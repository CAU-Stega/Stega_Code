not only is this movie a complete waste of time
further this is the only film i have ever seen in a while
of course he has a lot of money to be taken to a new level of work
you can tell that this movie is not a good movie
it is a very good film
he was a very good actor and was a great actor
tyrone power was a great actor and he 's not just a good actor but he is not the only one
he was n't a great actor and i did n't see him as much as he did
fly the streets and the movie 's story is a bit of a surprise but it 's worth watching for the acting
the movie is a complete waste of time and money
jared martin 's character is a caricature of the character of a young man
however i think that this movie should be seen by everyone who enjoys a good story and a good family
the movie was a waste of time but the acting was good the plot was good
the film is a very interesting and interesting account of the life of a woman in a small village in england during world war ii
once the film starts to drag the story begins steadily and ends abruptly
the acting is good but the story is n't that good and it 's not enough to carry the film
i was surprised to see that it was made in the early 80 's
the movie was a bit of an insult to the intelligence
at one point the film is set up to make a documentary
claude rains is a genius as the lead character and the supporting cast is very good
but i think that this film was made for a rainy day and i think that the actors are the best
it is the story of an old woman who is attracted to her
then the film switches to a very good and very very good movie
first of all this is a very poor film
the film is about a group of people who are trying to find a way to save a nuclear bomb
the movie is a little slow and boring but it has some nice twists and turns and the film has a good pace
similar to the original and the movie itself is a bit too slow
they are all so bad they 're good
similarly it was a good thing
but the story is n't that great
i was n't sure whether the director was intentional or not
make sure you do n't have to be a fan of this genre to enjoy it
at least the movie is n't so bad it 's funny
claudius is a man who has a heart attack that is n't even close to him
this movie has the worst acting ever
the acting is horrible the script is horrible and the direction is horrible
it is a very good film
fantastic film and i recommend the following of the series
at one point the movie is a little slow but that 's about it
its a good movie to watch
i was expecting the movie to be more about life but the characters are just so annoying
regardless of that the movie has a very good cast and a good cast and a good script and the acting was excellent
you 'll be glad you did
a very good film and a mustsee for fans of the genre
it 's a shame that the director and writer have n't made any effort at all
i think that the director was a bit prejudiced to the story and the film did n't make sense
but i was not surprised that it was n't
each of these films are a bit of fun
sometimes the film is a bit too much but there are some interesting moments and the acting is excellent
they were all very funny and the acting is great and it 's a great movie to watch for a few seconds
those who are not familiar with the story should see the film and enjoy this one
i was n't sure whether this was intentional but it was a little too slow for my tastes
then the story goes along and it becomes a very good movie
anne heche was the best actress in the movie but she did n't have much to work with
saw this film when it aired on tv
i do n't know if i can see it on tv but the fact that it was made by the uk is just a little too long
ramon is the best character in the film but his character is so stupid that it 's almost unbelievable
ultimately i do n't think that this movie is worth seeing as a comedy
this is a very good movie
but it was a little too long and i did n't think it was a complete waste of time and money
it is a great film and it is one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen
the film is a very good film and i would definitely recommend it to any fan of the genre
having said that the film is a bit long and the ending is a bit abrupt
in the first half of the movie the characters are introduced to a bunch of people who do not have to do anything to help them
secondly it 's not a movie that i would recommend
john cusak was great as the villain
not only does he do the right thing but he does n't want to go on a killing spree
but the movie is a little too much
every time i watch this movie i will say that i have to say i was n't disappointed
i was surprised to find that this film was made in 1995
the movie is a complete waste of time
i was n't really sure what to expect from this movie but the acting was n't bad and the script was so bad that you could n't even get to the characters
graham is the only one who has ever been in the movie and he 's just not funny
i was n't expecting much of this film
i was n't really surprised that this movie was made by a group of kids
the acting is horrible and the story is just plain bad
when the first film was made i saw it on the sundance channel in the uk
however the movie is a little bit slow moving but it is a great film that i can recommend
it is not a bad thing
he was a good actor and he had the ability to play the part of the villain
considering that this was a low budget production i was expecting a lot more from it but i did n't expect much from the movie and i was expecting a lot more
she was so cute that she was a little more than a little too young for the part
disjointed plot twists and bad acting
to be honest i do n't know what this movie is about
let me start with the good points
some of the acting is good
or the other side of the movie that makes it all the more enjoyable to watch
he 's a good guy who 's a little more than a normal person but his wife
take the time to read the book and you will see what the director is thinking when he 's done
make sure you 're in for a real treat
a very good and interesting film
this is a great movie for all ages
beavers 's character is the best one in the movie
solid performances by everyone who has ever been on a movie with such a bad script
valdez is a very talented actor who is a very talented actor
thanks to the fact that the film was made in the early 90 's the film has been released on video for several months
an old man who 's been a little more than just a normal man
the acting was horrible and the story was n't very interesting
the acting is pretty bad and the script was n't really a lot of fun
one of the most underrated films i have ever seen
tell me that the film was a complete waste of my time and money
they are both funny and funny
i have never heard of it before
in this movie it was a very nice movie to watch and it is one of the most underrated movies ever
i have to say that it is a good movie and one of the best films i have ever seen
inspired by the film 's end it 's a pretty good movie with a lot of fun and it is n't
it is a shame that the movie did not get released on video in theaters and it would n't be released theatrically
sandler 's character is not so much as a person in the book and he 's not a hero but he does n't have to do anything else
there is a reason why it is so bad it 's good
you know that you 're watching a movie with an open mind
the movie was made for a very low budget and i do n't know how to get a job of it
it was a great movie and i liked it very much
nonetheless i was impressed by the story
there are some good moments but the film has a lot of problems in it and the story is very weak
this is a film that is a real stinker
let me just say it 's a bad movie
peter o'toole is a fine actor but he 's not as good as the other two
fanny 's character is so stupid that she is so unlikable it 's almost impossible to believe that she is a character
little of the same applies for the film 's plot and characters
the film 's main weakness is the ending
definitely not for the faint hearted of those who are interested in the subject matter and those who have n't seen the film
well it was n't the best movie i 've seen
i have never seen the original version of this film but it 's still a good one
this film was a complete waste of time
john cusak was great as a man who was a little more of a challenge than a hero
instead it 's a pretty bad film with a very bad script
but the film is n't so bad it 's good
yeah it 's a little dated and it has a few good points but the movie is n't really a comedy or a comedy
it is the story of a man who has been a successful man in life and his life in life is in love with the young man
the film is a little too talky for a horror movie
remember that it was n't the first movie to be a success of the original but it was n't
that is a very good thing but the movie is not a comedy
a very good and entertaining story with excellent performances by all of the actors and a very good cast
madhuri dixit 's acting is very good
beth 's character and she 's just a tad of the same old guy who 's always in the movie for a few minutes
that 's the way it 's portrayed
the film is very slow moving and the ending was very disappointing
you 'll see it in a theater
it is a very simple movie
and it was not until the last few minutes that i had to watch the movie to see the whole thing
making this a great movie for the whole family
more importantly it 's a pity
the film is a very good film with a lot of great actors and a good story line
you 'll have to see it to understand what it 's like to have seen a movie with a little bit of blood and gore
all in all i think it 's worth a look
so the movie was a waste of time and money
i have seen a lot of bad movies
it 's a shame that the director of this movie has n't made a good movie since the beginning of the film
the movie starts out as a comedy with a lot of laughs and some funny moments but it is not
just like i said the first time i saw a tv movie i had to laugh at it
inspired in a very tight manner
i have seen a lot of movies and i 've never seen a movie where this one is so good but i think it 's a great movie
night of the comet beast is a film that will appeal to fans of the genre
it is the story of a young woman who is a woman and a woman who is in love with her
we are left with a sense of what the film is about and how to end it
this is not one of them
andrew is an excellent actor who is not only a great actor but he is a good man who has a good sense of humour and a good sense of humor
and that was the most obvious part in this film
cheap action flick and a lot of fun to watch
it is n't a bad film but it does
the acting is good and the story is very interesting and interesting to watch
here 's where the film is concerned
the film is a little bit slow but it is a good film and a good one to watch
many of them were just a little too long
a very enjoyable film and a mustsee for fans of the genre and fans
it 's a pity that it was released theatrically on dvd
that is what the director is thinking
one of my favourite movies of all time
remember the first one was a little too slow
instead of the usual hollywood clichs it 's a very funny film and a very funny one
instead we get to see the main character 's face
san francisco and the other two movies are a lot more interesting
however i think it 's a great film
every time i watch it it 's a joy to watch it
all in all it 's a very entertaining movie
i do n't know why but i do not think that a movie can be so much more than a movie
we are not told to care about what happened to the characters and what they did to the audience
i was so excited that i was watching this movie
the acting in this movie is horrible as is the script
you have to wonder why this movie was so good to me
most of the time the movie is a little slow but the acting is superb and the story is so real
the film has a very strong cast
let me just say that the acting was bad and the story was so bad that it could have been a little better
and that 's the only way i can think of a movie where the actors were so wooden and so annoying i was n't even sure what was going on
knotts is an actor in a movie
it is a great movie and a great film
in fact i would not have been able to sit through this movie
the film is very good but it 's not that bad it 's not
when i saw this movie i was very impressed
surely a movie with a good director and a decent budget is n't enough to make a good movie and i do n't think it deserves a second chance
do n't waste your time on this one
it is a shame because it 's so bad that it 's actually a shame because this was one of the best movies i have ever seen
the film is very well done
so what if it were n't so much more than a movie
weak acting and a plot line that is n't even worth the effort of the movie
you 'll see the same thing as the one that was the first to die and the second one is pretty much a continuation of the original
these are the kind of things i would n't want to know
i do n't think it 's the same
a lot of people who say that this movie is bad and i do n't understand why they would like to make this a movie
run away from home to the devil
variations of the film and it is very hard to believe that it is n't a movie
this is a very good movie and i recommend it to anyone who likes good movies
unfortunately i did n't have a chance to watch this film
they were so bad i wanted to see this
these two are not the same
i have to say i am a fan of the original series but i have to say i did n't enjoy it too much
yes it is a bit of a comedy but it 's just plain dull
the film is about two people who have a lot of fun to work together
they are not even close to the truth they are all in the same place
however it is a good film to watch with a few friends who have n't seen it
that 's why i think this is a good film
each character is a stereotype of their own
from the very beginning we see the two young men who are trying to escape from a mental institution in a small town in the middle of nowhere and the two men who live together in their own house are stalked by a mysterious maniac and a woman who is determined to be a little too infatuated with her
the film has a very good cast including the likes of dennis hopper and the late john wayne
the story of a young man named krishna who has a son who was a very good man
when i saw this i was very excited to see that this movie was not available on dvd
sorry to say this but i was so bored
but the film 's main flaw is that the film is not as good as the original
he was n't a good actor
although it is a bit slow moving and the story is very predictable i think it 's a very good film
i was n't impressed by the fact that i saw the movie in a theater and was surprised by it
i was so excited to see this show on tv
or maybe it was because the movie was so bad
and the ending of the movie is just as funny as the rest of the movie
the movie has a very nice soundtrack and a good soundtrack but that is not the case
given the choice of the film it was a very good film
the acting was n't bad but it was not the worst
well i guess that was the case
checkout the story is a little weak
overall it 's a pretty good movie
so if you are looking for a fun movie that will appeal to you and you do n't want to see the ending of the movie i suggest you watch this film for the good
people have to be the worst movie i have ever seen
when i first saw it i was in a class of the theatre
the film has a great deal of suspense and a lot of suspense
sex is a bit of a stretch to watch but it has a few funny scenes
jeff fahey and john cleese are the best parts of this film
i have seen this movie several times and i have to say it is a great movie
apparently it was a good idea to show a lot of things that were n't really funny but they were n't
in fact this is the best movie ever made
i was n't expecting much from the movie but the movie was n't bad
film makers have a very small budget that has the same name and a few actors
once again the film is a little too long for me
quite possibly the worst movie i 've ever seen
terrific acting and a great script
but the film is n't so bad it 's good
the film was very good and the acting was superb
i do not know how to describe this film but it 's a very good and enjoyable movie
it 's a shame that the movie is n't as bad as it is but it does n't
you have to see this movie to find out if you 're in for a good laugh or if you are a diehard collector of the genre
in the meantime it 's a little too long
author john woo 's first film and he has a very good idea of the supernatural and his work of art
i was so disappointed that i was n't watching it
the movie is a little bit boring
if you have not seen the movie yet you 'll be able to see it for yourself
i have to say i am very impressed by the acting
the film was shot in color and it is a beautiful and very beautiful look at the life that exists
to me this movie is not even worth seeing
it 's not a bad movie
my friend and i rented this movie and we have a few scenes that are funny and i think that 's a great idea
and the acting was so bad that it was almost painful to watch
the acting is good but the script is so awful it 's unbelievable it 's just plain bad
the movie has some nice moments but i found it boring and boring
the film is a very good film and a good film to watch
the film is a little too long
yet it is not a bad movie and it does n't even have a good story line
that is what i think is that the movie was a joke
this film is so bad i could not even finish it anymore
now i know it 's not a good film but i think it is the best of the lot
i do n't know why i did n't get to see this film
el charro 's story is very interesting but the film is not a good one either
do yourself a favor and rent a movie
greg araki has done a good job in this film but it is not a good movie either
one day the two meet up with two friends who have a very difficult time
it 's a pity because the plot is so weak that it becomes a bit of a bore
while i was n't expecting a lot of the movie to have been a bit of a comedy it was a bit of a bore
this is a very funny film
even when i saw the preview for this movie i had a headache
i was expecting a movie about a bunch of people who were killed and killed and tortured by the ghosts who killed them
they were n't funny and were n't funny
i was expecting a lot more from this film but i did not have to watch it again
mckenna is the best of the bunch
this is a great show and i think it 's a great movie to watch
the movie is not as bad as the first
they were n't funny and i did n't even care for them
he is a good actor and he 's not the best actor
like a lot of other films i have seen this one is the best
we have a very good story about a man who is a man and a man in a world
i was surprised that the director was able to create the same movie as the first movie
i was expecting a good story but this movie is not a bad film
what 's with all the white people
a good film that i would recommend to anyone interested in history or not
he 's not the best actor but he 's a good actor
tomas sen sharma is a great actress and is also very good in this
a very interesting story with great acting
the acting is horrible the plot is stupid the characters are boring and the plot just is n't there
overall this film is n't bad but it 's not a great movie
now i know that the movie was shot on a low budget but the acting is so bad that it makes you wonder what kind of film it was
i was n't really sure why the film was so good
my favorite part of the movie is that the movie is a little too long for a movie to be a comedy
needless to say it was a great film
the film is about the power of war and the impact of a war that is not so much
so the plot is simple the acting is n't bad but the script is so bad that it is hard to believe it is a comedy or a comedy
oh yeah i know that 's the way i should have known i 'd seen this movie
'the unguarded world' is an excellent film
after the first hour of the movie i was really surprised that the film was n't even nominated for a academy award
i have n't been in the military for years
a few minutes later the film is set in a very dark setting that is set in the same time as the film itself
i have n't seen this movie in years
but the film is so much better and the acting is so good and the performances by the actors that you feel like you are watching the movie and it 's a good film for a laugh
that 's the only way i could have done a film like this
all the characters are believable and the story line is very good
i think that 's why i liked this movie so much and so many people who have n't already watched it
but i have to admit that i did n't like it
today i was a little disappointed by this film but the film was so good
billy connolly is a great actor and he is great as always
if you are a fan of the genre this is a must see
peter falk is the only actor who can save this movie
only one of those movies that i saw was so bad that it 's almost impossible to watch it
if you are into the genre and are looking for a movie to watch and you 're a great fan of this genre i recommend it
crumb was one of my favorites
for me the best thing about this movie is how it is done
moreover the plot is a little confusing
particularly if you are looking for a movie to watch
from the opening credits the movie has a lot of action
donald sutherland plays the lead character who 's a good guy who is a bit of a jerk but is a good actor
cnn has been released and is a great film
but the story is n't that bad
while the movie is a bit dated it 's not a great movie
written by the director of the book and the book
you can get a kick out of the cast and crew
a very good story about a man and his wife in love
we get the impression that the director is not trying to make a good film but the director is n't able to make a good movie
for a movie made in 1979 i would like to say that i am very fond of the genre but i think that the director was a genius and i do n't know what to say about this film
most of the film takes place in the present day in the middle of nowhere
furthermore the film does n't seem to have any of the same elements of the previous films
beverly d'angelo was great as a woman who was a little too young
it 's not the best of the bunch and it certainly has some similarities
i was expecting something more like a film of the week
do n't worry on this movie it 's a waste of time
this is one of the best movies i 've seen in my life
i do n't know why the movie is so bad
i think that the director was trying to make a good movie but this one is just awful
the film has a lot going for it but it does n't really work
plus the film was a bit too slow and too slow for the audience
her character 's motivations and motivations are all very believable and believable
as a result it 's a little slow but that 's all
but the story is not that great
but i was n't expecting a lot of the film
okay so the plot is a little thin and predictable and the acting is pretty bad but the story is so good that the movie is so bad it becomes boring
please do n't waste your money on this movie
with a cast of unknowns and a script that could have used a lot of the same actors to have it all this is a great movie
if you 're a fan of the genre you should be warned that the film does not have the same appeal as in other films
what a great cast and great timing
why do n't we just get a few good laughs in the first half
they are all very good actors
the film has a very good cast and a good cast
as for the rest of the film it 's just a little bit of an insult to the viewer
moreover i think it 's the worst film of the year
it is n't even worth the time of the film to be made
i have seen this film several times in my life
but the movie is not about the same as the other movies that were made in the late 80 's
we are shown to be a little more than a little of a joke
after the death of his mother and his mother he becomes convinced that he is the killer of his daughter
this is a very funny film
i think the movie was a good idea to show it
i was n't impressed by the story
his character is so unlikable and the acting is horrible
maintenance of a serial killer is a film that has been made to entertain and be the only one who can enjoy it
they are not the only ones who have the ability to be a good person
characters that were so stupid that you could barely care less
the acting in this movie is horrible
we are supposed to sympathize with the character 's motivations and his motivations and the way he develops his feelings of life and his family life in his life
the film has a lot of action and it is a bit slow but it really is n't
mysterious is one of the worst horror movies ever made in fact i have seen worse
terry gilliam is the best in the movie
yes it is not a good movie
this film is a very funny one
there are many things that i have seen in this movie i do n't like and that is a shame because the movie is so funny that i ca n't help but laugh
you have to wonder why this film was made in the first place
yet the film has a very interesting feel to it that makes it worthwhile
a few of the scenes in the movie were very good
the film has no real plot and is n't a good movie
the film 's premise is the main problem of the film and its lack of any redeeming qualities
the film has a very nice atmosphere and the film is a perfect example of how a movie can be achieved
it was a very nice movie to watch and i was very impressed
the film is about two men who go to a small town to find their jobs
there are many other movies that have been made in the last ten years
the acting is pretty good but the script was n't very good
i do n't know what this film is trying to accomplish but i think it is the best of the lot
although the movie was a little bit too predictable for me it is still a great film
then there 's the fact that it 's not as funny as the original but it 's not a bad movie
a lot of the movie was shot in the middle of nowhere and i was n't impressed
it 's the same thing that made the movie a little more palatable and a bit too dark
as a result of his work he was able to get the best actor award
the film 's plot is a little convoluted and predictable and there 's a few twists and turns
we are not told why we have to be careful and not to mention a few things that make it so great
had he ever had the opportunity to show the real world that was his first film
overall the film is not a great movie
it 's not a great movie but it 's not a good film
the movie is not as funny as the first but it is a great movie
water was a good idea to make this film a success
yet the movie is not about the characters or the plot it 's a story about a man 's life
this is one of those films that has a few good laughs and a few laughs
the movie is about a man who has a heart attack
the film is a very moving experience
one of the best movies i 've ever seen
ditto as a film about the life of a man in an apartment complex and a man who is n't a good guy and an actor he does n't have to be the one
i have seen the movie several times
what i got was a great movie about a group of people who are trying to make a living in a small town
but it is n't a bad film
two years later he is a young man
today i would like to see a film that is more entertaining than the first one
furthermore the film is a bit too long and it is n't a movie that is not a comedy
if you want to see a movie that is so funny i would have to say that i did n't have a problem with this movie
this film is a must see for any fan of the classic
i was n't expecting a good movie
batman is a master of evil and the beast is an extremely creepy and creepy creature
the acting is horrible the script is awful the acting is awful the directing is bad the special effects are bad and the special effects are horrible
the film is not about the war or war but it 's about a young girl who is in a mental state
yes it is not that bad
of course it 's a bit of an injustice to a film that has been done so well
at one point the camera pans out and the camera shakes the camera
it 's the only movie that has ever been produced by a child
this is a very good movie
they are both funny and funny
that 's the best way to describe this movie
as for it 's a great film it is a good movie
can you believe that this is a very bad film
it was a great movie and it had some funny moments
for those who like the genre the film is not for you
nothing is ever done with a film like this
considine is one of the finest comedians ever to grace a film
how can a movie be such a great film that is so much more
why do i think the film has a very similar story
well i do not know why i did n't like it
john goodman is a great actor
wonder if this was a good idea to make a movie about a man who has no idea of the world
he 's not a bad man
luckily the film has a lot of potential for the characters and the acting is pretty good
so i do n't think that the director should be ashamed of himself
kim basinger plays the mother who is a little too busy to be the only one who is able to cope with her
two men are sent to a remote island where the town has been evacuated
this movie has no real story line to speak
it 's not a bad film
its not even a bad movie
this movie is so bad that it 's funny
such a movie is the perfect example of how to make a film
i do n't think it would be a good idea to show it to the public
you know it 's a spoof of a film that 's not a good one but it does
if i had to watch it i would have to say i was n't impressed with the movie
instead of being a good movie i was surprised that the film was made and released in the states of the united states
youssef ozon has a good eye for this
in the end i was a big fan of his movies
from the very beginning the movie is just a collection of random and boring characters
emma thompson is excellent and the rest of the cast is excellent
howard is the only one who can get a grip on his life
he is the best actor of all time
again the plot was n't that good
if it was n't for the great actors and the director i would n't have been able to watch this movie
there is a lot of action in this film
nobody is a good person and i do n't know what the hell is going on but it 's a very good movie that you will enjoy
hook is a very good movie with some good acting
the acting was good but the script was n't as good as it could have been
i do n't know how to explain the plot and it is n't the same
happily the film was shot on location in the same location and was shot on location in the same location
he 's a very good actor and he 's not a good actor but he is a great actor
a lot of the scenes were shot on location in the background and it is not long before the camera zooms into the background
the movie is a very interesting and entertaining movie about a group of young adults who go on vacation
this film is a must see for anyone who likes to laugh
as a matter of fact i have a feeling that the film has been done so well that you can only see it in a theater and it 's a shame that it has n't been available on video or dvd
the acting in general is excellent
angry and confused is the way the film is made
with the exception of that it 's a pretty good film and it is n't even a comedy
david cronenberg 's the thing of the same is his work and the movie has a very good story
but it 's not as much fun and the acting is so bad that the film is so bad that it is hard to believe that the director andor writer had a clue to the film 's existence
the film is a bit too slow and the story is a little weak
gabe 's father and father are the only one who seems to be able to get the money
but i do n't think it 's a matter of taste
cast are the nicest characters in the movie and the story line is great
even if the film is n't as good as the original it 's not a bad one
none of the actors were convincing
sub par is the first movie i have ever seen in a long long time
i do n't think i 've ever seen a movie that was so bad
despite being a fan of the original i was expecting something like this to be the first movie i have watched
the film is not about a young woman named seita who is married to a man who has been living in a house and a mother and a child
the movie has a lot more action than the typical columbo movie and is a good example of the sort of movie that you can expect from a low budget movie
when the film is finally finished there is no sense of mystery or tension in the film but it is not as much as the first
the movie is about a group of people who have been living together and have been living in a small town and are forced to spend their time together
not that it 's a bad movie but it 's still not a good movie to watch
i'm not a fan of either of these actors or the actors who are so bad they are good but they just did n't make it to the screen
whenever the film was released it is a movie that has been released on dvd and vhs
ps i was n't expecting much from the film
i have n't seen it since i first saw this movie
people who do n't like it do not know what it is
but it 's not that good
the acting was n't bad but the script and direction were awful
cat 's revenge is the best of the series
he is a great actor and a great actor
anyway this was one of the most boring and pointless i have ever seen
i'm a sucker for a good movie
not a good movie to be seen and not worth watching
this is a film that is so much better
forced me to say that this is the best of the three
when i was a little kid i was really looking for it to be made and the acting was good
some of the scenes are just so funny
creasy is a great character actor who is not only the most likable person he 's been but also the man who is in his element and his own
just do n't expect to see it
jim carrey is a fine actor and the movie is very good
what is the deal with the film
the film has no real connection to the original
so the film has a very interesting plot
in this case i have no idea how the film is about the holocaust of the holocaust
every time i see this show i was hooked
the acting is horrible and the script is just awful
they are the only ones who have a shred of respect and are not able to make them all
it 's a shame that such a great film could not have been produced by a director
throw in a bunch of obnoxious teens with their own and they are all pretty good and the rest is just plain awful
the movie is very funny and it 's a shame because the film is a bit too slow for a long time but i do n't want to spoil it
it is a very simple story
viva is the only thing that i can say is that it was a good movie and the acting was good
at least the film is not so good
ted is an interesting and interesting character who has a lot to be desired
the film 's premise is the same as the first movie
i have n't seen the original but it was a very good movie to watch
powell 's character is a bit dim and the story is a bit weak
this film is a very bad film and it 's not even worth the time
the film is very good in its own right
first of all the movie is not a comedy it is a very good film
the movie is a very interesting film about the lives of two people in the same way
if i was to give it a zero rating i 'd give the film a 1 out of 10 i give it a 2
i do n't know how this got a theatrical release but it was a great movie
but it 's not as good as the first movie which was a little too good for a horror film
luke goss is a great actor
this movie was not even funny
but the film is a complete bore
it is a shame that it was not available on dvd
his character is a little too cocky and he is too unlikable to be believable but it 's a bit of an annoyance to his character
it 's not a good film
the film is a complete failure and the acting is horrible and the plot is so bad that i could n't care less
there is no real story here
and the acting is so good
oh and it 's a shame it is n't
they are all very good actors
first the acting is terrible the story is awful the acting is bad
clubbed and beaten and the rest of the movie is just a collection of bad jokes
whenever the first movie is released i was excited that it was n't
this is a great example of how a film can work without a single redeeming quality
however i do n't know why the movie was made so badly
these were not the ones i saw in my childhood
the story is about a man who is trying to find a cure for his life
it 's a pity that it 's not available on dvd
the acting was good the story was interesting and it was n't the best movie ever
liked the movie and it was the first of the three films that i 've watched
the movie is about a young girl who is a teenager
with a supposed budget of about the budget and a quarter of the budget it is still very low budget but that does n't mean you ca n't get past the fact that it 's a low budget production
the film has a very nice cast and the acting is great
but i was n't expecting much from it
this is the best film of all time
this is not an action movie it 's a thriller
although it 's supposed to be a comedy that has a lot of funny situations it is a very good movie and a good laugh at the same time
you have n't heard of this movie until you 're a kid
but the movie is a little bit too much
it was n't that good either i was n't expecting much but i did n't think it was a good movie and it was just plain bad
we are not told to care about the characters but the way the characters are portrayed is so much better than that
oh and the ending is a complete mess
my favorite parts of the movie are when the two are trying to escape the car
did they get the money and the money
i was expecting a good story to be told that it is not a good movie and it 's just plain awful
sean penn plays his usual charming and likable character
and i was n't impressed by the film 's lack of originality
and the movie does n't have the same charm that it 's made in the past
the film is a complete mess of an hour and a half of your life
some of the other actors have been very good and the movie was a good one
the film 's main character is a young woman who is a little more than a little too old for the role
the movie is a bit of an exercise in the way the story unfolds
this movie is a great example of how not to make a movie
in fact it is a great movie
in fact it is not the greatest film ever made
rather than the usual suspects of the late 1800s the film is about a group of people who have to deal with their problems with each other
now the film was n't a complete waste of time and money
i do n't think that this movie is the worst of it 's kind of a bad one
it was a very good movie
unless you 're not into the subject matter and you are looking for a movie that is a little too serious and a bit of a mess this one is for you
at least the film is a bit slow but i think it 's a very good movie
gloria grahame is a great actress
this is a very good movie
the acting is good and the story is a little too thin
it is a very good movie
but the film 's biggest flaw are the characters
a very interesting and enjoyable film
the film is a complete waste of time and a waste of your time
the film is a bit slow and slow but it does n't make sense at all
i have to say i was very pleased
for the rest of us i 'd recommend you to watch this movie
it 's just a little more than a movie
then the film switches into a series of flashbacks that are not only hinted at the audience
too bad they do n't make a sequel
it is a very funny movie
that is what i think it is a very good movie
for a movie that is supposed to be about a man who is a woman he 's a man who has a heart attack
in this case it 's not a good movie
most of it was made in the early 80 's
alan rickman as a doctor is a good actor
a few scenes of dialogue that are so funny are just so bad
there is no real story to be found in this film
and the film is not about the war or the history and the history of the human condition
so what i got was a movie that was so bad that i actually had to turn it off
i have to say that i 've seen this movie twice and i can honestly say it 's not that good but it is not bad
in fact it has a lot of action
then i saw the movie on the dvd cover and i thought i had to watch it
teens do n't get a chance to do this
so if the film was a complete bore it would have been a lot better
a lot of people have commented on this movie but it is a movie that i would watch over and over again
to say it 's the only good part of it is the understatement
so i was looking forward to this movie
as a movie it 's not a bad idea
this film is a must see for all lovers of film noir
the movie is not as good as the first but it 's a good movie to watch
you 'll be surprised that you will not see this movie
from the very beginning we see the whole family struggle to survive
after seeing the movie i had to say i had to see this movie
how many times have i seen this
i do n't know what to say about this film
he is the best of the bunch and he is a good actor
what a wonderful film and a wonderful film that is
also the film is a little bit too short
ok so it was n't that funny
the movie is a very good film with some good action and a lot of action
taskin and the beanstalk are a couple of years later
surprised me that this movie was n't made by the same director as the other
a very interesting and interesting story of a young girl 's life
lugosi 's character is a bit of a jerk who is not the least likable character in the movie
anyways this movie is a complete waste of time
jack nicholson 's character is a little too unlikable
by the way i do n't know why the film has been made
but it 's not that bad
it 's not even worth the wait
for the first half of the film the film is a complete mess
in a way it is not a good movie
the film has a great cast and a great cast
two of the best films ever made the film is a very good movie
animation is a bit of a downer
for a long time he has been in his late thirties
if you 're looking for a good film with a good plot and great acting you 'll enjoy this one
the film is a very interesting one
but the film does n't really have a chance to be a classic movie it 's just a bunch of people who do n't know what it is
think of it as a film about a man and his relationship with one man and another woman
i was surprised to see that the film was released in the uk in a small town
i have seen this movie several times and i can still feel my heart pounding pain
not to mention that it 's the only movie that i 've ever seen in a while
or maybe it was the script that would have been a lot more interesting
story line is about a group of people who have been married to a man who is a struggling woman who has been living on the streets for the past 15 years
the movie is a bit of a bore but it is still a fun movie
i was expecting something more of a film
it 's a pity that the movie did n't have a lot of nudity but the movie is n't
davis 's performance in the film is also very well done and is very effective
in fact it 's a bit too long for a movie to be a little slow
but the movie is a complete waste of time
the film is a bit slow but it does n't really matter
so if i were to make a sequel i 'd have to be a little more interested in the story
it 's a pity because this film has a great story line
i have to admit i did like the movie
i think this movie was a great success for the eyes of a man who has a good heart and a sense of humor
one of the best things about the film is the music
quincy jones was a very good actor but the rest of the cast was n't bad
the story is simple and the acting is good but the script is so weak that you cannot help it
bridges is one of the best actors ever in this movie
do n't worry about this one
set in an abandoned building in the middle of nowhere this film is an exercise in the art and beauty of the film 's story
myers is a great actor and the supporting actor is very good
the film has a very good cast and is very well done
of course the movie is a bit too slow and boring but that 's about the only positive thing i can say about this movie
i do n't know how to get this movie out of my mind and i hope it gets a wider release
it was the first of the many films i saw and i have seen the original one
if you have not read the book you 'll know that the movie is a complete mess of a movie
the film is a little bit of a mess and it is not a good movie
part of the reason i was able to sit through this movie was that it was n't a bad movie it was just plain bad
but this is not a film for you
despite this the movie is a complete mess
everything about it was so bad
she 's not a bad actress
the film was made in color and the music was very nice
a few years later he 's been beaten up by his mother and he has been forced to spend the rest of the movie spying on the children and the son of the family
it is a movie of the kind of people who can be so stupid and to be scared
do n't get me wrong i love movies that make a good deal of sense but i think they should have been more successful and this one is a great one
chiba is the perfect actor to play in this movie
my advice is to avoid the movie at all costs and if you are looking for a good movie to watch with a group of friends in the middle east and you are going to be a fan of the book then you should check out the original movie
its a shame that this movie has been released theatrically in the us
the film was shot in a time in time in the early seventies and the director was obviously influenced by the fact that there were no other actors in the film
as for the film itself it 's a little slow but it 's not a good idea to begin with the acting is n't bad and there is n't enough of that
this is one of the most boring movies i 've ever seen in my life
i have to say the film was very funny and the acting is great
the acting is very poor and the story line is so bad that i could n't even begin to understand why it 's not going to be released
the film is a complete mess
cary grant was in this film as a young man and his wife was a very nice guy
i have seen the movie several times and i have to say that this movie is a must see for all fans of a classic
it is a very funny movie and the actors who play the lead character
this is not a movie to make for a good laugh
i have seen this film several times and it 's one of them
as a result of the fact that the story is about a young woman who is married to her father she is a bit of a tomboy
the movie is very good and i recommend it to anyone who has n't seen it
the film is not as bad as it sounds
this movie was so bad that i actually felt like i was watching a movie with a bunch of friends
the movie has the same plot as the first one
how could you not see a movie like this one in the first place
after the first hour i thought i was in for a treat
but it is n't that bad it is n't
and it 's a shame that this is not available on dvd
and the ending is a bit too abrupt
some people are not interested in the movie
he 's a great character and is the perfect choice for the role he plays and his performance in this movie
after seeing the trailer i thought i would be surprised by the fact that the movie is about the killer snowman
there is also a lot more of the same as the original
it 's a very good movie with great actors
and the acting was so bad that it was n't good enough to be a bad movie
if it were n't for that it was a pretty good movie
and the ending of the movie is a complete mess of a movie
i was n't expecting the usual suspects that i had seen in a while but i did n't know what to expect
i do n't know why i did n't get the movie but it 's still worth it
another thing is this one was a bit of a letdown but it 's not
i was n't sure what to expect
again i have to admit i did not like this movie
second the movie is a complete mess of mine
the movie is not as funny or funny as the other two but that 's about it
however the movie is not as good as the book
apparently this is n't one of those movies where the actors are n't really good
i think the movie was made for the sole purpose of being the best of the four films but that 's not enough to make you laugh
and the movie is not as bad as the others
and the ending is a little unsatisfying
as for the film it 's a bit too dark and too slow for a film
there was a lot of potential in this film
instead of a movie that is supposed to be a parody of the genre this movie is a complete mess
the movie is a complete failure
after seeing the film i was impressed by how many people i have talked on
a very good film with a good cast
before the end the film has become a bit of a bore
i have to admit that i have never been a fan of the genre but i still have the feeling that the film was a good idea for a horror flick
this movie has a lot of action and some really cool moments
and the movie is not a good movie
the movie starts off as a comedy and is n't just a comedy
two of the characters are a bunch of friends and their friends are a bunch of people who have a lot to do with each other
just as the film is so bad it is good
king 's mother is an excellent character
speaking of a story about a man who is a little more interesting than his character he has a very strong character
as a matter of fact i was very surprised by the fact that the film was so boring and the ending was a total copout
even the actors were so stupid
but the movie is a complete bore and i ca n't even remember it
then i realized that this was a very good movie
if the movie had been made in the us and early on the story would have been a little better
warren beatty is a great actor and i do admire the fact that the movie was made for the first time in the series
amount of blood and guts and a lot
the film was a complete waste of time
in fact the whole movie was so poorly done i could n't care less about the character
4 the plot was very weak and the acting was horrible
there 's a lot of nudity and nudity
do n't be surprised by the lack of the plot and the acting
now i do not want to spoil the movie for you
the acting is good and the story line is very believable but the story is not really that interesting
all in all this is a great movie and i highly recommend it
the acting was good the plot was interesting and i was very surprised to find that there was a scene in which the two divers were talking to their friends
robot jox is a movie about a man who has a heart attack
its a great show and i hope that it will get better and better it 's still a lot better
a very interesting and interesting film
this movie does n't even deserve to be seen as an example of how to make a movie
diverting to the director 's intelligence
the film has a very good story and is a great film for those who love movies that are not afraid to be good or bad
of course the story is about the conflict between the two men who are married
it is a very good movie
i do n't think it is possible to make such a film because it is not the first film to make the viewer laugh
his character is a little bit too cocky
when the film is over and over and over again it is a very funny movie
no matter what it is you 'll be able to see it in a theater
so i was surprised to see that this movie has a very good cast
in the first film we are treated to a rather dull climax
there is a lot going on here and there is a lot of action in this movie
ashley silverman is a good actress but the rest of the movie is just bad
this was the first film in which the director was obviously trying to make a movie out of a book
unfortunately the film is n't a complete disaster
with the exception of the director the film is a complete waste of time
the story is about a man trying to find a cure to his family and his family
the movie has a great cast and it is not a very good film
i do agree that the movie is a bit too long
there are a few good moments but the rest of the film is a complete mess
while i do have a lot of respect for the actors and actresses i have to say that i am not a fan of the genre but the acting and direction are very good
it 's not that the movie is bad it 's not bad it just does n't seem like they were going to have the right idea of the actors and the script is so awful it is almost comical
my friend and i rented this movie because of the glowing comments on imdb about the film and the fact that it was a complete waste of time
in a nutshell this movie was so bad
of course the only thing that is good about the movie is the music and the soundtrack
the movie is a bit slow but it is not a good film
having read the book i have to say i was a little disappointed
and the movie is a complete waste of time
ok it 's a movie that i would n't want to watch again
the film 's premise is that of a woman 's life
for a long long time i had a headache and i was n't sure what to expect
all the while the story was very predictable
i was surprised by the way the film was filmed
this movie is a complete waste of time and money
sam waterston is excellent as the villain
so if you 're looking for something that does n't look good then it is not for you
i do n't know what to say about this film
so the story is not that good
the story is simple and the story is so predictable
if you have n't seen the movie yet i would recommend it to the director and the cast
even the actors in the movie are n't very good
editor michael moore is the perfect director for the role of a man who 's always been a man
or is it just me or did n't
now i know i have seen a lot of movies and this one was n't bad but it is n't
although the film is a bit slow at times it 's still a good thriller
only to be honest it is a very good movie that will not be forgotten by anyone who has n't seen the original or the original
beachum 's performance is also excellent and he is very convincing as the villain
upon arrival in the woods the two of them get married to a woman and she 's taken prisoner
the movie has a very nice feel to it that is n't overdone but the movie is a complete bore
they are the ones who do n't know how to make movies
a few minutes ago the movie has been cut and the acting is n't that bad but it 's just bad
no one has ever heard of the movie but it is a very enjoyable film
this is a very good movie
can you say the same for the first time
one day a young woman named angela is murdered by the devil 's daughter
these two characters are so different from the other actors that you could n't care less what happens in their lives
it 's not a bad movie
but it 's just a fun movie to watch and you 'll be disappointed
if you have n't seen it you should n't be disappointed
fans of the original will find it difficult to suspend disbelief for the characters
why did n't the director have a hand
i do n't think that it is a good movie
as a movie i have to admit that i am a big fan of the original series
speaking of the plot the acting is pretty bad the script is awful
mr blandings is a great actor
gary oldman was a good choice for the movie
i was n't expecting a lot from this movie and it did not seem to be too much of an excuse for a movie that was made
after the first hour or so of the film i had to stop wondering how many of them were going to make this film to the next blockbuster
for those of you that do n't know how it is going to be
well this is one of those movies that is not so bad it 's good
shia labeouf is a good actor
kudos to the director and cast
as the film goes on we have to see a lot of things happening in the past and the film is a bit over the top
this is a movie that i think it should not be
i do n't think i 've ever seen such an awful movie
the movie is a little bit of a spoof
bingo is an amazing and very entertaining movie
no one is going to be able to make this film a good film
i was expecting the usual action movie but the acting and the direction was terrible
the film is about the same as the one in the book
i'm not a big fan of the genre but this is one of the best
the movie is very well acted and well acted
this movie has the potential to make you think and it 's a very good movie
but the story is not so much as it is about the characters
william shatner is a revelation in the film as he plays the role of a young woman who is a bit over the top
from the beginning to the end you 'll be left wondering if the writer was trying to make a movie that was so funny
it is a very good movie
this is the worst movie i have seen in my life
there 's a lot of action and some action sequences
in a way it was a good movie
it 's just a bunch of people talking about the worst thing about this film
best of all it 's not a good movie
i think it was the best of the two films
also it is a very good show
angels are not as bad as they are in fact
the movie has a great deal of suspense and the acting is great but it 's just not enough
however the plot is so bad it 's almost unbelievable
imagine a movie that is so bad it 's good
as a matter of fact it was not the worst film i 've ever seen and it 's a pity because the plot is n't too bad
at least that 's what i was hoping for
if the film was a bit of a comedy the acting was n't as bad as the first one
burton is a master of his own
mike myers is a great actor who is n't a good actor but he does n't seem to be able to pull a lot of his character
the movie starts with a very long shot of two people driving a road trip through a forest
the movie is about a group of people who have a very small party in a small town where they are a bunch of friends who have been living
the film is very well directed
our heroine has the same hair that is so much of the same
the movie has a lot of action and a lot of action and some good acting
that 's what the movie was about
i have seen a lot of bad movies in my time but this one is so bad that it 's actually hard to believe that this movie was actually filmed at a time when it was n't
the acting is very good and the story is very good
there is no real reason for that
why did they make such movies
nevertheless it 's a pretty good film
duggan 's character was so annoying and stupid that i was n't even laughing at him in the movie
when i watched the movie and the first movie i thought it was a good movie
the movie is a very good one
the film is a bit of a mess but it 's a good movie and a good movie
fortunately it 's not the worst movie i 've ever seen
in a way i was n't disappointed
i do n't think that this movie was ever made and that it is not the worst film ever made
however i was impressed by this film
whatever it was it would be a good idea to make a film about the life of a young man who is a very rich man who has been abused by her husband and her son
i have seen this film several times and i can tell you it has some great moments and some of the most beautiful scenes of the film
his character is so unlikable that it becomes impossible to believe him
after the first hour of the movie i was n't sure whether the director was asleep or not but i guess that 's what it is
i do n't know why i did n't watch a movie with a few mates in the theater
suzy parker is a very talented actress but she is n't as convincing as she was in the original movie and the rest of the cast was just terrible and that is n't enough to save the movie from being so awful
aside from the fact that it was a long time ago i was looking forward to seeing this movie in the theater
and i do n't think it was a coincidence
i do n't know what to say
all of the characters are all good the story is a bit of a mess but there is enough twists to keep the story together
well the first time i saw this movie was the first time i saw it i thought it was going to be a great movie
and it does n't work for me
the movie is a complete failure
would you have to be in the mood to watch this movie
if you have seen the original series you 'll know that the film is not going to win a emmy but it is still a great film
spoiler ahead i was n't really sure what it was
the movie is a bit of an action movie but it does n't make much sense
i do n't think i 've ever seen a worse film than this
out of the blue and the black rain the film is not only a visual feast but it 's a very very moving movie with great music by the late prolific composer damian goldsmith
this is one of the worst movies ever made
the movie was shot on a low budget but the acting was so bad it made me laugh
killer is the best thing in the movie
i was n't expecting a lot of it but it was a bit slow
the film is a bit too long for me but it 's not a movie that i would recommend to anyone who likes to watch a movie that is a waste of time
this is not the type of movie that i would recommend
incidentally this is the first time that i saw the film in my childhood and i was impressed with the acting and the story
the film is a complete waste of time
occasional spoilers ahead of the movie is that the movie is a bit of a mess and the ending is a bit too abrupt
otherwise i would n't recommend this movie
at least the movie is a little more entertaining than it is
overall this movie is a must for all fans of horror movies
this is one of the best comedies i have ever seen
sirk has a great sense of humor but he does n't even try to make a good film
presumably the director of this piece of crap has no idea of the plot
i do n't think that it is a good movie
have you ever heard of a movie like this
the film is not as polished as the book
i do n't know how many times i 've seen this film but i do n't know what it is supposed to be
angering a few seconds and a half or so
beyond the script and the plot is the acting is n't that good and the story is not that bad either
we get a glimpse of the characters in the movie and the story is very simple
most of the actors were n't very good and the story was pretty bad
the movie is a bit slow but it 's not the worst movie i have ever seen
this movie is so bad that it 's funny
keira knightley is a wonderful actress
in the end it is a very enjoyable movie
not only does it look like it 's a home movie but it is a very good film with a great cast
i have to say this movie is one of the best i have ever seen and i 've seen many many other bad movies
the acting is pretty good but the script and direction of this movie are just plain terrible
there is no real plot to speak of
those who do n't like this movie should be banned in the world and the movie
that 's the way the director should have known it was
dear the movie was a bit of a disappointment
but it 's not the same
after seeing the movie i had to say that it 's one of the best movies ever made
mind you it is a film that you will never forget
although the film is n't as much fun as a lot of the other movies it has the same plot and characters
had i been a fan of the show i would have had a good time watching this movie
little britain is a good film and it 's a great film to watch
but the movie is a good example of how to do a movie
like the rest of the movie it 's not a bad movie either
i do n't think i 've ever seen such a bad movie and i ca n't even remember that
gwyneth paltrow is a good actress and the supporting cast is great
the movie is a bit slow but it does n't have the impact of the book and the characters are so annoying that you ca n't help but feel the need to know more about them because they do n't have the ability to make it interesting
you know that this film is a spoof of a film that is n't a good one
save yourself a time avoid this one
unfortunately it was a bit too long and it 's too bad that it was not made for the screen
the acting was horrible the plot was ridiculous the characters were boring the plot was stupid and it was just stupid
the acting in this movie was very good
i was n't expecting anything much more than a typical hollywood film and i would n't have been surprised that it was a movie
the film is a complete failure and it does n't have any redeeming qualities
i do not think that the film is really bad
joey has a great sense of humour and he is very funny
then i realized that the movie was n't bad
beyond the fact that the film has a very good plot the movie is just a little bit too long for me
i was n't really expecting a movie to be a bad movie but i was n't disappointed
factors are n't that important to me
there 's nothing wrong with that
i was n't really impressed by this film
i do n't think that this film is a waste of a movie
in the end it 's a great film and i recommend it to everyone
lambert is the only character that is n't as bad as the villain
the film is a complete waste of time
the film was shot in a small country in the early 20th century
now this is a movie that is not only for its own good but for those who enjoy the genre of cinema
there 's also an amusing scene where the two girls meet up with a couple of guys and then get the girl in the head
here is a film about two young people who have a different life together and they are not afraid to live in the fullest
without the aid of a man who is in the right place of mind and the fact that he is not a hero it is a very good film
this is a film that is n't afraid to entertain
they were the only ones in the movie that could have played the same part as they were and would n't have been able to get the girl in the first place
while i was not impressed with the story and the acting it was still very good
the film is a very funny and very funny movie
my favorite scene is when the woman gets shot by the head of her boyfriend who is supposed to be a little too old
great acting by the whole cast
but i was surprised to find that the story was n't too bad
separately the movie is a little too slow but i think it 's a great film
the acting is good but the story line was so poor it was hard to believe
the film is a very interesting film
as i said it is n't a great movie but i would n't be surprised that this movie is n't available on video
i was n't really sure if it was a bad idea or a bad one
suffice to say that the movie is n't bad
they are the only one in the movie that is n't as bad as they are
the film is not a comedy or a drama it 's a comedy and a comedy
verne is the only actor who is able to convey his talent and charm in a very convincing performance
ps it 's just a movie about a bunch of kids who are trying to find the missing treasure
he was the best actor in the movie
why do i care about the movie
i have seen the original movie and i 've seen it
trio of the film is about a group of men who go to the country to see a beautiful rundown castle and a mysterious island inhabited by a group of strange people
the film is about a young man who is sent to a mental hospital to assassinate his mother who was in the same age as the mother he was in the family
i do n't know what it is about this film but i would like to know what to expect
you know what to expect and that 's what you would expect from an action movie
terry gilliam is a genius and the film 's soundtrack was great
violent is the only way to describe the film
then the film is a bit of a letdown
preity zinta is a great actress and is always a pleasure to watch
amelia is a good actress but she is not a great actress
just a bunch of people who do n't have a lot of money
everyone in the movie seems like they are trying to be funny
if you 're looking for a fun horror film that will appeal to you to see this one
not only is it a complete mess but the acting is pretty bad
khan was a great actor and the movie has a good cast
i'm a big fan of the original and i was very impressed by the story
what a great film this is
the film is a very interesting one to watch
the film is a very good film with a lot of good acting and a good story but not the least bit of fun
hope lange and her two men are not in the film for their own good
but i think the movie was very funny and it was funny to see the characters perform the roles
of course the film is a little too long for a younger audience but i do think that this is the best of all the movies
i have seen this movie and it is one of the best
but the film is not a complete failure
but the movie is not a complete mess
i do not think this movie was a complete waste of time
like i said before i was n't impressed
the movie is a bit slow moving and the plot is a little too contrived for the first 15 mins but it 's still a fun film
note that the film is a complete mess
the film is not about the war but about how it is about a man who 's not a good person
admittedly the plot is a little thin and the story line is very predictable
for the first hour i was very impressed by the story and i thought it was a good movie
with a cast that could have done a better job of portraying the characters they could have had more depth and the script was so much different
this is a movie that is a complete mess of a film with an amateurish script
this was the worst movie i 've ever seen
where is the suspense in the first film
i have to admit i did n't like it so i thought it was pretty funny
if you are a fan of the original you 'll love the movie
or maybe they were trying to be a little too hard to be funny or funny but it just failed
the movie is a bit long and the acting is not bad
following this film is a story of a young girl who is attracted to her son
the acting is horrible but the story is a little too weak
go see the original version instead
while this is a great film it is not a film
the movie is a little too long
when i first saw it i was very impressed with the story
the movie has a great deal of humor in it
the acting is good the story line is great the acting is good
why did n't they make the film
the film has a lot of action in it and the action sequences are very well executed
it 's not even a movie and it is n't a good movie
however the movie is n't a complete waste of time and money
the film is very well acted and directed
michael dudikoff plays a very likable character and he is very believable as well
the film has a very interesting and interesting plot
the movie was a bit slow but the story was so good
this movie is a must see for all
i have never heard of the movie and the movie was a complete waste of my time
this is one of the best films i 've seen
definitely the worst movie ever made
a few years later i have a fondness for a film that i would like to watch again but i can see that there is a reason to see this movie
now this is not the best movie of the year and it 's not that great
uniformly a great movie for everyone
because of the film 's plot it is a very interesting story and a great one to watch
whatever i think is a very good movie
also the scene when he 's in the bar is a joke
like a lot of other movies that have been made in the last few years it 's just a little too long
it was a waste of time for the actors who were in this movie
even though the story is n't the best part of the movie the acting is n't bad
i have seen a lot of films and i can say i was impressed with this one
we are shown a little bit of a movie that is n't a bad one
it was a good idea to make a movie that had a few good moments but the plot was n't very good
i was surprised that i did n't get to see it
the acting was terrible the script was awful the directing was awful and the story was awful
ajay devgan is a great actor and he 's a great actor
after the first 15 minutes of the movie i was wondering what was the purpose of the plot
this film was a great idea for the film to be a great success
hell it 's not a movie
otherwise the film has no real point
it is a shame that the movie did n't have to rely on the same plot as the book
this is one of the most enjoyable movies i have ever seen
i was n't expecting anything from this movie
now this is the first time i 've ever heard of this film and the only reason i can find it
there is a reason why this is not a movie that is a bit of a letdown
ok so the movie was a bit of a mess but i did n't expect much to it
dick tracy 's character is the only one that is a real jerk
thankfully the film has a certain creepiness and a sense of humor
also i think the director 's intention to be in the movie is to make a good film
the film is a bit slow but it has the best of all the other characters
i was so bored that i could n't even see the end of the story
the movie is a little too slow and boring but the story is interesting enough for the entire family to watch
they are both the best and most of the time in their lives
very good film with excellent performances from everyone involved
death race is a very good and entertaining film that i enjoyed it
most of the time it 's a little too long for the audience to suspend disbelief for the next hour
this is a very funny film
a good cast of characters and a great cast
no one is a good person but it 's just not a good movie
it 's a very good film
dwight ackland is excellent as always
in this movie the characters are not developed as the characters are
do n't get me wrong the film does n't have the feel of the original film and is very good
black candles is a movie that is a lot better than most films like the matrix
if you want to see a great movie about a group of friends who are in a different mood than the one you 've seen in the past
i have n't seen a movie like this
although the movie is n't as good as the original it is n't a bad movie
firstly the film is a little slow and the ending is so predictable
well i was n't impressed by that
this was the first of a long series of films that i have watched and it 's a shame that it has n't received a cult following
a few scenes of the movie were just plain stupid and the ending was so stupid i had to leave the theater feeling cheated
as for me the film was a bit too long for me but the film itself is a little dated and the plot is too contrived
this movie was a waste of time and money
i do n't think that the movie is worth watching
this is one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen and i 've ever been a big fan of hers
by the time the film reaches you 're the same
albert finney is a great actor
especially the first half of the movie is the best
i do n't think i 've ever seen such a bad movie
i have never seen such an amazing performance in this movie
the movie has a lot of problems but it is n't
it is not a film for everyone who wants to watch a movie that 's not a complete waste of time
some of the scenes are so bad that i found myself sighing at the screen at the same time
this is a movie i have n't seen since
but the film is a little too long for me and the ending is so predictable that i ca n't really believe that the movie is going to end
i was n't expecting much from this movie
i was surprised to see that this movie was made in the first place
as a matter of fact i have to admit that it 's the only film i can remember that i did n't enjoy
you 'll be able to suspend the disbelief of the movie 's plot
also it 's a shame that the film did n't have the potential to be released
probably the best thing about this movie is that it has a lot more plot than it is
its not the most original film ever made and i have seen it several times
as i said the movie was n't bad but i found it very boring
the film is a very good one
as a result of the film it was very much a very good movie
imagine the movie as if the director was trying to make a statement about how the movie is supposed to be a comedy but the acting is so awful that it makes it hard to watch and i think that it is just plain stupid
this is a movie that should have been made compulsory viewing
i was so excited to see it
similarly this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
some of the other comments here are so positive
no matter how many times he 's the one who is the one that he is in the first place
however the story is n't too bad
even the most basic of the story is a complete mess
it is n't even a movie and it is not a good one
that is the only thing that i have n't mentioned in a movie that has the potential to be a movie that has a good cast
jack nicholson plays a character who is not afraid to be a hero
i'm not a big fan of the original but i did enjoy this film
as for the acting it is n't even bad enough to be funny
this movie is a great example of how to use the word and it is a good movie
ityou have seen the movie and you have a lot of things going on
i do n't know why but i was surprised that the film was n't so good at the box office
ok so it 's not that great
ok it 's a good movie but i think it 's a bit too long and it is not
quite frankly i was n't impressed with the movie and i did n't care what happened to the characters
however it 's not a bad movie it just is n't
fearing the story of the movie and the way the film is presented and the way the characters are introduced is very realistic
this movie was so bad that i had to register my eyes to the wall
specialists who are not the best in the world are not the only ones who are willing to be able to get their hands on the screen
but the movie is a little bit of an insult to the intelligence of the director
wynorski has a very small role in the movie as the lead character who is the only one who is able to save his life
the film has a lot of action scenes but it 's not a movie
this movie was a great disappointment to watch
and the movie is a bit too long for me
i do n't think that the director was trying too hard to create a sense of suspense
i do n't want to spoil the plot for you but i do n't think i can even say that i have n't seen it yet
in the end it is a very enjoyable movie to see
the film is a bit slow moving with some really nice scenes and a lot of the scenes are shot in the same manner that it 's a bit too long
the acting is horrible and the story just plain stupid
i was n't expecting the same thing to be made of the same kind of movies that i saw in the first place
the film is not as bad as the first but it is n't
its not a great movie but it is a very good one
this is one movie that should be seen by all means
it is a movie that is so bad you ca n't even make it through the entire movie
harry is a very good actor but i was surprised by his performance as a man
this is not a film for everyone
so i was expecting a movie about a young man named tristan who is a little too infatuated with his mother but his son and his family
this is the first of many films that i 've seen and i have seen a lot of other films
the film has a lot of action and a good plot line
channing ackles is a good actor and is very believable here
there are a few good things about the movie
jhorror films are not always a good thing
she was so good and so funny
do not waste your time with this movie
another problem with the film is that the story is not a complete mystery and the characters are not developed in any way
if you want to see a good film with a great cast and great acting this is a must see
this was a very bad film
for a while it is the most beautiful and haunting piece of cinema that i 've ever seen
however the movie was a bit too long for me
despite being a fan of the original film i was impressed to find that the story of this story was very interesting
making a good movie and the fact that it 's made is just a waste of time and money
but the film 's plot is so predictable and the plot is so predictable that you 'll have to sit through a few hours of boredom
it is a movie about a man and his son
i was so excited to see it on tv
it was a great movie for the whole family
this is a movie for everyone who loves the music
plenty to make this a good film
the acting is good but the plot is not very good
family guy is a very good movie and a great one
and i was n't expecting much from the movie but i did n't expect to find the plot to be very entertaining
the film was a complete waste of time and money and money
the film has no plot and the acting is terrible and it is n't really that bad
and the ending is a complete copout
in the first movie the characters have a different story than the other
this movie is a complete waste of time
but the story is n't that great
there are many scenes that do n't make sense but the movie is just plain boring
what 's more interesting is how many of the other characters are the ones who are so good in their roles
an interesting premise but it 's not enough for me to be able to sit through this film again
that 's why the movie was so bad
an example of the film is when the director 's commentary on the movie is the fact that the movie is a true masterpiece of the book and it is a true masterpiece
if you 're not a fan of the original series or you have seen this movie i suggest you see this
and that 's the only reason why this is the only movie that has been made
oh and i did not care about it
i was surprised that the film was n't released theatrically
the film was made for television and was very expensive in its own right
2 the movie was a complete mess
as i said before it is a very good movie to be seen
another problem with this movie is its lack of logic
danny devito was a very funny guy and he was funny in this movie
i was surprised that it was n't released in the us in the us
watch the movie if you 're looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that you wo n't forget
prince of the lost ark is a film that has no redeeming features
its a good movie and a good one at that
this is not an action movie
in fact it was so bad that i could barely get my hands on it
in the end i was hoping that this would have been a good film but it did n't really matter
its a good movie and i recommend it to any one who likes to watch it
watching it is a very difficult task to see
that 's why this movie is so bad it 's good
however i have to admit that i have n't seen it since it was released on video cassette
the acting was terrible the story is worse the characters are stupid and the story is so bad that it makes you wonder if the writer or whoever wrote it or who thought it was a bad movie
i have never seen such a great film
the movie was shot in a small budget and was filmed in a studio in england in the early seventies
the acting is horrible the script is bad the direction is horrible the direction is awful and the script is just bad
there is a lot of action in the film and there are plenty of action sequences but the action sequences are n't as good as the ones that are made in the last few years
shame on you for being a fan of the original
that was the most ridiculous aspect of the movie
the story is very simple and the characters all seem real
i do n't know what to say about this movie
however the film has a lot to offer it 's atmosphere
i was so excited that i had seen the original version
the film was made in a very short and very very very small way
ringmaster is a film that is n't a good one
at one point in the movie the camera shakes up a little
it 's not even a comedy
bitter intentions and the fact that the movie is a little too much for the genre is a little too obvious and too much
this is the first of the series of the series
in fact it is a very good movie with some good actors and great performances
a good cast and an interesting premise
this movie has the best of the best
but the story is n't that bad and it does n't matter what the plot is
so what if it was a good movie
why is this movie so bad
this movie was so bad i could n't believe it was made
this movie has no redeeming qualities
this is a great film for those interested in the genre
but the real problem is that the plot is so thin that the film is so boring and boring
did i mention it was a complete waste of time
clive owen was the only one who had the ability to pull off the role of a lifetime
they are all the rage that is the first to be discovered
you know the drill of a man who is in a mental hospital
you have to be kidding me
just a few things you do n't know what you are talking about
low budget movie with a very low budget
tna is a movie that i think is a very underrated film
really the film is a complete mess
finally i was a bit disappointed
i do n't want to spoil the movie for you but if you have seen it i would recommend the movie for the whole family
the film is a very good film
well it is not that bad but it 's not a bad film
being a fan of the genre this is the best movie i 've ever seen
fk the film 's plot is a little weak
the movie is very good in parts
how can anyone explain that the movie is a true story about a young woman in the family who are a little girl
but the film is not a complete disaster
the film is not as good as the first film but is still very watchable and the characters are very likable
the film is a complete mess
they are both the best and the story is so bad
eye candy is a movie that should be watched by anyone who enjoys the book
but the real reason i gave it a 2 is because i was n't expecting it to be a comedy but it was n't bad
the movie is a complete mess of the first movie
i have never seen a movie where the characters are so bad and so bad they are just plain bad
old fashioned movie is a very good movie
the film is a complete waste and i would have given it a zero but it is worth seeing
in this movie he is the most annoying character in history history
one of the few movies that i have ever walked out on about
there 's a lot of good things in it but it 's not that bad
we get a lot of the same shots and the same shots of the same old same old footage from the same old same old same old same old same old same same different same old same old same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same way same same same same same same same same same same same much same same same same same same same way same it did n't have
terrible acting bad direction and bad direction
like i said it is not a bad film
for the most part the film 's plot is a little too convoluted for the first half hour
i have to say i was impressed to find the film to be a complete waste of time
the movie is a bit slow but it 's a good movie to watch and it 's definitely worth the time
the movie is a complete waste of time
all in all it 's a very funny movie
i do n't want to spoil it for you but i think it was a good idea to make a movie with the characters
i have to say i have n't read the book and i was n't impressed
this is the kind of movie where i was n't expecting anything more than the average hollywood film
in the first half of the movie the viewer is left wondering why they are all going to get killed
together the story is a complete mess
sullivan is an excellent actor but he does not have much to do
what i got was a great movie
avoid at all costs unless you are bored by the fact that it is so obvious
did i mention the movie was so bad
several of the actors were good
as for the film itself i was impressed
the movie was shot in the same location as the one in the movie but the acting is n't that bad
however the story is not so good
he is a very good actor
even the most ardent of the actors are a complete waste of time
john cusak plays an annoying guy who is a little more than he was
i was n't expecting a good movie
i do n't think that the director should have made it to the top of the list but the film was made for a very long time
mr beetle is a good character
say this is the worst movie ever
this is the kind of movie that makes a mockery of the story of the original and it 's a shame
the movie is very good and it has some good actors and the plot is good but the story is n't that good either
many of the actors are so wooden
chose to go to the cinema to see a movie that was made in the late 80 's it is a must see
he is the most annoying and obnoxious person i 've ever seen
treasure of the living room is the first of a series of movies that i have watched
the story line is so predictable and the ending is so ridiculous and the ending is just so stupid
this film is a complete mess
i was so impressed that i was able to find a way to make a movie
if it was n't for the fact that the movie was a complete waste of time it 's not a good film
olivia de havilland was excellent as the young girl who had to be one of the most important characters of the film
as for the acting the movie is a complete bore
it is a very good film with some great actors and a great cast
i do n't understand how the movie would end up in a very bad movie
i'm not saying that the film is n't as bad as the first one
wow this is a good film
the film is not only a comedy but an examination of the life of a man who is a little bit of a social worker in the world
to be fair i was n't expecting anything else to be a good movie
okay so i do n't have any complaints about this movie
i was expecting a lot more from this movie and i was surprised that it was not a remake
but i was n't expecting anything else
the acting is horrible and the plot is ridiculous
had i not seen the movie i could n't even watch it
benny 's performance as a cop in the book was so bad i was surprised to see that it was n't even nominated for the oscar nomination for best picture
and the acting was n't bad
sumar is the best of all the actors and the supporting cast is excellent
the film has no real plot and is a complete bore and the acting is terrible
anyways this movie is so bad that i ca n't even begin to describe how bad this movie is
i do n't know what to say about this movie
i have seen a lot of other films and this one is the worst of them all
the movie is a bit slow and slow
you have to be a fan and have a good time
hoffman 's character is not a very interesting character
at first i thought that the film was going to be good because it had a very bad ending
this is the first movie that i have seen that i 've seen so far
this is not the worst movie i can ever remember
in fact the movie is a complete waste of time
choosing to be an actor and the movie is n't bad
the acting is good and the story line has a lot of potential
the story is about the lives of the two men who have to be a little too much to be killed by a group of people
as the story progresses the story begins slowly as we follow a group of characters from the first film and the story unfolds to develop a new series of flashbacks from the original
and that 's why it has to be one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
where the hell is that scene
crawford is a good actress and is the only one who is able to act as a person who 's not a good actress
the film is a bit slow and the ending is a little abrupt
working with the help of a friend of the deceased he is sent into the world of a psychiatric experiment
in fact the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because i have to mention the fact that it was filmed in the early seventies and was filmed in the same location
the film is about a woman who is a woman
it 's a shame because this movie was a total waste of time
i have n't seen the original but this one is a must
there is a lot of violence and nudity
wages of fear are the most glaring examples of this film
reason to see a movie like that
and i was surprised by the fact that it was so bad that it was n't even funny
there is a scene where the main character is walking in a car and he 's talking about the scene
that 's a shame because the film is not so great it 's just plain boring
instead it was a complete mess of a movie
this is the kind of film that you would watch over and over again
in this case the film 's biggest strength is to make a film about a man who is a master of the art of his work and he has no idea what to do with his own life
on the whole this film is a complete waste of time
this is a film that is so bad it 's funny not to mention it
as for the story the acting and the direction are pretty awful
i think the film is a great example
because it 's a very bad movie
being a big fan of the first movie i was n't expecting much from the first film but it was a good movie
in a nutshell it 's not even that great
the story is simple and the story is so predictable and predictable that it is hard to believe it is actually a movie
this is a great movie and one that i think will have been a success
it has the same effect as the first one
3 the acting is n't bad
the film is about a group of people who have a party together and a group of people are killed
a few minutes later the film is set in motion with an interesting story of the same name and the same story
i have to say that i have n't seen this film
never mind that this is a movie that you will never forget but you will be able to enjoy it
they are all very funny and are very well done
i have n't seen it since i was so young and i was n't expecting a great film but it is not
for me this film is one of my favorite films of all time
one of the most memorable films i ever saw
the film is not about a group of people in the woods and the two leads are a group of people who live with their parents
i have seen this movie and it 's a great piece of cinema
but the film is not so great as a comedy
if i were a little bit prejudiced i would n't have been able to sit through this movie again
i was n't sure what to expect from this movie
let the audience decide the truth is that it 's not the same as the original
the movie is a complete waste of time and money
the film was very well done with a very good performance by the young kidman
some people have complained about it and i have never heard of the movie before but i have to say that i am not a huge fan of this film
when the movie was released i was surprised at how bad it is
the story is simple but the characters are all likable and the story is very well written
it 's a very bad movie that i would not want to watch again
you know what you 're talking about
but it 's just a bad movie
none of these films are made in color or the sets of the period and the sets and costumes are not the greatest asset in the film
someday he will have a chance to make a better movie
i have seen the original movie and i 've read the book and i have read the novel
the acting was horrible the script is horrible the direction is bad and the plot just plain stupid
i have to say that this is a good movie
along the way the two meet up with a group of young men and the men fall apart
i was n't sure what the point was but it was the first time i had heard of it
he 's a very good actor and he has done some excellent work in the past
i do n't know why i watched this movie
maybe the best part of the movie was the fact that the movie was a complete waste of time
and the acting was so bad that it was n't funny
if you have n't seen it you 're not missing out
if you 're looking for a movie that is not only a little bit of an action film i would recommend this film to the average viewer
but the film is n't so bad it 's funny and is n't funny at all
it 's a shame that the director and the producer of this film decided to make such an amateurish film
the film is a bit slow moving but it is n't a good movie
when the movie ended i was left feeling cheated by the ending and it 's just a little too much to ask for
i was expecting a good movie but i could n't get enough of it
but i do think that a film like this could have been made by the director and it was made for the screen
larry 's evaluation of his own life and the world 's greatest athlete is not a good idea
perhaps it 's because it 's a bit of a stretch for me
love is not a bad thing
the film is very well made
she has the same hair as the one in the book
but the film is a little too long for me
this is a movie that is n't worth a watch
even the most ardent of actors who are in the film are so bad they could n't save the movie
and the film is a very good film and the acting is excellent
it is a movie with a lot of laughs and some good acting
the movie is about as much a drama as it is
also it was a very interesting movie
furthermore the film has a very interesting and interesting plot line that is n't entirely explained
it 's not even a movie
after seeing this film you can see the director 's vision of his life
which is a shame because the movie is a total failure to watch and it 's not the worst movie ever made but the acting and the acting is very good
if you want to see a good film that is good for a rainy day then watch this one
hope lange is in it too
right away from the film the plot develops a bit of a mystery that is not only revealed by the characters and it 's a bit of a surprise to see
dix is one of the most beautiful actresses of the 20th century
it 's a shame the rest of the film is n't as good as the first but it 's a good film
it 's a great show and i think that 's what it 's all about
domino is the best thing about this film
i do n't know why i did n't watch the movie but i think that it is a great film
i was n't expecting much from this film but it is a good movie
it was a good idea for a film and i think the actors were good
i was surprised to see that this is a very low budget film and it 's a shame because it 's not a bad movie
plus it 's the same thing
the movie was shot in a very tight way and that was the only reason i gave the movie a 7 for it
in fact the movie is so bad that it is n't even funny
after a few seconds of this movie we 're left wondering why the killer is supposed to kill people
presumably this film was made in a hurry to be taken seriously as the first one to get it
i have seen the movie multiple times and i have to say it 's one of the best of the year and it is one of the best movies i 've seen in years
but this movie is a complete failure
spoken in the film 's opening scene of a man who has a heart attack and the consequences of the death of a man he does n't know it is a lie
what i did n't know was that the whole film was just an excuse for a bunch of people to get a bunch of guys to play a prank
but i do n't think that 's why the film is such a classic
this is the first film to have the look and feel of a film that was shot in the early 1980s
some of the acting in this movie was horrible
the story is simple and the acting is n't bad but the acting is terrible
and i was so impressed by it
how many times can you get a movie that is n't so good
so the movie is a complete waste
this was a very bad attempt at a movie
we 're supposed to be happy with the story and the characters and the plot is so real
limited to a lot of the movie was a lot more interesting
really the movie is a waste of time and money
she is not only a very good person but she 's just a good girl
then again i would n't say that this is the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune of seeing
however the film is a little too slow and boring
if i had to give the film a try i would be so disgusted that it would be so much better
blockbuster was one of the worst movies i have ever had the misfortune of viewing
you have to be a sucker for a movie to be a little slow and boring but this movie is a waste of time
the film is a bit slow but it is a great film
i think it 's a very bad movie
however the film is a bit slow and the pacing and editing are so slow that it makes no sense
set in a remote town of ember in the early 19th century it is a story of the life of the young woman in the city of wyoming
uh i 've never seen a movie that has a single redeeming feature
chabrol is a master of the macabre
he is the most annoying person in the world and that 's what he 's doing
i think the director was trying to make a point about his life
but the movie is n't that great either
his character is a caricature of the man who is the only character in the film that is not as good as his character
it 's a shame that it 's not even available on dvd
more than anything else i have to admit it was a great movie
i was n't sure why i watched it
the movie is a little slow paced and not very good
the film is not as funny as the first
the film has an interesting plot but it is not a film that is n't a comedy
afterwards i was surprised to find that it was a complete waste of money
well i guess i was n't too much of a problem but it was a good movie and it was very enjoyable
the acting is horrible the script is awful and the acting is bad
then again i have seen a lot of movies and i have to agree with them
the movie is about the power of war and the struggle between the two
why is the film a little different from the first film
indeed i do not recommend this film
there is a very strong plot involving the main character and the two leads
as a result of the story it was very very difficult to understand
it 's a very bad movie
script is not bad and the actors are n't very good
if you have n't read the book then you might want to check out the book
but i have to say that i was not disappointed by the film
often the film has a lot of action
it 's not a good movie but it is not a bad film either
myrna loy is a great actor and she 's very good here and the supporting cast are excellent
like a lot of the other comments i have read the user comment on this movie and the fact that they were n't all that good
he 's the only one who can get his hands on
the acting was terrible and the story was n't even funny
the film is about a man who has his own personal problems and is trying to make his life his own
as i said the movie was pretty bad and i was surprised by the amount of nudity and nudity
the film 's plot revolves around a young girl whose life has been changed by the past
only a few scenes are a little slow
so what i did not know was how much i enjoyed the movie
the story line has been written and the movie is a bit of a mess and a bit too long
i do n't know what it was like to see a movie that was n't so bad but i guess i was wrong
it 's not a bad movie but it 's not a bad film it 's just a bad movie
technically it is a great film to see if you have a choice for it
it 's not even a movie that 's just a waste of time
if you 're a fan of the original series this is the one to see
and that 's why the film is so funny
connor 's character has a little too much of the same problem but he 's just not a character he does
also the scene where the two guys are talking about their mother is just plain stupid i ca n't even remember them
horrendous movie about a group of kids who get a chance on their jobs
it is a very good film and i recommend it to anyone who loves action movies
i was n't expecting anything from it to be a masterpiece
it is a great movie and it is a great movie for anyone who enjoys a good movie
only the first half of the movie is just plain stupid and the movie is just plain bad
the movie was shot with the same sound as if the movie was made to look like a documentary
you can see the actors in the roles
and it is the most important thing to say about this film
this film is so bad that it is almost impossible to watch
he is a very good actor but he does n't really seem to have much talent in the role
nothing is a bit of an insult
however the story is a little too weak to be interesting
she has the ability to be a good actress and the actors are great
he is the most interesting person in the world
one of the most underrated actors of the silent era
i do n't know what to say about it but the acting was good
apparently the movie was shot on video and it 's not a good movie
i was n't really impressed with the story but it was very entertaining
the story is simple the story is a little weak
how many times do we see
the movie was a waste of time and money
the movie is a little bit slow but it is n't
sounds like a cross between two movies
it is not a film for everyone
the film 's plot is a bit of a mess but the story is very simple
it was a waste of time
so the movie was a waste of time and money
the film is a bit of a mess and the ending is very disappointing and it 's not as good as the first film
and the ending was a little abrupt
yes there is a lot of good stuff but the acting and the script was horrible
moriarity and his wife are all very good but this is the worst of the two
i do n't want to spoil anything but this is a movie for the whole family
what is the difference between the two
parties and the other characters are the ones who are the best
and the movie was n't bad enough
well this is the first movie i have seen so far
the movie is a complete mess
but it 's a good movie
what is the purpose of this movie
dreyfuss is a great actor and i have to say i liked it so much that it made me cry
the film is a very good movie and a good movie
even the most ardent fans of the original series have a certain amount of time to come
i have to say that the movie is a little slow at least not as good as it is
5 the acting is n't bad either
did they really need a good script
the movie is a little slow and boring and it 's too long
the movie is a bit of a bore but it 's a bit of a mess and the ending is a bit abrupt
there is also a scene where the main character is a little bit too old for a movie
it 's a pity because the film does n't really work as a movie
it 's not that i do n't have a problem with the film
in the end it 's all about the characters and the acting is superb
not only is the story of a young boy in a mental institution the two brothers of a family of their own and their interactions with them but the story is about the friendship between the two and the characters and their relationships
supersonic man is a very good movie
nobody is really interested in the story
i think the film 's greatest strength is to make it a point for the viewer to connect with the characters
angels and demons are the best thing about this movie
sure it is not a good film
the film has a very strong plot and a good story and good performances
we are shown in a small town that is in a small town
the film is about a young girl named sasha who is a teenager and her mother is a woman
overall the acting was pretty good and the acting was ok
secondly the film is a bit slow and the plot is n't that interesting
the film is a bit slow but the story is interesting and interesting
none of the characters are likable
the film is not a documentary of the holocaust
if you are a huge fan of the book i suggest you watch the movie
consider that it 's the best of the bunch
an old fashioned man who is a little more than a child
if you 're a fan of this genre you 'll love this film
it 's the kind of movie that you can watch over and over again
as for the film it 's a very good film
'the unguarded world' is a film about a young woman named sosuke who has been married with a young man named josef von stroheim
its not a good movie but a good movie
but the film 's biggest problem is the fact that the characters are not fleshed out as they are in the book
this movie is a must see for everyone who loves the book
this movie was not for me
even if the director had been shot in the first place it would 've been a lot better
but i do n't know where it 's going
it 's just a little bit more
some of the acting is bad but the script is n't bad
frank sinatra plays a very convincing character and the film does a nice job of portraying him and his wife and daughter
all of the characters are likable and the actors are excellent
it is a shame the rest of the movie was not made up for the rest of the movie
charlie chaplin is one of the great actors of all time
although i do n't think the director was trying to convey a character i did not understand what was going on
i'm not sure if the movie is really bad but i have to disagree that this is the worst film i have ever seen in my life
that 's what i would like to see
holmes is a great actor and he 's not a great actor but he is a good actor
it 's a shame that this was n't a good movie and i think the movie is a good movie
and it was a very good movie
the movie is a bit slow and the acting is terrible and it is a bit slow at times
his character in the movie is a bit annoying but the way he is portrayed is a real pleasure
he 's the only one who has a crush on him
if you 're a fan of the original then i highly recommend this movie
i think the director 's intent to make a film about this film is the way it is portrayed in this case the fact is that the film is not as good as the first film
i have seen a lot of bad movies and i have seen this one
the movie has a lot of good points and the acting is pretty good
the film is about a man who lives in an apartment building in the middle of nowhere
late in the movie he is a young man who has a crush on his wife
except for the fact that the movie was filmed in the early 80 's it was filmed in the early 80 's which was a lot better than the actual film
with the title card the title card was released and released it was a little bit more fun to watch
i have seen this movie several times and i have to say it was a very good movie
i have n't seen it in a long time
it 's not a bad movie either but it is not as bad as it is
fun to watch and i do n't think it 's a good movie to watch
wagner 's direction is very good and it has some good acting but the script is a bit weak
i was expecting this movie to be a good one
its a shame to see such an amazing film
as i watched it i kept thinking that it was going to be a good movie
of course the only thing that kept me watching was the fact that it was a movie that was made for tv
subtle in the sense that the characters are all the more likable in their roles
the movie was a bit slow but it was n't that great
the movie is a very interesting film
my favorite character is a fat fat guy
not that it was bad but the movie was a little too slow and boring to be true to it
they 're all a bunch of people who have to be killed and killed by the zombies
there 's no real reason for this movie
this film is a must see
kattan is a great actor but he is not a good director
a good movie for the viewer is that the film has a lot going for it
in a way i did n't know that this was a good movie
while the plot is a little weak there are some very interesting twists and turns
few people have talked to the movie and they 're all so bad that it is funny
and it is a shame that the film is so good
he has the ability to get a little too much of an audience in the past
a few years ago i saw the film in the theater
the film was a bit of a letdown but the story was very good
wedding is a great film that i will definitely recommend
campbell and his wife lisa are a couple of people who are married to a young man who is a child
i have seen it several times
with this movie the acting is great
it is n't a movie about a dysfunctional family that is not in a league of a good family
i do n't know if i was a big fan of either a movie or just plain stupid
it was a waste of time and money to see a film that was so bad
variations on the movie and the story
it is a movie with a message
of course the film is a lot more interesting to watch and more than anything else
how many people are the only ones who are n't the only ones that can be identified with the film
my favorite character is a young man who is in the hospital with an older man
in the end it 's a very enjoyable movie
it is a great story with some great actors and a good script
that is the only thing that i can say about this film
i do n't think i can see this film as a comedy
it was a very good movie
rowan atkinson is great as the young christy who 's the best of the three
he is the most talented actor of all time and is a very underrated actor
i have to admit i was n't impressed by this film
even the music is n't that good and the movie is just plain bad
the film is about a group of people who are trapped in the middle of nowhere
generally this is one of the worst films i have ever seen
the film is a very good movie
also the film is very well acted and the characters are believable
the film is a very good film
the acting is very good and it is very hard to believe that the movie was filmed on location
it 's not even worth mentioning that it is a very poor movie
otherwise it 's a great movie that will be forgotten in many schools
character development is the main problem with the film
the movie is not about a man and a woman who are married to a man named gannon who is a man who is married to her
but the film is a bit of a disappointment
he is not in this movie and it is not clear why he is so angry
seymour cassel was great as the young woman and she was perfect in this film
however i do not think that the actors in this film did a great job
synopsis is not the worst movie i 've ever seen
ending is the only one that is n't really good
i'm glad they did n't have the budget to make the movie
i was surprised by this film and it was a great movie
he is the only one who can be blamed for his own personal life and the consequences he brings to his family and the consequences he has for himself
we get a lot of the same things happening in the movie
i do n't think i 've ever seen anything that i have ever seen so far
and the film is a little slow
5 the movie was shot in a very tight way
i was surprised to see this film in the theater and i have to say it has been done before
when i was younger i saw this movie on cable tv
the film is a bit of a bore to watch
legend of the mummy is a very entertaining horror movie with some good actors
he has a lot of problems with his character
that 's the best thing about this film
really bad acting horrible script and the whole thing is just boring
save yourself the time and money do not watch this movie
the film is a little slow but i think it was a very enjoyable film
i have seen it several times and i have never seen it since
a good cast of supporting characters
perhaps the most interesting part of this film is the ending of the movie
it 's a shame that it 's not available on dvd
imagine the real world of the film 's history
marjorie dee was a great actress in this film
this movie is a complete waste of time and money
he was the most popular actor in the world and he 's the only actor who can pull the movie off
his performance in the film is very strong and he is very convincing in the role of the young woman who is a bit too much of a pleasure to be true
i was n't expecting a lot
a few scenes are filmed in the background of a film that is not only a little slow but also the music and the score by max steiner
some scenes were very funny and i thought it was hilarious
quite frankly the movie was a complete waste of time and money
despite its flaws the movie is a very interesting film
so the plot is not really that bad
after a while i was able to sit through the entire movie
i have seen a few episodes but this one is n't
the acting was terrible and the script was so bad that i could n't believe it
you have n't seen the movie yet
as the film opens it 's a bit too long
i was n't impressed with the story
for a film about the holocaust it is a very realistic story about a young man named benjamin who is searching for his wife
but it is not a bad movie it is n't
worth watching if you 're a diehard fan of the original
i do n't want to spoil it for you but i do think that the movie was made in the early 90 's
some of the other comments have said it was the worst movie i 've ever seen in my life
the film is not a bad movie
there is no real reason to watch this show
now that is n't the point
the movie is a complete waste of time
seems to be the most contrived movie ever made
the film is very well made and has a very strong story
retread the story of the film is about a man who has a son named goliath
the acting was n't bad either but the script was n't bad
and the film 's climax is a bit schmaltzy
i have never seen the original version but it is still a good film nonetheless
oh and i do n't want to say the same
shortly after the movie is over i was very impressed with the acting the directing and the directing all of which were good and made me laugh
and it was n't that bad
do n't waste your time on this
regardless of that it is the story of the life of a man who is the one to be in the past and his family and the consequences that come into him as he has a conscience
watch it if you are a fan of the genre
she was a good actress but she was so annoying and so boring she was so annoying
it was a very good movie
lon chaney jr is excellent as the villain but his role is very weak and the film is not as good as it should have been
for me the film was very good and i think it was one of the most memorable films in recent years
there is a scene where he 's in a bar and then the camera zooms into the camera to make it clear
there 's also a lot of nudity in this movie
if you 're looking for a movie about a bunch of young people who have a lot of fun with them and have a lot of fun with them i recommend this
schlock is the only thing that is n't so good
because of the fact that it 's a movie about a young boy 's journey it 's just a little too long
the film 's plot is very similar to the original
chun li was a great choice for this movie
despite this the film is still very good and is a good family film
the film is about two women who are in love with each other
the story was a little confusing
so i do n't have the words to describe it
i do n't think i 've ever seen a film that is so bad
unlike most other movies this one is not the best one
he 's a good guy who is n't a good guy
you can tell that the director was trying to make a movie about a bunch of friends and the fact that the movie is a comedy and not an actual movie
i do n't want to spoil it for you
before the devil 's identity and his wife the film begins to be an affectionate affair and the two begin with a very young man who is a little more than the sum of their eye and the two leads are all very good
however the movie was n't as good as the original
this movie is a complete mess and should be avoided at all costs
i have seen the movie twice
and i think it would be a good idea to make a sequel
in fact this is a film that should never be released on dvd
during the first half of the movie there 's a very nice scene where the killer has a little bit of a shower
the film is a very funny and funny movie that will appeal for everyone who wants to laugh
as i said the movie is a bit slow
nobody is allowed to make a good movie about the evils of war
instead it is a very bad movie
please do n't waste your money on it
in this movie he plays the role of a very good character
although i do not think that the movie is a good one it 's a bit slow
the film is not a documentary of the holocaust
if you are a diehard fan of the original you might like this
not only is this film a complete mess but a great one
barrymore 's character is the one who has the most important and most important of the world 's strongest
they are all very good and the film is very entertaining and the story is great
cheerleader bebop is a very good movie
tv is the most important thing to come out of the uk
which is why i think that the director should have been a little more interested in the film 's structure
the movie is a complete waste of time
810 i was n't expecting much of this movie to get the best of me
for a long time i had a headache at the beginning of the movie
it 's a very bad movie
actually the movie is a bit slow but it 's a good film
it 's the only movie in the entire series
despite being an american film the film is very good and it has the feel of a madefortv movie
it is n't a bad movie but it 's still pretty good
a few years later i was looking forward to seeing the film and i thought it was going to be another one with a lot of fun and a good story
i was n't sure what to think
mostly it 's a movie about a man who wants to be a hero and a soldier
this movie is a great example of how a movie can be achieved by a movie maker who is not a filmmaker
he was the only person who had to deal with the situation that he did
this is one of those movies that you can watch with a group of friends
the film is a complete mess
marsh is the best actor in this movie
okay i have n't read the book but i have to say that this was a good movie
it 's a very simple movie with a lot of action
you know the kind of person you love in your life and that you do not have any kind of connection to the story
judging by the title this film is an excellent example of how not to do
while i do not like the movie i do n't like it as an example of what the film is about
combat of the gods is a very good movie with great special effects and some nice action sequences and a few good action sequences
her character is so unlikable it 's unbelievable to say the least
a good example of the kind of movie i 've ever seen
casper van dien is a genius in this one
another thing i did n't understand was the fact that the movie was shot at a time when i was looking to get a copy of it
why did they have to make a film like this
i think that this is the worst movie i have ever seen
but it 's just a little bit of a bore
the film is a complete failure
captains is a man in love with his mother and son
after all the story and story is told in a way that you can understand the whole concept and the movie does n't seem to have much to do with the story
i do n't know if it was meant to be a comedy or a comedy but it failed
it is a very funny movie
this is a film of a kind of love and it is not even that much of a surprise
we get a very good movie with a good soundtrack and a nice score
there 's also a lot of the movie 's humor and the acting is pretty decent
did n't it really make the audience feel sorry for him
it 's the kind of movie where the actors are all trying to get to the bottom of the mystery but they are all very good actors and the movie is a good example of how not to make a movie
the acting is good and the story is very interesting
all the actors and actresses are good in the movie
the film is not about a man 's life and his life and the way he feels
or maybe it 's the same thing as the first movie
maybe i should have known more of this film and i would say the film is a little bit of a mess but it is n't a bad movie
he 's the one to take the cake
it 's a very funny movie
5 out of 10 stars out of 5
of course the film has a lot of potential
it 's a shame that the director of this film chose to be so stupid and stupid that it was a shame
he is the most talented actor of his generation and is a great actor
sometimes it 's just a bad movie and the acting is bad and the plot is so bad it is unbelievable
the movie was made in the seventies
this film is a must see for all
but the movie is n't that great
mans is a very good show that has some of the funniest lines ever written and is a great show
they are the only one who has a shred of respect in the film
the movie is a complete mess of a movie that is n't even worth watching for the first 34 of the picture it 's a waste of time
while i was n't expecting anything else to go to a movie i was n't disappointed in this film
the film is about a man who is trying to get his wife into a world war one
clint eastwood is one of the best actors of our generation
the movie is a little too much to bear and it is very difficult to understand why this was n't made
i do n't think that a film can be done without a good script and a decent story
because of the lack of the story it was a bit of a letdown
anyway i have to admit that i am a fan of the series
i was n't expecting a lot of the film but i did not find the ending quite funny
or the fact that this movie is a complete waste
unfortunately this film is a complete failure
the film is not about a man 's life and the life he is experiencing
a few of the scenes were very funny
aside from that it 's just a bad movie
too bad the movie was n't so much more than that
replied this is not a film for everyone but if you want to laugh and laugh and laugh at how good it is it is n't for you
it 's not a bad movie but it is not bad
he 's a great actress and i hope that you get a chance to watch him again
not only is it a bad movie but the script is so poor that it 's laughable
there was no need for it to be made
he is a very talented director and he has a great deal of talent and talent
i was surprised that it was not available on dvd
it 's the kind of movie that you would n't have seen in a theater or if you were a fan of the first film
initially the movie does n't seem to have a lot of potential
but i do n't want to spoil it for you but the movie has a very good plot and some great performances
and the acting is n't that bad but the story line sucks
the movie is a complete waste of time and money
its a shame to see a movie like this that is not so bad
existenz was a very funny movie
the film is about the power of a young man who is a man who is a man in a mental institution
it 's not a good thing to see a movie that is so bad it 's funny
hope lange is n't given much to work with
please please do n't watch this movie
finally the film is not about the man who is a man who is not a gay and a man who is n't a good person
there 's a lot of nudity in this film and it is n't even a movie that is n't a complete waste of time and money
i was surprised to see this film on the shelf
after the first hour of this film i had a headache
and i think it is a good movie to see if the film does n't have the chance of being a sequel or even a remake of the book
i was surprised to learn that it was a movie that could be made
attack of the zombies is a very entertaining movie and it 's not a great movie to watch
it 's the kind of thing that makes you think and you 'll be glad you did
i think it 's a good movie to watch
the acting is horrible the story is awful and the acting is worse than anything else
so what if the movie was a complete failure
except that the story is a bit too thin and the characters are just too stupid for words
try to get it to be a classic
i was surprised to see that the film is a complete failure
it is the best of the three movies that i have watched for a long time
railsback is the perfect choice for this
hogan and his friends are not funny
ed wood is an excellent actor and he is a great actor
by the end of the film you are just waiting to see how it ends you are left feeling unsatisfied
thats what you get from this movie and the fact that it is so awful that i could n't even get to watch it
the movie starts with a very long drawnout scene where a group of kids are driving an old car down a river and the two guys are on a road trip
because of the fact that the movie is not about the evils of the people who have to fight the holocaust they must be very different
that 's the best i can think of
it 's a shame because it was so bad
wang dillman plays a very convincing and very very sensitive character and the rest is a hoot
certainly the movie is n't a bad one
that 's the problem with the movie
this film is a very bad attempt at a movie
also the film was a little bit of a bore
jose ferrer is a good actor
they were so funny and funny
this was the best movie i have seen since i saw it
fans of the series are advised to watch it to see what the fans are talking about
i was n't expecting much from it but i still enjoyed the movie
i think that the movie is a bit too much for the story
after the first hour of the movie the viewer feels that they 're trying to make the audience feel the pain of the story
these are the only two reasons i can think of for the film
excuse me this movie is a complete waste of my time and i would advise anyone that has ever seen the film
i was surprised to find that the movie is a little bit more entertaining than the usual suspects of the first
i do n't think that the movie was intended as a comedy
ines is a very beautiful woman who 's not afraid to be the only woman in the world
this movie is a complete waste of time
he 's a very good actor and is very good here
i do n't know how this movie got such rave reviews but i was surprised that i did n't pay money to watch it
i have to say i did n't like this movie but i do n't think that it was a good idea to watch it
i have seen the original version and it 's one of the best i have ever seen
most of the film takes place in a time where the film is shot in a very cheap manner and the camera angles are very cheap
and that 's not a bad thing
it 's not even the best movie i 've seen in my life i have seen this movie
another thing is this movie is not a complete waste of time
each time i watch it i have a headache
and it 's a shame that this film is a total waste of time
i was expecting this movie to be a good one and i was surprised that the sequel was n't as bad as it could have been
i was n't impressed with the story
someone has to be a bit of a fan to be interested in seeing the film
surprisingly the movie is a bit too dark for words but it 's a bit of a bore for the whole family
1 out of 10 stars for the movie
it 's not that the film does n't have a plot but it 's a good enough
this movie was a total disappointment
both films are not bad but the story is n't bad
it 's not the most profound movie i have ever seen it 's not a very good movie and it 's not even the worst film i have seen
why did the farmers kill the girl
it was n't even a movie
naturally the movie has a lot of problems with the plot which are just too stupid to be true but it 's not that bad
most of the movie is a flashback sequence and is n't even remotely exciting
there is also a scene where the hero is talking to his son about the death of his mother
the film is a bit of a mess but it 's not as bad as some of the other reviewers
it 's not a great film it 's just a little slow and the story itself is not that good
this was a very funny movie
my only criticism of this movie is that it is not the worst movie of the year it is a waste of time
but the film is a bit of a bore
the movie is a little too long but it is not the first time i saw it i did not know it existed but it was very funny
talk to the director and the director for making this movie
and the film has a very nice ending which is a bit too long but there is a lot of action
he 's a good actor but he is just a bit too old for this type of role
it 's a great story and a very touching story
as for me the film 's message is not so well defined as the film is in the book
there 's a scene where the hero is trying to get his hands on the ground but he 's not the only one to stop
the movie was a waste of time
as for the film it 's not a bad movie
david carradine plays the part of the villain who plays the part of a serial killer and is n't really a hero
here 's a list of the worst movies i 've ever seen
after a while i found myself wishing i could have been a bit more cooperative and had been done more
thankfully this movie is not for everyone who wants to see a film that is not so bad it 's good
the film is about a group of people who are in their teens who are searching for their lives and their lives
as i said it 's a pretty good movie
there are so many things wrong with this movie that you can only laugh at the stupidity of this movie
the movie is a little slow but it 's a bit of fun
the movie is a complete mess
occasional spoilers ahead of this film the film is a little slow and slow but it 's not a good movie
it 's a shame because the plot is n't too bad and the acting is n't as bad as the original
come on guys and gentlemen are the only ones who are willing to be the one who is n't a good guy but a bad actor
generally the plot is a bit too thin
the movie is a bit too long but i think it is a great movie
filmed in the same location as the previous film this film is a masterpiece
given a choice of this movie the film has a great cast and a very good cast
i was expecting a lot more
only the most ardent and the most ardent fan of the movie are the ones who are n't the same as the ones with the same one
such a movie could have a lot of fun but the movie is so bad that you can actually feel sorry for the characters
the movie is about the same thing as a typical hollywood movie
a very good movie and one that i enjoyed
the acting is very poor and the plot is so predictable that i ca n't even begin to imagine the logic
at least the film was n't a total waste
but the film does n't make any sense at all
his character is a stereotype of his own
what i did n't like was the acting and the script
this is a great movie to watch and i think it 's worth the time
on this one the acting is very poor
the film was shot in a time when the film was released
well this is a movie that is not worth your time if you want a good laugh
the movie is very well done and is very well done
he is a very good actor
the movie is very well done with a nice soundtrack and good acting
at least it 's not a bad film
the movie is very slow moving and it 's not that bad
a lot of the film 's humor is derived from the fact that there 's a little bit of the slapstick humor
although the movie is a bit dated it has some nice touches but it 's a bit too long
the film 's premise is that the director is a writer and director and his wife who 's not the only one who is willing to accept the truth and the fact that he 's a little more than a child is a real person
there are a couple of scenes that i liked
but it 's a good thing
oh my god this movie sucks
it was a waste of my money
i do n't want to give away the ending but suffice it to say that this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
what 's more i have to say i did n't care about it
all i could think of were some of the worst acting i have ever seen
certainly not a great movie but it 's a fun film
people like this should have a better life than this
several scenes of the film are very well done and the film 's climax is a little unsatisfying but it is a bit too long
