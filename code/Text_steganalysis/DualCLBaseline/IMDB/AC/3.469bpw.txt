anyway the movie is about the best
why is it the opposite way that the first two episodes are still shown in many cities and the only ones who are able to be are their ancestors
it was a real treat to watch another excellent film
not a masterpiece for those who enjoyed this movie that i have already seen or read and will be glad they did
the whole time spent on the cover of the dvd which in order to attract the audience is one of the best i 've ever seen with a good actress
by the time you have to read the story of the book it should be noted that you have to make an ending of this film
fraught with the most extreme violence imaginable in the world this movie is a big step down from the box office
the story starts out as a real movie
he is n't the most beautiful figure as you would expect
i was surprised that i liked it
despite the fact that the plot is a bit off i ca n't find another one of this series 's episodes
jeanclaude van peebles and his family were two of whom in the other two decades are still a lot better and one to watch a more better film
you should give it an extra point of view of it as a way out of all the negatives of movie maker and i must apologize to what it means to get
you 'll have an affinity for everything you need a movie to make you care about
i have this movie on my collection at the local video store
the acting was horrendous the direction was bad the special effects were bad and the story so stupid it 's hard to tell why even a few episodes do n't come up
combs has a decent character but he does not make it big enough he did n't do something like that
maybe that 's why i think it 's a very good movie even if the actors are n't a good movie because they 're all great
it all seemed more like a parody of the original play
i watched this film a second time but it is n't a big let down in the movie
the acting was good and the plot was a good one
i saw this movie on the strength of the other comments the positive comments that i have seen better here to write that one
as a result the movie is a joke
when a movie tells us how this can be seen with some good actors and actors there is another great performance by michael douglas
told the truth and it does not seem to be
i found this to be funny enough to get a lot of laughs
jefferson 's direction is all so extreme and so unreal that it is almost a matter of time or a few minutes
perhaps my favourite is michael jackson
still there was no such measures as he did
she takes in her best job a lot of ways to be seen with their men a young woman that is not even more a father of a young child an admirer of her mother
yeah it could have been pretty much the same plot but he ca n't get past the flaws
besides to think of the whole story a little farfetched
another point in the movie is how little screen time
stanwyck 's character is very sweet and innocent and while she tries hard to help her overcome her relationship with marie
silly and boring that should n't be enough
sandeep gingold is one of my favorite actors and i was a little skeptical but this film just did n't make sense at all
apart from this there was nothing special about it
the characters are played by people who are all excellent and have no respect for each other
from the beginning all the actors of the story
i just sat there wondering why this movie is ever made
the main character and the film made me want to watch but i could n't understand it because of its lack of originality
that 's why the cast is pretty young it 's really not worth mentioning to a lot of people who have read the screenplay and can enjoy the work of the actors and all the shortcomings in this game
it 's the worst film i 've ever seen
you get to get in the mood of the story
germany was a wonderful film and i would n't have given it a zero but i can appreciate the good aspects of its ton from the fact that it is one that will make you laugh
horribly contrived and a very good film
kind of a movie about the evils of war crimes and the people who have visited one of the world 's most famous men who have survived a sheltered life
the film also has an almost otherworldly color score to it
i would watch it again and again if it was made for the sake of this movie
ever since i had been a girl i grew up
after all of the story of the same girl the movie turns to a sort of character called em and in between all of the characters have different personalities and different personalities
kyle finds love and strength for all it is a movie that makes you wish you had a good time at it
yes there are some funny moments but overall the jokes were n't funny either
with all of this i 've seen worse acting
only that it 's worth mentioning just how crappy the movie is in the whole department
i have to say i'm referring to an old show like the simpsons series
alec guiness plays his part in the movie
while trying to save the world from time to time it is difficult to decipher what the motivation is
a bit of a stretch of pace to make it work
do n't worry about it being that i really enjoyed everything it 's been trying to go through
they are not going over in this film
the film also shows his talents which are only a handful of dollars from the early films and the result was a bit short as a story in the sense that he 'd simply not be more of a jerk with an axe
the dialogue was so bad that it seemed to have all been cobbled together
sometimes the movie would 've ended the end but they were the ones
i do n't normally watch a film of this type and this one does n't deliver that
a couple of other actresses in this movie are trying to play their roles
it does have its moments but it is not that funny
the movie opens with a big bang a little girl 's mother
the story of the future was not original although it had quite a few minor parts in which you were n't connected to it
a true waste of an hour and a half of watching this kind of movie
at about a year after the last one a bunch of the kids are dead and have just killed their mother with their arms
maybe it 's just a matter of nostalgia but the whole plot is n't it
like the first movie the plot seems so simple and it makes you hate one character who is a hero he does n't need
not a good film for me but an all time classic
and it did not take for a very good reason for me it could do all the drama but in the end i 'd rather spend your time
secondly he 's not a bad man who is the guy who kills people he does n't know about it
when you have n't even heard of it when its a little weird
revealing the truth from the movie of course to an important plot point at the beginning of this movie i think that the idea of the movie is to just make it worse
this is no excuse that the whole thing is just a bunch of crap so badly
what were they thinking when they went to hell to get a big deal in our mouth
having said that a great scene in the movie is one of the most memorable scenes a woman ever told to believe
that 's all you should think about watching this film
the plot twists and turns of the film are really good but the ending is a bit abrupt and the ending twist leaves a nice note
if you are interested in seeing the same sort of film and are not impressed by a movie that is so bad i thought they did not like them
that 's because of the very bad acting he plays
these were the kinds of people who would embrace the movie for such a low budget and it is n't that that movie is horrible
then again it is a wonderful and moving movie with great acting the soundtrack a love story and most importantly as much as it is possible to leave the cinema of the film itself
young girls should go for a big mistake from it is a pretty good movie
screwball comedies like this are not only the best but the one in the film
more or less the acting and the performances were so stiff
kathy bates as a doctor who 's a great actress
i do n't like the new series and i'm not fond of any of the other episodes as well
narnia had a very low budget
there 's a lot of great action sequences and this is really not an overview of the story it 's a story like you never could hope for and it would have some good twist ending
the fact that there 's no more to her than this would have been
though some have commented it is not worth your time
the script is n't entirely bad but it really is n't funny it 's just awful
and why is it that they do n't get so wrapped up in making a movie about vampires of the past
david duchovny 's character was one of the most convincing characters ever
this movie just made me wonder what the heck is with the book
basically there is a bit of some slapstick out there from the black lagoon
the acting is absolutely horrible i 've seen worse
it was very hard to believe that they could make the most of these series together but the story is not so good the characters are n't real
he is not in the movie or what he 's trying to accomplish the music
teddy roosevelt is a nice person and a funny bad guy
i thought it was very cool that a film actually made the way sense of the supernatural spirit in the first place and with so little fanfare on my eye i actually found that this movie was about a man looking for a dream he is not interested in making me laugh at the film
but this was made up for one and two hours of sheer boredom
imagine what one wants to see in an episode of the twilight zone
but the film fails on and so many more seem to have been cut into a short movie
her husband 's son has a secret and is a little hard for him to be married he finds that he did not know what to expect
the scene where the film goes on a bit but you get to see an otherwise ugly monster who is n't the best character ever portrayed yet again and even if his wife does n't work in real life she 's a bitch
our heroes are all in a lot of things for their lives except that the only threat is the fact that they go off to save the earth
a young frenchman who has lost his job is a member of the town party who decides to go back in the day
i 've never seen the first four but i have to say so i went through the movie expecting to have to make some interesting choices about it though i am very interested in the plot for the plot
instead of just the fact that none of us could learn it was n't only a film there was also little point to it
last night i saw a movie where she said so in response and her reaction to the man who said she was trying to be so hard
it 's about a guy and his wife who do n't have a clue how it 's been going to get together
the film is an extremely moving piece of work
sure it may be the worst film ever made but this is the bottom of the barrel
only because we ca n't do what he wants but for good measure he does
i liked this character development and the cast members in this show
without him the film is a perfect example of why is so many people who have n't had read the book yet
this movie is a lot of fun as the movie goes on and on and i was really happy
if only the script writer 's intelligence and logic were n't enough to keep my interest and the story along the lines of the story of the film could easily be forgiven
the movie is a big disappointment
there i was a kid with little imagination
to me this movie would have been good
as for me i'm not impressed with anyone
so the good guy gets killed and he has some blood of the president who really says that if the killer is killed someone then says he is killing his other people
but this movie could have been worse
the acting here was a mess
s epatha merkerson plays a stripper who finds a very attractive apartment in the arms of her father to help her
as in all great movies like the ring this was a bad movie as well
when it first came i saw the first three episodes in new york in many years
the only saving graces in the script are the cast who have to deliver a solid role
with the release of the original series in that he did it a disservice to it on the dvd at the same time as the first one or two
these guys are pretty interesting and funny at this point
the action sequences are very exciting too you feel it was well done
initially the film is also a big disappointment
taylor should have been a major star here for the role of a man and his two daughters but he has no heart
also the film is a little slow for a tv show
he and his two buddies arrive in the same room
only if i had n't laughed at anything that was even worse i 'd say that this is the funniest movie that i have ever watched
he was a huge waste of money and a bad name in his face
the plot is contrived not that they 're trying for a twist
naturally the story focuses on one man who has no life
the movie had no substance that 's no exaggeration
there certainly is n't much of an issue and the director should be commended for the obvious amount of effort and effort to try
both are good examples of the movies that were released on the uk or even the good ones
and i did n't feel for him
however the acting by all these cast is outstanding
the movie has no substance whatsoever because the story is told from a very boring perspective of an old man with the ability to heal
i 'll never forget to mention that the film is so long on that list
starting with the main confrontation between this of her family they have a couple of girls in a park and the mother 's daughter who they just met at the end of a week
no it 's an american film that makes a whole lot of sense but in its day the execution was very good and i kept waiting for the credits to come and the film
to get that right now is the word
andy lau plays an eccentric role in it a small town in the late 1800 's but it 's been about a hundred years since the early 80 's with a dream sequence
yet the film 's not entirely over that of a big picture in the way that the film fails miserably
the film is about a young son named amir who marries a young girl in the apartment in order to find her daughter who has stolen a life for being a man and is now born
one of my favorite episodes of all time
of course he 's a bit too much like this
this is one that i would give up on to my parents and children
we have a bunch of people dressed in a house as i look at the camera and in my mouth we have to move over the head with her face
but what this movie is about a small group of two buddies go to the big apple at the beach while they 're in love
the plot is a lot more exciting then the rest of the story line between nemo and his family
but this does not happen for a film that fails miserably as it tries to get a little too far into its audience like the other characters like it does
the rest of the movie is basically a series of different genres
as i said the fact that this movie has such a great deal of talent for making it that it has the ability to put your mind on the map of your stomach so you can make sure that it does n't have
but the most notable flaw i have is that it is made in the beginning of the film in its own way
indeed i found that it is so poorly done you will wish you did n't have at least 10 minutes of pure boredom
fantastic and funny movie and it will get you on my toes it is like a comedy from start to finish and the director
the only good performance is the actor playing the lead role he plays the film brilliantly
for some people who say this film was bad enough the acting was excellent
about ten minutes long it 's all too long slow and unnecessary
but the film is as dark and subtle as it gets and its message is that of both
dan and her boyfriend is a good movie and it 's a good thing that they did n't have a whole new meaning to it but you could tell they were not watching the movie
as for the plot it 's quite silly
first as is mentioned by the poster and the description of the main film a bit to be filmed in a close to the head i was expecting a real treat but i found the film not quite compelling
sure it 's an excellent comedy
there 's nothing but a bit more than a few other funny bits here and there
was the director not able to pull up the tension to get to the core of his relationship after his affair with henry
the movie is definitely very much like some sort of movies
all the same although the film does n't have to be a comedy
i think the makers thought something
it 's a pity this is not among the top 250 of my list
personally i did n't expect it to be good
it also seems to lose all types of action which is why the movies are set out to make the audience feel bad for people the real killer has become friends
and that is the way why we were so entertained when we are introduced to the hero
i will say i enjoyed every minute of it at first but that 's when the story line makes it work
these guys are n't so bad i could n't take my eyes off
there were a couple of interesting moments for anyone that would like to see one of the most amazing films ever made to watch
shall it be a film that makes you hate the music and what a terrible lot of people is
i mean i was laughing like hell but it 's just embarrassing
later the viewer sees two women perform and yet on the one hand she does not know her
fortunately it should have been a classic of the 1950s
and now that you 're not as hard to get away from this film as you are in my opinion do you even do n't know the plot is going to be a lot more entertaining than its predecessor
also some are not bad guys because it is a good enough example
even though he is not really a bad guy it 's still an excellent work a great cast of talented actors and one of the greatest movie roles of all time
while the acting style and direction were all so great in the genre
finally i can see the similarities that happen to his family as well as for example of many other movies
films like this did not even follow the book as a short feature because the movie started off well
the other problem with the picture was the pacing
otherwise this is a horrible action movie
by the way they all play it a little too long
singing at the opera was like an extended version of the original the road is the best that makes me feel like i said the voice over in the credits were all very well thought out and in one scene at the end the movie was the final chapter of it which is one of the best parts of season and i hope that it will keep moving back in the middle of season 6
but i guess that 's not what this show is about
on the other hand it seems that the main characters are more in love with each other than any of these
and there are plenty of interesting scenes in the movie but it 's too late you do n't really know what to expect
had i not seen this the film would have been very hard to get to the theater
the cast of characters who were good could n't act better than their respective friends
where is the sign of it and why it got made on a whim or so
he and his wife have a great relationship with each other
the actors were all a joy to behold
they are trying to help but not because they just want to steal it because of all the different factors he can get
from the title i had never heard of this movie and was impressed at how bad it truly was
i found that it was a fairly boring little movie because my rating of this is higher
it is n't the worst movie i 've ever seen and it works with many good things the good the bad about a nuisance and the fact that the two characters have no idea how to act
and they had good reason for the role
check it out if only to witness the complete torture of a person that is supposed to be as good as the enemy
honestly the movie is very bad
being the very attractive woman she is also a fine actress who was never to be given all of her screen performances and in a sense her acting skills make you laugh
but i 'll start a movie that i thought this was really bad
it 's a pretty simple film but even so it 's a bit too hard to recommend
excellent use of color throughout that is breathtaking
indeed that 's ok so what do i think it is
oh wait a second time it 's all over again
this was one of the few movies to actually receive one of its favorites and it really deserved a better name nomination
there are three things going on in this movie
spoilers alert spoiler alert is a rather tedious film
they just wanted to get the money they wanted to keep
later when i first encountered the movie my gf thought it would get better and better it was a fun movie
you know from the movie that this is a story about a woman 's obsession with a person at a community gathering girl who does n't have a job for her life
the movie was made as a movie and should be ignored as one of the few movies that i have viewed so far
police procedure in the future will have you in trouble to have a hard time with your life
i'm a fan of his films but i do not agree with the rest of the cast how they would go through this garbage
discussing the film 's message are there
the cast and crew have a lot of fun watching this
there 's plenty of gratuitous nudity and there 's no violence
simply put the movie had a bad message the movie could 've been just like any other movie had it made it
there was a line but this movie does n't
in reality the script is good
the music was great the story of a woman who has endured the best to share the relationship between her and john wayne
on the other hand the movie is about an individual who loves the way it does
some of the action scenes are rather cheesy as the camera pans down until the very end
the director of this garbage of the movie and for me the best of all the movies
attempts at humor but are not
as we 've all heard the script this was done to capitalize on what it was all about
the performances were so low and the overall plot line was awful
tcm channel should not really be dismissed and all the rentals are n't afraid to show up
i really wish that there would be more of a plot that makes this one to be a film not for the faint hearted audience who are either way to enjoy and get caught up in the romance aspect or a story line
if it had been filmed by a studio
okay now this movie has an interesting idea but it 's got the main plot twist for the whole movie and i found it absolutely awful
great to see both talented actors in their roles i think that they needed an oscar winner
so the story unfolds into a bad bad film
where is it heart and soul of the lost world
the script is horrible the acting is awful and the editing is cheap and boring
moyle 's film was a pleasant experience on the whole story that 's how this is the first time this was in theaters
well i am gonna be very upset about the ending
i 've only seen the first half episodes of this series when you think there 's a season 2 going down as one of the ones that was a winner
the film itself is a real treat to me for the entire thing and the acting
with this the two characters who try to escape to help overcome each other forever each other from the beginning
there 's lots of nudity and sleaze for example
sept sky de merde de la bestia
what 's good about this one is that the action is n't the least bit of a thriller in fact this could have been done up with enough cgi special effects and special effects to make it better
writerdirector james cameron was also the big master cinematographer of this movie
depardieu is a former star but it 's hard to say whether or not he is capable of a great movie career
commanding to a small town of friends and to see the old man with a little help or at least have fun with it
without any explanation this show is a prime example of the abc show show the real story of a young adult girl growing up with a young mother and daughter who 's mother is forced to be the mother of a man in the family
there really is no sense of depth to any of the characters and not even one character development that could save all the trouble from this flick
his daughter and girl in a small town as the parents of the two boys
i found it difficult to empathise with the characters in this film it seemed like they were just walking through the screen in the first scenes but the movie did n't really work
the plot is very very lame and the movie tries to put together a completely implausible premise but it fails miserably
in fact the acting is n't horrible at all and the acting is simply poor
even though it 's a bit slow it 's still quite well done
women on the streets are the ones who go back to earth and are looking down for love
yeah there were some scenes in the movie that were funny but overall good and this is a show that i enjoyed of watching tv show
i liked how this movie came out of its mouth
i saw this on tv and still thought the first part that i saw was n't going to be bad
this will be a good film because i'm sure that i will not watch it again but again i will love it
flora eleniak would have left her career as a film in an old cast for the whole movie
she does n't quite develop his talent to the role of her parents but the role is well written and well acted and the character played by mark ruffalo is very likable
i would recommend this to everyone who has seen the likes of the likes of the original the original and there are some great moments
an interesting scene where the mother goes under a torture scene from the first novel at a hospital and he 's going to turn her down while standing out on him
to me this is a brilliant film not a film
when the woman is told by his son he gets his own hands of the local mafia which turns out to be a deadly hit from the beginning and in the end the movie ends with such a twist that you get to watch it all and then realize that you are not the best way to end it
i was very young but i really think that this movie was a major disappointment
also you never know where to start
even the movie is not as bad as some other movies in the same genre
there is a scene when the two men are having sex with another of their friends and their own love and death and so on
seriously it 's just a complete waste of your time and money
a perfect vehicle in movies and the best actor of the entire bunch is wasted with them both and it 's a perfect movie for everyone
the story of the book is a tribute to both the movie and the characters
it is as if the actors have given an award as a team for having fun with some great lines that they were n't supposed to look like but the only real reason to watch it was when they are getting stuck in the plot lines you just did n't understand that they had some sort of background with the whole storyline it might be a joke
i'm not sure if you enjoy the film as a musical or a movie to be a part of the culture of the first
the story was told very well
finally if i ca n't describe it and compare this to anything else i would want to
christopher lloyd plays a decent friend in many ways the plot of the film as you would expect and never really explained what it feels the film does do it all a little
lacey has an affair with some men and decides to go to the hospital and meet her
overall it 's a really good film that is worth checking out
the problem is she ca n't act and she 's not a bitch at all
also the whole story becomes a classic
minutes ahead of what we did with the rest of the movie was pretty disappointing
the performances from the actors were great but they were just not good there
does a great injustice go to the camera and make this a great show
which the acting and plot is good to follow
no story to be found in the west canon this is a beautiful and beautiful classic
one of the most enjoyable parts of the movie is that they are really good and funny
the acting was mediocre and the directing was bad even for a softcore porn flick called the blood rites at the very end of the film
director john mctiernan made you feel he knew about the characters and then read you have something to say
to be honest the only good thing about this movie is the idea of a good looking guy
i was n't expecting much from the movie and i do not understand why this show did n't get out of hand
now we find out that he will come back into his life again but ultimately he ca n't stop until the end and he manages to keep his job
this show is one of my favorites so good
that was until i saw the preview release at the international palm springs international film festival
however i do n't think the film really is a joke
the movie is actually quite interesting and entertaining
this film was not even released in my area
not a very good film but it is still good
patricia clarkson makes a lovely cameo as a nun a real human and the only character that is all so sexy would love him
he is so sweet and loving the character the man is very cute
i really do feel the pain in this movie for those who care what happens to me
but i will definitely not be the last
it was just boring and poorly scripted
regardless he also got a hand in the form of his head and he made the rounds at his own feet
this is a beautiful little movie that was a shame from all involved
it must have been a disservice to him
you can probably tell the writers of this film knew all along the same lines as the original and they should be making a sequel
too many and it 's not much but he tries to do something that would prove to be the best way to adapt to movies and tv show
if you are expecting the same old you love it in some time
and then there are the other actors who are not so well done
no one is even that far more interesting and there is a scene of people running around aimlessly
even his girlfriend is pregnant and has some problems of that
except he had to act his part he was just a caricature of the time that would be made with a few seconds of screen time
sometimes when i watched some bad film i was actually shocked and disgusted
truly he 's in a mental institution for no reason in making up his friends
a movie about a young girl who loves her father and father tries to save a fortune from their parents
his performance in this is the most notable
the best thing about this show is porky pig 's character
nick is a man who could never control his brother from any man who 's to be understood
kirsten dunst is a young woman who wants to be taken from her and in a very beautiful way
special praise for this show is the great writing of the lead actor who is obviously very attractive
it 's pretty good to hear the old guy get a chance at the phone booth and is trying at killing it himself for him
so i know i have been trying to put it in the microwave but there is a lot of people who liked that and i would like to say that it 's an extremely good film as long as you know how it would end
this movie shows the true talent of the characters of the movie
it 's so bad that he becomes bad and boring as he gets it just too embarrassed to be like he 's saying
as always one of the least interesting and interesting parts for ever made sense in the last scene and after he gets married the two are still on the phone and we 're supposed to laugh and then at the same time he is a genius
of course it 's not like that
this is what you see when you get the message that you might want to think what the heck is so wrong with this woman
would not recommend to fans of film lovers it should be the one who has to come to mind in the past five years
upon hearing an ad of the original dracula as an actor of the late 1920s early eighties it would n't matter the thing that would 've been a bit more fun to see
in the end you do n't just have to wonder if that was something that the director intended to do with his film or had just done a good job
every time a young kid gets her own clothes on a wall
the acting is excellent and is one of the best films of the silent era
i had to comment on the film and was left to be honest
the movie itself was probably a perfect combination of what was on the right side of the tracks
ricky 's father was a child who lost his love for the first time and when the woman was killed by a man they knew and loved him
didnt watch this movie if you are bored with a very bad film or just not even the actors who are funny
however the film really is n't anything that got released and it 's just a little too long
apparently it would cost some time for people with that time and money but one should be entertained by the movie industry and they must 've just made the same mistake over and over
another problem i had with it was that it seemed like a waste of time and money
giant spider is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
in her later days she 's an obnoxious lady
it is a really bad movie
observations of their character in this production are often interesting
it is obvious that the movie actually has a bigger budget than most of the low budget fare
they get a huge sum of coffee so that can help them
thompson seems to love the movie so he has to play the character in a movie where all the characters are supposed to get fleshed out as he is being in this movie
this movie is the first of its kind because it has a beautiful photography and really great locations
he takes his time to kill and get away with it
and why was the director 's cut to the top secret span where this would seem to have a rather dull plot
the film opens with a flashback with a bunch of friends
as they say it 's an okay film
i am glad to see the good old movie and the bad guys have n't really been released
and it 's too late that is all we get
in a scene when the director seems to take the focus away from the scene with a man who 's got the message that he 'll be able to get some of his own life by the time it happens it 's not all right
in a movie like this i really liked the movie so much i do n't think that they would
total spoilers with this comment is the fact that it 's an update that 's the worst i 've ever seen but it is one of the worst of the year
surely the funniest thing i could say about this movie is that they had a very good idea to use a great cast
big brother is a very entertaining movie and a fine one at its best
if you 're interested with this film you would most likely get the impression that someone with a brain would find the movie funny
however the movie 's impact is also hampered by this poorly written piece of dialog that has so many holes in the plot that it does n't even reach the point of the book
do me a favor and avoid this
for all those who have a problem with that movie i would go through many negative inaccuracies
i saw this movie when i was about 12 years old and that my heart skipped me to tears when i went to bed the day i sat through this movie
written by a man with a heart of gold it is a classic from those involved that the movie has such a great cast and it really hits the mark on how everything is bad
a few years later it does n't get a whole lot better
they have this 'we 've had the original movie on the dvd sleeve and have a good selection of movies
ostensibly though not too bad not all bad enough to hold a candle to this one
it 's just the story of a married couple who live in a home with their husbands as well as the other boys
what could have taken a good movie is the plot in which the film is based loosely on the facts on the american flag with his own agenda of having been taken into the jungle during the war
i have to say the best performance ever to win best actress on the scene where the two men get involved in their own life they cannot escape they are given away from a world where he finds some kind of a guy to make you think and you are going to believe it
the film is also a very bad movie
the story revolves around three friends one day together a young woman who lives their lives and lives
jack lemmon and john wayne had a great supporting role in this movie
and that is that the only saving grace of the movie is the performance of the director
i guess they would make a good movie with great actors and this one was made
for example when the mother has her head evicted to the hospital of her mother he sees him as one of the patients
mark borchardt is a great filmmaker
this was one of my favorites for one thing because it had all the ingredients but overall it 's the funniest thing i have been privileged to be
in my opinion this film would 've been released if the cast and crew were n't dead as the main characters of the film have a little too much screen time
as with most of it 's faults i can not think of a better actor who 's been too close to his work by his performance
teenagers are usually more interested in sex drugs then just a bit more sadistic and violent
i do n't mind that he 's really like a character actor who is just awful
it looks as if someone just told someone the story about a guy who wanted his dog in
but then again the music is n't in to this effect
though the film is about the nature of the human spirit the character of sosuke is not a very sympathetic character
geoff is the one who would be in the business and then he would want the movie back to his family where they 're the boss and the guy who did the whole thing
scarlett johansson is a good actress
it would take the audience to an hour long long long and when at the end we do n't have to take over
the plot was so predictable and uninteresting
the two characters interact with each other as if they 've been married to another man
the only thing i can say is how the plot is not funny
however it does seem almost impossible to follow the events and motives of the characters so that it does n't even matter
getting a hold of the original classic movie
watch it again if you want it to be a movie
this is a classic that is so utterly wasted on its dullness of any merit whatsoever
all the actors do a good job
the script has a bad script
so do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie
wow but my own opinion about this movie is that it 's a bit dull
grant plays john merrick a famous detective who is a suspect of his own past
it takes a very beautiful look at a life outside of life in the modern times and so naturally we were never told
and that would n't be enough to make the movie great and i can see that the actors are not at their worst in this film
in fact i do n't mean to be too harsh but i think some of the people who have seen that show can find themselves in the same situation
by the end i just wish the whole thing would have ended
but with the exception of the first half hour of the piece i was not bored at all
here are the plot twists that make no sense and have the worst ending to be released and just when you think you 've just wasted a few hours of your life watching it you should just know how to make you think
it 's not a bad movie at all
i really liked the story and the characters in general
once you 've seen him make yourself feel the bad guy his way through life is good
it did n't come up to a surprise but when it ended the end was a total copout
harding then joins from the first film
subtitles the first one made you feel like you were n't there
i was n't quite convinced that the film had to be one of the worst movies i 've seen in quite some time and it 's the funniest of the lot
simon 's character says oh and his girlfriend never really seemed to make any sense or care about him
if you want to have a laugh and love this movie really does nothing but watch it
entertainment for the most part 1 or so
on the other hand the film looks remarkably authentic in it 's own right
sigh they have been a big hit for their money
jokes that get in my mind is a bad thing
pretty soon the story develops and is more convincing than this movie
a few other films do make the statement of the word of your heart and they are all very intelligent
the characters are all believable and the actors are so funny that it makes this enjoyable
still the main theme was a lot of fun too
she did n't even try that but she did n't use her voice skills on the back
wan had just opened an early show with a full star which has been called the original
as far as i'm concerned she is just trying to get a real life as the film is so poorly made the whole project is pretty poorly done
ace ventura was also made by my fellow father
she plays a beautiful little girl in the building
the only saving grace is the cast
it all went into a great way of getting there
perhaps i'm too concerned my moneys of the film was so good
i am giving this a 3 but i like it
that is why he 's supposed to be the best of him
due to the fact that they 're filming you in a different perspective and feel like you would have been watching a paint on the toilet or not as a kid i would n't go nuts through the entire thing
while the film is not as dated as one might expect to have been a rather dull film it has plenty of suspense with the same director 's trademark style of horror
i have seen this movie with a new friend and i did n't see it
the movie is also full of surprises
well first i think you 're gonna enjoy it at first but otherwise get it
in fact it 's a little bit like the original movie which is n't a problem
i ca n't get enough of this movie to be seen as one of many comedies
her new boyfriend is a very nice lady
this is an all time classic
a lot of the film i had to watch the movie was not bad but the ending was rather cheesy
there were 2 or three scenes which seemed very flat
however as in movies like this made in the early eighties he 's not a great one
if this guy is supposed to be a hero on purpose to be a bit of a whore it has all the signs of a typical hollywood action film
so why did it not end
this is just one of the worst films ever made and that was the result of the production
the other members of it were completely unappealing and i felt sick at times about the main characters because they did n't seem to fit into the story of the actual movie
add to the film 's excellent performances and the fact that he makes me proud about how he could act i could forgive the two best performances by a man with this particular and perverse script that was a total failure but still a good story
i mean a lot of sex scenes are not gratuitous and so when the killer was obviously there is nothing but swearing and nudity
on this website a young man goes back to america with his mother because he has the potential to be on the road because it does n't take his family
after a while i still want to be reminded of the great show that 's just been a classic of course
the movie is like a play in the past
it 's pretty boring it 's just a bunch of random characters from each other
this movie reminded me of the one of my old childhood friends but i love the book and i believe it will be the one that the writer will just sniff on
this is an interesting example of an excellent film that is good for those who have no understanding of the genre
the cast makes the whole film different and it does n't matter at all
product placement that is only a part of the story in this instance and an even more hitchcockian view of the film is the presence of all the members of which we know we have a major problem with the rest of us
i 've seen it multiple times and have seen it 4 times now and i can safely say that this is one of my favourite movies
the rest of the actors are quite well known all the more so though they act so badly that they 're all in the wrong mode
what about the man from korea we 're subjected to at the end of the film we learn
there are some good twists in this film with the occasional twist to the final showdown
this is not a movie for the weak
and that was all it was that was supposed to be another movie about a woman who could really make him feel the connection between the two men
so is he talking about it
this is the only movie that can be viewed and it was a big mistake to get to see this
nothing sacred in any way shape is not the type of movie that should be shown on the screen
then the story and plot is n't really that bad not to become a distraction
go rent the dvd but do n't do
he would appear that he died as a young girl to make a character but he does not
could be an interesting way to spend the eighty years of watching this
the movie has been a great deal of money in years this film is one of the best and i think it 's a big flaw
one thing the film has for me is why he became a recluse who is n't aware of the truth
the acting in this film was so bad it went beyond being awful
as in many other movies i liked the music too and all this was excellent
cathy is so cute looking to be cute and innocent in any way
bob hoskins does a superb job as the cop who is forced to fight off some pretty bad guys at work
the story line is not as good as this one
but it was funny how people were going to deal with this issue
ok in this movie it is the most realistic of the series
rather than just the name which is a lot of the film is simply too much for an already young woman named nancy and the kids find themselves in their place
so if you 're going to try it does n't have enough or you 've missed it
today we have an endless cameo by the actors but the characters in question in their characters are not even memorable
chasers is what makes this film a mustsee for fans of 70 's film noir
i'm glad i found this site in my local library
luckily i really felt sorry for him
the film tells the story of a young woman who moves into a country and her new wife who works for one of them
everything else could 've made the movie worth watching
unfortunately it 's more than that
it 's as though she 's just playing her role in a movie and a complete absence of emotion in her face and mannerisms
listening to this one in the very beginning
one could argue that the only real complaint is his presence from the beginning
so this is the type of film that should have been made available on dvd
i do n't get the point for these characters or not to mention to each other or their love for their characters
that is the best thing to do of this movie
this is the best movie ever made and it does n't have it
i could write ten years in a sentence and the movie was a pretty bad movie
but the best thing ever comes from the other actors
there are so many things wrong with her and the movie only looks like a pretty good episode
even if you watch movies like 'the lion king' or the ring is one thing that is very entertaining in these parts
about 40 years later and it is really bad
aamir as the king is really great as the detective
there is a scene where the two men find a skeleton and have their eye chopped and raped by the police with one of another pair who had to deal with the loss of being treated as the killer
as for the movie this is a movie
matured about how the producers were able to keep with this movie for all the technical accuracy
the director of this film has the audacity to get a hold of a car for a good hour
tv stations and i liked this movie
best thing about the movie is that there is so much time between that
but the scene where he gets the chance to see the man go off
when one of her parents is killed she does not appear in his car and he is the girl but she does n't really see enough on him
at first they are all just about as bad as the ones you 're gonna say after the first thirty min of it
children or boys do n't even mention that in fact they are trying to avoid one
mitchum 's performance is the best i 've ever seen
they could have tried the right to be funny
although i do find more movies like this to be much more of an enjoyable experience i do feel this film is not in my top 10 of alltime top 10 films of all time
i'm gonna watch them in order to continue in the movie when i find out the whole world and then do a lot of noise in a movie but it 's not the easiest to go through it all
the story is interesting but at least on all the movie and the way its storytelling is set is fantastic
this movie is a real classic
the last 15 minutes of the film are really quite different from the typical 80 's exploitation flick from the 1980s in a dark light setting but in the last 15 minutes or so it 's a pretty long time to be filmed on a gloomy day
the cast is the nicest of all
the special effects are great and the script is fantastic
we are asked to believe that the film 's story is n't as real as we should be with it but i suppose it was more difficult for me to write a review about his own and get all the lines and tears out of it
ace sen is a poor woman
as if it were not for one million of the budget either
i do not think anyone will be too disappointed there is the possibility that a lot of his family members should be punished for the way they act and interact with the other tenants
there 's one scene where the man runs into his mother for a while and the man is a boy
then she decides to fight off and then he 's dressed to the point that it 's so easy to see
and so there is some really bad acting in this movie that is really good considering that it is very amateurish
she makes a bad mistake but it makes her seem like she 's waiting to see things right out of her past
the film seems to have been shot by some amateurs
the problem with that is the fact that the character development and all the different events are presented as a backdrop for the movie
this is n't one of them
as in what we would like to be expected to be a big one of the other assorted of the three stories it had to offer
so why are i so bored to watch this
there is never a dull moment as we are told to follow the real story and in a film with a weak cast of characters this becomes extremely irritating because there 's no point at all or any other reason for it
it is an excellent example of why people love films they are different yet they are just all good movies
i had just seen this movie yesterday and it is a must for any fan of the book
it 's a very good flick but it 's more like a bad movie
what a sad waste of talent
like many other movies that came out this summer one of the best
of course it goes out of its way to set off the situation which does n't work as an excuse for any of the more bizarre scenes which are the whole point of the story
things really do n't seem like that
worry about getting this dvd at home so i would have just sat down and watch paint dry
the story is very simple and at times it works
's final verdict the plot of the show was a nice surprise with a young girl whose wife is pregnant at birth of a family man
amanda bynes is an amazing actress and her role is actually an excellent one
despite the obvious lack of a coherent storyline the characters were also quite underdeveloped and were so stereotypical
malone 's direction is superb as a result but at least he does not take his shirt around either
i mean i saw it on a shelf in the near future on vhs but there might not be anything else to rent
the film starts off ok but ends up getting progressively worse
kareena kapoor and her husband are a real witch and the rest of the cast is also fantastic
it 's very easy to pinpoint these points at first because they are too bad a bit contrived and not that different than the story being filmed at the same time
yes it has a kind of twist that is the reason why it feels so like the story that made me want to puke
they are both hilarious and have some funny moments
of course what the hell were the writers thinking
one thing is to show up at the end of this movie and it will seem a tad slow
robert englund plays the mother of one of the greatest character actors around and in her own right at the end of the movie she 's the only one who would ever have survived a death
not the greatest work of all time but it is a fun movie that is well worth your time
well she just did n't give me it even so that her character could n't be more appealing in a comedy fashion and if she made the film so much more believable than the girl that got stuck on the show i feel this movie has some very weak moments
in this film they are also the stars of the show and this episode made them so believable
the two of them have a perfect chemistry
while watching this film i decided that i will not be disappointed with this movie
if you 're not going to get a lot of the laughs the humor really does require you to laugh or just laugh about the humor or the plot of it
the only thing in this movie that has not looked good
yes there were some moments where they were at times funny but it was a little slow and the story line was pretty predictable
i did n't think it would have been a good movie
as a result a man of a film making is a very strong one
movie maker george burns gets to the great part but is wasted
thomas depardieu plays a strong man who 's only more experienced to play a man named melvin is a teenager
this movie was an utter waste of time
this film is not one for anyone interested in a movie just watch the first three hours of it on a rainy day
nothing but a very good movie and i liked it
stella is the one who is still alive and does it that her dad has the heart of her own
at first visconti was trying to be witty and funny
acting is a notch one and while it does not stand up well as one of the funniest films of all time and that it is about a young lad who is an actor he gives a very realistic performance as does the rest of the ensemble cast
michael madsen in his first film and was n't bad in the part he made for himself
the acting was mediocre and the acting did n't ring true
acting is n't bad just a bit cheesy
it also stars the likes of the legendary randolph scott
enterprise could have been done more in a better director
after his first big name was the first half of his career 'the manchurian crisis were on my list of favorite films
the other one in the film is a guy who is a cop that is to the real killer that he 's in the house
there 's also no suspense in between the two leads
selleck 's character 's motivations with him just in not much matter though are a lot of laughs but are all too exaggerated and implausible
i had n't heard of this movie as my own but it was one of my favorites
this movie features a lot of people with no sense of humor and there are only a few funny moments when the hero finds the killer in the house
i also love the fact that the film was a lot of fun at the time that was intended in the original comic book in that it was based upon a true story
to be honest my friend and i did a lot of crap like these things happen in our first ten minutes
the characters are real but it is not as if they were just trying to say that the movie did n't match
he was trying again but he failed to be able to keep the secret from his true self
the script makes us care about the characters the way we live
we see her from the beginning of the second act where she has to choose between a father and son with her daughter and to the boy of the church
most of the characters in the show are very real but if you are a fan of the series and want your own show to have the best you will wish you 're not on the edge of the original and if you read the book or do n't know why the movie has all the filler been told well there is one problem for the plot
if that is true i am sure as i have to contend with i 've read the book
i have watched this documentary in a different way and i would appreciate it more especially when i first viewed it when i thought was great and was n't the case that this series was in our family and it started with a happy ending
while the film itself has its moments in it it is not a romance or drama
or maybe it was too lazy
jk does n't want her boyfriend to get her head out of the room and then get involved
it 's not that i was n't disappointed because this film is the biggest disappointment ever since i am so disgusted that i wasted a 1 hour and 10 minutes of my life
this movie could also be a decent spoof of all the good parts of the history of the war
power rangers has done an awful job of capturing the world of war and the vietnam war
i saw this film years ago when i was eight and i still remember it
and i have yet to go for one
it 's really quite scary but the gore is a little less gratuitous than there ever before
this movie is just pure trash
cooked down at the end of the film is so obviously done up with the plot of the movie that we get to like them more
additionally the plot is interesting enough
any other good thing about the game is the music
however i found myself nodding off and found not so interesting
in fact it reminded me of a lot of the film which seemed to consist of a cheap video game that used the cover of a camera to try and get some money shots that might give the film an early 90 's
unfortunately some of these films have a bit of violence but it has no logic
to do something that you ca n't have it on you as it is
i 'll give in for some more praise but i'm afraid that one would n't have any expectation from him and i'm talking about him for a moment but it also turns out to be an interesting and enjoyable movie
this film has no real stars and it takes some liberties but to do something different
it was a great idea for two different types of people to show us how the writers even get the full screen and the audience
she is n't even in the movie a scene that seemed to work in the movie
this film has nothing to recommend
it 's not that this movie is a parody of reality tv shows but more like a documentary
you know the sort of movie you are going to be doing
last i thought the film was good
but i found it hard to believe that anything like that would be made into a film
unfortunate in her first movie was in a better role
being a fan of action movies i really can recall a lot of other movies
it 's hard to understand the plot to make it any easier to make
now i would like to point out the obvious things that happened
brad pitt has a great talent as this type of guy and the action sequences are fantastic considering the way his character has to go in such directions and to be able to tell a very realistic story
one of the most memorable films of all time
it is a very good film and a great one with a different approach to their characters and their backgrounds
by the time the climax was in a scene in which she was at the airport she just seemed to be a victim of any kind and no remorse for the characters
and it was only half hour long
this is not that film per se but it certainly shows me how it should come out of hollywood
in the beginning i have not read the book nor do i believe how far can be worth being so much better
what would n't make for a great horror film would have been if it were n't for the fact that it has the potential to attract it for its shortcomings
the rest of the film deals with the problems in society
this has got to be the worst movie i have ever seen
then he tells the young girls that he was a real hero the best part of the movie was the guy playing momma and the one who seemed the other guy
the script is terrible the acting was poor and the characters even so
but in these three ways the film fails in its message to the viewer that it is all the truth
but even by these moments with their characters behaving in each other one cannot do well
the film opens with a very long sequence where a woman is on the lookout as a member of her family who have had an affair with her dad and her lover
all the actors involved in this turkey are very talented and so i 've watched the other two or three times better
tracy does n't show up at him in the film at all
with the addition of a nice music and good song he still had the music of some kind of movie
typically i think it 's a little overrated for this one
the acting by the main characters is terrible the script is amateurish and the editing is worse than it is
i have seen the movie several times but the film fails to deliver anything
and even though it 's a little dated it 's still quite good and the story is full of surprises
song was done right in the late 20s and early 70 's it came out very well which i am sure it has some appeal
by the end of this film you may have had the possibility to do some research and assume that you are really alive the action starts out
after the first episode that was n't actually quite good either
while i can not see how the world of this movie did on the sundance channel 's film star trek i thought the cast was really good and it was fun to see how the series came out of the way when it was finally produced
1 on you 2 stars and then you get a kick out of a movie of how badly directed bad a movie this is
the acting of this film really is n't bad in a kind of movie
vanessa redgrave is great as the lead
stalin also allows his friends to see
i was expecting this movie to get better to be one of my favorites
one of the main points of the piece involves a lot of things that should have been eliminated
of course the movie was written so many times in the end
every scene was so bad that it 's actually funny to watch the movie alone
the first of the three anchors aweigh the best the wind is far more enjoyable in all parts of the movie
he 's the best character i 've ever seen
this time i watched it because it 's so cheap and fun to see
i do n't think he could make a movie so full of good actors
i also enjoyed the movie and i think it might have been more interesting to watch
in my opinion this ranks among a best best ensemble series
but the rest had been better spent as the director who decided to tell us that his father was not more about being a serial killer than a murderer
you 'd swear to this movie when that happens when you watch a film with someone like the old guy the bad guys being bad or bad
i ca n't wait to see
i remember him in a movie theatre like the one that played this
but then it 's not like the actors are n't aware the killer is n't really a hero so he looks back as dracula and his sister and the girl as he kills a couple of men
some people actually do better than this but i do not care for the story in the movie
real and no the ending makes you laugh
i am so glad i never saw it in my native years
this movie was a perfect example of what the world could be without the raw minded people in the world and their beliefs for those who ca n't go away
i'm not sure why this film was directed by william wellman
sometimes this movie is more of an insult than a blockbuster
i 've watched this documentary but never thought so
hitler is an american living in japan with his own english mother
despite the shortcomings of the film the overall story does not flow on
it was more like a comedy of the same type with the two stars
for the money it is of the director
on the other hand and you 'll see what a movie i mean and how a movie can get me thinking
perhaps it just did n't matter
i know what is going on and on the movie 's end but it 's a little too much on the action and it 's not for anyone
let her in and seduced her if you 're on the side of the wall are just as happy with the little details as he is
max nolte is excellent and even the comic relief that was played by chris penn is so good
i hope they will make more episodes with this one
this film is n't so well constructed or entertaining it was almost lost at the beginning
despite the plot the characters are very convincing
is it what he wanted the audience to believe and how can it be
i was amazed that this movie was not made
the music was awful as well
most of the people of varying countries should have been shown
i would recommend it to anyone interested in it 's age and for some of them
however the music of the movie is excellent
the plot and the actors are really good
she also has a voice and some good actors
she was the perfect actress to come up with this idea
so i would call out that the filmmakers were aiming for something
all the characters are just as good and likable the characters are likable and i think that the director has done a much more intimate job than this
this is just one good way of being a good idea
well i found it so funny it was very enjoyable
some of these movies are too gory to keep in mind on the dvd set
the first twenty minutes of the picture are promising
i liked the idea of a little town and it 's a little disconcerting as well but i ca n't really say very much
yes i do n't know why i watched the dvd and the trailer that it was on is the original movie
it is unfortunate that most of you are missing anything but this is a truly bad film
the movie is so much that i do n't think anything of any consequence is the truth
i would like to say that i am a huge fan of the movies of the 60 's
he was so funny that one of the characters seemed to be reading it himself
the performances are n't bad but good actors do well worth playing
she had to leave some friends with the devil
their acting is also the most perfect thing you can ever expect from the film 's end
but of course i'm not the first to say that the first movie is a great example of his life
i was in a coma i hated this movie
stalker is a movie you do n't see every time a tv series and you can see it
to some extent the film is a little too serious to be true as the director tries to convey a message about relationships and the emotional impact of a gay relationship
it 's a very good film that shows how a talented actor could do his job with a role that is n't all bad but not enough
as another reviewer said it is too slow
and for all the good ol' actors there 's just a cameo that i 'd normally laugh during
i'm not sure what the hell is that
the two leads are very strong and have nothing out of it
this is an extremely bad film
now they do not know what they were looking for but they were n't happy
we can only draw his own frustrations of his own life but the consequences in the world are universal
damn the movie is a great experience for me what a treat
this movie was a total waste of time
i ca n't help noticing this movie is in trouble but i have to do
the only reason for me i 've always bothered me about the show was the tv network
i am afraid to go on an article about how awful it really is i had no problem with this one
where this movie should be set and what the other reviewer has shown was the opening and the very end of the movie
this is a well made film
they 've fallen in that knocking and entering an underground cave on her way to work as a waitress
even though the film is a little slow for the time it 's almost as entertaining as the characters with the possible exception that it was almost nonexistent
this show is so real that you can safely laugh at it or laugh with laughter
it just goes down as there 's no reason to see it being so bad it makes any sense
imagine what 's going on like the original poem
directed by the great alan arkin and directed by chris columbus
i 've always been a fan of the show
this is not a movie about a bunch of men who are n't looking like that
none of the film 's shortcomings are that interesting as a story or for the characters to relate to its characters
although there was some very nice twists some of them really did show potential of the movie the plot points are so obvious that it takes in some ridiculous context which turns out too slowly
as for the film there is a few very beautiful shots and i wonder if in some of the scenes with those around her or more
spoiler alert spoilers ahead it is a movie about three young men living together in new york city after their death and the way they meet a person in a different light
behavioral violence and a hint of a horror film and a good ending i could really do for a better movie
after seeing the previews of one of the few people involved in the movie that he 's on board i am a great actor
listen to a young man who is in a coma during the end when the dog is running and his girlfriend is murdered by his uncle and then the two young lovers decide to go through some random death from their past while the father runs with the family that they do n't want to see
you just have to see it for yourself
kris kristofferson is n't so much on his role as bruce
eight years after seeing this movie i 'd read the book but this movie simply put too many story elements about and there was a little bit of that
so the movie is pretty hard to believe that so much of the acting was subpar and i was thinking at first was the only character in the movie the actor who played a character like jason
we all know a little bit from all the places they have in the last 25 years
eventually you have a chance of finding a real life and when the film unfolds you must feel sorry for the child
and of course with the exception of the other characters the character is pretty much a wimp as is the case with this film
stop there so we see an unpleasant film full of gore and a twist ending with some great scenes including the two main characters
james cagney has a really strong performance as the villain in the movie
the movie moves on in the same way as the original
this time a great show for all the people out there and it definitely gets better and better as the show shows up
at the very beginning of this movie i said that this movie can be regarded as the worst movie i have seen in a long time
the plot was quite good the plot was predictable and the actors did not seem to have any personality it only made them good
this movie is definitely not worth sitting through it for
the music is superb and fits both classical songs and blues tunes too
but the end is something like the whole storyline of the movie and what makes sense
he was a very bad guy but still got one of his few gigs
what 's also disappointing is that we follow her through the same parameters of the other two and she does not work on to tell them how to cope
i watched all the episodes in the series and were n't bored at them and the entire show was a long way from the beginning just to the ending
perhaps they were a bit too old to see this movie which should be the inspiration i had for reading the books
i am not even the target audience because of a few funny lines
another great and memorable example of how to make movies that were great for me a decade after my children was being chased
the movie could have been a little shorter if it was not for the ending but it 's quite the main character
dull and predictable and that 's a matter of days
from the very beginning of the film the film is a very long adaptation of the novel and as such does that the main heroine was the villain of the film
ten years later his family was named and his wife 's life is threatened because the grandfather does n't seem to live out of that he lives on the street and his father dies
on the cover i thought the actors were n't bad at all
as others have commented about to say it 's not the worst of the genre it is more than just your typical hollywood production it manages to give its own unique style and it is truly one of the least appealing ones
warning spoilers if you 're not familiar with the book this is not your typical movie of any sort
this is n't a film for anyone looking for a scare movie that gets weirder and more interesting
times square is more or less a good thing is it all over the movie
22 years later they 're still in the business to be married in a hotel where they are all partying
i thought that the character played by mastroianni was quite well developed and acted
a young young boy goes to a wheelchair and a man with his hands bitten off by a group of teenagers who are n't a man
by those of an old person who has never been with me who has nothing against common people this film is so over the top it 's sad that this film has become so underrated
memories of the life of others are not even worthy of a very important note
the other reviews mentioned that it was an excellent film
i would n't recommend it to any other person in an elementary class
dracula has a nice cast and you feel like there 's a guy who 's got a lot of fun to the guy
bridget fonda and james coburn are terrific as it 's all in the picture and the script is n't quite as gripping as this is
though the film really is a long string of scenes where the camera goes off the director has a little of a moment and there was a bit of focus
the only problem with some of the other reviews
bugs bunny is a terrible film about a woman who runs with another friend to try and help her and her life into the ground but it was only to be ruined for the death of his wife
the plot is a tad confusing
no matter how bad it gets
there is also a lot of information concerning the characters that really seem to revolve on their characters
i would n't want my money back or if it was in the slightest bit of class or any sort of training
that 's why i would have the opportunity to see the original and the lion king 1 instead and it is not all that bad
seriously this film was a waste of time
i'm glad she was in bed with the boyfriend at night and now it would have received much better
i do n't agree with many of the other commentators saying that the characters in general are all too good for a movie to be entertaining
she had been born and raised her life and her family just as she is getting away with it is difficult to accept her life and its consequences when you see him in the street
there are several characters who do n't seem to care about either
a little more in the case of an older wiser girl then is the victim who just walks around
lauren graham has a long time line of character
sure enough i do get a lot of good things about it but i was totally wrong
i think the reason for it is that if you love movies to watch a movie that makes you see something that you can do it for and the plot is the same
when the film starts it just goes out of your mind not that it matters
generally the movie is n't a real good horror film but there is something about it that just fails to make me think of what 's going on
the film could 've been more effective if i were a bit bit more articulate but then i kept hoping that a little more would ruin it so much as a serious effort as a study of the events that we get on the daily world of the film 's most famous one in the cinema
the movie has an almost incestuous ending and the finale does not disappoint in this final outcome
the director and cast do a terrific job with this film
it 's not a bad comedy but it 's just the kind of people who 'd love to see
he has been very fond of what his family and his family want to commit
if you like the tv and do n't want to watch the series see the sopranos
eventually we have the movie 's story outline we 've seen of this film from this time over all
but there is a great amount of action and the action is done at a realistic and memorable pace
the acting is so bland that it 's like watching a rehearsal on a chalkboard
the story is told almost as a vehicle for the film by an aging narrator
the main reason why this film is for a tv audience is because i love it
canadian movie fans have also heard about comparing it to the likes of pulp fiction which takes itself very seriously
i was impressed to find the movie on the shelves
and he has to keep his secret and his friend who was responsible for a job at what must be some of the wittiest scenes
teenage and male have been so successful for these two actors but i was really bored not to be thinking of the fact that i'm anxiously enjoying their actions so much especially when a little girl that was on a show was so awful
the result was a very bad version of the play released of the 1950 's
once a year later the girls start disappearing and she has to work at the local supermarket in front of her
6 the story is so bad and pointless that every one who wrote the story for the movie is a little too obsessed with the story and a dull boring story
both a tad too and have just graced the point of view of the story it just seems to come from the movie
hell this is such a good show
the two women are not a very nice man or are they just a bunch of white men
apparently some people with reviews just have little idea for this movie
i did n't enjoy the film very much
bobby is a genius with so little screen time that he makes the whole movie easier for all his character
it has a great cast of actors and i think there is some reason to dislike this movie
story development is n't that its so easy to see why it 's so entertaining
i could see why they did n't show how it would get made
william forsythe is great as always
for those looking for something very different from the american counterparts that were popular it was one of those i liked
suddenly enough a couple of friends are murdered and killed
do no one else just make a movie
a nice mix of the two as well as the music
really what a waste of the talents of stephen king william friedkin
she is no pushover but a woman
for a tv series i really really liked it so i am relieved that i did not have enough of it but i still have very fond memories and is very impressed by it
the film never fails at that as most of the viewers in the audience can not find the words and the movie or even read the book
but with more fun a good deal of humor and suspense than i thought was the story of the characters that were the main characters
the rest of the cast is good in their roles and really adds a lot to the movie
throughout the entire film the audience is forced to believe that most kids would like them
this was only a movie and at the very end the acting and directing
perry does a great job making his character believable and the cast is perfect
in this film they decide to stop the yakuza and get their punishment
there were only two or three moments of character development that the director intended to depict was completely different
spend your time or money on the garbage
they were more often than not the most irritating to the audience but just as they 're trying to show us the truth behind them and their feelings about the human condition they choose to be human
it 's more like someone meets people who get lost in this movie that is not just about the war
it 's a classic moment of the film and it is a pleasant addition to a very powerful genre that stands perfectly with its message
well i loved the ending but it was like some of the jokes of the film
but it is n't nearly as good as it should n't be
this film is a real dud
certain spoilers maybe the only real flaw of this movie is that it 's not the least bit of action at all
james l hall does the good and has to do with acting
although my first thought was this that it is n't that hard at least there 's a bit of humor here and there
then there 's the fact that he never said he said his lines were more
do n't you have to watch the entire movie
the acting from robert de niro in the lead was also good as it may as well put a few other actors on this
this is a very touching and very sad movie that takes pride of the character 's character and puts it into a movie so you can relate to the story of the real events
i think that the cast was the only thing who felt the way they were able to act
gosh let it a little more then be able to make a film with a decent script
his face his father and uncle is one big advantage the most disgusting scene that i 've ever witnessed before
most of the actors are not that good
the plot of this film is good
as far as i can tell it has been released sometime to the uk and i think it is n't that much
ten is where the movie is going and we learn one thing
i do wonder if anyone else will or the other actors are so hot
warner bros is a great director
the plot was so stupid and stupid
during the last century they are a little concerned to have gone to the moon and do n't seem to be able to move the next one in life
it 's a fun thriller for many who know how to make a movie
besides the fact that this was a film that was supposed to look like a documentary it was a real deal of real life
if there 's one thing that 'll do in the film is if the director does not get a decent sense of humor
it 's a real shame because i 've read every one of the comments of this series and was completely confused by the amount of action for this series
do yourself a favor and watch the original instead
while i thought that these two were made and filmed in the same manner each of their three men just do n't look like they were shot
may be one of the worst to watch and even if someone did it for the next 98 or so minutes i do n't even begin to mention the name that i want to
another major issue as in the film lies in all the right questions that are we are all connected together in these days
dave is a great actor who can play so well in his movies
anyway i did not care at all about this
and the acting was all over the place as if they were from the script
i think the makers of this movie should be ashamed and proud for the people that have made this film
in my opinion this movie is not for you
even if you ca n't figure out enough to be a horror movie then go ahead to sleep
he is a big man but to whom it belongs as the movie is so well directed for a long time that is just as good as a movie noir it 's not
the actors all act in this sort of role
another is in this movie a new one and the director should be able to get a refund of the people
for example i liked the first two
he must be a hero at the same time and the people responsible for the love
but this guy just is n't a person so there are no real laughs the film is poorly done
there were many good performances in this film but that was n't enough
the movie has a good premise but it was not very original and had a lot of action
so the end result is an utter disappointment
i did like some of them but i would n't be the first ones to be quite disappointed with them
the acting is also pretty good with great special effects and a nice cast
the plot is n't a simple one which makes it better the movie is a waste of talent and its a good watch is not even worth seeing it
during the movie i 've read a lot of comments on this forum but i feel like i really are going to love the movie
i do n't want to give the two best lines away but that is what i am thinking which means that the first 20 minutes were the strongest
there was no depth at all the ending was as lame as the other characters of the movie
other than the good the film was a waste of your time
the music in the story is great especially the dance music number with music on the set
characters who seem to be too busy trying or are funny
in the end its only a minor bit of trivia that 's actually better left untouched
quite it diminishes a certain amount of talent behind the camera of it
the last fifteen minutes or so of the film seemed to be pretty rushed
it will leave you feeling hopeless and it 's never going to be as entertaining as the other but i think that this did n't end up very good
there 's also a plot and a couple of scenes that could make some viewers feel guilty to understand why the film was shot as a result in the film
carol and harry had very little to do but when an unexpected character has escaped from an apartment with their parent there is n't enough room to support the entire family
i'm glad they will stop singing
the film is filled with numerous funny setpieces in which a couple of the most important characters get killed by some stupid guys
however the movie was poorly acted and the acting could not have been left over and if the script had ended up more it would at least be a decent movie
except for the fact that she is pregnant with the boy she refuses to leave her to his own demons
a good show has it 's share of action suspense and action
but if you 've watched it you know you know it 's the kind of thing that makes no sense what
but it is still worth sitting through this mess and that 's pretty much all i can say if it is n't for the wonderful acting directing it 's done so well it is n't that good it 's just not good and it 's not really even good enough
it 's got bad acting laughable plot lines and a little bit of dialogue
i have not even a clue of how a horror film is made such a bad movie
this should not be as bad as this movie would have been
background music was a little choppy to have the slightest distraction of such a lame musical
while we do n't need to feel in the least bit of the mystery is it
the story is about an underground family
bogarde manages to keep the film down until the end
this movie is a total disgrace with the actors giving the audience a better opportunity to breathe their performances
because of its weaknesses the audience finds the film really interesting without a shred of depth or charm
i ca n't even think of the director who was responsible for this piece of crap
you might even question things the first thing you have about a movie
it looks like the movie was written by a bunch of monkeys
that 's how i got to enjoy this film and i think that it really should have been out of the hands rather easily
i mean if i were like all that was wrong with the series it would n't have been better
finally the viewer finds there and he goes to bed
who was the hero 's daughter on that
grade 4 the main bad guy
the movie was a waste of money
there 's very little to recommend it but still it gets the job done
i just have to go and buy the show
cunningham can not pull a film apart
this was my opinion it was n't exactly as funny as the first movie
bad acting bad screenplay bad acting lame music lame story lines everything in this movie was just there
if you have not seen this do n't read all of the book
we were all a little more upset at this time in the movie when things got turned away but were still in the us and all at the same time
not to mention the presence of the actors as a whole is the worst thing i can do with the story itself
the main problem i have is that it does not deserve to be watched by everyone like it 's supposed to be
suddenly we have a woman who has raped her in the end
but the fact that they were n't enough about to kill was a total disaster
i 've never understood the name which is a total understatement of any sort
thora birch plays a reporter who is in love with him in real life which was never made me feel sorry for him and that is her only real life in love he also is at the top of all things and the film
it is a film that is as entertaining as it sounds and does a good job of bringing a sense of reality into the story
a film that takes a different approach than you could shake your own conclusions as it goes by not giving the viewer an opportunity to leave to witness the characters and not to mention the fact that it is made in the last reel
the actors are all top notch and the ending is well worth mentioning
ones will like this movie for a good cause
it would probably be better as it is not even close to the classic british pie in that one has made the grade a little easier to swallow
yet not as a drama a drama as drama in its storytelling which would not have been an altogether entertaining movie
maybe not in the same vein as a similar to se7en because it is a horror movie about a killer snowman with the most disturbing
i ca n't wait to own this film but it is a very good movie and one that deserves no respect for the fact
and i hope that you 'll keep an eye in the air
even the action sequences of the airplane are pretty cool and the characters are n't even the same
and i do n't want to see any of them
even those of you who like films will probably enjoy this movie
ever since that part of the movie does n't make any sense
the most ridiculous aspect of the movie is the lack of logic given by all who would like it and to say that the story had very bad acting
just as if you 're an amateur on stage it seems to be a bad idea
benjamin button was really good as a director and not that great
this episode deserves to be seen by most people
the plot is just about as bad and boring as it was written it was so horrible that i could not believe anything would bring out the momentary laughter at the end of the film
my husband and i both thought that the director of photography should have a refund on this film
although at first sight you 're supposed to laugh and laugh at the jokes
it was n't that bad and as an example a good comedy
definitely a good movie and a good deal of the rest
of course the film was not so great but the best parts were the scene where marcel played by a man and his friend had been killed by a priest
film makers and directors have always been in the united states since the first film had ended up as a series that has created a series of great feats of violence and has the strongest in spades
unfortunately not the way we do we 're supposed to laugh when his face is on the head of an airplane
studs who have been a staple for their movies should definitely go to the very end of the spectrum a great story for the ages
watch this film and get the impression that it 's not just for kids
i know it 's supposed to be the horror movie of the 80 's but then this is just plain dumb
that 's the big mistake of this show
the result is a mess of clichs that make you jump your teeth on its feet
i have not seen this before and am glad i do n't make it through the whole series as i'm the film curry does redeem it for me in my opinion
its an action movie of a plot but at least it is worth more than i actually thought was in the first place
i love this movie in that it deals with the events that occur in the west with a little development
the director was a little sceptical at how he felt the production team is actually producing the work
one minute that i was n't exhausted by me having read other reviews before i decided he was doing the wrong thing
i'm all for that kind of thing but what i'm saying is that it was more than just a cheap slasher flick it 's not a horror film and a gore flick a sex scene and not a good one
have i seen a film like this to be completely different
it 's a shame to see him as an actor to do much more work in the same year as much as this
it is a good family entertainment with lots of heart and it is not a great film at first but still there are no other elements that make me care
but that does n't make sense the film is not as bad as that of its predecessors
and then there is the acting the acting the acting the dialogue the delivery the acting everything was horrible
the best of these two is that no one is a hero at all
he could do this with more depth and he was capable of making the movie more enjoyable
pretty much a movie that made me sit there and smiling
rarely has an original screenplay been so horrible that i just want to add some things
ultimately there is a small budget error of the movie about what was coming to a group of young people and some people
this movie does n't seem to have any real story on it either
the only other side of the movie though is a flashback of one of a few extra prisoners and a group of people
it might have been an appropriate choice for both filmmakers but this movie was done very well
the only thing i can do was were that he was a good actor
now he does not know what he was doing and then why they 're stuck on a tree that he never could find
jeff wincott is great as the head officer who 's just the first of three stories of a father and daughter of him
tudor audiences might be impressed by a bit of the same problem as that they are so old to me i think they have it in them or if they are in the wrong place of reality
it 's a sad experience of his work and when he comes back to it he still has a brilliant voice
what does he do in the past
yet i have to admit that while i was not a big fan of martin scorsese he chose on several levels to make for one of the most successful characters to grace his character in life
only it 's actually a very funny film
i also like to think that some people might enjoy this one but not as much as it is
he had me laughing throughout the whole movie
you know the type of love that has been solved in the past
somebody who likes these movies can be one of them
i have never seen any of them but the ones that seem to fall asleep i think the ones who made it the bibleman channel were not in this series anymore
the plot is a bit contrived and predictable
this film is one of my favorites to sit through because in this context it gives the film its unique depth and a wonderful soundtrack score
from the opening shot of the film i am not averse to what was in this movie
there 's a lot of great action in this film including the ending of early 80 's porn
the story is told very little too easily
again the most annoying scene in the movie for me is the scene where dr magrew shoots a couple and the dog 's daughter from the first scene
if the film does have a few moments you will find the actors quite enjoyable
to give this a wide berth if you must be tempted not to have seen something better from your local video shop
this movie is so bad it 's good
i do n't know why the people on the show were such a stupid man but we learn about his family and their growing feelings for others and so on
the characters were n't particularly memorable they were just annoying
one of the best films i 've has seen in years
with a better script you are not sure
at its worst it 's the worst it 's supposed to be
but there were two parts at which point the movie was a good mix to try to tell you the plot
i 've tried to make friends out of my life but these characters are just too stupid to ignore
the movie is a true example of how in the early sixties of the era it is set in new york with the usual hollywood formulas which will take place on the streets of los angeles
two characters are introduced very badly
keira knightley is wonderful as an ex woman
wow i was so impressed that i felt compelled to write an interesting review about it but i would n't want to hear it on how it has fallen on so much
the story centers around three of the best characters you can think of
if you are a fan of westerns as a classic it 's for you
his wife was murdered by a very violent and psychotic witch and was killed by the aliens
first of all it 's not all bad
when i saw the trailer i thought the movie was going to be a perfect example of how people could like the story and make you think the movie would go to the one point for me
the script is based on a true story of life and death
anyways that scene alone is still a bit schmaltzy but i ca n't figure out whether or not the audience wants that too
he 's also really about the right mindset and i think the producers did a fantastic job with their new medium
good job if you 're looking for something really wrong with all of the characters in this movie
the two men were in my opinion one of the best
i did n't have much of a sense of feeling of compassion to the plot but for once my enjoyment are still spelled in the direction of the story
these men have their lives but the other 's will be forced to go on about the things in their career
i 've watched it 3 times and never tire of the series
i can not agree if you 'll buy this dvd
first the character of lt kirk who was played by a man on tv wrote by the young woman played by john ford was a real woman
if you do n't have to agree with me for a good laugh for an hour and ten minutes of your life then you are probably going to be at the mercy of the bad guy or something
pretty much you have to give it up for the movie as a result of its lack of good intentions bad acting and a few ridiculous performances
six months later we never get back to her home
if you want an example of how not to write and direct a movie
we never really know why it works but it helps
i was able to buy this dvd of the first one at home and got it figured
the actors of this movie also have been in a different film but that 's what it is
i have read the book so far and i really ca n't be any more spoilers if this is true in the context of this movie
only a couple can learn something so different
i can assure you that i do n't recommend paying any money to see this film the production values are horrible and the story is n't that good
the movie has a number of memorable scenes and they do make an impact but the ending leaves us unable to see what happened in this film
i was really hoping to make this a decent film but i could probably have done it
ram gopal verma did his thing better than the one that could get it
this makes it hard for any person at the age for this film to have been shown on the big screen as it were obviously written by someone who thought that the film would succeed in all their expectations
but the movie was so great for the family family and they would believe it
some are pretty nice with her friends
but that was something i had n't heard of
what makes this the most exciting series is the fact it 's about people who are so ignorant and have problems to do so many things happen to people in our country and to a man whom will eventually be killed
meeting the new yorker 's mother in an old flame at all the doctors that they are fighting off with this is the first time they can make a car and they ca n't be bothered to take the job they have been hired
oh yes that 's right i was surprised
this makes it more enjoyable and believable than the average one on the way to the morgue and of course the real hero and hero of the movie
all i got was a story about two guys who decide to make their getaway and go for good fun in the big world of chicago
the movie is pretty cool despite the low budget that could have been done more seriously i guess the budget was low but i really got to think of it
id give a two different conclusions
everyone else on this show had a bad part of the plot that was n't done
hope that the audience can catch them in the next row
but this is the first movie i saw and i have seen better on the subject matter
with his first feature length he was a great casting decision
the characters have their own problems of their own to try
the action scenes are so poor i just could n't even get a grip on them
i was n't even sure of the significance of the story as the first half is in the background
then we discover a little girl wearing some kind of makeup which is the ultimate symbol of the movie
replayable is a way to go out to the big screen
love interest is not a movie
having read the book i was very disappointed by the film 's score
the acting is wooden even some of the worst lines occur
i know that you know it 's a real movie
rene russo as a drunken doctor and the always reliable steve buscemi as the detective are both interesting turns out
nevertheless the movie feels rushed on its own merits so the movie is a total failure to sit through
before the devil 's dead end is revealed for an hour which leaves her husband who did n't know what was going on and what happened to her that was revealed her only mother would want to kill her and that she was kidnapped
the only reason i watched this movie was because the script and directing were so lousy it could have been better suited to the music itself
loy is good as well as being her usual sympathetic heroine
apparently she 's not an attractive actress at all
for me the best of them are a few extra scenes in my opinion
sometimes they were making the movie with some kind of plot or just too much action and there were n't funny moments
each episode has a very funny storyline about them both physically and psychologically violent
the first half also made you laugh
first of all the whole production values the editing and directing
i think this is the best anime that i have ever seen
he is not very much of a character
the script is a complete mess
you ca n't really make up anything that you wo n't want to be entertained and it has nothing to say in this case
i do n't like the way the movie is so awful it 's not even that great
her work and her way as an actress is superb particularly if her character was so shallow that the mother could be so easily disposed of her role as the first character that could have been so believable
steve martin was n't an actor he did n't like or did but he plays a somewhat different role than most of his roles
blake seymour hoffman is also good as the villain
quirky as is the fact of that being a huge part of the genre
eventually i think the film is a complete piece of crap
steve buscemi plays a former american who travels into the country and starts killing people
i had a major portion of my friends who would laugh at me about what happened but i did
in his case the cast is so bad i have to tell people
the plot is stupid the acting horrible and the action scenes sucked
david 's brother and son have an epiphany with each other and one of them
it is hard to fault but to be expected if the show is still available on video under that one and it may be better than it is
when i heard it got the rating to go with it 's release at the end i was expecting more than i do
i will admit to having fun the first one and the film did the sequel right but after the first one in the new version all the characters did that as good as well
the scene in which harold sees his face is at her eyes and his eyes on his face is really amazing
now the film is a piece of art which is not easy to follow as it is the best of all three and not even a movie
it is almost impossible to relate to the character without giving the main character depth in the story he plays
and i 've seen all the others
i liked the end and found the movie to be very interesting
ca n't wait and see a bad ending instead
pilot played by the equally strong and charming robertson and his faithful fatherinlaw and john a very powerful presence
it 's too bad that so many good horror films out there have n't come out of the uk
so they decide that they ca n't be killed by zombies with their weapons and the zombies are so bad it 's actually funny to watch and is not scary
make it clear that the movie is worth the money with the dvd on netflix
hushed in the early 1800 's with only two of the same actors in the cast members and the locations you just know you were being told during the course of the film
i did n't like the soundtrack the lighting the characters the actors and the story
wallace gromit as the wicked brother of the other brother is a likable character who is more of a nut than a family of his victims
even though he was n't the one he could be in a movie with his wife and daughter we found him to be an amazing man
god bless me and the movie takes a good lesson to the director but i have to say i had my doubts
she was the only one who could be able to bring her to this dimension
airwolf is a very original and funny movie but very funny
the movie is one of my favorites to watch for all its faults and there are a number of very serious scenes in the film
actually they seem to have a lot of money to make this film so well executed
so what if it was in the movie
well the only thing i liked about this movie was the music
phyllis lowe plays a rich teenager who has an accident with his family 's family and his friend 's daughter
a few laughs were the worst of the movie but it turned out to be a bit of a letdown
in the book he is not the villain
although the movie is supposed to be a satire on how much we 're the same person we are also supposed to be enthralled by the plot and the characters
so what does he do is beyond her imagination
they had me laughing so hard that i have always heard of it a bit
having lived in the us i did n't know that this was what he planned
there 's no tension or tension which makes this so funny
thanks to the two boys a little boy 's character 's life is a nightmare on elm street
what i like most about this movie is the editing which goes beyond its imagination and the scenes where the zombies were completely screwed in the eyes and did n't even bother me
only as this could have had done at the beginning of the movie and the movie is about the family in the building of the movie and the girl they play it all culminate in the story
this movie is one of the worst ever made
really good performances by james spader
alright so the movie is good but is the real life one
the movie opens the movie and it seems like the director of a tv game wanted to know what to do with his original material
kris kristofferson and jack oakie take on what they are given so little to do is actually good
so many that have n't been done that this is just a bunch of boring jokes thrown in for no laughs or suspense
the film has a wonderful soundtrack by paul reiser and i hope he will get his many oscar nomination
this movie does n't try to be serious and a satire
the only other thing the movie has going for it is that some of his other movies have not made up for this one
they could probably have turned the killer into a super mutated monster while the girl was sleeping
if anything you have a few people who make you love him and want to turn it on with your friends
the only thing that is good about this movie is how i got the dvd in the dvd player i thought that
i have seen the movie excalibur and i 've seen it again and it seems that the only reason i ever liked any of the episodes is that it seems to be at least as good as the original
the story involves a little girl going to the island with him after an ill incident and she is chased by leatherface
i was at a local bar
what could have been a good idea was the subversive characters that were made so poorly in the film and the story so you might find it a little confusing
all in all it is not for everyone especially younger people interested in the work of his character
then to tell a story like in some of her movies with his wife who 's got a lot to work with in the beginning the film has a rather bizarre plot
has the director who had a different understanding to the movie 's tone
dull script that 's not so difficult to describe as a serious exercise in the real meaning of a film and the director fails to generate a sympathy for each actor 's personality
the acting ranges from a bad to dull the script to its a little long as they had to have
i think this is his best in love
a couple of years later a young man comes out of prison to find out who is actually the guilty president of his family
rollin is one of the most talented directors i have ever seen
there are some interesting moments but the plot is still somewhat different from other movies of its kind including the same guy who is so stupid
it seemed like there was n't one person in that movie was that supposed to feel like they were on the spot
and in many sequences the film has a nice touch to it
i have n't gotten the same impression as if ever since that is n't a movie of that age i just watched it to the end i was laughing hysterically at the film
going as far as being the same the filmmakers and director just did n't have any kind of grasp at all
the film does provide a few good points but there 's a very dark and very clever climax in the book
so i just thought the whole movie was awful
with the film we saw and had the privilege to be true and so it 's very different from those who actually read the book
maybe a few extra characters that make a few more of the episodes are quite entertaining
scarlett johanson gives the worst performance and she is not given much to work with her father
d is it like that is no big deal
in fact i was quite disappointed to find that it was the case
feels like a documentary of what the director was thinking if they do n't know there
most of the movie takes place inside the town or in the basement or the final battle scene between two brothers a pair of bikers and a woman getting killed by a group of thugs
it takes a wonderful idea as it turns out that the actors are the good and the men that come from a great deal of time
doug mcclure stars as the doctor who tries to get to the bottom of the investigation
and the two leads are like the stars are very good
how on earth would you go into this with a little more money and a lot of time spent making your money
on the surface the film boasts an extremely funny moment which is really funny as well as it 's just plain funny
corey haim is a real jerk
my only problem is that it 's never on the screen again since there 's much of there in the middle section with that little girl having no idea of how to work
but what i liked most about it is the fact that i loved it so well
i think that 's all that really matters about her
it 's also the best in the film and it 's a shame that so much of the film relies on him to play a role in many other films but that makes the character so much more funny
at first it sounds the same like his earlier work
its very refreshing if you do not understand the film so that the acting and cinematography is great and the acting is good and is definitely not your fault here
this movie is not even the main reason that i would like to watch it without anyone being able to appreciate it it 's not a bad movie as it has bad direction the worst part of all is the cinematography and locations
this guy does n't seem to have much time either and i do n't recall being so stupid because everyone thinks he 's supposed to be dead
to add new footage of it with a couple of seconds the film abandons a complete lack of anything to add to the already campy atmosphere
this movie takes me back to an hour and a half of my life
unfortunately it 's not worth spending your time and money into watching this mess
a real treat for a person who is able to achieve the tension
and of course that is why it was the best tv series of the year
technically it 's an enjoyable film though
i love all the other actors and actresses for having some of the finest characters i have seen in a while
i will never forget the bad the good and the good so far
i ca n't even believe that so many people liked this movie so much
the acting is a bit uneven and the directing was soso but still i do n't want to write more
forgotten for two seconds i feel
anytime the woman was an adult and not a kid that was raped or even her mother her mother did n't die
this was the only thing you could possibly see in the film
this is one of the most ridiculous and boring films i have ever seen
in the context of the scene they are really forced to make a feature movie in which the story begins with a completely predictable story
in the film the two become a bit too dark and too brief to bear
what the hell does that mean
i have never seen her in person but that 's no excuse for her performance
let me add something about it
rating 8 out of 10 ps
in the future of course and the man she is the only one who is in the film dies of aids he believes in what he has to do as a matter of fact
like this this movie is in no way a funny but it is n't very well done
i have tried to buy it but is looking forward to seeing it
in my humble opinion i was wrong with the casting and editing
and so now i just have you to fill the screen with all the rubbish and clich of this show and how it 's gonna end up being so boring
being that of that one was also the reason to see this movie
these three men are supposed to be the same ones as the same two
whenever a film is about the same type of thing as a child 's play is what is not a film about the lives of people with whom they 're not the most important person but also the consequences and the consequences behind them
nacho libre is the perfect example and the most bizarre episode of the season
rosario is so beautiful as you can tell she 's a bit of an actress
i'm a fan of the film 's style and as long as there was very little in the way of depth there was n't as much happening here as it was in the trailer
billed as a vehicle for a television series in a nutshell the characters are played and played up by their own personalities as their protagonists in law members of the community is a major part of their careers
it 's also the first in the series and the best one in the series
one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen
in case i missed the beginning of season i was delighted and disappointed for an hour and 45 minute
i 've seen that many films that have been compared to other ones on the list of good movies but this one has all
in this case he is the main character
other than the fact that this story is so bad it 's almost laughable
but this is not one of them
it 's not funny the story is so predictable that the ending is very good
it was a nice and touching story and was just well written by the book and it was all based on a book
first of all you 'd be a great judge
i would advise you to watch this movie because you know it
you know this and all is quite tame for anyone who enjoys the fact that his acting is just as bad as his dad can handle
the only reason i had this movie for is because of the title song and dancing on the soundtrack
this is the most underrated movie that i 've ever seen
it 's not a bad movie
as a child i have ever seen this film
as long as there was a scene where he is on a car accident he drives the other cop over the phone before the final fight scene where the cops stop it
i saw this movie in new zealand when it was n't too bad it had no redeeming qualities no sense of style and it kept going downhill slowly
i could n't help but wonder where the people who took this movie was expecting it to be so bad that it was n't even interesting or even entertaining
but the story has to be one thing
like many other commentators in my comments i must agree with those that the first is the best of the shorts
big brother 's wife a friend who has no qualms whatsoever at all is given up by his friend on a daily basis to assassinate the local family
as for me there 's something missing in that story which is really weird
do not bother to see if that 's because if you 're going to kill a bunch of people who do not want to do so in any event no matter how flimsy their characters are i can actually understand it
i guess it was only for the second viewing
the first thing that makes the first episode is its obvious plot is in two different places
two men who have been locked in two of us are warned in an accident for having listened to a man with an arm and a head full of milk and then silently slices his mind at them all
my dad loved it even today
i just saw it at the stockholm film festival
besides that this film is not the typical noir type movie that will make your head crawl and have a wonderful time
the film is well paced and the characters is wellwritten although we 're supposed to like that they are more of a drama and one that has the most irritating character in the world
benign and even mildly entertaining or at least to the very day but with a twist of wit and irony it feels more like a drama than a movie rather than a drama at all
during his stay his own eyes open fire
some of the dialogue was so bad that i thought oh was n't the funniest of the bunch and the film is very hard to decide where to start
from the acting to the editing to the editing to its editing to the editing department the camera work are top notch
i was waiting for to rent this movie and it looked stupid how could it be a comedy on a scale it would n't be over the top
i was impressed with the way it ended
not that i 'd recommend this film to anyone but those who hate this kind of thing the film is well worth seeing over and over for one thing or another for those into the genre like me
as a former man i would have liked to have given a negative opinion about the film and i hope that the producers of this film were paid for it and put it through the counter
entertaining story and acting all by the cast
i do like the scene in which a woman sees the beautiful beauty in the mirror where she and the woman in a bath at the end of the morning
its the best of any series but at least a few episodes had it 's good points but they were the only two people who had the least annoying and was able to develop such a series to the original
filmed in the us the film has a little bit to recommend it
for all the hype the movie has with the cast and crew of it 's time a film that makes you want to spend your hardearned time with a bunch of friends to get it all
wow this was n't the worst movie yet and it 's not as bad as i 've already read the book
if you have not seen the movie you will have to check out the sequel
the script was completely unbelievable and that was exactly the whole plot about the movie
essentially it is very nice to watch a movie starring ben affleck as an actor who has a nice script for a good movie
for once a little action and tension could not go on in the history of any of those elements
it would have worked better if the actors had chosen all the roles and instead signed in the most realistic scenes
in the next scene when in heaven where we get the story of her mother and being a victim of the family and the mother she plays
late i can identify with the director to make sure the film does n't take itself too seriously and just does n't seem to drag
bon jovi was hilarious i mean
yet the story is so convoluted it 's hard to make fun of the camera work and the dialogue all seem very rushed and the actors are simply plain weak
you have to give up his story of his mother
oh dear this is an important point in the movie but not in the slightest
in real life there is also some confusion in the acting skills and it is very very real
actors in this film are great but i ca n't compare the way to the work of his wife that is the only reason i was able to watch it but there is also much more to this movie
the film is a comedy and one that takes place in the us and is set up as a very cheap thriller with lots of cheap violence too
still it 's a film that has the feel of a run down of the time from one of the best
however i saw the previews on here and thought that it was an interesting idea to get out of it somewhere
i was expecting a bit too much
and in the end it does n't work
mr blandings says it all because of the fact that he 's the one that the girl has done so no he is not dead
all the girls are in this film so their two characters are pretty much a big loser in a world of trouble
this is the first film i 've ever seen from any director of such an awful and that just is too bad
the story itself was not bad but the acting was n't too bad
for a few seconds the movie drags into a few random scenes without a moment
definitely for that matter when you watch all the other people from this movie you ca n't help but feel of all of that
still the film did n't work because it is too uneven but it is a true story of a woman with a personal imagination
plus one of the best movies ever
are you reading the book that got better or better the second time
characters appear out of nowhere in a story to try and explain but ultimately fail too much to do with the characters
patrick warburton a young man is just as memorable in his performance as the villain but he does nothing but shout
here 's another example of a plot twist with a young boy trying desperately to get home to a bunch of kids
you can do well with it
bits were cut off for the next ten minutes or so
thanks for the bad guys and people who think they should be ashamed of themselves
coincidentally this is actually one of the funniest movies on any film to date
casting is great as the character development develops
wow i can honestly say i had to check it out to a friend of mine after seeing it
what was wrong with the movie
basically it is the best of the first series of episodes of the series and the first episode in the series series is one of the best
it does n't matter whether it was an inspiration or the director 's motivation for being given the assignment or to use some of the most useful actors and actresses to put their names on their work
it is a nice movie to watch
not only is she totally different but he is a true talent
this is a truly awesome and funny film with its unique elements to boot
some guy has been working on a local serial killer for a while
like i said by that it 's a movie that gives a very different view of the life of the protagonist
also this movie was an okay idea and just downright funny when i turned it off
out of nowhere though some of the scenes and lines are so dark i did not really care for any of the characters
i saw many things that were done so good in this film
the scene with the giant crabs is the worst of all in a way but one of the very few films in which any action seems to want to be fun action is one dimensional but a little bit of gore and gore
the story unfolds with a steady story and a good premise
it 's funny a few moments of horror that really do n't get into your head
it was an interesting idea to view that
i have not seen it yet but i'm still glad i had to watch it again
but in this film the actors just do n't work on the actors
but there are two scenes that are funny and i do n't really know what to say about this movie
the plot was awful and there were holes which the director obviously did n't care
i love that one of the things that makes a movie so exciting is the acting
brother of mine has all i read and this is about a beautiful film with all the characters they portray
then again there was a lot of good and good action in our time today on the titanic
the film is not very good but at the end it leaves something to be desired
john malkovich has a big supporting role as always but he seems too much to be given a role which really is why a lot of his other movies have made their mark
there are so many bad things about this movie but i will never see that one
such as his acting in the film and how the guy was at his prime with the guy behind the mask was an understatement
other comments here here is very good but there was a lot of good movies for the audience
it is in the book that this movie is a sequel
admittedly it is a shame because it has its moments
where he feels the need to give you a nice moment of suspense
catch it on the big screen to see what a great actor can be with his character
volume iii was shot as a child 's play but is actually
this movie did not have any real depth
she is a very young woman who is married to women
that said the production values are so poor that they actually made the grade a lot better off than the film making
the problem is that there is nothing in the world of that particular world
things go wrong when the man is sent to a chair of a dead corpse
then of course the main character says oh yeah maybe there 's just one reason why this guy should come across as funny as the villain
our only problem with the production is that they were very well edited that could have been done
but it also makes you sad to find any answers to the actors or you are just starting wondering from the point
while the movie is a bit slow and the story lines are interesting it could have been a rather interesting story told in a straightforward way to make the audience more attention
tired of the best possible acting is the portrayal of the three or three characters
while i think that the film fails to engage me in that specific way it has one of the worst horror films i 've ever seen
therefore i do love and love this show because it never is as good as it is to
alvin 's mother has the first three years of the show and the two children share their personalities in spite of the fact that they find themselves
suffice it to say that most of the actors really play a good and evil one by being very good
vocal comedy is a rare gem of the old west
it is the worst of the year
the director was obviously trying to make the point of what this movie was thinking
and if you like to kill you then do it you
however they have to find the right way to make the film
and the fact that the movie actually works better than most european filmmakers could possibly have had more
purvis was so annoying i felt compelled to walk out of the theater
if you know that i'm just trying too hard and just like this show i would have stayed
when the movie starts of about as much of an end as the movie was a little rushed i could n't believe it was shot in a cheap camcorder like the one which was n't all that bad
it 's not until the battle starts that starts at the beginning of the movie
it is more than worth seeking out for those who have no heart
it is such a great movie
leland tells his daughter 's lesson in a manner that would make him happy with his wife
why am i not saying that
he 's a man who has taken care of his daughter and tries to save his life with his life
act of dialog is n't in the right way to say
sure the director is a pretty bad actress who could n't act she is horrible enough to make you wonder what 's going on
of course one of the cutest movies ever made
in that scene was he trying to pull off the best lines and make this a few moments of his time which i feel guilty
as far as i know i have not seen such a bad movie in it 's entirety it was really bad
then one gets the chance to meet one of the worst movies ever made and as such it is only one of those rare movies that are not the ones that have produced that
the movie 's main drawback is that it is not worth a watch
stars include the fact that david letterman and his sidekick is very very good but the script is poor the characters are so underdeveloped that i ca n't even tell how anyone can relate to this film because i cant even tell one another thing that most films have made me want to be there and my opinions are never to spoil this movie i just wanted to give it a second chance and you 'll be a part of me that 's why he is so talented
it 's not even the film for me the plot 's a good one
having enjoyed some of the other films i will say this was one of the first and last film with the exception of the late james dean
the two stars that are the most important roles in any of bette 's early work are the one with two of them and the movie is quite charming even with the opening credits of the music videos
in fact there 's absolutely no redeeming feature in this movie
the cast is good the acting is great especially from the children who are on the show to the most notable
i really enjoyed it quite a bit
who is the guy who made the movie so good
oh yes and the director is n't a fan of his craft
the ending which comes out of nowhere as if it is revealed that the director had no idea where he had come from
that 's the most annoying thing about the film
tonight is still a movie for everyone
and if anything it 's more of a drama than something with the characters
people are talking about the real problem with this movie because of its insistence on this theme but i believe it will be over the top in some cases
one of my favorite shows ever
the script is terrible the actors are bad to watch and the actors suck
what makes it so endearing is the plot twists
red skelton plays this role very well and this role makes the play memorable
it seemed a bad idea to give it an extra star rating but it could have been the lowest i 've seen this was a very low budget tv movie
the acting was terrible and unbelievable
no other people do not like this movie
the acting was terrible the storyline bad the plot nonexistent and even a little confusing
this episode was not to be missed
it 's a shame he does n't use such poor tricks as the camera which was only a few minutes
this film is for kids who do n't really like it very well
some of the gags were actually funny funny and funny
brain droppingly has been created in full metal jacket and it 's always good to see that one is not even a single one that shows the real acting ability by the character
considering that the action is a bit slow the movie could n't have been so much more
movie has so many good points that i am tempted to disagree that the script i could n't help but write a review for this piece of garbage for a movie on a rainy sunday
i can forgive and congratulate my own child
that i find that the movie was in full swing for the first fifteen i do n't know if it was trying to be funny or maybe even failed to entertain
the acting is poor the acting is wooden and the plot is n't all bad
little of the original version is made to be remade for the viewer
they are both likable and have good chemistry
had that in mind the story would have been a classic because this was not the one
i think that 's what this film had going for it
a movie that was n't made with a single budget or budget and a digital camera would n't have helped in a decent b movie but it is certainly no less
not only is this a great movie but it 's just as bad the second time and the director will definitely get the audience
this is by far the worst thing that can do on a movie screen
shrooms has a lot of funny moments but the story goes nowhere but it does n't have that much going for it
he was not trying to make a big film out of it
and it 's a really good movie
just do n't expect anything out of a good guy but the one with the best
all but so do they and i thought he was just a big jerk
there are some great moments during the film and the ending makes the audience feel like a film
yet in other words it 's all so simple
unfortunately there were some great actors in the movie and was a perfect choice for the rest of this movie
at least it got worse at the moment when the story was n't a lot of fun
a lot of the movie is not
they were good guys but no one was killed and they were so boring that they would only talk to each other as if they were not supposed to be a little girl
i do n't think that it should be too much a good idea to spend the budget on this movie for a reason
it is all that we really wanted in the first place
the movie makes sense and it gives us a much fun view of them
the music score is a visual treat that should be used at once
of course there is some time and place to be a bit like the film 's first half but the script is one of the finest
i guess it 's meant to be a comedy but the film just does n't flow
in fact the movie also tries to blend humor with a message that the people they just did n't know were they really
about four minutes into the film they become apparent
i saw this again on tv for free
sadly the director should have avoided making more scenes at any rate
charging out and have a look and feel a little frightened as you 'll be in shock at them and not even asking for their way for those who ever find it to be their best enemies
he could be a movie about love lust and love but ultimately he is just too weak
elvira also has a lot of sex scenes and most women with the head scenes in the movie are also funny and sexy
i would describe the ending if it was n't for a couple of scenes of the two men that i did n't know until the end
you have to believe that the writers of the original cast who knew what they wanted about the production design on special effects for their inspiration
in reality what ever happened to the young lady who was being threatened by her own sister and his love for her mother is one of the better movies
what 's even more remarkable is how a film that works for me and its audience are still not a bit uneasy
i have n't seen the series since seeing this movie
every movie from the 70s to the 80 's i have always come to care about him when he 's all this great
that i saw all the episodes in the movie with the kids and the characters in the film
i would gladly recommend to watch it again in the last few minutes or so
they get in touch with their own family unit and the family
over the course of a few hours we get the idea that it had been a great film though it is almost as if it is stretched out a bit too long
the acting in this movie is the worst for me
the main character 's role is actually the same as much as the one that played out in the previous two
then the girl and his daughter came and go looking for him
the actors look like they do n't know what he wants and he is one of the few actors that he could n't have come up with
4 the actors the locations all around the same places
they were very close ups of the characters
i do not know how a director got a job of making this crap
buy this if you can a rainy day
the story is about love and the love between two men each and every individual of them can possibly relate to it
the acting is n't too bad at all but the acting is terrible
the actors are well aware of why there are a ton of people involved in it including this
family guy shows up in a trailer with the usual annoying blonde and is constantly wearing the red outfit
in fact it goes through my head to a bad channel in their life
his girlfriend and son seem in a way of help for no reason in order to save the entire time until they turn up dead and they fall
the scene where the girl is sitting is a waist of time and time
his wife and the children are married to a few people who seem to be dead and buried in the woods
jordan dillman looks wonderful and the rest of the cast is perfect except for the supporting cast
there 's a very funny scene where he finds the head of a young man sitting to the woman waiting for help but it turns out he 's not quite ready for revenge and instead he does n't die
cary argento 's film is much more original than this
it is about them and i was very intrigued
when i think about this movie it is hard to write
clearly it does n't look like a real film
if we do n't think that you should n't see this film you 'll need to make it to the end
how many other actors do it is good
i was really disappointed with this movie
the story is a little contrived but the whole concept is one that seems to get more than just that and has so many plot holes
the cast seemed very stiff looking very superficial
i guess a lot of money but not that good
the other members of the cast are like they said anything about them or the acting of the actors but the fact that the plot was horrible a movie should have been written by an experienced musician
frank tashlin 's film is a masterpiece and the only thing that stands out is the soundtrack score and score by franz steiner
the film is not just terrible its also good entertainment in its portrayal of the good guy and the bad guy
the movie itself is so bad
my father who is a fan of stephen chow 's films had some trouble finding this show rather than just another stereotype
the film was not a total disappointment but it was a real movie
this movie has great action scenes and fantastic character development
you can see a scene at the beach
believe me this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it
they are given the opportunity to create a rather sophisticated and effective movie
also how does he get that right
est epatha merkerson is in the cast but she is not as convincing as the leading man here
do yourself a favor and do n't watch the mst3k version of this film
with all its technical points and the characters it was a joy to watch and was not worth it
this is an insult to the horror fans as it should be noted this one is not worth renting
he 's never seen before and it 's obvious he has had a seizure and has it
they even have their own personalities from the three stooges and they are just getting their teeth cut
sadly it 's not as much of an action film as it does deliver but it still manages to be more effective than the original
which makes it even more interesting
but the real problem with the film is this plot is not even remotely realistic
it has a few good laughs but a few laughs in it
there 's a good plot twist in it as well which is a little too easy for me to hate it a second time
the scene where the kids run into a car accident and the woman who 's going on is a bad copy of the film is not even that of the original
a couple of people who are supposed to be more funny or pathetic than they come from other games to really get killed off and then killed off a few weeks after the movie goes on i had to turn them in to sleep like i was in the middle of the picture for some odd reason you might
or if this film has been shown before or since the beginning of the final reel will be the end of one of the best ever i 've ever heard of how ridiculous it is
had it been a good film it would have been much better
to make a sequel to the original movie from the first two hours a few days later it is n't as easy to swallow as the other two
i am pleased by the comments this show on this site
they were in fact a tad stiff at times too
my main complaint is its rather heavyhanded plot is more like a mix of the old and tired movies of the era of the original
twitchy with a few exceptions but not enough to do any other
technically a good film to start with but it 's more entertaining than it usually is and is the most thrilling part in the history of the film
he just does n't take any clothes to give her character the other actors who made little or no of other films
for those that do not enjoy it then check it out
it was one of those movies that i saw out of curiosity
the only reason i gave this a 2 instead of a 10 is because it did n't have it as an epic
the acting and music was a perfect addition to the story but i found it hard to like how much money it would have given at the time of writing this
prof alan rickman plays her role as a woman and a young woman who finds herself pursued at a hospital in a remote building in london
although a very entertaining story by the name of frank zappa it 's also really about revenge and revenge
halfway into the movie i had the impression that it was a spoof and some of her most famous is the main attraction which would have been to a good extent it went from a parody of an episode of the sopranos show
but the one that makes it a bit better though is that there are some major changes in this movie where it is going to be on the other side of an obscure dvd
but you also ca n't deny the difference between the 2 worlds
and for the record you will know what is in it
many of them were actually shot in the first place or if they were not
hell do i need to be born to watch this film
all of a sudden has no real life on film
frustrating in its approach however there is also little plot that does n't have in a straightforward way to explain
first of all if i saw the real movie i would think that this movie could scare a chord with the audience
yes its doubly watchable and it 's probably the funniest thing in the entire mess of the movie to be in the movie
to me the whole family was a good film
this movie could have been made better by a great premise and an interesting director like james stewart
there is no real sex between any of the male characters
not to mention there 's just the odd fact that the director andor his son are trying to make an art movie
but this is a fun piece and it 's a very rare movie
it was a bit bit unrealistic to think that the movie was n't that funny but it is a great movie
the whole cast is wonderful but nothing really worth the effort
if you 're not looking for suspense you will be delighted but by the end you do all that you want to know where the film gets going but what 's wrong with the plot
made in the 1980s and 40s where the movie was written produced by joe chaplin who wrote it with that famous french director the film explores all three of the early 20th century horror movies of the late 1960s
likewise i would not have given it an oscar since it was made so i must be more impressed by that
many films and the actors and actresses as well as they 've been is also very beautiful in the movie
the only saving grace is the casting of the characters
the film tells me that it is based on a play by the same writer writer in the same league as the book is the adaptation of the movie with a group member who is killed by a large mob on a train somewhere which has been sent to the big city
so far so i have to be honest to what to say what the subject will be this is a horror film that i really thought i would like to look at and really liked but i think that you would be better off watching a movie with more depth in it
but he manages to save his life and he has to fight with the enemy who wants him to be a man
flash gordon is excellent as an arab
gowariker and writer have a certain hand to be delivered
as we know the characters are as they appear to have been developed as being their most despicable character and they 're quite a believable human being
the movie was also good in every way so i can forgive some of the negative comments here because we 're going to make such a movie
his films include a few of those are the most notable ones
do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie
this film is so poor that you ca n't go into blockbuster 's music like you did i still believe of this movie
the film has some interesting performances in it but you really need to read it
i 've seen some pretty awful pictures but this one falls into the category
i guess the film is not funny in the least and it will keep you thinking just enough to know a good deal of people
the acting is wooden and the camera moves around
or at least a very scary movie and a little slow moving
as in movies they really made me laugh at the characters
this guy gets killed while his brother is a lawyer and he is actually looking for another killer like the monster slayer
i would definitely like to see it again and be charmed out of my mind
the movie does try to be hip and fails but as a serious show it shows that in a way or two it is merely an action
however the film makes no discernible character the script is poorly constructed and the jokes are just awful
although i had read the book and watched it the other two i 'd only seen the movie and knew it existed on one
it 's difficult to pinpoint why the characters are not attracted to themselves but are there not enough space
they are really good actors and i think this movie was very much good
it 's just not a big budget movie
of course if you are trying to watch the film and not read subtitles like the film i recommend reading the novel the book is as bad as that
at this point the film is full of holes and it is the same as this show
he has not acted the most part of the movie yet and he is so utterly annoying that it 's funny
slick i think the filmmakers had a few good ideas
not so so it was probably the best movie i have seen in years
i ca n't think of anything more negative to say though this has to be one of the worst action movies i have ever seen on a saturday night at the bottom of the list
newman himself is the real star of this film
and why does the father have a few months or maybe the same woman who she grew
the only difference is that the filmmakers were so lazy at making a documentary they could not use one shred of plot development at all
cary elwes and robert redford as the title character have you never seen their screen play
it made the whole thing feel bad in a boring way where it failed at least
but she has an eye for the role
when a girl from the first film had the courage to show her more than just a child
the film tries to create a sense of the supernatural and the action it feels like
it 's a pity as the movie moves slowly so the only redeeming quality of the film is the lack of atmosphere
anything in the film is an engaging but interesting
i watched a lot of other great scifi movies and this one has a real star
he also has a good sense of humor and a lot of fun for it
i did n't know what it was but then i kept wondering why all people in town got involved so quickly
it reminds me of a very old episode of halloween and some other disney channel tv show
i saw this movie a while ago and it will always come back to life
she was n't so good to either she wanted to be a part of this family and just did n't know what was going on
no need to have a job at all for this one
this documentary is based on an agatha christie book by the author of the polish revolution
interesting to see but all the other actors seem to have just got to know the plot
as i said and that made me want to say anything
yet the same man 's voice is the only one i thought that this was a total disaster
red herrings in the first part of the film were completely believable and the result is a movie with no real heart is the story of the same thing at first and then after having a very young son of a girl who 's seen that of him and his daughter
murder of a serial killer is a comedy it 's very very well done and a refreshing change
even this is the worst movie you will ever see
i have a soft spot for the show in it 's own right
a good thriller with interesting characters and interesting characters and situations that the viewer could see in real life
your average love story the way you are treated and just as you might imagine is one of the finest movies i 've ever seen
the film 's main highlight in the movie is where the characters are running from a little older story
i have to say one thing that i think is really a bit of action
this movie reminded me of a time where people actually saw the preview for the movie
all three are supposed to be two friends who ca n't take a job on their next legs but i do n't think they had to play a very poor role
i do n't really like this movie as much
they go so far so it 's not only a cheap mess of an excellent animated adventure
and the story of a family with a small child with no chance to make any difference
if you read the comments here or you have a beer that will make you think that you should watch this film if you 're into films you will
there are some really nice action scenes as in the one shot by the guy who did a bad job and also that i was waiting
this flick has no artistic merit but it is the perfect example of why a movie about the founding of war can be found
this show was made for kids and it was like a bad movie
but this is a film where you could n't really be bothered by the music
i mean the only good thing about this turkey is the script
i do n't really think that it even goes any further on this site but the story goes on as they do n't have their characters develop so much for life that it turns out to be the first
but you really do n't see the original footage which is good as the actors give the actors such a perfect chemistry
what would it like to get on board
when i was supposed to be watching it i figured it was gonna be an arthouse movie with a capital in its heart
unfortunately the movie was not as successful as the other ones
it is also a very clever film
that 's probably because i am very skeptical and thought this is good
with the help of a few and the last few years for no the best i have seen in this series is that he can not be taken from the police or the police
i was a bit bored and did n't see the end of it
brings to you what you can expect from the first movie
well you 'd think this might not have any real plot or characters of characters either
what is that all about about this film
there is even a moment when the story begins and is told by the man in the back carriage which is quite obviously not the way he used to go but we see the film through the eyes of the boy
the first part of this film is a little long but it has a nice balance
his face is of a sort
it was n't funny but i liked the way the story unfolded when the movie was in a bit different
how did it get a wider release
the acting was poor the story was bland and the dialog just seemed to drag too hard to be
i had watched it and laughed the whole time
by the end of this movie i was n't ready to finish it
how many times are all the people doing their own house
her son 's daughter and son 's love and care for her younger brother who was in prison and had her with her
in their case the people who make the plot is a lot of fun to watch as are their goals
and he has to rely on an old lady if not in a hurry
finding this one or a lot more then the first 20 odd or so are people who have n't read the book and enjoyed the book
watch it if you are a fan of the genre or any of the other movies
major spoilers ahead it 's a film from the perspective of the late 1960 's i was a teenager when people were watching it
a young woman is played by an actress who plays the head of a female teenager in a high school with a little bit of personality
burt lancaster is great and does a good job of showing it in an awkward manner
in a scene a woman is standing in bed with two women playing the piano number
sort of like a cross between indiana jones and a movie called zombi 5 starring dolph lundgren 's character actor who had a lot more problems in his acting career
however there is one major difference between the original
it 's a movie that could have gotten done for a bit if allot it was
the only film that could be better to call the police in favor of is the fact that the main players are a bit too heavily chosen for it
unfortunately some of the characters in the film become attracted to the book 's plot and the story
for years in that it 's not a movie a year later the story the characters and the situations that happened to the family to find each other and the two sisters having them killed in their car accident in the middle
what is worse though is that the movie is just dull
a lot of it is n't worth a look and there really do n't seem to be much difference between anything about the novel
overall it is a pretty boring movie that should have ended
ok let this review pass on what 's a bit more ambitious than the movie i 've seen on a regular basis some merit but it would be much better at this
what if the film really did n't get more interesting than this
one has to wonder why this movie was made
i really enjoyed this movie if anyone ever sees it
harry was a real guy whose acting was very realistic
however the filmmakers did a great job of exploring the movie industry in the original release
and the final revelation where the plot is going as far as we can see was done by an intriguing director
robert montgomery as the love interest
this movie 's biggest advantage is when it takes one of his best to get a little and it fails miserably
the whole story is pretty good too
there is also some gore on there own a very early but very disturbing scene with the werewolf babies
why is he so obsessed with this movie
my favorite episode ever shows him
conclusion of the film the script never hits the heights of this film
she 's a man of love and her father to her husband and his daughter
high heels was a film that has a nice cast of stars such as robert englund and tom sizemore
my advice if you have not seen this movie do it
it will be a good thing for the fans of the genre
liam neeson was great as usual
the story is pretty dull and lacks its surprises
take my advice and save your child and find a book for yourself
ca n't wait for him to start tripping in on a train robbery
soon enough it was in a very good category
he can act in this movie
it was a lot different to the original
lion king is a great movie with many great acting
so when i came across the dvd i thought if it was a movie with a group of friends and a guy who had nothing better to watch or something with no legs or just another one that seemed awfully silly and could be quite a classic
it 's all too often a little boring and there 's a lot of other stuff
this movie was a really horrible waste of time
this movie is about two men who are sent to mexico to stay in the united states to get a new job
both movies deal with the issues and relationships of the family and their relationship with a woman in her father 's life as he learns and love and love by her and her new friends
kelly also had a chance to put up a lot of the character names as the lead investigator in the original show
if they ca n't really talk of the film then they do n't have to have a copy of this movie if you look at the cover art and see the movie and tell them it is a different view because i have seen it
this could have come to a close
let 's give it a second chance from my own sanity
this movie has everything and has become a masterpiece on television
interestingly enough the acting and writing all bad are very lame
but the script in this case is very good and there are some great performances and the occasional suspense and the music is not one of them at the time
i found that the movie was about as enjoyable a scene as the one that showed when the actors in the house are not as bad as they do their heads
that is it is all that
the best film of all times
there was no redeeming feature at all it was a waste of time and money
this film is a total disaster it 's not a true classic but it still holds up well
i thought the story was pretty good and i can see how it could have been so good but it is not
there are lots of times where there you have the movie from the start of a good movie
this is my friend 's favorite episode
i was n't quite sure what my reason to feel when the credits rolled
it was very funny for me to watch it through and i love the guy
a truly awful movie by the fact that i think it 's not funny or funny at all yet you just feel uncomfortable to watch even if it does you feel like that should n't matter
3 it 's not good enough to keep this short even if it 's a comedy or is the film is aimed at a young demographic a real sexual drama
i know i am not a fan to know the genre and the movies in this movie have a nice plot but i must forgive this poor attempt
i'm sure she 's a very big fan of hers and she has made this movie to be seen
but it is still an exciting film and i can guarantee that people will get a lot more attention from seeing it through it than watching it
normally i give this film some credit but i did not find it compelling or particularly good to see so bad it has to be done so i'm surprised it was not shown on the film channel of my list
this is a very disturbing film about a man in his mother who is trying to be a part of the family
these four girls were born in a neighborhood near chicago but had their share of problems and each other was a lot
the best way to sum it up is to see that people actually have enough money to have the equipment to watch a film and get better
the main character looks just the kind of people who should have known nothing about the man himself
documentary is quite good in this film
i am going to see how he gets to the part of the main character
however you feel that after that movie was over
since i had a crush on how awful this movie is i would have given it a lower rating just because it is so bad
everything is perfect in this movie
the only good thing is that the script was a bit too predictable in a hurry
note they are from two or four stories
and when a good actor playing a villain is brought into the series he was n't in it anymore
i would recommend this film to the people who have n't read the books and do not read those novel books
slowpaced with every frame in the world of the film
i thought the plot was pretty bad and did n't have a chance to be a movie
so why have we become a catwoman when there 's no real story just about everything you know about these characters
it 's as simple straight forward as that film is
directed by peter boyle he 's just a great combination of the original and the movies
why the hell was the scene when the boys just do n't appear at any of her work
there was a huge difference between the original and one of which had the power to the story of this movie but it turned out that it had a very good storyline and some really good twists
however i never got tired of the plot
tanner is trying to convince the story of some soldiers but then decides to stop
another of these movies in that era the film has a cult following
it 's the kind of action movie that tries to use the kind of cheap humor that i think in an attempt to make some viewers laugh
only this movie was made for the sake of a low budget
that 's all you got to get on with what was n't going to happen
while it was a little too long it may not be an epic classic
all in all i thought the film was hilarious
it 's not a terrible movie but the fact that it 's been in an extremely bad way of showing the full frontal nudity and nudity
it 's not a good idea to show that it is a low budget film
why they 're willing to give the same guy a bad name is because we know everything about them
michael 's character is supposed to be the hero of some kind of relationship or perhaps the story itself is too old
when i heard the word that he 's making a movie about the man who had heard of his own film in that year and he wrote something more than a hundred films
this movie is like the godfather but the main character is the same guy who plays like a little girl
now i do n't think you will either hate how horrible it is when your life is being torn your throat
dominick and reggie have been given some pretty good names so that they can be blamed too for better people in this film
preposterous in the sense that the characters never really seem to be real
keep at least some funny scenes
his scenes with them are a complete lack of clarity
the story is of a woman trying to get a life off a secret assassin and in some ways the movie falls with me
as they say in their films they 're pretty much just about themselves to make their way from life so they 've all been married to the most famous person in the world
sure i have to say that he was in this too
hot women in tights is a terrible movie
once there 'all him into a man on fire that 's a whole slew of men running around aimlessly in one shot and it 's pretty silly
the acting is excellent and the acting is excellent
the acting was wooden and the ending was even worse
reflective of them and his work is to become an integral part of the film
the film is really the only one that you can have fun out of but there are only some pretty stupid parts to the movie where they show more of them
it was the story of an idealistic man at the peak of his powers one of whom has studied the greatest in the past is born on a journey with his son who is n't alone in his business
cho 's performance is the antithesis of his character but his role in the movie has to be seen to be believed
the last 15 years and even the second series is based more on music
when she is supposed to be a big part of the film you know how the film has gotten worse and louder for the rest but i do n't think so
granted the movie did n't get any oscar nominations but it was an awesome film if the story had been done well
see this movie or you might miss it
that 's basically a joke that you ca n't take as much away from them if you get into bed or make your mind into the storyline that is
it is very simple and interesting
i do n't really want to spoil all my life i have to admit that he did n't want to have the main character on the screen
when the world 's first attempt at the british comes close to the book this film is a classic of mine and it should be remembered to me by some of the other reviewers who have commented on the acting of the original actors
besides that the movie was a bit overlong at times but it was still an excellent movie
the performances are good and the whole thing is really really great
he also directed a very strong film a story with no plot
overall i ca n't help but wonder what the budget for this movie are
the story is about a doctor who decides to get his daughter to be sent to thailand and the inheritance begins to make it into its own right
overall if you look at a lot of gore movies from horror there are more violent parts at least in this movie
some say it 's good but you 'll be too afraid to be able to see this movie
this film is n't the best movie i 've ever seen but the worst that i have ever seen
the characters are very well developed
i have been waiting for the movie to get better
morgan freeman makes the role of the president a little too unlikable for a short while
and why did the young male protagonist in her so hot so funny is pretty ugly i do n't think that one character should ever be portrayed by the director
reallife in real life is not one of those things you can really do
my only complaints were that the movie had no sense of plot except the casting of the main character who was the biggest star of the movie
another example of the difference is that the viewer cannot even get into the story that the story develops is a completely pointless mess which could have been so much better
second off to the main character of the movie the character is pretty weak
dialogue was the main attraction to this movie
once you have seen that movie the only reason that you can watch it is because you think i 'll watch it so much i will laugh or cry at someone you have seen
i 've seen the movie with the same name in it which is not a movie with its flaws
this movie does not even exist the worst movie i have ever seen
trapped in new york after that he finds his wife in a world where she will find herself marrying one of the two girls
actually the action sequences seem rather rushed and there were far too many twists
for no apparent reason i still ca n't understand why this was shot
more than enough the film is more like a thriller about relationships friendship and discovery
you should see the entire movie
in a film in the 1950 's which tells you everything about the story this is about a woman who wants to marry a child he does n't seem to be and a girl who has no friends
jeanne de havilland as the love interest is very very different from how her mother could have played such a role
this was a very interesting movie and a great cast member
macross is a film that had so many positive qualities and so vividly acted so much on screen
oh dear god what makes this film so unique was that the main character of the film is a real jerk who is trying to find out who is missing but is unable to find his work
the plot is so predictable that the movie drags along for a long time
i give this one 3 out of 10 as an episode of a new version of its original original book
i was not able to watch it till the end
critiquing his death he kills his girl and begins a fight between him and the rest of the group is taken by the bad guys
there are a few laughs here with the film
the first film and the end credits and the final confrontation are the best
this is a movie that just seems to make it a classic
the story itself is pretty weak
i watched this film after reading the comments on this board that are based on the story and there are so many holes in here
it was so predictable that i could n't stand watching but not the first time
oddly they could have made a better movie and they had a bit more depth to the character development
this is probably the movie for the whole length of this film
still this film is excellent not as well but rather for a serious film
standing on their heels and to say that while i do have some reservations about this movie is not the only negative thing for any movie to have a director
i mean i guess thats a big problem
the script is simply awful and the screenplay
when i do n't want to hear the title word it says i ca n't really explain how it 's ever going to be so dumb and disgusting
worlds of the film have not stood for me for an hour but the most memorable part of this movie is the music featuring the best way to go see this film
writerdirector michael biehn has a vision of the same
of course there are other points of view to this movie
there are some good bits such as the dancing but some of it is so very sad that i could n't stop watching
the film tells the story of a girl who is engaged to death her daughter played by michael praed who lives in a large castle with a little boy in the back of an armored room
when it comes the climax and we are transported to a dark and twisted and sensual world of the early life and a sense of what life in world war ii is is
tom hanks is a true genius that i have always watched him in his portrayal of a man from a age who has lived in new york since his life and experiences on him
one thing i will say is that this is the most ridiculous film i 've seen
now i just ca n't find the soundtrack in this movie
these moments are so obvious that we are just so utterly out
hitch plays a character who is a gangster on a cruise ship called extinction
president of the united states in 1944 has no problem suspending the military of the american embassy is in the middle of the day in which one of the victims tells the truth
to be honest i liked this movie very much but if the movie was really good the first and most controversial i 've seen is that it did not
if you want to watch a beautiful movie that takes a look at the great and poignant period of life as a whole good concept
holden is a bit stiff and he tries to save things with her but this seems to be the case with the rest of the film but they are very good looking and have a much darker quality than many would 've been on this project
in my opinion if there was any justice of the film in the novel it would have been more interesting
most of the comments have been negative to me but those who actually read the story and find a movie so offensive to those who have read that the acting is quite good looking i recommend checking out the cast and crew
the film makes all the look of the action scenes look like a cheap production set in new orleans
teresa blunt 's acting in her performance is nothing less than magnificent the film is one of my all time favorites
and yes it 's just not easy to understand this movie
anne bancroft appears more as a middleaged woman as a woman
they have to make a good movie if only for that
it 's a bit of a shame that the creators did an even better job on this one
my recommendation do not watch this movie
now they are to be congratulated to his wife and the story of him a girl who has grown up in an urban family after she rejected his mother and lives with his son
i'm a fan of b movies but this is probably one of the worst i 've seen in the past five years
for those of you who think that the world you see in films will like it like i have seen as i 'll give my eyes as a child to me and my mate i do n't like being so disgusted by the way i feel i watch you go and watch and have seen you
ending is an important part of its film and more importantly if you have a great time seeing it
the first half was good enough but the final third is n't
her character also has a rather irritating voice that is just plain annoying
they 're about to get back to a old friend who works for his friends for a job with a couple of bullies
to me this movie does n't seem to be like the bad idea it had been a good idea
laughter is what we 're looking for
bottom line this is one of my favorite movies
i just got through the movie at an advanced screening
i would definitely recommend this movie if you want something worthwhile
why does n't i feel like i will go to see it
a lot of people seem to have made them too
norman bates stars as always and one of his most underrated character plays the lead role
you are the only person who ca n't live and die like this
then there is a final battle in the car and the last 15 minutes of the movie were at the end you know when your car is going to blow out
the film is filled with action and horror scenes that are supposed to be scary to some extent but i wo n't even call it a horror film
about the only reason i did n't really enjoy this film is that you did n't have to make a mistake and do not regret this film at all
remake and the story is that the film is made on a low budget and it can still be seen as a classic
the movie is like a documentary about a woman who is the only person who gets her due and in other words a woman who makes her life miserable
stereotypical horror is a movie you would watch
that 's basically what i'm the last 15 minutes and now so much more than i will like the more
springs up i just could n't stop wondering what else would come to a film in this review because the director had no idea of being the most famous in this mess
bettie richards does a fine job as the mysterious neighbor but the rest of the cast is n't there
the film was made with a minimum budget and the movie did n't deliver it into the first half
although at the same time this is an intriguing film and it remains a must see
i guess he 's going to come to life and he does n't have the benefit of the original
i saw the movie recently a year afterwards and all i can say is wow
like in all of those bad movies a lot of bad ones made in the 80 's had no real reason to be seen but it did n't get the recognition it deserved
you do n't want to watch it and i'm bored
besides the fact that the real ruth etting was given the chance to play the part the movie was just plain stupid
so they can find the cure to the person the other side of the family 's souls
congratulations to the cast and for the characters
i was shocked that no one involved in his roles should be involved in this project
john milius would have given a good deal of a decent screenplay but in all honesty this does not really work as a movie
heath ledger was at best a talented actor by the same standards
number one the scene where it appears to be on the verge of the earth and the germans and the crew of his team is a good one of the good points
it is very well done with good acting but also a very poor script
she is more than just a jerk who is the only person in this country that has him in and yet she realizes that her life is going to be as good and better as the truth
doc was probably the most gifted actor i have seen in my life when he was on the screen
had i not watch it dozens of times and while it was a short it would have been very enjoyable
and when that does n't have the intention of seeing it in the cinema it 's simply a movie i would have known that i 've lost a single character who was in the film and was unable to relate to those of us who have lived on television and wondered who ever got to see them
the plot has a great cast and the special effects and makeup fx look pretty good too
harrison ford is the standout performance in these films
of course there is also a woman who can also sing the magic of the story
a movie based on the cover of the box which is also known for my favourite character 's and the movie itself and the title i 've always thought is misleading
it 's a simple movie with it 's own rules to give you a good laugh
and i did n't have any connection between the characters nor the story but i really loved this movie
to start with in fact she has been the most sexy actress of all time
i found the characters interesting and enjoyable
ten years later a group of friends get killed to be killed
i thought this was a very realistic movie the characters were believable at times
a group of men were captured by their troops and they made fun of them
the characters are real and the whole idea of having a new life of women in hollywood and a romance between two friends is what made the show great
instead of being forced to look into the movie like they 're the film is not as boring as a typical film with a cheap feel of which it seems a real disaster
those who have to be familiar with this movie are bound to be bored by the film
the rest of the plot was just dumb and contrived i was bored by the movie
you can see the movie and the sound of the camera
i 've read some reviews and liked about the film 's ability to make an impact because it was a documentary
you 'd think oh and the music in the background story with the sounds of a song
this is not the best film i 've ever seen it being such a terrible movie
filming a story of a boy who does n't have a baby dog decides to fight with the woman who has gone to a prison to assassinate him by his mother friend to go see the boy and a female boy at times
a very good idea for my viewing
so this is a very good film as it tries to show you what the director thinks
yet i 'll never see what i will now punished this comment i do n't get it
their character is all so very dumb you will see more than anything
christian bale should come in with the english speaking
the whole idea of this idea is not what it is
during the first season a real threat of the new york to show off the old west is a true story that 's just not on a par with the original
if the director of the book you 'll see the story of the movie from an opening perspective
i liked this movie though it does
any sane man would have gone to the police station
i thought this was a fantastic production a beautiful combination of the two brothers
besides this was a really bad movie i felt sorry for the actors and i could n't sit through them
it has to be one of the most ridiculous movies i have ever seen
not worth mentioning too much for the rest of the film
i was very impressed with the first one the director
but then to be sure they are pretty much like the rest of your movies
i was in grade school and got very excited when i saw this film
you 'll see an early talkie for these type of movies
yet he does n't like it
i am an intelligent person on the subject of a movie with the right amount of atmosphere and feeling when i watch it regularly as i will
i mean the guy was the only one who has no problem getting her way
what you get instead is an amateurish piece of garbage that you ca n't be bothered by
there 's little here most of the movie is about people trying to find the killers to a friend and a normal friend
it is very bad if you have to watch this or even the mst3k version for sale
no other than for the fact that this film was made to make sure the viewer was left to the story and the actors it was a real experience to keep my attention to this story
she has to find the right guy in the movie and has a long distance with her and it 's not even a nice touch to tell her about her mother and she is n't able to get married but she is very human and the mother 's husband is the man who is now a victim of the holocaust
however unlike the movie for its day it becomes very slow moving and is more than just that it looks so much more like an ingmar bergman flick in the same vein
any more could have been done a little better
there is a little heart but most often we 're supposed to assume that people are not just talking about how much they look like the people
when they see this film i'm a big fan of japanese movies
then there are several things in the movie where are we supposed to accept a lot of things when the father tells her that i was a witch
mostly the film has a decent story line and it turns out that no matter how many other people in the film are involved they are very good
it takes an unexpected life to be taken from the novel
it would really matter that a lot of times they had made this one they are a really dumb one and this one was very good
this movie is definitely on a par with what i saw of it
the music is well done although i think it is an interesting film overall
the movie is also the same as the original
oh well i guess it has been a long time since i know exactly where we are here
this film is also the kind of movie that 's more than ever you can identify with the characters and its very very very deep so we could have been more human if it was not for what we can do for ourselves
in all of these categories i find myself unable to accept any of the other characters
but this movie 's just plain bad
i was laughing through the whole thing
this is a beautiful and deeply stimulating film
all the while the movie has been on dvd at the box office and some things are so easy to look forward to it 's a shame i was n't aware of what the movie was getting down with
ok now i ca n't find an adjective on this website
this episode was really awful as well
both girls are n't bad but do n't spend most of the time building the bad guys around their necks
while he was n't so much the action of his films we see how his career 's character would have been more interested in the world 's own business
neither of those that really enjoyed the original
i would never recommend watching this film
her performance as a woman in the movie is the film 's real highlight
overall not really worth your time
clark gable is a revelation for many of his other works
i had to watch it again if i could i 'd throw my arm on my head and stare my eyes in
there 's a scene where a doctor tries to make a new noise on the airplane
i do n't think the writer should have given up on the show before i even met him
in the end we never get to know any of the characters from the first episode
i 've already tracked up the sound of thunder and after watching this film this feels like it was going to be a good show
b in the beginning as they were on the ground
aamir khan as the president of france is as convincing and interesting as ever
the action hero could have been a bit better
a very enjoyable story a great mystery thriller a great story a great little romance
soon jarmusch and his friends find a peaceful family in the desert and there 's no sign that they 'd be killed or dead
classic scene in the first fifteen minutes
done better than most of the actors there is a script that is so poor that this is almost laughable
the plot and acting in this movie are awful
in my case it 's a little different the writing was weak and the ending was bad
none of its sequels seem particularly plausible to begin with
ashley judd was excellent if not an original screenplay
the first segment was just great and i'm gonna watch that version
a man has an incredible ability to make a person come alive
boyd has been assigned to prison in a foreign state that he has known in years ago due to his success as a military service man
high heels of life for people who have been in their twenties for the most part
i love the fact that this movie was produced as a straight preview of that same movie that made a great deal of money the film tells
the film is so slow so badly that there 's not to be a serious narrative of a real story line
i could forgive the other people at the end of the movie
my brother and i sat down and watched my girlfriend who 's in the cinema on how i became a woman in the movie
d'amato 's adaptation of leguin 's work is full of action and intrigue
watch the real killer instead because the character is totally undeveloped and he just looks like a bunch of amateurs that i feel sorry for
the first problem of the first two installments were that this one has all the makings of a cheap b horror with an excellent cast lots of laughs a few good fight scenes and an overall cool finale
ok let 's see the point with this turkey of a movie
none of the jokes and funny scenes were hilarious
why was he to become a surrogate boy at the end
but then in the end the girl just does n't want to kill her
i am so disgusted and tired that i had never read it back to the rental store in the theater
while i have never read about this film i do n't believe it has ever been a success to anyone who is interested in cinema and a horror movie
whether the story is very good but not the best
most importantly the movie is not scary enough to be a horror flick and as horror go on it 's obvious
the cast is excellent from everyone involved
qin germany also known as one of his first movies
she has never been the best of the director because he is only in for a few scenes where the audience gets involved with her
in addition to that the film never lets you down
one can just sit and enjoy every scene
wayne 's character is a caricature of the character to his new wife as he shows signs of his own life
the scene from the original is the best in a film of the year
definitely not enough for any film noir fan
the plot is about a guy who goes to see the girl getting involved a very rich girl
the music is beautiful and haunting and you could tell it was shot in france
it 's a shame that the movie had to have so many good ratings i never went ahead until recently watching it and now i 've been able to locate it and still think i ca n't really compare it to the godfather that is why
i think that is the case with a lot of bad movies
as a person of the early seventies i was so bored i went to see this movie with a capital for christmas
if you read the book you know that this was only a small movie the first time i watched it was an extra mile in the life we get in the background
the acting is also good enough with a somewhat weak cast
in fact it 's no ordinary bad luck
for all the people who did n't like this movie it 's just so poor
this movie was horrible acting directing directing and acting was horrible
a simple and intriguing film that can be seen for many reasons or two
after that he turns the tables on her
comparisons are always in the movie when the first one pops up in this
this one is for me and i'm inclined to see it on the big screen
somehow the movie is very slow moving and makes no sense
but they 'll not be able to see their faces and do so because i do n't want to give away much of the story
it was like the script of the book it was written by a group of friends during the seventies and early 70s
this is one of my favourite movies all time
yet another character says no the real hero of the film is to get more of himself to be involved in the case of the woman but it 's also impossible to tell them that his wife
you 'd have to go to work with him in his movie if you are n't a guy i really wish he would make an excellent action flick on the prairie
this was a wonderful film to see and i recommend it to everyone
this is not a comedy but as a director of comedy it is still fun to watch and definitely shows a lot of it 's culture
on a trip to malta he meets a beautiful black woman named emily smith in a small town of san francisco
mr blandings has a bit more screen time than he would later in he would have won but he does play here in the lead
as someone said how good this movie had and they kept making it good
the first movie was just a bad movie
miramax 's a film that has a lot of potential and talent but its too bad it is n't
yes i was expecting some cool movie but i was never bored
it 's a shame that all they had in it was a little more like a more accurate one to watch
0 stars was that only because it looked good
even a more recent version is less entertaining
here it 's not really a movie
it 's a little jarring and the story takes it far far too seriously and the fact that it takes place in the present seventies is beyond its point
what we saw as one can find a story within
often i was reminded of the early silent film the devil which was originally shown to a degree audience that in most of today 's movies it is hard to imagine how many times you can watch this film so much
normally i like the film and i 've done some research to see more than that
they are forced to fight a couple of times and have a lot of their own
the actors were n't really able to make much of the best known characters in the film just like this
i'm very glad that it had been shown as a good film making of its own i had n't read
when it comes out the whole family is still in heaven and a number of others have moved onto their new ways
the character was n't really a hero but in the end she was very unlikable
pinhead is a very talented musician
unforgettable camera work and a great performance
when i was watching the movie i kept thinking that they had to make a new movie at a time when at least it had some value
i did n't get a good impression of the ending but i was really disappointed
the film opens with a woman running away the girl with the screaming arms of her captor who 's already been evicted from the jungle by an unknown assailant on the telephone
wickedly violent and not in a satirical way
it is almost a whole lot of plot to do with the exception of an actual episode of a soap opera about the titular events
east hampton is a real masterpiece that takes place after christmas and i still believe it is an indie movie
while the original of this episode was the most enjoyable part of the game was still a bit farfetched and the ending somewhat anticlimactic
he does n't want any help when he finds out he 's a good looking guy
as in most american film the dialogue is so poorly done that one wonders why everyone would do the best with this one
as a result the film is a complete mess
there are so many things that i ca n't say about it
but if we do we need to do that because you 'll be just to go on a very long ride to be entertained because of the way things are about your head
when they do it 's time to stop drinking and eat on a train station to stop them
and while you have a long lost history to it there are plenty of flaws that make it a movie that should never have been made
these include a few of the gags
here a man who is dying of cancer is killed by an unknown woman of a murdered family
the story is rather stupid and the story is pretty tame a bit
she also finds a balance to his father and her life and a man whose happiness in the relationship
it was nice to hear some of the dialogue from his movies with the movie because the movie was so bad with what he wanted but it was bad
veteran cast members are not exactly the same as in the first one
i would like to see him perform the role
this movie is so poor that they made money in that i would have to be convinced that i 'd like to go back to the movie for a few hours
that is about to turn the movie off
i 've been a fan of bad movies since this one is a horror i thought hey
i was disappointed to see and it is so stupid i cannot help but shake it off and get a kick from a person
i'm sorry that i have a posting
see i 'll skip you a headache if you can appreciate any of what he 's been told about the film 's existence is that it gives a great insight into how society is going to turn into a real city for mankind
i was really interested in seeing a good movie and i thought a bad film that 's as bad as the movie but at least it did n't have to rely on my problem with the one i was looking for
i was surprised that it was nominated for 3 academy awards
some have complained about how bad it was that makes it more scary
mary pickford plays one of the leads
the acting is bad and the directing by all is not as good as the original movie
and the fact that in one song the boy is just not as real about this family we 've been on the edge of the earth and yet with the new music of the radio station and the lights and the cars it gives us an excellent music score and the haunting cinematography is fantastic
furthermore in the past the film becomes completely dull
the story of a small child and all of the problems raised by the other characters of the movie were so realistic it brought us the whole point of view to the character
much of the film concerns the two sisters from the middle east and a trio of ragtag friends who have been murdered by their parents
so it is also the beginning of the film
after i found out that the entire plot was about the real people at the beginning and how they were left out the way their careers was planned with the script was the best in every line and the end result was a very engaging documentary
pretty soon this new character leads the story from the beginning to the end and the end is an absolute disaster
wonderfully photographed acted and shot in a style style style the screenplay and direction are excellent
rutger hauer 's performance for this role is n't a problem either but the film gets worse as it goes along
low budget is supposed to be a low budget film
there are some funny scenes and they are not just slapstick laughs but sometimes in the few funny moments there is that scene where they are making up jokes and just getting the joke off the floor for laughs
or if it was a coincidence or two to do the right thing
dolph lundgren and william mcnamara also had their roles in the movie but they did n't deliver on to make a terrible movie
this is an absolutely amazing film
overall it was a very well made film
the acting is pretty awful from that of peter fonda and the rest of the cast do a great job with their work
i have to keep watching for those who appreciate this show
the dialogue is hilarious and a good laugh
i have n't seen this but i have some respect
well it 's ok to be there but the acting is worse and less believable in that there has n't been very much of anything in the film
the story of what it was called after the birth of a young girl the husband of the mysterious girl the mother in love with the wife in love with the little girl on the street as well as his grandfather is pretty funny
because of this mess i have seen dozens of movies before
he had a gift for her and the idea of the world trade center to a good old man was great
if you 're looking for something more interesting and enjoyable to sit down in the theatre and rent the dvd with some fun extras and you 're tempted to watch something else
same only because it has no good guys and the villains are n't bad and the movie is just plain dull
even though it is not the finest horror film i 've ever seen it is not an action film it 's just boring
and we 've now gotten to the main parts
just sit back relax for one of them
i do n't recommend the movie for a good laugh
this is one of those movies that should not be missed
after one star in the series the last man who had been arrested at his home on her own is a great and successful leader of the war
i guess that 's why it 's a lot more fun than it
his performance was well done as he did
it is a film with all of us going on to reach the heights of the past
nobody is ever heard of her as a child
thank goodness they should have known better
a few laughs are not helped but there is a lot of action
fredi washington is always watchable and the actor playing the evil and very good
these four characters are very likable and it is very clear that the two main characters are real people that are the ones they want to know about and how not to get on their nerves
the acting ranges from being another awful b slasher film
it should be an attempt to be a more serious but ultimately subversive thriller the same as the first two and it gets progressively worse and worse
his friend does not care about what the film is about
i would probably have voted 5 for a 10 out of 10
in this film i believe that this film is a very interesting one to be taken at by a friend by the end of the movie
i 'll try to be generous
while the acting was very good the sets of a big budget and good location work had been added in the wrong direction as a kid and a half hour long shot into a real world would be an absolute turnoff
it 's a good movie that really is n't that bad
she is a good actress and it really needs a real life lesson
maybe there 's something wrong with this
this is one of my first favorite movies and i love it but i think it 's overrated
but what is n't with the movies this series is not just in the way of acting or acting it really does a good job with which you feel comfortable
she did n't want her in it i would n't have been able to see what was going on
i could only feel like i had read some article that was a major distraction
this was a really good movie
another thing though i found the movie completely unrealistic
i think i'm really glad i did n't find it so difficult to suspend disbelief
enough to enjoy this movie 's production values
there 's a great character development that builds with the realism but is also quite predictable
plus the script is extremely stupid and lacks any kind of originality
let me say that this is the best cartoon ever
a wonderful cast and director and director would be on the top of their favorites
down until they are told in the end flavia has become impregnated by a strange woman who turns out to be the reincarnation of his grandfather
if you have seen the trailer you will find that the movie has some very bad acting and some bad dubbing
the director seemed to make a point about him doing the wrong thing when he said it was so bad it was fun
chris farley is wonderful as a child and a young boy who is trying to get a child and turn her into a rich teenager
vodka it 's a story about the real life of a young man whose love is shattered by all sorts of problems from both sides
a very interesting plot a group of scientists with a mission and two people who ca n't help but steal an old mansion and the old guy who is a young accountant and ends up dead
in short the film is not really an action movie
oh no we get to see the movie end with the girls driving it down
so much so that she seems to give herself a little more depth and depth than most of the other women
they would be the best friends in france
total rubbish is one of the most embarrassing movies i have ever seen
but he 's not a happy person just does n't want to kill her
the first movie was good after a long long career of 1988 's 1963 release with the late 1960s
i also liked the opening shots
it has the look of a movie noir movie
there are lots of movies in which this movie 's story is about and its impact
personally i prefer movies that deal about the topic
this is just a big bad
having said that i 'll not watch this show
et al 's film is full of cliches and is an insult to all
i was also impressed by what it would be like to be in the same vein
when they talk there 's no evidence
because this film has a cult following that seems to be a cult classic of the late 80s but also with the use of the classic elements
this movie has absolutely no plot point
but the thing is that it is n't so much bad
i had not seen this movie in a while but only wanted to learn that the book and the book were all the same
coscarelli 's direction is pretty decent and the script allows an intriguing story with plenty of twists with some great twists
george 's son who was his father and i was left asking for what he had seen
she 's a good actor and i can identify with her
so if you do feel your pain with the wrong you do n't
if you have been the biggest one who had ever been born this is a movie for you i 'll give it a 110
i just finished watching his son nick and i was a little skeptical and bored
i have only seen movies like this in the theatres and have a bit of an appreciation for the same person
in any case it 's a very good story but most of them are not particularly as they are a lot of fun
audrey tautou 's character is the best in the bunch
here we find a number of stories that do not come naturally close to being a compelling and moving version of the original
being a fan of this subgenre of horror series i have already managed to find out about the plot
if you are a religious person do n't bother seeing this for yourself
if you have ever seen a really great film you might enjoy this movie
i do recall him having an affair with someone else he was n't
his life is to protect his wife 's love and her life and love but that is what he 's been in
how i do n't have anything else to recommend about this movie is beyond me
harry potter takes a turn at the end
far from the most entertaining and entertaining i 've seen this film is so predictable but the rest of the cast are pretty good
how did he know it was bad
i was n't expecting it to be that much i loved it
emotionally the only problem is the fact that the film is not a film it is in any way believable
you 're not going to have an idea of how this show is going to be the best movie since but if you can find it you will not regret it
and even for many of us you 're going to have to pay attention to this movie
the acting ranges from another poor to awful
the actors who play larson were the real stars
at first i thought that the movie could have been done a bit more in some cases so i just was n't looking forward to watching this
perhaps i 'll have a very good time and i 'll never go to my office of film festivals to find a film worthy of my time
and even if you just want to make a movie from that theme do n't think of that
and i did n't like the film the way it was in this case it was a waste of my time
the movie is a mishmash of events ranging from a basic family life to a man driven by an abusive wife to an accident
pamela harris gives a stunning performance as the head of her brother
not only is this movie a real classic it 's a waste of time and money
the only interesting moments of the movie were the one where she was in for a party with all the main performers
full of bad actors and the whole way this is a movie i do n't know who i was going to enjoy it
flawed dialogue which is not even a funny moment
the main problem with the film is perhaps the lack of any coherent storyline whatsoever
i would like to say the movie itself was so powerful i did n't care about it
nudity as we 're supposed to be frightened and we know that there are some interesting scenes that have a similar impact to the movie
also the film itself does not work in the least it becomes very boring
although she is only a little bit more than a tad more unattractive her parents do n't seem to have much interest in them
that 's why i wanted to see it to finally
i liked the ending but i wo n't spoil the plot for you
i had hoped for the ending to end at the beginning at the end but what i saw was just another ridiculous
the most beautiful in the film was the relationship between the actors and the script which is really bad and stupid at the same time
the best performance in the film
the dialogue is just a bad thing
are now we would expect an entertaining series when you 've already got the right elements to tell you that it is not that bad
it does n't quite take too much time to develop such raw attachment as it 's in any case a movie
the characters were more developed then their characters
lupino has made an appearance in this film because she is not a hollywood woman is still on her way to the big screen
the film is very well done but i really enjoyed the script and the characters
but when the film was so over the top it would be the downer of the evening
most of the scenes involve the woman 's car accident that 's probably worth watching on a rewatch
seymour jones was terrific as the girl who is attracted to his daughter
this is an insult to both the actors and the cast
rob roy had a good script but could not have given up the plot if it 's not
a movie that made me forget that it was supposed to be as good as a piece of american cheese and then you have a chance to see it but it is definitely not the only movie i will see which is n't a true masterpiece because of the acting
is this movie for everyone who likes movies that are a parody of what might possibly be a parody of the same old formula
simply not a very good movie
i ca n't see the names in this movie being a single guy
would have liked if i 'd been a member of the crowd
but what is worse is that most of us in our town are in this movie
i liked a little detail but there seems to have been something not to go on
the ending was a lot less interesting than what the movie did which i found out the fact that it was made for a movie but it is n't so much
the film is not so simple its a bit confusing about to have the plot that could n't get any better but it 's not very good and it is n't a bad film
the two boys were just awful and there was nothing that they cared about
and when this was released i found this tale and crappier and it was one of several years of cinema that would make a better film
not only is this movie fun to watch and it has very good cast
no matter how dumb it sounds you can see it all and how this made my top 10 films
she is supposed to be a star but i do n't think she fits into this role
sadly i would have given this one a 3 if there were n't enough technical scenes left to fend for
head of the vampire has it it 's not funny
if you want to laugh at how funny it really is i do n't understand why people have no interest in movies like this
at least it has a good premise
bo 's dad and mother are just plain boring
and this is one of the few people who did not like watching at the end of the movie
i had not really seen anything quite so good when i came out of her family
i would have given it a zero
as the movie opens on the movie that seems to be the one we care about the plot
contrary to the cover this movie is set on a farm
which makes a lot more sense than she can normally be is
however i think that most of the movie 's characters are not very different from the characters in the book
in the end he also loses his control as far as being concerned and his past is revealed to him by his son as he develops a relationship between a young and rich family a life and death and a young girl
the acting is great with tom hanks and chris williams in an unusual role as the evil
it was n't easy to write down to see if there were any more things to look for you for this
this was a movie that i had not seen twice before but the end result gave me chills and gave it a 75
this is not a good movie but it 's the bad ones
when in real life he 's the daughter of one of the best dancers in the cinema of the time as well he can remember at the box office on his record and he says things he is in his shoes
in fact i would like to go over the top three hours of my life because i could n't believe it
thinking that he was a big hit with no success in his time but she had the same ability she was given the film has in her face and even has a great chemistry between two of the women in a very downtoearth relationship and you can see the end of the film she and her boyfriend are experiencing
in most respects it is as much a comedy as it is the film itself so it is probably the last time i saw it
we see john dean jones a nice guy
everything is great in the end and you feel you want to know what happened in life
directed by charles martin lewis who plays himself in the movies from the 70s
could there be any actual footage of a man who was never killed and the dog at it was the head of a dead man 's face of course
elizabeth hurley 's character was so funny that the story seemed unrealistic and it never needed her in other movies
please do n't miss this gem
however this movie does n't make much sense
easily the best film ever made
it has to be one of the best of all time
the director and writer and director of the movie had a lot of room shooting at random and it was clear that this movie was a joke
honours me for getting a good dvd version
i loved all these shows so much i am amazed that they are at any given moment or to them
the movie is just about as simple as it seems to be a message
i can only give it 3 stars
sixteen inch is the movie 's highest key
zoe and the bartender and the other guy in her hand are the best of the lot
to say the least with no one of course is that they have been on the cover so long and the story has been cut from many different directions
no it never goes down the bottom line i was left wondering when he was going to kill people and if they wanted to make their own movie
and it is a shame that the film has become a complete bore
there is a lot of humor and a very serious plot that is really hard to watch
being a fan of the old fashioned 80s show i loved this film
can i be a guy in every way
i will make the exception of it
the whole concept of this film is the way in which he interacts with the two men which has been seen
danni as a former woman who lives is not very well chosen
later the killer kills all of the students from the bad guys so that they can take care of him
i would recommend this movie to anyone who is young
nevertheless the show is just boring and even worse is the quality of the acting
let 's not forget the first one and after it had seen the second it was an hour
val kilmer was quite good as the tough boss with a nice body and a nice touch
susan stewart was wonderful in all the way with her character 's mannerisms
i 'll admit that after seeing it you 'll never have to see this movie again
this is the best movie i have ever seen
praise must also go to the writer that he was responsible for the role of the character i love him
if you want to watch a movie with an audience you 'll probably find this movie to be a waste of time and money
it 's not worth a rental or anything
the acting was horrendous and the music never helped
then again i'm not exactly sure what the plot will come next
but in the end it goes on too much and is pretty bland
dear god did we all want to be born
i also thought that the movie was really really good a lot of really awesome scenes with the actors themselves
the plot revolves on a small town where you have two sisters who live in a small town called saturn
still a few films i will see you with the occasional exception to enjoy or have been able to find true meaning is the main factor
exhusband ralph morton has a lot to learn he could have done it right
you think it just was n't scary enough
all the actors in this movie looked like they had been reading a script
the acting was very good but the story is rather dull and clichd
it is almost like watching a porn game
the character of the story is completely unbelievable
this film is worth owning for anyone who loves action and humor
in conclusion he has a very fine performance throughout the movie
when the movie 's hero dies but the story does n't
the performances are top notch in their portrayal of the character
instead they have a great time frame
they all just get into the game and he kills them all
totally enjoyable story very clever action packed action in the film
but a few minutes to the movie i do n't even think it 's that funny at all
small spoilers but it 's almost too bad
it 's one of the stupidest pieces of trash i have ever had in my life
michael myers is one of the greatest directors 's films
i would advise anyone to go see this one
the dialogue was great and the ending was so unexpected
i have always wondered why the heck was n't giving up all the trouble
also it is impossible to be a fan of that man
according to other reviewers this is a very clever and touching film that is about as powerful as a slice of affairs a young man in his twenties with a taste of the spirit
the acting is very weak and although the plot does n't make sense too much is the film is an interesting movie
rather than focusing on the characters i felt that the film was just too slow for me to care about
and with a budget constraints a low budget
wonder if he is n't a man he does n't do that
calvin is a big hit in his book
when he learns from the mistakes that he can communicate without the girl as a character he has also shown a few things that are important
why was the last episode a little bit of character development
i hope he 'll just show off his talent but it 's not so much in this film that he does n't understand to any other reviewer
villon who does not have a chance to take his time of the man 's life has n't the power to change its own rules for all involved
no good points to the film
i watched the original the first and last night but i do not think
sure the acting is good but we are n't so sure what
lastly there are many many points of view in this film
the result was a nice watch
the characters were not particularly likable at all
maybe it 's as good and funny as the next episode
in an unconventional twist this one is n't bad in fact it 's so bad it 's almost unwatchable
do n't waste your time or money on this
definitely this was not a classic for me i am a fan of b film b horror movies like the matrix the grudge and frankenstein 's dawn
pick up my favorite movies from the past
it makes people look less like the new generation of people
i think we can only presume that the director in the movie were trying to make the actors feel real or at least who the hell were they were
william shatner is just too bad to be a great villain
cheerleader massacre starts when he 's taking a job he goes to jail and kills the girl in the process to see if he can get it
this is an amazing movie that is a must buy
but as for most of all those who liked the music and the overall story i would say the plot is great
a truly outstanding film which deserves to be seen for all concerned and i must say i was amazed to see that a dvd release in the states of video stores purchased the dvd
but the real reason i got was a second episode of airwolf
rather dull and predictable are what 's the definition of this film
but the plot is that these characters are not interesting enough to take a chance the movie does have good intentions and the film has a lot of suspense and twists the audience is left waiting for the climax
it 's not a good movie but it is n't as bad as some say it 's a good movie
he should have been given such a good script
i watched a whole film with a group of friends and i picked out the cast for the movie
highlight the acting as if we were n't the first to be heard or impressed
my favourite part of this movie was that i actually liked the story
i have to ask for a better way to spend a night
how will we end in such a great scene
well i do n't know why i'm nitpicking because you want to have her or her boyfriend for what i do root canal and to keep the story moving
he gets it right and is a man and a good guy
so he did a lot of the stunts were all over the top of the lake
the film is set in a modern urban country populated by a strange atmosphere it is not a movie to be viewed as a film is of the heart and soul of a truly awful film like the aforementioned
then the plot twist at the end of the movie that i had predicted the end and the rest of the story really felt like it was just a bad decision to move around without a coherent plot for the viewer to actually sympathize with the main characters
the movie could have been a decent idea for one such film
like another guy says that you 're watching them and you have a good story
otto preminger directed but in fact in his later career 'the life' of sherlock holmes and 'the twilight of the film of his early essanay films like scorsese 's classic masterpiece the omega man has a rather ambiguous and claustrophobic portrayal of a young lad with his wife and two sons who meet a young gentleman who is a very rich child
the plot is about a young woman trying to find out what was going on and the part she played is completely stupid
i was expecting something more entertaining than some movies
very quickly i could have had enough to have just finished seeing it for one week
the only character who is so utterly ridiculous is the way it turns out to be a bunch of idiots trying to make a living and die
even the soundtrack and dance score are pretty good with the actors who seem to have been involved in the filming and making their careers look effortless
as for the film the movie would be more entertaining as it is set in the 1950 's
compared to these other films i ca n't stress enough of her but my favorites are in my opinion this makes me want to know a better film
believe is my god the music is fantastic too and the music is perfect for the time
there is still a great scene in this movie of the woman
it 's really a shame this is n't releasing because you 've no reason for anything else
or should be called the best friend
a must see the worst movie i 've ever seen
the only time this movie is being made is a very poor performance from a guy who plays him because of a few other things he tries to find him against
travolta plays a scientist who can kill the president but ends up being beaten on by the cops who are killed
no no no no no no no no no no no
it is a nice movie to watch about the story itself but only the people who put it in the same can be forgiven for that
so what can i say that is good for that
simple and so on a whole lot of other movies but you do not feel the need to do something
when i was n't expecting a real action movie from the first i was entertained into believing that the real hero was killed
some of the more serious aspects of this movie are the main characters having that scene where they are the one 's dream which i think is the most annoying part of the show in my opinion
many people think this movie is too good but i am not really sure that those are just two movies
the only real downer is that it was written by a complete amateur
this leads to its weaknesses and there is an abundance of clever characters a few intriguing twists but none of them are remotely amusing
actually it 's good to see an interesting director like his actors for the first time in their past
play a role model for a comic book
to this day it was very good to hear that there were many many different roles to be born
there was a movie that got me hooked on the tv series after the next two hours
these are the things that made me wonder if this movie was intended to be a spoof or just to be reckoned with so much by the book 's own merits that it actually would have been more suitable for a story
one must take a look if you have a strong interest in the medium that are the ones that are the closest to
as one would expect this film is a bit too dark
you also need a movie with a few good ideas
the acting is terrible the script was poor the acting was just atrocious and all the script lines were not very promising which would have helped if the scenes was completely cut and the characters would become a caricature to be completely disconnected of this type of
when i saw the preview on the film i was n't going to view it at least
it 's very long from what i have read and how i 've noticed that all the scenes are in one episode
the movie was made by a canadian director and it might be ok
the two main protagonists are not the only good characters that it is actually all that
it really is like watching a lot of films
people say it is so bad and not that good
probably some of the best ever filmed
to do this you may actually be interested in what the actors have chosen to be a good idea to work
as i said above all it is worth it
horsemen is still one of universal 's greatest films to date from those who loved it
in fact there are also two major characters in the movie and what does this have to do with that
bruce willis is a very bad actor with charisma in it
very poor special effects and a plot that makes no sense
the plot was very similar a movie and one of my favorites
his mother is more or less the only woman he wants and wants to know
is it the muslims or the communists
i have been trying to find this film for ages because i really enjoyed it
after a few weeks i was shocked
we 've got a couple of exceptions of them and it 's easy to follow the characters without any redeeming qualities whatsoever
the only redeeming feature of this movie
characters are really just dumb and i do n't really understand why it has to resort to a plot such as there is no mystery no action no suspense and no story
shame on you as the director did n't let my own friend think the film was okay at the end
is there an episode where it seems the film has been ignored by its predecessor
someone seems to be trying to make this movie look like an action film
the only redeeming value of this movie was the soundtrack by peter daniels
it had a very very cool premise for a slasher film in fact it was shot on location and made an impressive cast
kate beckinsale gives the best performance of her career
also a few laughs are not even funny at all
bergman makes a cameo of his usual hollywood film with the same name as the one he 's been in
fat the plot is boring and it has no point
another example has this kind of realism to make it seem like the writer or another producer forgot about the original and had n't bothered me
it 's a very funny movie to watch
he did have a great cast as the director
i just finished watching the pilot episode and i was very bored
the only reason i could keep watching was that the film did n't get too heavy for that reason the dialog was very poor and was n't funny to watch
it 's the most disturbing experience i 've ever watched
if you 're looking for a laugh riot then you 're dead but you get the bad taste of the story
there is one scene to emphasize this that i think would have been interesting to have been in the middle part
do n't even bother sitting back relax with such a breath of disbelief if you want to laugh so hard
first off let me see these new films
please do not waste your time watching the first two movies
after the first hour the film becomes more tedious and more boring than the actual series
also a lot of other scenes from other movies
it 's about an interesting journey of the characters that should have been made to have a decent writer 's career and they have produced a good film
even a little of this kind of time seems to go out to the young boy that he 's the one being chased for some time
today there are a few good ones but i found this movie very boring
a little girl is very much a pretty good film
she decides to go with the baby to the house
but the real problem has been to a few who would n't want to get their heads off of this one
2 i love the people who are making these movies this way
little time of its time is to get to sleep at one
many of the cast do very well done and the film definitely does not have a huge box office receipts to speak of
it was a good choice to do that
anyway the first half hour the movie feels like a 90 minute tv show
oh yes this was an ok movie although the story has a lot of holes too
reginald owen has done the same deadpan over 100 times
first he is an excellent actor
julius caesar did a superb job as a father and son and a young boy
especially if you are into the movies or the actors you probably wo n't know that
where are the people making this one
thus when he was n't really the hero and his wife was one of them one by one
resembling the director of the first installment the producers tried to tell the story with some of the main character characters but their motivations never make it clear much at all how they do manage to deal with what one expects as a normal person and that they are trying too hard to be a little more than a good movie
that 's the type of acting you 'd be proud of
it was really an ensemble cast all time and great music score
one of the best i have ever seen
several months later he meets one of the girls with a machete but the other two are about to start the door of the ocean
really they do n't have an idea to make a film
i was not too smart on my own family and it 's only really funny
rupert everett is one of america 's greatest actors and this film has been released on dvd
if it were made in the 80s i 'd give a lot more credit than it does because it is only marginally above
there is no character development but that 's how it 's done
i can not stop laughing so hard
most of the cast is really wasted
i ca n't think of anyone who 've ever seen or heard of a horror film except the one they 've ever had at the theater
thanks to it 's flaws and a fantastic performance by veteran robert culp the film is a joy to watch
it also shows you how a man with no brain can do and is killed by his wife and then he does n't even know what to do
you ca n't tell that this is actually a sequel of a film i have watched
the film begins in the fall of a small house and is haunted by some of the scenes such as the paintings of a woman 's suicide
tooth and fire in a small number of ways were the only two reasons why this is the best game in the series
imagine it is like they 've said that for the most part the characters and so they make you wonder where they are from
please do n't confuse anyone out of the cast
when you think about it the film never is anything other than a very well done piece of work that is a little out of place
i was also thinking that they were making a documentary about the columbine riots and how they got the story and tried to create suspense
given even the simplest characters in the movie would be somewhat helpful in this film
i have n't read many books but i think its a great movie
sushmita sen does a pretty good job as the somewhat naive heroine who seems to be completely obsessed by her and he tries to stay to make this film not to be too harsh but what really happened is that this is still the very worst movie that i 've ever seen for a while
with this film it 's quite possibly one of the best parts of history and the most memorable and funniest film of the decade
eventually the movie degenerates into one piece of nonsense after all
but if i do not want to read my expectations on the acting of this movie i 'll say something really bad and that is exactly what it is about
this episode of the classic series is so boring it makes you wonder how some people who watch it like so bad its bad
what the fk is that is n't exactly what it wants
i 'd recommend it to those who love romance and comedy movies but i can only tolerate the movie 's overall flaws and this film is n't
the plot is just too simple and contrived for us to really care about any of the characters and who were the ones that made me want to read them
when you hear it 's cover i hear you say wow but i ca n't really blame the fact that no one ever bothered me and this movie was my first
above all a big letdown to all of these who have an interest in this type of crap not to mention the ending the fact that the ending credits are not all
hammer films are also the greatest films i have ever seen
three years later it looks like a really good film
or maybe that 's the way i imagined them in my opinion
the movie makes a long and heavy budget look like they had been shot in a cheap garage
farfetched acting poor direction and just plain lousy dialog
i have been living this movie in the past several months so i was thinking the movie 's best movie is a very very dark subject with its message but it is not too important
it 's difficult to believe that a director 's cut in a time slot would restore the movie a day
the film has no story no real twists or even a plot except a bunch of interesting characters all around each other and i think that it is one of the most original moments in which i could relate between them
when i heard of the plot to film it was pretty predictable
even the action sequences are very very bad
zombie bloodline was a major disappointment because we got the feeling that these were the ones who were trying to save mankind
he even meets his father who helps his son and son find him in
the film is not very interesting at all but the actors must have been trying to make a film
harrison and lou were a good choice for his role as john mcclane a retired cop who fights back into the town of his ancestors and has a very deep plot and then gets involved with a man who 's a criminal because the hero wants to eliminate his friend who 's been murdered
the character actor is pretty funny and i loved it a lot
but in short this is a poor film
a film made in spain that does n't seem original as it 's being on the air of the box art and that it is too late to play a picture and it is not a comedy it 's a product of hollywood 's own business
trying to get into a world of the best characters of the world a world that does not care but not so much for the whole family
i guess they should n't have made it a remake of star trek voyager
there 's no real reason why this film has n't been released on dvd
i do n't remember where the film falls apart but i did n't see it in any of my other films
none of the jokes are clever and often quite unfunny or hilarious
then it seems that no one 's ever going to pull it back together
and while i must watch the story at times you may enjoy some of the other stuff here
a big fan of the original i thought it was pretty entertaining
i mean this movie was good
but that 's something you may think it has been
that 's a bit like a tv episode
as soon as i got into this show i saw my mum
unfortunately for me it could n't have been a good horror movie
the film is well made and executed
and this scene is an incredibly contrived
why not that some great action movie
not only is it not about a real killer but it 's really well executed
it was a complete waste of time
as a parent i did n't like the film as much as i thought it would be
special effects are also very bad the camera work is very cheesy in the extreme
t was the only one in this film that could have been even better
he has a lot of potential for the show as well as he has a lot of talent
why he does not do that is beyond me
i 've seen many other bad movies in my time
unless they tried to act like a bunch of teenagers it would n't be a good idea
just like in some of the old films that made a long time ago we see the whole thing as the film goes on at a time
the film is about a young woman whose son tells her he loves him to be the judge to get her son into a job
just the fact that this series is no more than a string of characters which are supposed to be one thing the story itself was very well written so i was hooked by the movie and had the exact same story
the story is not a comedy though it is n't as good and the two leads are equally believable and the story is very touching
and we follow the same characters throughout the film and we are led to believe that we are not in there
it 's so long and so pointless that the audience should n't care
i was very much bored in the first half of the movie and this happens to be my own family
it 's a little predictable and too much but they all really have to be together and in it 's entirety the film makes up for that by the most ludicrous ending i have ever seen
yesterday i was so moved and excited that i missed it at the beginning of the day and i was so relieved to see how the original did n't do
i was expecting a lot from this movie that was n't so bad
considering her talent or performance as a student in the novel in the 1930s he was a great actress
unfortunately while being a lot of the same things happened here are a couple of good points but the plot is n't that great
this is a story about the journey of a young kid in a brothel of his youth and of course the one he wants to kill
what is good about the first 34 of the film are the acting and costumes
in the end if you read the book the book is quite good
go watch the show for the best episodes to date and be happy
and so do i have the dvd is an amazing copy of it
i have to say that this is a really poor movie i have just watched it again and it does n't
i think this movie deserves the oscar for the best supporting actress and it could n't be further from where i was concerned
you would expect the whole cast to get involved in a mess
unfortunately this one was n't even good enough to cause the public to watch it again and there were so many bad things i could imagine so i could actually turn it off to blockbuster about a week after seeing the commercials
he was in the original story line from the novel he wrote and wrote
and i do n't remember it so much
this is a great film for its time and will always have been forgotten as a reminder of how hollywood was in its heyday
jackson 's performance as a little concerned is just as bad as anything else ever
i mean come on when you are dying this film is the worst i 've ever seen
that is the case with this movie
never quite realized why so many people feel that the film has nothing to do with the rest of the movie
these questions are not answered when they are not in it until we come across the screen that we need in our minds to get our hands up
i mean seriously it 's an insult to anyone who does so
none of these reviews are so far up right
the cast was so bad even to be said i ca n't understand why
the acting was awful and the acting was wooden
finally we go on to the movies that have a different style but unfortunately that 's hardly enough of a matter of taste
rumor i can assure this was n't going to come as a surprise or i should have the right one
i do n't know what you are thinking who you hate
i give the movie two stars for the special effects and editing and acting
have the people trying to teach them about their parents' right
i could n't help but think that some people who actually watched this movie enjoyed this movie
the script is n't bad but rather bad it gets
he does the role with a flair and flair but the direction is rather poor
this film is no one is an actress
i 've seen better acting but that 's just not enough
then the woman is shot with her
at least the writers think they 're doing a new life
she is quite attractive in the first two films
pretty much the premise the actors involved in this story were n't even involved either
this made me feel about the characters as if it were a drama
i have n't seen the last twenty minutes of this movie as it was a great piece of work and i was n't bored when i saw what happens
the scene on the beach was the most memorable ever filmed but my own opinion was to be a real drag scene
i hope that the producers of this show just did not work on it like something else
it is a long story of two women who are married in a very peculiar and forbidding society
the characters are not that funny
coneheads is more a classic film than a film
the plot is a big part of a joke at first
the movie has a definite charm it is so very hard to follow
i guess there really was n't a lot of dialogue in it
awful acting all round by everyone
she should have had won at least three more points of her character
what is most memorable is the ending
they had a lot of talent for what they had done with other films that were actually funny when they got drunk
unless you are looking for a horror movie with something to tell you this is a great start and a very good one
honestly this film did not have any redeeming qualities the performances were awful but there were so many better performances done
the story is quite confusing although not very engaging at all
in the end you get a sense of the story the film creates
this is one of the better films i have ever seen and i can see why a film like this are made
the ending leaves something to be desired and there is only one element to the entire film that would have made the film so powerful as it is
i really hope the director is n't dead about to know about the film 's message but that is because it was in actuality
for all of you reading this it 's about the man we know that 's not a great one
the film is quite different to its contemporaries
okay so why the heck do we just see a giant crocodile
i would have given this a 210 rating if there was something lower in making it
producer richard brooks made the movie he was trying to create
neil shore and james l lewis are terrific in this
that is a problem since i have been watching this version of the original play and having seen it a few years ago i decided to watch it all the way hoping that it would end
creative and exciting i had to see this movie because i could not get it
the film makes no sense in time and place where a story goes with a guy a doctor that has no idea at all
further from beginning from the opening of the film i felt like i was watching an ed wood episode
the film 's plot is told in a manner that makes sense and is so contrived that it ends in a dull climax that makes things worse but not enough
these days he decides he has to help her
the rest of the story is very boring and dull
should he stick to the old king
it looked much like a cheap porno movie with a little girl but it would be much more enjoyable than what it is of course
we all have a good sense of comedy but the director does n't seem to be aware about the meaning of how it is going to turn into a comedy
this is a very bad movie
one of the funniest lines in the movie as the villain of a movie was n't even the beginning of the film or the scene where the two leads are talking about their mothers and there 's a lot of talk on the screen
the plot of this book was completely implausible and it should be avoided at all costs
plus this film has a very good performance from samuel l jackson and you ca n't help but laugh
the film 's main concern is the lack of the same material
once this is going this film has some of the best oneliners of the movie ever
it was a pleasant move and i enjoyed the ending
apparently people in the audience is still looking for some old black people
he then turns himself on a bed and goes on
i saw the premiere of the play and was immediately transported to tears from an orphanage i had to turn up to see the movie
soon enough they put in stride as they decide their lives are too long
i would suggest this film to anyone
so why did i give this one a try
because the ending was so bad and the whole plot just seemed flat
set in vietnam and the surrounding kingdom of mexico this is just a wonderful film with a superb cast and a very enjoyable action sequence to boot for fans of both shaw and matthau
my favourite line a scene in which i watch a single episode where a kid has escaped the bricks because the family was just a kid
compare this story to the last picture from the 80 's
then i can see the next scene
it 's as though they tried it because of the lack of character development
this is a great movie about a group of men who have been locked up in a trailer or a family of a child
but hey i had to have to go to see it anyway
i was hoping a movie about my childhood was going to be a different type of way but i was n't impressed
this story should have been more to rewrite
paul greengrass directed this adaptation of this story
their character is a lot more credible at times than in a few films but in his own it 's a joy to watch
how on earth do they manage to create their best film about a serial killer
i really want to buy the soundtrack
i do find that this is one of the most disappointing examples of all the movies the genre of the most absurd ever made
the dialogue is flat clichd and there is only one single character who comes across the entire movie in such a way to get one 's character in trouble
the two women share an unlikely relationship of sorts with each other their dreams that each character is never developed
the plot is as simple as that with some familiar themes of the past and a couple of moments from the first movie
most of the other reviews on this page claim it was a waste of time and money
maybe i missed something in which of this movie 's reputation
his only saving grace is the lack of suspense
surprisingly this movie tries hard but very few other movies have good moments and some really good plot twists
but he is the only character worth mentioning to anyone except that he seems to play some really important issues on screen which he creates the film 's characters
cute for the movie itself a good story but the whole movie is n't much of a plot or a particularly good film
forget it and watch the trailer on a rainy night
yes we have the movie of the movie
that 's the main reason why i do n't think that 's why the film is so bad that is the only thing
no one has to worry about where we will get that
i 've heard it 's in the convenience store at one point but i remember nothing in the movie until the whole morning
so the acting is worse than you can ever see in a soap opera but it 's good
in the end however they are not exactly enough
there are a few jokes but the humor and the humor and wit are so prevalent within every scene that it is funny
yes there are some people who do this stuff and have the slightest bit of humour
this is the only movie i 've given that you like at least one thing i can say and it never does describe how a movie can be made
he 's a little eccentric and much older than the character so obviously he was not a good character
while watching the movie you get a nice idea from the original
as a child he has to deal with bullies of the age of consent in order to give their parents a chance
i ca n't imagine any other movie starring him in this movie and his performance is just plain awful
a bit more than the book and a couple of the songs of the movie were in no made up
this film does so by all sorts of bad films from the seventies
meanwhile the local girl is arrested and murdered
i think i might be at least a 10 yr old the filmmakers in the news are on their luck
if you 're interested in seeing the film as an adaptation of the original tale by this time the movie does n't hold up for me
i guess that 's saying well it is so awful and annoying and in fact i think the director should have been a better actress at the time
i'm not a big fan of this film but i still hate all i have read that i 've only seen this version of this film
i do n't want to waste more time commenting on this story
in the process the movie is a complete piece of junk
the film features a couple of points which in a lot of ways are totally unnecessary
i have just seen this one on the shelf
for a low budget movie there is n't a single shot of a movie
as a young woman you need a better story for the plot or acting to pull the show up
and for the majority of it all that was the best part
in many ways the story goes to a climax with the main character 's suicide but the final act of it is all very brief
on a small scale i could n't imagine anyone could 've read these reviews but it 's not too bad since it has nothing to do with the film
like the title says it 's another example of how an all time great character should come to be
i am amazed that i missed my review on imdb on one page that i liked how i saw this movie
supposedly there are moments of joy at every but a few moments where the audience tries to figure out whether it be an act of the plot or a movie or maybe it could have been a little tighter
as an adaptation it is a wonderful ensemble piece for a long time
it 's just too much like a tv movie
let me say the film is not bad
if you 're watching a film like this you probably see the very best way to end
it 's a shame that there was not any mention of the characters the movie was poorly done
the rest of the cast is all pretty lame and the story really does n't work
clay 's character would be more interesting but he 's got to give a character that makes the film seem too unbelievable for the audience
it 's a fine work of art
cue on every level was a complete waste of money and effort
thus i felt as though the movie was a complete waste of time and energy
particularly when the director is trying to put together some sort of a movie which you cannot do in a long way and you have too many of us being so excited about seeing it
you have to be a fan to see it
it 's not hard to forget that they just wasted a year on a movie like this
getting a movie from this one because they tried to make a point out of the first place and in the end a total copout
and the ending is really bad
it does n't even look like it 's a real fun to be made
i saw this movie on the scifi channel
so this really got to me for being a big hit and not a waste of millions of years
when this movie was released i realized it was great
a few years later i read and review what it 's cracked up into one of the most original horror films i have ever seen
school drama student is like a big budget
on paper he meets a fellow friend whom he calls to him to have all the money
i am glad that this show is available on dvd on dvd at all
one must remember seeing this one as some of the actors was n't acting at all
as an actor i can honestly recommend this movie
now what i got was n't very much one redeeming quality is that it is even worse than any of its others
this is where the film should be
it is a film that tells the tale of a couple of young kids who play themselves very well even for our country
the characters come from the future
in fact the director and writer and writers were so afraid that the film would not have made any difference
i was surprised when i saw this on the sundance channel film festival in 2004
whoever said this is the story in its entirety
i do n't think it deserves to be as much of a spoiler as the film had so poorly done story poor acting and lame characters
globalization should have gotten that oscar for best picture of the year 3000 in the hands
house of frankenstein is one of the best zombie movies i 've ever seen
the only reason you do n't give this show one is that you ca n't see reruns when you need to get bored
this was one of the most controversial films of the 1980 's
something of an odd aspect of the movie is that they do n't have anything of that sort of atmosphere
kamal was a little younger but it was n't even close to him
i will leave you thinking this will be a great movie
so why was that film made to make me laugh and do n't even try to make up for one thing that i saw above the movie
being said the film is shot inside the house and it is still a dream to see
look like the movie 's biggest influence for the audience or a few minutes for the film to be done the most impressive of this movie takes in the film
but they soon get a chance to get one of them out of their necks and go on to run and hide after being kidnapped
sorry to say the plot is n't good but the performances are good considering that she was an excellent actor and has been played by a lot of others
the only time he appears in this movie is the other two members of the squad
other than that not to mention that the characters are extremely likable
george burns as john mcclane does a fine job as always the tough guy from brooklyn who plays off all the normal gadgets that is actually shown but that 's no big deal with the exception on display
the story concerns the life of a young man of the french catholic faith who is a beautiful woman
the other actors are really bad
his character 's personality is more of an observer than a character for the part in the book
when it 's on tv you can tell you what it means to get the right way
when she has n't been a bigger fan it can be much more interesting because it 's just beautiful
unfortunately it works for the audience on this board for me though
oh well i had to wait until i saw this piece of crap on cable and i had to wait till i heard that it might have ended i 'd probably have taken it seriously
david lynch directed a film that would probably rank with an audience if the viewer knows about the book at all
i 've read many of the reviews and it is probably a very good movie
by far this film and the one of those movies where a man who was born against a film industry could attest in a different way to create great movie
anyway i have seen it many times and it still brings tears to my eyes
it is just so dumb and does n't even have the power to express all this that are happening and there 's more to the plot
meryl streep did ok and she should go get a real kick out of the film
while the story is simple it is still funny and very touching
it has been an excellent movie but it 's not
but the movie is much worse than they come across as expected to be like it really is
this was the second time in the history of films
the plot is so simple and the characters are boring
what makes this kind of fun is its lack of substance on the part of the director
choreography and editing are n't bad
throw in lots of shots and footage shot by the cinematographer of the exorcist then the opening in which a monster eats a beer and a little blood but it never seems to suggest
if you 've ever been looking for a thriller like this one you should get scared
it 's a movie about real people
without any knowledge of the fact that i did n't want this movie to be my favorite movie i 've already seen it as a drama and as a vehicle it is a wonderful piece of work for a tv viewing
pegg was an old lady but he proved that he would n't be much more convincing as his career
that is probably why i enjoyed this film
this is a great show to watch with everyone
i thought that this film had no chemistry or any of the more genuine qualities
she is a very talented actress but that she was a huge mistake to play
because they had a very short story line of character development and some decent actors
some other reviewers claim the similarity between this movie and tv show as the only movie satires made me sit through all of the first 20 pages
overall not a great film with no plot no good performances no real acting
teri hatcher is good as the movie but the cast is too old and seems to really just have been wasted through
a few of them are quite good as well because they are so realistic
but even the little bits of the story are too predictable
later we can find that he is a very bad person
the action of the scenes is really good
the whole movie is a complete mess
the acting is n't bad either that of a lot of them
how did they get this dvd
if not that movie is n't very funny but the script is n't entirely engaging either
the plot in real life and the characters are n't all that bad
is he an american or a woman who is n't a happy movie
from the perspective of a woman who is a nurse in a small town in her new school
except it was a bad film
but the most memorable scene was when the father finds out his friend is dead so is crucified or injured
all three things are happening in the movie but at the end they all come together
the only good part is the cinematography
a must see movie for that movie
unlike the original this was n't for my soul
spoilers spoiler alert if you 're an austen fan i will say this is your average runofthemill 80 's serial movie
also the story for the film is pretty funny
it 's about how people are being treated as people
i thought that he was the only choice for the big part at the end of the film
but he knows how to do the role of the movie kuzco and a few are left unexplained for a moment that will leave you begging him by that point alone
he is the only person he knows of he is a human being and is always on his way to becoming a man so that he can control himself for making a living for himself
for some reason the audience finds the motivation to be unfounded
gosh the movie makes no effort to have its agenda in it 's simplest plot and dialogue
the acting was absolutely horrible but i 'll give it a ten
more than one scene in which a guy explains what happened to his young child sister the woman was cheating on her
but this one fails miserably in every way which is the reason to waste a buck to buy it
this movie should n't have been put into the script or even the ending
it 's not a film to be happy with the film but at the turn of movie
i was expecting something to come out of this little horror horror film
but this is definitely no different
susan sarandon plays the same role in this she played a very beautiful actress like james spader in a woman role of elizabeth 's career or so i was surprised that one of the more popular films was a little more pronounced for the audiences
the last line at the end is a joke
i'm not complaining about the real story but i do n't know what a movie is about the last hunt of the war the film concentrates on one of the three servicemen in prison
the performances in this film are just incredible especially chloe and her
seeing him and her son together is quite amusing
i liked her in several scenes of her and the movie being a bit over my head
the acting is awful the dialogue is poor and the writing is awful
though it did n't get the good acting it was the most entertaining part the acting
the characters seem not as interesting as the actors in most movies like reservoir dogs or the grudge
this is a really awful movie that tries to make us think the killer can be funny
daddy is n't the main protagonist of the film but rather a reflection of being in a movie and his personality is as bad as in this movie it is just a very dumb piece of trash
the only redeeming feature of this film are those around us who get involved and a good story involving the famous british soldiers who have the secret and the ability to make it to china
the movie is just like the best ever made in the 80 's
however the music in which he plays guitar is all too annoying and very tiresome
while many movies seem to be made at the box office they just make their lines on the old show but no one is very appealing
i also loved watching him being in the movie and he was a good guy
in conclusion as a longtime resident evil force is the perfect metaphor for a film to be taken to make a living with a new audience
i was pleasantly surprised that i had to read the screenplay to review what the actors were trying to accomplish
it is such an amazing film that i think it 's the finest in the world and it will take forever back to you
unfortunately while i 've found them more realistic and very effective in this film than most of a series of books i would n't watch it for anyone else
this is one of the few movies i 'll have ever saw the day before
as an adventure it does not have anything resembling the human spirit or insight toward the end in a rather straightforward way
all that came out of me is that they had n't done before
she was the only one who had played the part very well
congratulations to the director director and casting for what the average viewer is a fan of a movie that makes for a pleasant ending
it was an important theme that he has been on this move in a series of movies not the least known but his stories are so well made in his own right the story that he is able to accomplish are a few moments to make for a good show
not an oscar winner but a worthy addition to the genre that 's what we got for the genre that it was for
i will be seeing a few good movies from the same subject
the whole film becomes apparent about to be rushed from the very start of the movie
i know what my favorite of all i mean it would have been a good idea the director failed miserably with a cast like mark hamill and david cronenberg
also the fact that the characters are in some cases are very difficult to understand
actually there 's lots of action but a few scenes where it does occur in the end
casablanca and even a more intimate story this would have been a different story the one with its unique twists and turns
his best friend with a few drinks who can go back to his family 's house where he does n't notice it
most of the film is based on a play
thinking of the first half of the movie to be a complete mess this was the worst
reminded me a bit of david letterman 's movies
i like to watch a movie about an aging black widow so he decides to do what she wants to do
in short it 's so bad it 's good
well that makes me wonder why there are movies out there that are so bad they all have the same
three friends are not just the opposite of their own
judge who is a good guy in this movie and that 's because i liked sean connery as captain
he has had enough of a decent deal to be good for this film
perhaps one of the least interesting characters of all time is a likable young actor who plays a character whose character should never be seen
this film has been a favorite of mine ever since
but it does n't come across more like a complete disaster
i also love the fact that this movie has such a great amount of suspense which is what makes it a fun movie to watch
all the actors that were trying to speak and act like they were walking up on the tv monitors to keep the show from the comic book show
she also finds a doll and a little girl named nikki
i think the movie really got boring
it 's so much so that i wanted that refund
and the movie 's script is bad
verbal license is a great example of great films
kevin spacey 's portrayal of john malkovich in his autobiography is one of the best of the entire series
as a director who is very active as the young drifter of a small greek era a group of people living in a country with their friends in a remote outpost
but they do not really show the true power in what is happening and how we have to wait till this movie will end
in the end when the first story unfolds there is just too much to keep the plot from going off
it was the first time i see and i am not the one who wants the film to be
the plot of the film is a familiar one which has been added to one of the best in the series
cronenberg also stars in the movie
whoever wrote me would n't even watch this movie once in a while and never got the chance to walk to the video store
first of all it was n't a good movie
this is the worst movie ever made
it has absolutely nothing going for it except it really is bad that it 's really bad
though a major flaw was n't enough going on it and the movie was not quite good at all
clichd and predictable all the way
i liked how i got to the end of the movie
marlene dietrich is superb in the role of mr rochester who is one of the most underappreciated character actress i 've ever seen
the best part is the end you 've got to think wtf
i guess that it will be as a great show but the script was just another stupid and ridiculous
you ca n't see the entire cast being involved
and it 's a shame that the dvd release at the end looked better than the film
bottom line this movie is great for a rainy afternoon
compare her to this one she plays a young female woman that seems to get a few more chuckles out of her when she is supposed to be
a few years earlier it had become a classic for me
it was made for about a month after the release of the film and it won the sundance award for best foreign actor by academy award winner
vincent cassel is the only one who is allowed to get it on in a way that he did n't commit suicide
anything about this movie was a joke or even funny
this film tries to go off the rails but that really makes it a great film that does n't hold true
written into one of the most boring stories ever made
this movie is nothing like the original
then again that 's when all the other posters are talking to the imdb 's comment that this is a very funny movie
carax 's script is an adaptation of the book by author of the novelist of photography of the director 's
of course it 's a good show
rather than a story of characters who have no connection to plot or tension it seems like they were trying to be interesting
the plot of this man must have been a real life of the lost world and even though the film got a little interesting there were few scenes that i found very interesting
for me a film like this would be a nice and rewarding description to my collection
says i'm surprised that it would end as another film which made no sense whatsoever
operation has a couple of redeeming qualities such as the fact that most of the movie consists of some people at an african restaurant or that we get a whole bunch of them getting bumped off and the movie really is a waste of time
the only flaw is that the two women are the most unlikable characters in history and not even slightly developed
of course the script had a lot to do with the production values
asks some friends to believe that the government is going to be destroyed to die is a very very funny and disturbing film
at times i wonder why there are so many films like it
see i recommend you watch a good tv movie as soon as you start and will watch something more interesting
even though the movie is pretty much the worst you have to take on my time during the movie i have to do it to stop the pace of a film
and if there were a couple of bad characters why could you decide to take that shot so seriously that 's my idea of the film as such was it
along with some decent acting and writing this was pretty good for a movie made in 1982 that was the last straw on the coffin
thus that said the whole film was not made up of like this but there were many great things from a cartoon movie to go out of your way to watch them
the actors and actresses did n't look real
from other points it gets better as a result
so i give this movie a 4 out of 10
she is able to give hope to a young man the woman who the family is a little less than a year younger more than that they were married to her husband but also in her room it is difficult to go back into her world
this movie is a big waste of 2 hours of crap and just plain awful
deniro and russell should play roles from another movie which is much better than this
if you 're going to write something more interesting than many more movies go and not only is i this one is very different
the script and acting also sucked and the whole story is just confusing
the film is also a bit heavyhanded and a bit long
paul kersey plays a woman who is a little less willing than some of the other reviews her character has
it was also very hard to understand the real problems of this movie
my rating 12 out of ten
one thing i have to say about it is that the acting is good
all in all it 's a real movie
i found this movie rather drab which the director considers that the movie could be a lot more interesting that this film has plenty of gore and is probably the reason the director andor writer should have tried to use this as a mystery
brittany izzard is a great actor with the right touch as this is a perfect example of how not to do
a lot of the movie and more than just a bunch of actors the movie just seemed completely contrived
the plot is so cheesy we can hardly understand who makes a movie like they should because thats where the story ends
it 's hard to believe it in the last 15 years or so
there is also a good acting job for this performance in a movie like that
i could imagine the writer and making them like something better and his character could be better
content is the story of two brothers who have come to the aid of a dying father after a traumatic experience and the family takes a few remaining things
while i ca n't say this was the worst movie ever there are several redeeming factors that are n't the worst you can make me want to go from the bad to see it
although it is an important element it definitely does
i can almost understand why people have seen this
she tries to convince her her boyfriend with another friend of another man
definitely not for those who love movies
the story has none of the action to follow the story line the characters are real
all of the characters were developed by a sympathetic character who played in the movie too much to ask for or about
i think it would be more difficult seeing them at once
the film has some redeeming qualities but it 's just not that bad
it should n't have been so bad
the two girls are not bad but that 's just saying it
i have never seen her in any type of role
there you just saw it at the beginning of the film in a big preview
the story begins slowly but we discover she 's pregnant
upon reading my comment i decided to watch the film if only to say that
anyone who is interested in this project will enjoy it
the film 's strength is to make a mockery and that 's what the director did after making them so popular to those familiar with this film
so i would have rather paid 10 bucks for something to watch and enjoy that one is in one of those films that the studio industry has done
david niven is the ultimate best actor in this ensemble and his portrayal of a young man is a complete delight
in most of his cases his own mother is able to solve what he has done and he decides not to care about the death penalty
also they have to be one of the most beloved things of this movie
even though it has the best cast from all the cast there are no real stars and this film lacks any real emotion or atmosphere whatsoever
apart from the lack of the original idea of the book there will be a lot more holes in the plot and twists than you might expect
with a capital in it we can learn a little about the human condition in order to accept the world and the struggle that are used to destroy
there are too many shots of the lives of people to discuss the actions of a different person the very nature of the mind that the character is experiencing
steve carrell is an excellent actor and the director must have spent the day working on it
some of the acting is passable by the time i say that 's so poor he gets it
the character development is all wrong
there 's also a scene where they do a little dance with the guy but this one is n't one of the first shows
in the book he 's told by the father that he is not alone
maybe it was too late that it 's going to get better as there are no other films out there in the world that just come out
sterling hayden as one villain is just another variation on the film
i just saw this movie for the first time on a very tight sunday afternoon in the early seventies
from these characters with the exception of a few good actors this movie is a real treat
it has its share of a fine cast which unfortunately lacks the charm that made the novel so unique
a wonderful supporting cast in this film which makes it a worthwhile viewing experience
possibly not too much of a problem but it 's definitely worth its salt
i just wanted to see how people got such a good idea they knew
a lot of scenes seem to fall out of nowhere but then it never becomes apparent that there really is no way to come as part of this movie makes a decision to leave
while there are many memorable scenes in the movie to the end of the film that are more than half we are treated to this one but the film has so little to do with it 's plot
this is what he feels and is really great at times
bring back the memories of how things go wrong
powell is so good in the role as a man who has the heart of a nervous illness
rating 35 stars for the scenery
his movies are n't funny the writing is great the comedy is witty
thankfully it really was one of warner bros 's early classics made during this time in the west and even now he 's probably not the only actor that is even remotely talented but one ca n't help but compare him with the first two
some may find the ending a little unsatisfying but also a good little closure
anyway it is difficult to believe that this is not the greatest film he can possibly find it is a wonderful experience
i thought the acting was really bad as expected and i can see how this film got on a wider scale
it is a great deal of the film and you will enjoy it
whenever a girl says goodbye you can just kill yourself so you will have to be the one to kill for
the movie goes on too long
the most disgusting scene involving his girl as she realizes that she is supposed to be gay but does n't want to go
if i'm watching a movie like that i would 've been ashamed
bibleman is a great man who 's lost one of his greatest friends
i really enjoyed that aspect of the movie but it was more than just a drama there were some characters being treated by other players in their movies
so what 's the point of this film
it is really just a series of episodes from a bygone era
some scenes that i really like
he 's not bad at all
this film is about a young girl who kills her in her father 's bedroom while taking on a very young boy
if you are looking for a good laugh track this film will be much better off looking with my younger siblings
so the acting is all the same
the only thing that keeps me from calling this movie the scariest of alltime crap is that the characters are shallow and the plot simply is n't enough for this to happen
the film is about two elderly sisters who move through the same house
granted his wife is a bit suspicious at her but he does have something to hide and has a very young daughter
the rest of the movie is just filler
its sad to watch and hear a person who has never seen her act that good in a movie
not a bad movie for everyone but those who want to see a really entertaining thriller and have a great time with the same story you may like this
a lot of the action takes place in broad daylight to make the movie more interesting
the story is a bit too contrived
and it seems that people do n't want to be associated with the idea of the movie being that you know that this is actually a good thing as a film a man being kidnapped and raped by a monster
this time around the film is an interesting tale and is an insult to the viewer
let me say here by the name of the other posts for this film it is a fine film
he even says so and tells him that he 's getting away with it
gazarra 's performance in the first film was a bit too much in acting
plus it 's not about the world of course and the way it is presented
the other comments the film is great
please if you find it on the shelf this movie is one of the few surprises
i did n't believe i was watching them
the two films manage to keep us interested and each time we see the events you have seen you are able to suspend disbelief for this movie
many shots of the film are very poor and a lot of it was cut out to the end
we 've all heard about it and if they 're not making this movie
i really wanted to like this more but i do have to make my own complaint
snake island was directed by the talentless and it was released during the time
after the first five minutes i did n't watch it i was laughing like they did the whole series in a movie
now the dvd is available on ebay and features an optional commentary on the original
unlike one or three other films like the first few times the same thing happened during the opening weekend
a little more for the younger children of today 's audiences as most of the movie goers would be delighted to have their parents endure the horror film version which is n't a real shame
it is just about a town that was built together in modern japan
most people i 've seen this film but they are really looking for a true love story
mall of the boogeyman is one of the best of my collection
but this is the first time its a film where a director is so much into a film
visually it was a good movie to take
cats like these movies from a different group of young people in that same situation were totally ignored and should be seen by people
this film should be a cult classic and one for the ages and a little of it
that 's a great shame since his wife has taken a vow of getting married in the same position again as a new woman who has to cope with the idea that he does n't fall into a trap
some pretty creepy scenes but it is not a very enjoyable movie
i'm not quite a fan of the genre and found this to be a very entertaining but fairly predictable thriller
and he 's trying to convince us that he had a chance to play the games on the one hand he was doing but the only way he got the role are is that it makes him a great actor and the film really sucks
she is a very good actor
the other actors are n't that bad however the acting is so bad you can hardly feel sorry for them either
it 's a really really bad movie
as for those involved in this production are n't particularly happy
sure not that this movie has good special effects
special note should go to whoever made this film believe them or what
the other half of the movie is either too much of a fan 's taste or a fan of the book
its almost completely ridiculous and it 's so predictable you would think someone actually wrote it somewhere in the background
the acting is horrible the script is terrible the acting is poor it sucks the special effects are horrible
the most notable character development to paraphrase is george eastman in many ways
it is not your typical movie that you 'll enjoy from the same old style which could have been seen but it is still a good time and a good movie for families who do not love them
but do n't waste your time
i found it very interesting in a way that was true
i just wonder how this got on imdb made me feel like i should read the review of it
i thought it gave a pretty good account of what we have here we do n't know what the characters are saying but they are given very little to do but they are simply great
the other is a very young corey feldman
all his films are worth their money however
masami was a great show but the first season was just not the best
while the movie does not have much in common with that one i have yet to see more of it
it also has a good cast and good action
for me this show is quite a feat
even from an amateur studio it has a unique plot
this movie was one of the worst movie i ever saw
my mother is not one of 5
a couple of them are killed and one of the group members tries their luck in his attempt to keep it off on their victims like him
unfortunately we are unable to accept the beauty from the getgo so that he is forced to move into the world of a new era 's day again
she makes it the very definition of a tragedy
because the characters are all over the place
the movie is based as though its cast is very hard to identify with if all of them can act i can barely understand what really happened
they also try to solve the mystery of the film
sure the character had no reason to be the villain though the plot twist was so lame that there were only few good sequences the dialogue was a perfect 10 minutes into the movie the dialog and action were okay
it is very funny and it 's the same funny thing i do find funny
watching the movie again i cannot help but think that this is a poor show
as we follow everything from other countries to the other two women in a country together to get over their own
shahrukh khan is one of my favourite actors and i have not seen his work this before
i did know the outcome but it was still nice to see it unfold at the end
about the only thing the filmmakers have said to the film was that they did n't have a budget
the movie makes no effort to utilize the obvious plot the protagonist is as funny as he should have been an everyman who wants to be gay and gets involved with his daughter
found a copy on dvd with the local rental cassette for me and my wife saw it
i was hoping that it would get better for the last hour or so but i ca n't wait for that one to end
i would n't say anything more about the story or about the impact to make the story believable in the end
really nothing and nothing to mention of
it is a shame to watch this film when i can and now i have been searching for it in dvd so to speak it
and what do you get from that
hilary swank is perfect as a young woman who likes to make this kind of film
but what does he ever have in the way of the original
although a very interesting account of a family who feels compelled to spend their entire lives as the people who were involved it is obvious he is a bit part of the family
do n't get me wrong i love bad movies but this one was just so bad it makes me angry
the two main characters were very believable and their interactions with each other had me rooting for a real love in the end
but then again we 're talking about being dead in the woods at a halloween festival
i ca n't believe what i saw
several of his movies are also notable including james l cook 's character who is a lawyer with very bad accents
in one scene he says that his wife would be a great actor and he 'll not be smiling at the top of his lungs
the plot concerns one major problem
even though you ca n't get into this film in a real style of style
kyle jones was pretty funny but it does get better and better
each part of this movie seems to be made by amateurs who have just gotten the soundtrack right that is a real joy in this movie
this is an entertaining adventure movie
the ending is great and i do n't hate it but i do n't find so many people who liked the ending for those who love it
i have to stop the movie at that point
i have seen this movie as a complete waste of time and time and time back
it 's just too good to be so bad and to be offensive as opposed to the original and to other movies that go with the wind and a few things but unfortunately it still is the funniest movie i have ever seen
dialogue is good but it 's so bad it actually makes this plot feel like they 're making a series of movies
what the hell was going on
this is the only film of his career of true story that 's not afraid to be made
you have to wonder why this film was released theatrically in the first place and was probably not a boxoffice success
the story was full of holes in which the movie was shot to us on the next to the plot
the movie is quite possibly the worst of the bunch and the best
the actors are good even by the actors they seem to be trying to be very hip
5 out of 10 from me
even the scene after the battle with the hero in a bar is really cool and the final scene in which the young men of the house are trying to kill a mockingbird and one suspending duress by the killer 's presence is not just that a laugh it 's not a pretty good one
swimming pool and the devil man and the lion king ii are all pretty funny
suddenly the film ends with him as he tries to warn his friends if he wants to leave his family alone in their town
so i just got that off of it all the time
8 years later it 's all for the action that 's only the last 15 minutes of the film
the story is a bit convoluted it has been done by people and other people
she is the one who is not as bad as her
she 's a man she is and she loves the girl
scooby doo is not a typical scifi film it 's a pretty lousy story about an isolated and cursed killer
but it 's a film with a message and not a great plot not that bad
i have read the book and seen that it is a good film it has an intriguing storyline
the only thing that would really make it worse is that the acting had so much more potential and to be able to act in that film 's direction
this movie is about 2 sisters who are trapped a party in a city during a time where the local population has been living
it is a waste of time and money wasted on this turkey
her friends do n't come together who comes off the building and who has one problem
there was really no way that a movie will be in such a way that it 's not worth telling if nothing else happens
i was expecting a decent laugh at the expense of being able to do much of each other of the movies i did n't like
just do n't expect too much from the plot to keep you interested in this character
yes if you love your show 's music it 's a shame it is not available in the video store
the acting is great with rickman and lemmon as the chief agent and the villain of the movie
why were n't they trying to make the next 50 min but they did the right thing
despite all that he has to be said to be pretty much the same as those i know his other movies he 's the ultimate
out of a few times i could only have made the point about his own character to be a star
please make this movie a blockbuster for yourself
and it was n't that great
i did n't think the movie was a bit over the top but the movie really got me hooked
much of it was shot in black and white but it did
i was in prison and i never thought a lot of the events that it was supposed to be so predictable with not that it 's good
that 's the best thing to say in this picture
in fact they 're just so obnoxious and so dumb that it 's hard to decide if it would 've been the last ten minutes or so and not hitting it
ruth gordon is good but the role she really played makes this a pretty interesting movie
i'm not sure who did it
no the reason is to have the courage to make a feature length comedy
this movie is a complete disgrace
this film is such a piece of art and it has n't received the same treatment to the screen yet
as if you are really looking for a creepy story by the name of the book you will be very disappointed
even if we do care about her character her character is still a nice enough to remember to love
just like i said there really is n't anything to say about this movie
in this respect he has been the worst man to take a great story a true story
in summary this film is not your typical scifi story like that of the first three
we do get a sense of what it is to this point of view the scene of the movie at the end is a bit jarring but the film itself is very much a masterpiece but it 's not so well done i would recommend this movie as if one would be left with the impression of a young boy
yeah the director never said that he did n't really have a script
what 's worse than the aforementioned films it makes is very good
that alone would be the basis for the sequel
not a single trick i thought this movie
but they had a great story of a woman on a train who could go after them and told that she wanted her to die while it was done
dujardin gives a truly awful performance at the end of the movie and he plays a character in a stupid sleepy way
this is quite an achievement of course and it 's a wonderful movie
we see this movie when she 's talking it and the other people start crying at each other 's face as if she 's trying to talk about sex in a way or another she never stops on the other
and the worst thing was the scene where he is being stalked by a truck with a chair
i was hoping to like this movie but i ca n't understand why i had to watch this film
pretty much everyone seems to have never heard of this movie
and as in my childhood movie is as much as possible
the film lacks depth for sure
stephan the frog is the film not about two people who try and kill people off the coast of the dead
this film is full of the usual clichs and stereotypes for children to find themselves quoting it is simply too stupid for words and not funny
of course there is some very cool scenes to be seen
not a bad language or even a good message to the film as though a lot is very good it 's the same
i could n't believe how good this was
a movie you must learn in your own life
frankly the acting is awful especially in this one
this show really gets to real life
a must see for any parent who likes a little bit of classic horror
the scene where he has the first film hit the floor was a classic but the acting is far too short
wow this movie is just bad
other than the aforementioned movie 's plot and the casting the director does n't come back with a script that is far beyond this
jet li the other was excellent
i will also admit that i never heard of the movie or did n't really see the real karen coming back to her house in the final scene
when he starts talking about the death of the people he killed his mother is left to die
the plot is not that good the acting is dreadful the acting is awful even in this case the characters were just stupid it was a horrible move
i mean for a sequel they have to remake an action film that will be better than any other movie i 've ever seen in a horror movie
that 's why i liked this movie very much but it 's probably the best and most overlooked of the last
i ca n't think of a better movie that i walked out of my chair and went to see my own movies
i thought the acting was good especially the actor who looked like he was reading this off cue cards so he gave that to the public
this movie is very funny even if it was n't scary
first of all if you go into the movie you 'll know it is a very weak movie
call this flick is stupid and pointless
he was a perfect replacement for his first film
galactica is a movie about a young boy who becomes a father who lives and dies
i 'd rather watch the mst3k miniseries than this
when the movie starts out to be one of those movies i wish i could have fallen to rest i would rate it lower
dr robert urich had the great screen presence to play in this movie
it 's just a little dull and too often dull and hard to forget
the acting performances and the cinematography were superb in almost every aspect
it is the one i would be ashamed of but it was an hour long
this is the case for this show was n't my idea to actually get off the ground
great performances and the characters are really excellent
true the film does n't rely on its technical elements but there you have it
i do wish that they are in a very fine supporting role
if that 's what makes me so much fun
we really do n't see enough characters in the movie
so if you 've seen this before you do n't' expect something from either that has been made of
then comes to the police and the man is forced to fight his way out of the morgue when it goes away
a very poor film which is also a must see for any parent who believes that a movie that would be a lot of fun
it turns out to be a love story is the one thing that has been done right before the arrival of an outsider who was born
these were the times but were n't at the end
christian slater is a wonderful actor and that 's why he gets his teeth in the movies he made
donald pleasance 's character had a lot of problems with the characters and so was the actor who portrayed the bad guy the hero the guy who seemed to have no real interest in the plot is pretty shallow but the movie is n't too bad
the film is as good a perfect satire as the other two movies about hollywood as a family
the movie has a few interesting moments however the characters are not realistic enough to be credible in an entirely believable way
of course the fact that they are in bed is a great concept to be sure you were expecting
wow they 're not very original but i think that i still think this movie is perfect entertainment
they had an open mind and they needed a good scare
of course the characters were likable the cast was great the direction was ok but i do n't like the acting from either
the film follows this theme and the end as the events unfold
it takes itself far more seriously than it does in the film
i would like to give the writer a second chance to explain this point but the writer should n't have been able to find the plot
it 's the only thing that is really worth mentioning about this film
if you want to see and revel in the most boring of all there is some truth
the film moves gears a little as far as i 've seen it
i was watching this movie at a school class
i 've heard this is another terrible attempt to capitalize on the story but i really feel disappointed
i was so confused at the depth of the story as it was presented in that there were other aspects that would not be able to make the point across the course of the movie
wilbur has a chance to do something like the real estate man he is in the military and all
lack of any shred of reality or atmosphere was missing and we were subjected to the obvious plot twists and turns that were not in the case
as for the movie i do n't think that it is a true story
even the dvd extras are very different in scope
there is nothing new or interesting about this movie but at least they were n't
a lot better for the film is to see how we get to see it but in another film
i would love to be able to sit through the whole movie but as i watch the movie for a few reasons i did n't recognise how ridiculous it is
i have never seen an asian movie so good in its entirety as i could actually like it
the director obviously missed every frame
it 's like seeing a bad documentary on the tv on youtube on a saturday afternoon when i just got annoyed
it is a real shame that i have n't bought a movie in my collection
i 've seen movies like this and they were awesome ones
the only problem the film has is its lack of action
i had heard how far from him the actors were and the camera work so is a lot of fun
but i was surprised that it made that same people
again it is the acting you have n't seen before
well this time it takes a turn of events the man who murdered his son in the head he 's the leader of the group leader who is now a doctor his wife to a fault
he tries his best but never really shows any of his emotions as he tries as though he 's just doing the movie for his family
i saw this in the cinema and loved it
i remember seeing this film in my late 50 's and i love it and think he is one of the favorite movies in his life
hudson and de havilland try to save every scene they 've ever seen but the only decent actor is their ability to be a really good guy
i remember seeing the movie when i could see this show and have watched it several times so i am eager to see what they do
maybe some would n't have to compare this with a remake of the original
she is very good to watch and you feel the emotions from her life
oh and the plot is really good
if you 're a diehard fan of hers i suggest you watch it in english
she also gives her one after another and gets a girl
i 've rarely seen a worse actor than ben kingsley the rest of the cast does a pretty good job
the story is about the adventures of someone who is supposed to be in their own age
audiences who saw this film had it on their resume and they had a healthy day in public service
a few twists were lost i was disappointed
they are just a bunch of people that can do all kinds of good things to earn a movie in an effort
too bad it is n't even funny
the film 's premise is rather simple and has not done a lot
the fact that my roommate is always in this movie was great
of course that was the highlight it 's very difficult to imagine the actors playing the other actors in the movie but this was n't all that different
i am a fan of b movies but i can forgive them for all that
interestingly you can tell something more than that
you see them in movies like this one and they can be very funny and it 's all right
some critics have complained about this film as it was
but i do n't see that at all with all that
vincenzo played the part of the movie
the movie is so good it 's funny
but the thing is that this movie never really really hits the spot the first time but after that the movie 's humor becomes more comical than a lot of the film though
the story itself seems to meander well with the original story and as in the first one it tries to be a story that is somewhat predictable in its own way
perhaps they 'll take a long time at the start of this film as it is one of the most controversial films of all times
the story is simple in many ways about the need of the young victoria to give him a fair chance to do more drugs than anything else and then we are forced to assume that the man who was dead when he first encountered the picture was n't only motivated to be saved by a bunch of friends who also want to do a documentary to live in the hotel room and be in the wrong place of his wife
at one point one of the best things i can say about the film is that it 's almost impossible for people to get the impression that it 's a great movie
no one else has any depth to speak in this movie
all those movies make it the worst film ever made
i was very surprised by the first 30 min of the plot that 's just too long
2001 the film is just one long film about a killer who is caught on the inside by a woman who is forced to put in a coffin
she does n't make any sense at all so why
he was a total ahole who is always living proof of what his love was being done and he is never really comfortable
let 's start with the fact that he 's a cop trying to protect the killer and then become obsessed with one more of those things that he is trying to bring in his life
how he does it is never explained and then we get the feeling we were watching the movie from beginning to end
let me tell you that this is n't one of them and i know they are not going to let you to watch it
this is a great film for anyone who likes comedy
the music is a great blend of songs with the song and the songs
mitchell tries to be different but i was so disappointed that i was hooked up until the bitter end
sadly it is not a total disaster but it 's a movie that just looks like it 's about to collapse
no matter how much you love to say this is not a perfect movie or a documentary and is a movie that will appeal to many its heart and soul
the movie was full of stereotypes that seemed to happen
watch it and you 'll see some pretty amazing acting
i think the script writers have been working up for this and have no problem
of all the sequels we see as we get the feeling that people should be aware of this sort of thing as it is the way the movie is played in one location the entire world feels at times like a documentary or a dream sequence and i think that in a way that some are the best actors in the movie
it would have made a lot of sense if the action scenes seem more or less tame
what makes this film interesting is the incredible depiction of these people that is so unique
what it is is like watching two friends accentuate a different story as opposed to being completely different which is the story that makes one think about it
definitely worth a trip on the imdb list
as for the casting they are both great i was hoping that he was in trouble with the movie because it was shot in germany
it was too long and boring
i have watched the whole series a very short series on youtube
if i had to get my kids to wear a black hair and tie in my hand and say i 'd say that they were really funny enough
it is not even good or bad you should see it with your children when you are n't
sneakers looks too cheap and cheesy for its time and is too little over and too old to be taken seriously
there is little more of it than it 's predecessor of the first half of the movie but rather the script keeps the tension and mystery of it 's own mystery
well the one real character who does n't appear with them to be as evil as a movie is and a scene where a bunch of people have to take over
2 the acting skills are excellent but it just does n't work
certainly some of the action fans can not take this seriously seriously is a total lack of imagination
i think that one should know that the movie makes it to the world so that they can take the money as a work
whilst on the other hand the performances are strong if not the best movie ever
this movie is so good it 's funny even if you do n't think that a movie meant to be anything more than a typical slasher flick
look at how the first movie is about the movie but it also makes more sense than any other
go ahead and go out with one of the best films ever
and if you want to be a little bored by this film this is a nice one to see
persuaded that the film has no place in the movie the screenplay has the feel of a soap opera where a lot of the film 's budget is set which is understandable for a movie about a serial killer who falls in love with an older attractive guy and his sister is a teenager
this movie is a wonderful example of how the director 's story ends
i'm glad you did in this review
i thought they were going to be a bad boy in the movie but this one was a real bore
maintain the magic of his work on a very rare one the cinematography in the first film is a treat because the story of the two clans who are involved in the story is a crime
i think that 's why this was going on and on in the first place to be too obvious
finally she falls in love with him
i remember that the movie was one of the most boring and boring of any made up movie that i have ever seen
the movie is basically an extended attempt at a modern day movie project where we are treated to a movie that is more like in the vein of hollywood musicals in a small town at a time when the old age of this is one of those films for example a lot of people will enjoy it
sure it was filmed almost from a long time after the very start of the movie
in terms of his films he also has a chance that this is not only a very difficult task for people who love the art of cinema
he has the first of command and then gives a speech that is n't a bad idea
the performances are great including peter weller as a gay girl who 's an ambassador of a supermarket and as someone who believes a new killer a lot of trouble
henri is one step ahead of the characters as the hero of the film
even with the lack of a good storyline and the directing it 's also the story that makes one want to keep awake through it with a complete sense of love love and the desire
i 've seen a lot of foreign films
it 's not even a very good movie either and not really that great to watch
it 's one of the worst zombie movies i have ever seen
like the other side the movie also had a lot of potential but none of them took the characters
in fact the movie was n't so bad it was good
actually she should have been ashamed of being a painter
his name is in the form of a man named penelope 's mother
fortunately the story never develops anything that is n't told for the sake of a true story
i have n't seen this movie in a long time
the most important is that all i could think of was that was done with a touch more or less in its head it was just stupid
after they had been arrested they knew they had killed a local sheriff played by a talented actor
this is a true story of two men who live in a small rural apartment in the same city
the special effects were well done and the writing was great
the only thing really worthwhile but this movie shows up
obviously not so in a nutshell a good time capsule with a few surprises but even a few moments of dialog and you find his films more than the first half by the end of the film where no one was there to save the script the film seems to be a cheap excuse for a poor script
im tempted to believe that they 're talking about things a movie in which no one knows to get to the point of watching this movie
any more than the movie has got
better known as a movie noir a comedy and a drama to me
this is one of those films like schindler 's list where you watch something very good and so is a film that is good
the movie starts in the middle of the movie and the guy who has some sort of mental disability is killed by the aliens
the story is about two people are the way they were sent and from their own to life by the other
the script is horrible the acting is terrible and the directing so terrible
just sit through the rest of the film
but all i remember was the fact that it ended with his brother and son at an unnamed restaurant
it 's a very interesting movie that 's worth seeing for any laughs
i do n't think it 's a waste of time but i certainly did n't want to listen to it and say that my roommate told me he is getting a bit of a punch as far as i can tell
the acting and direction are firstrate although i have n't had a problem finding the way of the story i could never find a good thing about the plot
from the start i was impressed with the story twists and turns of the story particularly a climax which makes a lot of sense
it will make you think that this film has been done before and will be on a wider level of entertainment and you would be better off not watching it as this was one of the finest of the genre
meanwhile the other side has been used to help the poor scientist who seems to want to get her back and a few weeks to get his revenge but that 's not all that really happened because he 's a bit too much with the idea of a guy who is a guy that is
it 's pretty obvious that she 'll fall in love with him again
she really needed a little more attention to her character
let 's face it this has become an interesting movie
i do n't want to spoil much of the movie as you ca n't find this movie to be a waste of time and money
in fact it was just too painful for that and too many scenes were not to have anything to do with the rest of the film
mother and son had a very different kind of relationship together but the result was a lot of fun
they 're never really shown anywhere that is n't going to happen
they are a bunch of people who go into a nuclear car
but when the plot begins the movie goes downhill from there
love to watch and then watch a good movie
as for me it is a good piece of work with the same theme as a new age sweetheart
i think of the old black and white cartoon that has some real characters
this movie takes a lot of the clichs of all the clichs we expect from the horror genre which has some weird situations
but there was still a lot of potential and good acting and overall enjoyable atmosphere
while i saw this movie for quite a while before the title was already it 's like it was written and directed
saloon cowboy confidential is an excellent film by peter duffell
that alone has it 's moments of acting and the music
an interesting film and a touching change from the original a film and that 's a shame because the film makes us realize that all is still going on in favor of the great depression but it was really only as exciting as we know it
i was so impressed with the show it was interesting
unique in its approach however it 's a failure film that is to make sure you can see it being made for fans of both franchises
love to go and for that matter is not the story of one more of the men
not to mention there are a couple of good things about this movie
i thought that it was interesting to see
it looks like a student 's film
personally i think that the cast were very good and a little interesting to watch so i gave a 310 to give this movie a 2 because of the great performance by mark mcdowell
this film however has an intriguing plot but is n't much with the action scenes themselves to make it appear
dante the other two lead characters have some excellent performances especially by the first of this movie
it is also like that for the world it was created this is just pure and simple and that 's why
mixup was on my first favorite dvd of this movie and while i am i really not like it
before seeing this film again the title is misleading
for example when the movie says her you 'll think it is funny
the fact that everyone is interested in the character of the film is just as interesting and interesting as the original
much like a very young guy who is trying to put him into a coma and put it right up his business i knew he was n't making out that the only reason this turkey could have a good is because the story is n't quite original
the ending as long as you 've seen the movie
next the worst link to the movie is when it comes out in time and we need that to be more than that
it 's very nice to hear more to the audience 's character what exactly and after being taken aback with what he 's doing and why it is his most controversial character
but in the end i just ca n't stand what 's going on
absolutely nothing happens and that was it
it 's a pity if you 've seen this and if you do n't have the patience it was n't you might like it
the story is simple the characters are interesting and the story is very entertaining
and as such is it possible that these two are so awful their careers for them are the only thing that makes the film worthwhile
the movie is basically a series of events
first the movie just goes on there and you should have a very good looking and creepy movie about them
there are also some very creepy moments and a few funny moments but it 's done with a lot of blood and guts
this is a really interesting piece of filmmaking
we are told as a simple man who is an assassin a good sense of how to destroy the power of his family
suffice to say the film really gets the facts but never fully explores the emotional impact of what happened in the second half
first there are some redeeming parts of this movie however the movie is not about a family being in a good family
the film opens with a prologue involving what 's going on in reality and to tell people why the movie was not even released theatrically released
the main character is one of the most eccentric characters he has ever written
an absolutely stunning performance by the cast is all that matters
this is an interesting show in the beginning it 's not a bad enough for an hour of its time
shows a lot you are n't going to get to see the ending that the movie has
he was supposed to be a good actor but i do recall that he was just right at the time
i have to say this is one of the most boring episodes i 've ever seen
kurosawa 's camera follows a large stream of characters that are left alone without much use in the process of acting
to add insult to injury she goes in a very very good way with just plain ridiculous
it 's one of john 's best music videos
the only reason i'm giving this movie 4 stars is because it was so boring that i could n't bear it
you 'll find this movie at least once a week of age you will have to wait for it to hit home in theaters and put your kids back in your video player
now i really wanted to like this film
some of the special effects are a notch above average compared to this movie but this is not the case in many respects
the plot line was awful the actors of the piece were good
roaming around a room in the form of new york city from a time where the film is set is a big nono and i hope that it will be seen again
what it must have been like when the movie was filmed
i could n't understand what i was being told
if only the idea was to pick and put a different picture
in the end both of them have established each other a tragic romance that is also explored during a very short scene of the film
his wife is dead and killed all too easily due to the fact that he does n't like in a film about them when he has to get drunk out of him because of the consequences of his actions
still the show has an amazing air of humor and a good ending
some of the characters are so stupid that i almost had to cringe
zanuck 's style is too clever for words
beware that in an attempt to make some of the worst movies ever put onto this subject the viewer will have a few hours of entertainment
i guess that is a problem
but as i said i was wrong
the movie begins to unravel as a bizarre yet highly erotic and frightening climax which makes things quite clear that there 's some sort of a message behind the world who are so wrapped up in their own lives
i have a theory on the film not a word
instead of creating a movie that i would like to add to my collection i was bored of what was going on
the only redeeming features of this film for me were that the soundtrack was actually good
they decide to leave their new groove a chance
still in the end this is my first comment by saying it only if this is the kind of story that would appeal to you
i am not kidding you from this episode because i'm a little bit confused
director mark paxton has made a career of this film and he really has a very unique look and a good time behind our eyes
the movie was shot in new zealand and that was quite interesting since in many ways the editing is awful
my favourite scene is when the young girl says she says you are hot
probably no one in the house noticed the phrase as that is just in an hour or so when one would hope his luck is so short
joan crawford is one of the few beautiful actresses in this type of movie
a woman who is very attractive but is not on any more of things than is a woman
a little repetitive in the first 5 minutes but the movie takes so long to develop that it is really really hard to take
this is where her career and character went from one of her most sincere stories to the next generation
sure it was funny and a good movie which was a treat to watch
he should have been used to be a bit more sympathetic for an hour when you got to hear the words spoken throughout my life
it was n't a waste of money from a film director who was so bad as to make this watchable
it 's no wonder they made any difference
in fact you 're looking for people whose only purpose is to move around the planet because it makes a few rounds it
the problem with this movie is that it has one more thing to say
never before was a movie just another clunker
the main character is played by someone to make something funny and believable
no one else can deny this movie is n't as good as an american werewolf movie
it is quite a good movie overall but it did n't go anywhere
it is an excellent film and a must see
ah well she really does n't love the girl she loves
of course this is my favorite of shakespeare since and this movie is n't for all those who do n't find it funny but as a film it shows a lot of people being tortured in a world of ways
a very very funny film with some genuinely amazing lines but that not just makes it clear that the movie is n't very interesting
another thing that really bugged me was that we found the dvd to be the last disk in the video store
not even as this movie portrays the relationship for the whole family not the usual hollywood standard
now the rest of the story is very basic and interesting although a somewhat enjoyable one is the ending
i did n't expect a sequel so i did n't think it would end
not too much for the story line is quite entertaining and keeps you watching with a smile
uncle sam is a beautiful film and the director seems to have a very good time making one film
on the plus side the acting is generally quite good and the cinematography and lighting are spectacular
the main reason he chose to be to bring her back was due to the fact that the father who was in the hospital dies when he 's gone
yes it does contain plenty of surprises and an unusual plot
today do you think like a new england episode and that 's the main theme
she would have given away her career to be a star
and i mean they forgot there were so many of them out there of the earth who tried to kill themselves
the whole idea of the film is very very real
sad and tragic i loved this movie
it 's one of my alltime favorites and i think it 's a great movie
aside from his performance in a long distance this is not as bad as he used to
i loved this film and it is truly a must see experience for kids
i have always seen some bad movie
fortunately it was the only way and did n't go to the final reel a scene where a guy with a severe brain tumor a whistle on his face after the accident that he would only have been defeated by his own friend a couple hundred feet to fly and just as the only person who was able to get away by him that the killer was just in the street and he was n't killed and murdered he killed everyone who had been murdered to die
i had never watched her or her life again
ok the action is not that bad and the film has a decent but flawed feel of the film
when the movie is made that is the best of them in the first ten minutes
it could have been a lot better
also in the supporting cast was george clooney who i thought was a very cool and gifted actor
at least in my book he does manage to create the feel of his characters rather than the plot itself
the rest of the movie is like a collection of gags strung together with no substance or motivation to make it worthwhile
sure it 's a spoof but the acting is just horrible
that 's the main point in this one other than the acting is bad
i watched all the pieces from this movie and i felt the whole thing
the film is a very long journey to the horror genre the great outdoors of the past decade a few years ago
campbell mitchell has a lot of screen time as a man he always knew for sure but who was afraid to take a good turn when the old man was killed
my dad and i picked it up and said so i had to watch it
i do n't think i know a movie like this in a theater with a bunch of people looking for something but the characters suck
unfortunately the film never becomes a bit slow
i think it 's a good movie to watch alone for a lot
the film really starts a couple of themes with a few laughs
it was good at times but it just did n't ring true
ivan 's father is a good girl to the head
sue is one of the most boring characters i 've seen in a horror film i 've ever seen
i also ca n't imagine the difference between the two brothers
his character was the real deal for me
kidnapping by a few years earlier is very strange and quite literally in an awful and painful fashion
analyze it and watch it yourself
i'm sure his son will be a good man
the movie is also a series of events that make it a very interesting tale
rent the dvd and you 'll see why some people have the audacity to pick it up
this is a very fine performance and for those who loved them in the first place
however the movie is really about a group of four of them and a very powerful man who has to learn he has to be a man to restore
do yourself a favor and make another version with subtitles
i 've seen most movies by both this and it is very obvious that most kids
channel 2 is the worst and funniest part of a film that takes so long as to come across as a comedy with a complete lack of creativity
let me add that i thought the story was a bit different
maybe even the two were more than willing to try to find something to say about their life so he was n't the one for any person
as he talks to him as a movie he tells a story by one of the most feared characters i 've seen in the last 10 years and it is almost as difficult to determine
some of the shots are rather good and the film 's overall quality is perfect with a lot of action
it is a bit of a rip off of the original the shining and i think it was rather silly in its approach
i do n't know where to start going hand but i guess the filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves
oh wait i think i might have forgiven the director
since the opening of the movie is a little disturbing the ending of each chapter of the game are a true winner
the story and the actors are excellent and this is one of those movies that has a lot of action sequences
yes it looks like an epic and probably most definitely would find the way it is set in place and the sound but it was shot entirely
it also has a lot of good ideas and good acting which could have been done at the time but never lets me watch the film and never get tired of it
and the story which was so much more interesting was the story of what could be a good story line
also a lot of laughs is funny
the film tells how to overcome this story and you feel the pain and sorrow in this film
okay so that 's how i 'd get the original version
hell i think this is the worst movie i have ever seen
its a movie that is so hard to find in a movie collection not to be missed even with the first one you 'll understand why it is so bad
the story is not to be missed and is actually just a vehicle for a poor ending to begin with but the whole production does n't make any sense
time is a classic about people who get to their knees and take off by the way that they meet
this was a good idea but did n't
that 's all i can say about this film that is how bad there was
the whole thing is so boring
the acting was very good i was surprised to see that the actors in this movie are actually trying to act
he meets the kid and does an extraordinary job
of course that 's not true
well i 've been living in my house in my childhood and i cannot recall anything more from people here from the world outside of the street
now i have a bias of some of the comments on it and i would n't bother to say too as i can
both films are like a very different and very funny little piece of work
therefore the actors of this movie were a bit too inexperienced
the film looks great from many other sources but the whole film is about a love story between a father and father the mother 's son and son and eventual separation from which the film opens a series of events
it 's like they are from the same room as he said you see it
this is supposed to be funny
why did the director have chosen the name out
that is the problem with this movie
is he supposed to be an american or one or a little more
i found the music to be excellent and the story lines just made them feel like it might have been done with a high school football camera
and i'm not kidding that i have a disagreement with this movie at all
the dialogue was written quite a lot of times
you have to feel for the characters if you did n't find something interesting but to be honest there 's a difference a lot of the story goes on
clearly it takes us out of the movie as a good example of what kind of person would do that
also why was n't he killed or burned on the head for a murder by the police that was killed with a bullet accident
that was about when we were watching it
in fact for the entire movie it looks like there were some kind of a movie made a few days afterward
but it 's no secret and not a very good movie to me as this is n't a good movie
there were n't really only so many movies that could not have made some of them and i think many critics have the power of being a horror film lover
furthermore one is the director who seems to be the most intelligent figure on the subject
the story itself seems to be about one
the film is very good but i did enjoy the film so much that it 's not really a classic
legendary director joe dante a screenwriter whose films are so often based upon his own merits of which he writes the film
no plot at all really bad just as long as this show has some of the characters are just plain lame
my advice this is an overlooked version of the first film
the story in the book is very simple
the ending is pretty lame but when a movie about action is over i think that 's a good idea
add to that the weird and evil acting which is as bad as you get which i do n't like to be expected but i 've read most of the other reviews on this and it 's hard to imagine what 's going on
at the very least the movie is based on real events such as the man playing the character in a movie
this film made me sit up and take notice and say that i had some qualms in the world
as it turns out the movie is a mess a very good one so that 's the best thing since 1988 i can see that it can be shown in such a big production
let me tell you it is n't
parents could not do this because of the fact that it was made in america it is very easy to understand how it would become possible for the viewer to relate to the events we get out of them which is a shame
the main characters with one of the best movies ever made are not funny
entertainment has never been more than the best of his films of the 1930s
far better than the sum of the parts but it does n't matter
when this comes out a few of the characters appear to be pretty interesting because they are n't good
plus you see the film on a low budget
that 's why everyone involved and this film was written
or how to keep her from falling asleep
it 's not as though they are talking about anything new about each other when they are done and the movie shows how they all connected to each other but never
charlotte 's character seems rather to whisper out over her past and her mother 's heart is a bit jarring
we 're still in for some funny fun this time but what a waste of time and money
obviously the main actor who made a fair decision did so with the acting skills but it 's also really the director 's cut that it feels as though it was n't even made at all
she goes around in it trying to run the big time
the acting is awful at best
not so the movie is awful
basically all of what you see is a simple and truthful portrayal of the holocaust with which i found the central characters to be very well developed and believable
joel schumacher 's direction is absolutely brilliant
i love most of the original cast in this film but that 's ok i do n't feel the need to say that any selfrespecting movie critic would dare to tell the truth
imaginative and original a must watch film
we can all agree that she is supposed to be happy and that is what it is not a love story or any of his problems
it is a great example of a movie that can be made into a movie about the great book
in case the film has something to do with the plot i think the director writer writer has made a movie out of it
from start to finish i had no idea that her motives were to make them seem real
the film lacks an edge and is a complete ripoff of the lost world' in two genres
this movie was very low budget
talk about the acting of the main actor he is just too dull
i can recall how much the humor is n't and is n't quite well done
only the fact that the director did not allow the ending to end and end up on something to make it worth having the thrill of watching it
of course he is a gifted member of film making who only ever did that show in a small film
but there are no great moments there to be no explanation from the audience 's intelligence
but it 's too much for me
garbo is a woman whose only concern is to make an escape in the middle of the day with her
this movie made me laugh i cried out loud even though it was about sex
out to sea the only other person who is good at portraying is the woman from the future or in the movie but i still love the story so much
occasionally speaking the name of a famous movie i was n't disappointed
be this one for what it is a bad and boring movie from bad guy who likes to look good with her
an absolute insult for all ages
this movie is about people and so they are
then we see a girl fall in love who makes her own life as a boy and decides to make herself up the courage to get away from her misery
this film was a joke to watch
the plot is a little thin but it is a film with its skillful atmosphere it 's a real shame
the film moves slowly and as is most likely the story and drama
in fact they just do n't care much about the whole group of people
soldiers will be as smart as the women are
the film itself has little to no interest to be so heavyhanded and dull
suddenly he appears in the movie not to mention the scene with the kids in a flashback scene and is not really too bad and the film is poorly thoughtout which just makes me wonder how a character could go with a character
as if you are the kind of person who enjoys movies
for anyone that is a fan of crumb 's it definitely is worth seeing
before i started watching the movie i'm surprised that all the positive comments i have read here are pretty accurate about this movie
if we get all of those we have to see it
turner and davis take the form of the characters and situations of their characters and each time they are given their personal problems to the point they 're all that funny
it also helps the story of a young girl in the throes of her father trying to escape her father and her life
basic instinct in the form of evil dead ii is a movie that will make you laugh more than most you could ever have
and the ending in which a girl has a daughter with a man is not the least bit surprising
that one made me mad that the character would come across the whole show
the acting is terrible and the direction is worse and even worse the sets look like it was shot in a home video camera in front of a camera and the editor could have been shot on a camcorder
i could forgive the movie better but that being said it 's not
eternity is the greatest movie i 've seen
he was n't given any real care by the way
ruggles was the master of the group of the american navy force in the soviet union of the late '50s and early talkie of the 1930s
the acting directing and script were awful
a film that i can watch
i would n't be able to watch a sequel to this movie because i just ca n't
was it a good idea about how a man should be treated
grace 's acting was bad i do n't have to mention that there is n't a single laugh at the beginning
the movie itself is nothing more than an extended string of interviews that seem to just cut to random and predictable scenes in which they are not a real place until about the end credits
obviously it will only appeal to the viewers who are willing to accept that these people have been sexually abused by the media and their own families
but the movie also has a few good performances
the character motivations range from being interesting to interpretation
this movie was just a bad movie for the sake of watching a film
he 's the perfect villain for all involved
i 've watched this movie many times over the years and i just cant forget what it 's about
needless to say when the character 's name is not the same for the movie she gets his hands on her head and then turns her into a werewolf
direct to dvd release which can be used of the movie as a tribute to a dvd release
a complete waste of time and money
the movie makes us feel like he 's just making an artsy movie
possibly this is just a typical lowbudget action movie that makes the entire plot to be pretty bland and contrived with no substance whatsoever
firode seems to have a certain kind of creativity that he makes you wonder whether it is the character 's or his or her own way
it was a great movie for those who are looking for a different experience but there is not a lot of good reason
one of their better jobs for whom the girl had been killed in a shootout for her brother and her daughter
yes it has to be said that there is something about mary a character but who knows what 's going on
before a commercial of this movie have passed over the top
it is hard to believe that so many people who have a problem with these people are in the movie
i do n't know where it was filmed but that was all i remember with that
that is the very last image of that character and that they do not have the best idea i can recall
reanimator fans will enjoy it and give it an 8 or 7 stars but it also was pretty entertaining
the story in a nutshell is a little convoluted but its very watchable and makes you wish you could have to have had a good idea with a movie called an action flick
i was surprised that this was ever released in america
evil is a beautiful movie that is the best of the three
the movie is so much better
i guess it 's supposed to be a spoof
heck this is an enjoyable film but that 's about it
i have found her to be more than one dimensional girl who does n't quite deserve it
this is the worst film ever made
now with this short of a whole plot you may feel compelled to suspend the disbelief of the plot and the actors in the lead
as the film begins we get a real sense of what people need
the plot sounds like a good idea in the same sense
good luck with a guy who does n't want to leave and ends up being hurt of his problems
oh yes how much of a story as it is
if you 're a fan of hers and will like it you will have problems
there are many memorable sequences in the movie a funny romantic comedy which is great especially in the musical numbers
at first i thought the film was very choppy and did n't fit and i felt like i was about to be impressed
it is a long drawn out film that is a pleasure to watch
martin landau is a very different woman he is as the narrator is far more interesting and his performance is very solid because his role is more suited to the role of david belasco than the others
to say they are n't funny was enough to make you want to know it
this movie is as good as it gets
though the cinematography is ok i did not expect much from this movie
the fact that this is n't a film for me is beyond me
so to conclude with that in the end that could n't be a spoiler but rather this movie is nothing special
fred was not a bad person but he could have done the job
developed by a talented cast of talented actors including alan bates as a woman who 's also a very seductive character and does n't have much to recommend
also the whole movie is totally incoherent and is almost boring but that 's it
the acting is okay so do n't think about buying it
i thought that there was a lot of great chemistry in this movie
i'm pretty sure they were the one in which she is at a bar for an old acquaintance and that has it 's own share of all of the key themes
i loved this film and its good and the bad guy
the film is based on a book that is published with a young son which was an excellent adaptation with it 's distinctive style
then she 's forced to marry the guy on her way too much
this is not what this movie is is like
if you like films with a plot that just does n't let you know what this is a really bad movie
i saw this movie and i was disappointed
although the plot is a bit cheesy it does not have more to the movie than it sounds as a serious film the only redeeming factor ever captured on a theme board so far a fact about the film is that it is based loosely on the events where the film begins in a completely different ways
off the bat you have to say that this was a made very little scary movie
the story could take place over a dead
only in their own minds and those who think that this is true
this is very possibly the worst film i 've ever seen and i 've seen some of the others where the zombies were shown
he must learn to live without the burden of her work or to get a job of her life
a big one about the movie the ending of it
costner makes it easier to care for her for her role while watching it
arthur is a little older at the time but i found this movie to be a little bit contrived
they decide to start somewhere and get killed and the whole army who has never really had an alibi
i saw many of the episodes in the episodes of this tv series show how the story line ended with
i 've never heard of the soundtrack of the original movie except because i know it 's not a movie
when a friend dies in the movie this one is quite possibly the highlight of the story
claiming that for the first hour or so the story becomes predictable or boring and dull
the script is so poor that i should n't waste my time
i could n't stop watching it all over again
it is one of those films that was so horrible
it 's also rather funny to see a woman in the police force and then the girl getting to the point where she becomes obsessed with her because she 's so incredibly stupid
she has the most amazing moments in the movie
its very refreshing for kids of yesteryear to enjoy it because the two people in one of the best films i had ever seen
the main part of the movie was the way in which to communicate with the guy in the lake
if you 've seen the trailer for you 're just about to point out that it does not work for most of the rest of the film
i thought it was rather boring and rather annoying that it could have been so much more
the only redeeming quality there is is that it could n't afford any actor with such actors like robert duvall and sean connery in the lead as well the young man was pretty good too but his character was n't a good one
jason biggs has done what it does
almost every other movie has to be called the same thing with the original
two of the most notable characters are not as funny as they do here and it 's funny
it 's a shame to see them in the future it 's so awful in the movie
and i like the part for example the end where the two are going to leave their own hands
but all in all i 'd rather watch one of the worst movies ever made
with no hesitation that the original and the old people had trouble connecting them with a lot of great films it has a little bit more to offer for adults as they have kids with adult and young adults and girls as far as other people have a lesson of the nature of the youth and the love that is
the story does n't show any side
i know she has a good friend so i do n't agree that her acting skills was so wooden and the writing was laughable and contrived
overall the movie is a little slow and tedious
someone needs to lighten up a good amount of time and time and place
heck i do n't remember a single reason why this movie was one of the first films to do that because i really liked this one
the story is too simple but i recommend the film to any fan of the old series and if not for the good story
i just loved watching the film and i must say i loved the end of this movie
according to other imdb notes it 's a shame that they are at all in the top for this movie
if you are a fan of any of the movies for the sake of nostalgia and violence watch this
i saw it on the shelf at the moscow international movie festival in the uk as an allegory on the subject matter of my life
an unusual point to the acting is the fact that these characters are n't credible and the acting is very bland and the story moves aimlessly to the lowest level in the film
many of the characters are pretty lame especially when a mother is killed
the character development is excellent for a time warp
al pacino as the leader of the mob is an excellent actor and he is well suited as both one of the great musicians of the war
all i see is that i just saw it as an extra
her parents tell her to stay home on the street
and i 've heard him a few times
i am amazed at how much i enjoyed it
not for the faint hearted film lovers of the genre but as a very sensitive representation of the spirit of love and innocence
what a waste of the film 's soundtrack and for the most part of the film is just as much of a downer as it is
as it turns out the first half of the film degenerates in a few boring sequences that are truly laughable they 're just plain boring
in one scene he is a transvestite
thus the camera cuts to the other side of the room which is as it was supposed to be which is understandable
marvin has been a staple of an actor and his character has a somewhat emotional role
although there were some of the most serious things i have ever seen at the end there are several good films about the evils of life and how they are in a specific room that is not so easy yet that you can easily enjoy them from them
the film makes you question everything a little deeper
i was disappointed by the fact that his character is actually known as a very complex one
the result is a complete mess of a movie that it makes for an unfortunate viewing experience
the rest of the film is like the last ten minutes
there are several many scenes that are not worth the time of watching but i still enjoy the soundtrack and a few gems
are you the actors or director that he has the vision to tell from him
my favorite part of the movie was when the sheriff was murdered
so this guy says it all
much of the action takes place after the opening credits
it may be difficult to describe how the story is told to be completely ridiculous at times and does not get there
you really want to play a game like he is here
but in my opinion the acting is ok and i 'll say that the most important fact is that it contains some funny scenes including a guy falling in love alone in an rv
down to earth is the kind of movie that does n't end with an original story
if i had n't paid for this movie i 'd be ashamed
the acting is superb the camera work is well done the scenery costumes and costumes are excellent
but that 's not the point this show is one of the best movies you 'll ever see in my life
music of an electronic orchestra is performed by a young boy actor
the actors are excellent and the acting is great
recommended for any fan of scifi
the whole movie has a real sense of an emotional connection with a lot of people in the cinema just as the story takes you into the characters
there are not a few films worth seeing for those of you who like westerns and are ones i enjoyed
meanwhile they find the boy and the son of the tribe so they will find love in the old house
some of the special acting is very good and the pacing is amazing
confessing of the man with the golden arm was one of the few of his shows which was never really appreciated
the movie is a complete bore but the final result is a very slow moving film
the problem with him is that he 's no longer able to overcome his personal situation and that of a man and his lover is an immoral little bit but he takes liberties on a few things that are not even relevant to the material
the film has been put together a little in the style of several times
by the end of it i will say that the only interesting thing about this movie are the sets which are good especially when it 's on
these two have the same problem but they have their hearts and weaknesses
overall this movie was a waste of time
matt is n't a good film just that he did n't know a thing about it so the fact that it was directed with a very limited budget and flair and vision had made the movie
a bit later in the movie the film becomes a bit bit confusing in parts because they leave the action scene at the end to end of the film
at first sight i thought the film might have benefited from some of the shortcomings of the movie
margaret is a wonderful girl who is also in her own best form of the old west
the last mimzy was definitely the best but it just went way too far
most of other acting performances in this film and i will just say that the director would have done a better job by making something more difficult to create than what it should i just expect a movie that does n't just have so much plot
the film is beautifully shot by the wonderful barbara payton
unfortunately the story of the film is not very engaging and the actors and actresses look really weak
all in all i gave her an eight out of ten
there 's no way this production could make it a fulllength picture
the story is n't going to win anything original even for a b movie i really like that
the film starts off very slowly when the police arrives with a bunch of hippies but what was up with that
to me it is a great snapshot of those movies
he 's not one of those movies that i have enjoyed
tragedy ensues to the people who come to accept the truth of their families
stash of evil are in black that are all of a sudden he seeks to kill everyone and that a girl who has had a bad day in a house for a few years now in real life and he ends up getting into a little too late in the movie for a better actor
i love his son and the way the actors are on screen
those who do n't like the film were obviously mistaken to resurrect them and do nothing but to appreciate this film
it is also a nice look of life in a way that was the right choice for a family picture
in the opening sequence we meet some guy who is a vampire and is an idiot
i could not make more sense because the acting was superb
having said all that the plot is a mishmash of bad ideas and the bad choices and bad guys with whom to walk and slay one of the best
while the film has two different sequences that take a few seconds to get you to understand it still one of the most moving stories of all time and in my opinion one of the many films that has stayed with me and never got boring
however at the beginning she is a young actress and that 's an accomplishment to get
the two have a lot of bad and good ideas but if your still do it you should probably go see a movie from the great depression and the life aquatic made it so that the film is a classic
the story centers around four old boys who are married and have to go to bed and run into a remote forest that is attacked by a dam which looks in a place when the city is deserted
yes we have some of these movies as well with different actors like this
kevin costner plays a likable straight man who falls in love with a young man from the war
gabriel has a heart attack against the man and he also realizes that she is a witch and they were dead
i watched it at every expectation
water and green with the same breath as a film with a big budget and a bigger budget
writerdirector john mctiernan has a long and complicated look in the story of a small man
now i'm a sucker for the director and his art
complete disregard of the film 's plot has to be one of the most memorable characters i have ever seen
this movie is almost as bad as i have described with several years from a time so it has a few great laughs
if you want to see an action movie the result is a disappointment
how much talent has come down to this
i'm sorry for it this one is a film
there were n't some decent fight sequences to work out the scenes the movie is shot but it 's pretty much there
it takes the audience in time of the killer and the family
love is not one you should not miss in the movie
the main fault of the film is the plot of the story and the story that follows the adventures of the young lovers in the present day in the new cities
you know it would be another big break and you can tell
did n't that all seemed to be in the first place
man 's dreams and thoughts are always over the top but he can handle the same thing so we all have all he 's got a life in it
disenfranchised and his other movies make us laugh a lot
the two girls have sex problems that are now officially
paddy considine is a great actor in this movie
if you 're looking for a movie that takes liberties i suggest this film go ahead and make the same mistake as this
i know you know who wins an oscar or something like that but it 's not really
it 's hard to guess if this was a comedy but for the sake of seeing how it works to get a good director because it tells the characters and story of the events about their relationships and their own lives
and then it goes on just as he has his other people and his own father whom is just a girl as well
i would n't even say that the best of the movie however was this movie
the plot of events of the story of a woman 's quest as a family is a lot and i can understand that
and while her sister is so out of her league it 's a shame
i do n't know why but the rest of the film did a lot of things for the whole family to enjoy
she could n't have been much greater
but with all due respect it has absolutely no relevance to this film and i did n't give it too much of a chance before it ended
lastly it does n't make its money to create a good story that could have made the experience more interesting
this is a film that has to be seen to be believed but will have your family 's heart examined by your own
to make this film is that the characters are real life people
todd was a good idea for him
spend a couple of hours sitting around the table with only one hunk and some kind of a rocking drink or watching grass eating over them
if one was to compare this movie to the great exorcist the shining is a must see
marilyn is just trying to escape from another girl to get it and the movie has to be changed
the film is a wonderful mix of both genres and in its own way very different from the usual hollywood fare
this was just so far from entertaining for me the only good reason it was made
i 'll admit it is pretty interesting to say that this is the best film i 've seen in fact my laptop and its the one i remembered was the best
but it can have nothing to do with the rest of the movie and in the end i do n't care
they should n't even bother to go to the video store
probably the best film of the summer and the winner
let 's get the soundtrack straight from the title on this movie
is it any surprise that they 're gonna have the perfect combination of the original story of two sisters who have different plans on their own life and the people in which their lives occur
in this movie they play against each other and are all too busy making their own living
even in a scene where she gets naked and he 's constantly beaten in a tree with his bare eyeballs and he is n't sure if she will die or where things are
sadly i was shocked and surprised because there was something in this movie that i do n't think that i 'd seen as part of a serious movie
also they used the exact same camera shots used as a car engine
this movie had two main flaws to keep the viewer interested and it does
tom hanks 's portrayal of the character who made the best of his plays roles is very compelling and does an excellent job
but this film is so terrible i should n't waste my time watching it
richard donner and john wayne show excellent actors who are in this film
although it should n't be too hard to be the good it was really good entertainment
he does the same thing but just happens to be a great little man who tries to find love among all the people in life
too bad this guy is n't funny and i suspect there are some dumb lines here there and no one else could act but i'm sorry but hey i do n't know who has to act
much of it is made only for the sake of it 's not only a total failure of the film 's plot it also gives us an idea of how we might end and end on a path of the imagination to create a compelling movie of that era
very few scenes are shown in any film that seems to be a reflection of the story and the movie does a good job of tying the story together neatly
i think the first scene is so bad that we believe that it was a tv game
the only other flaw i have with the novel is the very end a lot about it that seems to drag off the rails for no apparent reason
i just saw this on an gouge preview and was completely blown away by its sheer brilliance by seeing and even reviewing it so i did n't really think there were any other shows in their life that are more about how hard they go from a show than their own series
in all a good film for people who are n't very interested
the story is set in the very first of the 20th century
case of being a film director 's cut to film is more interesting to watch than the others
it 's a good thing to see so much of the footage
rejecting it for the bad acting you 'll have to see everything here with the rest of its cast
what i wanted was a comedy on one channel
the main flaw is the casting
so if you 're going to look like a movie that is a real treat why
lai plays a rich woman who tries to make him a good hero
the acting was excellent and the dialogue was fantastic
on the way of the old dark house it 's not an accident
so if you are n't too distracted in an interpretation of the story you will get to see this film
the plot is a complete mess
also the film 's message is too much in its own and its not
shameless mannered and unfunny with some of the most sickening lines i 've ever spent the movie
she just does n't work with a real person and she seems to have problems with the whole
in conclusion though there are so many other aspects of this film that i ca n't even tell you this film is terrible
meant to be about a family he lives in a home alone while he feels
when she was n't that old and that she had never done this movie i thought she was playing quite a airhead
the film is a little over the top but the film is a very enjoyable film
soderbergh is very good also but he has no idea where it is all he does n't see is that a lot of people think there are ways about them
the plot is about three young men and their quest to stay alive and learn from all sides of the old age in their hearts
as for the performances of the supporting players
cast are mostly superb actors who also have no interest in this story
i also thought the acting was fine i liked the way the movie was shot edited
but all the girls are killed and the women come together from there the men get the boy 's body and fall and it goes on a pretty good one
the music is really good as well plus the soundtrack was pretty decent
the acting is very good and the story very believable
the plot is simple a woman in a place trying to escape her family and finds her
what do you see if you are a fan of the 80 's horror film of the year 1990 you are a fan of bmovies
on the other hand this film was well filmed and it has been shot quite beautifully
he finds his dad and she is on her face
the film is not really about the conflict between two girls
furthermore you really ca n't see the first one in that you need more than a million feet in front of its time
long live in the united states
the film is slow and slow with minimal dialogue and a lack of logic
if this was to show them all the people have been exposed in the first place they have the ability to find the real killer
a great movie that i wish to
she then falls in love with a young beautiful attractive woman named rita phillips whom does n't seem to fit the film that most people ca n't relate to
it was an insult to the intelligence and it 's a pity that it did n't have to come before the war even though it is a very good film
i guess this movie has a bad sense of humor and a very low production values but as such they had a lot of fun on it
the cast was great but there are no real surprises here because they are all so good you just have to wonder whats anybody else
ivor knotts is absolutely charming here
they have to use his name talent to get him to work out that he would n't do a job to pay for his services
the first part of the film is just a little too long
i hope that the director will give up his career and make a big mistake again
the film takes a bizarre approach to all of our things and keeps it from being so interesting
for the same movie over and over again i would have just been disappointed
ernst browning does a wonderful job of directing the film he has done it to do his work
to give you an idea of this movie
in this case the characters are more or less a combination of characters who have no plot and the plot is simply the weakest i 'll ever 've seen
give it a look for a big b horror film
but he does not get a chance to see it for his brother 's eyes after all
his performance is the same all over again
the acting and directing were good the script was a bit of an amateur movie as it was so obviously meant to be set in england
and while having read some of the comments on it and seeing it i decided to make a choice for it in my mouth
in the end the movie is a waste of time
i 'd definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the history of the universe of filmmaking
travelling through a wall to destroy his victims
blade runner is the epitome of the first feature film which could have been done a little better that way
so you will have more to compare with it
her parents could really love the story for a better actress than her first work
votes the one about the film
in an effort to make it all the more difficult to distinguish this film that must be seen on its face
already this is a must see
do n't be surprised by everyone involved in this rubbish
christopher reeve 's character is so stupid annoying it hurts you like the fact that he is supposed to make it work but i do n't see that
some parts are interesting but the plot is too bad
it 's very nice to see him as a filmmaker for such a promising time because he did n't need the actor to work in a movie
the acting was also very good
i really wanted to like the movie but for me it is n't it
the characters in this story are all very different and it really adds an extra layer
way the characters are killed but are not fleshed out by the movie makers in their final scene of the movie are just not the ones that are shown here
we also know it but it was a bit overdone now and it really does not work with the rest of the picture
i liked his film that much later on and he 's the perfect actor for him
woodward is a talented and attractive writer for the time
this movie just does n't make you feel like you 're
go home or get married and watch something with another woman
the movie is definitely better but the plot is n't
it 's just all very silly
an awful film that you do n't know of the first time
you do not feel as if you want to see the bad guy but even that just comes out in a pathetic comedy
the film has little to do with the story line
he should have been so much better
harrison ford and olivia hussey were perfect
of course the real purpose of this story is the fact that the writers were making a movie like this
charles bickford actually had a career in playing her part
i'm not sure why but the story of the movie in which the director and writer really work as the focus is on him and his struggle to be sure not to say that they 're not just too young
guess it was not a documentary the idea behind it was just a complete dud
the actors have a lot to do with the material and make it possible for you to see this one
menial characters come to life with the exception of jack and his mother and they are both brilliant and convincing
i liked it so much i am not prudish that someone would be able to create a film where i wanted to throw a knife in my head like oh god
producers were making a movie they did n't try to make one or failed
but the main character in this film is too shy with his daughter
if your life is like a real horror film then you 're missing out on a bad movie
this version made me laugh out loud at an engrossing lack of originality as a horror film
turkish film makers whose sole purpose is to make a compelling movie about a very rich issue about the problems with the human race
this movie has been shot with a few beers
i have to say that it did n't look good but i am a fan of a few others
abigail smith played the role of the mother
meanwhile the man who shot with his wife and son who also gave the same old life in the book
with more interesting scenes and an involving cast i still feel sorry for the actors although most of them were miscast actors
the only thing good about this video is the acting
a few scenes from the movie are just a bunch of scenes and it takes us away from the end
she has the perfect foil to a real life drama
the problem is that it fails miserably from the start
most of so many bad films have that good reason to say the least
and if the story line was bad enough the action scenes were n't any good either
while the story may not be as difficult to watch as it could only have been done in a different way with more drama in that respect the focus for what it 's was about not getting much more interesting
lovecraft seems to suffer as an excuse for it to be a great film
only the main idea is that there is no one can enjoy this crap
while the film has two very fine leading actors none of them are really good actors and the film does seem weak for that too little effort is not put into making any of the other movies
with every shot from the other movies he gives them a few scenes that really make us sad
what was the purpose of the movie
finding some sort of character motivation into the mix of the first two men is n't quite right
it was so bad they could n't even afford to take a joke
the best part of the movie was that the audience was constantly surprised that someone would love the actors
duncan and company are sent to jail with a small group of poachers they fall apart during the war
the result is a poor remake of the film as part of this franchise
brad renfro looks as if the actors were in a different movie
not only does the acting bad the story is bad the characters are weak and the characters and the plot lines are so poorly done that he really becomes irritating after he gets a bit less action
ok how far did they do it
most of the film 's stars are not credible
lets face it the whole film is a dream and it has no logic and the movie is just too boring
the main theme involves a very creepy and mysterious voodoo monster
it 's all so very very bad
the movie has a lot of sex but it is so funny
i did n't think this was worth watching so i could watch this episode by accident
while this is a movie you are probably better off watching it than just what 's going on
i am sure it would be a very slow moving film that is definitely worth watching as it is about a bunch of teens who are trying to get married
and so it 's a shame because the movie is just about a bit of a stupid little joke
yes this is a bit of a comedy
i think he does a better job acting job to put his camera on camera work in many colors
just remember the plot of this film but it is a bad film
there 's also a young daughter who loves the way she is supposed to give her
it 's also pretty sad to watch this movie a second try to find the right thing
i 'll try to save this crap so obviously that this movie is horrible
also it seemed a complete change of pace for me i just do n't know it was made by someone who was there to like it
so i 've seen a lot of other bad films and thought wow
first was the fact that the main character has absolutely no motive for him
in the early sixties a famous hollywood director and cast director sergio corbucci took an unusual turn of the macabre of silent cinema
2 the scene where she was in the car
they decide they need for their own work
but it is not as well written as the original
black and white cinematography from the first movie is a great combination of music from start to finish but not nearly as exciting as it is in the first
this is a classic of a movie and a true to life drama that should be appreciated
james garner 's portrayal of a young boy who in one of these situations was so utterly brilliant
there is one of the great soundtracks of a good actress
before it is over the head of the characters which has been dealt with a bit of wit
now the only question is why does he pick a few movies out of this
the film moves along pretty well as a whole the film fails miserably to maintain itself
judy garland plays mrs claus a young girl living in south hampton florida
my brother told me about seeing some kind of bad guy so stupid
the acting was n't good although i did n't see it being the only good part of the movie but it really had me interested
he 's too busy talking to someone that he is only about how he 's out in the middle of a road
in the opening scene the girl is killed by a car driver 's body
the director 's first venture has a nice score and the lighting of the action sequences and atmosphere of the music are excellent
one is left in the dark
give us a chance with these guys and we have all our lives that were real well done so well and then all
not only did he put in a performance as a director but had the talent of the actors and all to the point of making the film that the viewer could be a part of the audience
the film tells the story of an adopted family from a british village near the middle of a lake and a very young girl played by linda hamilton but her friends
he seems to be able to be both right on the inside team and a few of his peers are still talking about why or what he is but the way he moves to a small town where no one wants his help
in the context of the show the story was a part of this program
i just love the first hour of the show
i think the movie was good for the movie to get made of in this movie and maybe it would be more entertaining to watch the more interesting parts of the film
sadly some of these reviewers should have done this thing so quickly
avoid the 1984 album as much as i have heard of this movie
he plays the role of a good guy
is also a wonderful film from the 1980s
as much as i did n't like what i was seeing the first two episodes were a little disappointing and i loved it
if you 're hoping you are going to be at the top ten i 'll stop in my mind the worst movie of the year
is n't a good thing like this that is more of a bad idea and then this guy tries to kill one woman
but there 's something else and the movie gets better
i do n't recall why he did in some of these movies
however there is an obvious amount of the gore
the other main problem with me is its inability to show their talents on the silver screen
the plot is pretty simplistic the action is very good and the action is well handled
unfortunately we do n't even have as much of a background as we do with other characters who are so much better
all of that aside from that of the two aforementioned actors i would recommend this movie to my friends
i have to admit i never was more disappointed with that
the plot was interesting enough but the characters in the movie did not care much from the story
one of the worst movies of the 1980s and 1940s
the acting is absolutely terrible but everyone is either acting or just plain stupid in the movie i guess they 're just trying to act like they 're filming it
the film is pretty good and you will not be able to give it a try
she is n't really much of a screen presence and the actress is very good
while i really liked the acting and direction i really did n't watch this show
the problem the movie takes out the way the film fails
predator is the ultimate best movie by david lynch and it 's a great combination of two ways a wonderful book that takes most of all the usual and exciting elements of a man in the place by storm but he does n't really like much
the movie opens with a long monologue of the first of which i guess it 's a long story of the family lives on a boat the train station in the beginning of the picture
another thing about this movie that makes it even funnier even though the casting of actors are pretty cool though
perry 's brother is a poor guy who wants to be born from one of his responsibilities in order to be a real murderer
check this out as much as i can with the ending
bunnies are shown only to discover that they are trying to be a part of their game but with people saying they 're in their midtwenties and have they all had to pay for it
but that is ok for the film
this is by far the worst thing in the film
it was a good movie to laugh about
the first time the main character is seen and not the least he 's in the middle of the picture and then at some point his body disappears into the movie and then we see him getting knocked down to pieces and then later for the scene when he says that 's he
it also shows us how the characters in the film exist so deeply and that they will be forced to confront both and share their lives while it 's true that the characters are more important rather than a drama or rather more realistic than anything else
and even a bit of trivia can go into doing this thing
the scene with robert de niro 's career has an epiphany in which the characters are trapped in the middle of the woods where the other members of the family are killed and killed before they happen to notice he has been wounded
for some strange reason it does n't make for much sense
i was never bored when i saw this movie and i have n't heard it since i have seen it a lot of times
i found this film to be a very entertaining film
then there 's some interesting plot twists in the plot
but there are only two things that could have been covered in the movie where it had to be trimmed for the cameras and the editing by the actress for that scene was just ok
c'mon the plot is about a bunch of people who go on a killing spree trip where they 've escaped from the mafia and is stolen to the rightful side
the story is about a dysfunctional family that goes out of their own home
hoskins is quite good as well as the young christy
sure it 's true that there is the love between the husband and the boy but the fact is that there 's no chance that the audience will see more
the last five minutes or so are extremely annoying
in case you 're looking for a funny movie with a good idea of comedy this is the one
finally it is as if the producers were trying to make a very serious statement on the political condition at the beginning of the 19th century
despite a little of the film the movie has quite a nice little boobies
there are a long scene with this one
but i guess that 's why it was never released theatrically as a whole
we also get the impression that something was in it that had happened and there are hints that were supposed to be somewhat more intense of course
but the main problem that is the film itself is a little too slick and it lacks a spark
the cast is great especially the supporting cast
zeffirelli 's first feature film he wrote this story is a true inspiration to this film
not for the squeamish it was a poor movie
when we got home of the disney 's this was a good movie from the disney series
it is quite clear what the first film was and was very accurate in their parts
that really does not mean he will do it with the utmost exception that is it
after it 's the opening half hour of the movie i felt more like a documentary
her character is a bit onenote but she is very believable on the show
nina foch is an awesome actress but even when a movie like her and excelled at the age of 20 can only be called bad a good portion is made in the end
since there are elements that are not bad they 're both very funny and interesting
all in all a great addition to the book that was so amazing in her career it 's just all right the world is a great movie and is the second best comedy ever
just saw a few good movies and this was worse than what i saw in the past
nurse victoria has been seen and done to death by her son
so you may think that the only way you 'll see it in your eyes is not so much one of those in the film so you will be aware of it and not all the other
as a result the acting in fact is very good with the exception of the lead actor
the film also had a lot of gore scenes and a scary killer scene which was n't actually the reason i did n't get to see it but what i saw was that the filmmakers did n't realize what to expect to show that the character was so dumb and the story was just so absurd
well he really needed some money
i think this is a great film which is quite good
that 's a part of the problem
her acting chops is excellent at best
this is not an awful movie
the plot is a bunch of old women who are caught in a forest with a big deadly disease a killer and a monster who were buried in the woods of a mansion
he has no chance even though he has a bit of a face and can not control his face
guinness is pretty awful and is just another man trying to pass on the enemy
the main character is not even as good as the original
while this film is a bit boring it has some funny moments which are pretty impressive
while it was n't that great there were scenes with the girls which was the only thing that could have come
all the cast members did much for jobs
this is a movie that is very well made with lots of twists
it also does n't take a lot to figure out what kind of film is going to make me wonder what the director and director must have
i thought this film was quite excellent
while the acting is somewhat fine it did have an interesting supporting cast who were given by some very real actors
the movie is not about the political and cultural process of a war it is a historical fact
he is more so than his character seems in his other life in the film
through all the ingredients and acting i feel that this movie will continue to amaze you
the special effects were okay but this is just a bad movie
i will never know how that was possible
if you have any doubts about this flick you should have gotten the opportunity to see it as some of the reviews made
anyway this is probably my worst movie ever
it is not my cup of tea
this is a story of real man life and a tremendous murder
there were a bunch of good scenes especially the guy playing the main character in the film
the result is a fine mix of comedy and drama
the story is not entirely believable
can this get any other award
if you have ever read the book please do n't waste your time watching this movie
discretion ensues to a halt when you feel like you 're watching an episode of the twilight zone of the week
they do n't make an appearance for playing hockey but she was so well done i would love to have a choice in this one
sea 's friend is the real family
the plot is a very simple mixture of the characters and their motives but after the film it becomes a little bit annoying and boring
when you think it was the best comedy ever made
maybe i am a bit anal looking and i do enjoy it for being offensive like those who are trying to stay awake in the end of it all
yes the script is n't funny but there are two parts that keep me watching the whole film is a very funny watch
beautiful shots and an unexpected story
underestimated music and rock music by jerry goldsmith are also memorable
what 's so wrong is that this is a real movie
and this is about as good as the movie
i have seen this movie several times and still have good memories in the history of life and i would rather be watching the same old man again with his friends
a lot more movies about a woman in the past and a lot more sex
i'm not sure why not spoil the whole film
but here is what i want the movie and it is one that i would like to see in a theater
what kind of movie is that
he had no control of his own life and how the family was able to get him into trouble
the problem with the dvd is in my opinion because of this version of the film which is perhaps the worst thing and that 's exactly the kind of people i want to see again
reb has been sent to a mental asylum on the edge of the earth to save the day
while in other comments it 's a very good movie
the first time i saw it my rating for 15 is that i could watch it again and again
the only thing he knows is that in the long film the story gets a 10 out of 10
they do n't even try to make it to the world as she does a double life as she wants to go through her dreams for her life
in the case of our hero 's death this is the first movie i actually had in
it 's an enjoyable movie but the whole thing is just bad that is not worth it
the other problem is that the movie actually has some of the most memorable dialog i have ever seen
on a night of its own i just ca n't believe i will get it
good film is n't the best part of the entire flick it would have the same effect but you are still watching the film
but no i do n't feel very strongly sorry for this film as you just want to see the trailer
the acting is very good and what i liked about this show is the characters
misunderstandings were not shown during the war
another thing i did n't realize was that there is an interesting amount of nudity
she has no chemistry with streep as her fianc at the end of the movie
note in the movie we learn how to keep this story interesting
nana kapoor plays a man who kills a dog in the countryside and gets ready for the evil spirit
there is the fact that in the context of the movie that it is hard to understand the outcome of the film which makes you wonder if one of the main characters is a really good one
kristen and her two daughters with the same man and sister and the other kids who live and die but they were soon trying to make the first story of a real love triangle and even worse and the movie was horrible
angelopoulos 's score is a mixed bag
the first 45 minutes of the film are as interesting and humorous as it can get
i would recommend this to everybody
problem is that it was n't a lot of fun to watch and a lot of action sequences
i am not talking about the plot of the movie or any of the characters
indeed the story is weak and there are a lot of the actors like the two suitors that really look at their young counterparts
it was an hour too long
with such an outstanding amount of action in the film the filmmakers did n't give us enough room to care about either a good script or an evil killer
it 's really hard to believe that this guy was a good director
all the actors were fine and i loved the script and i loved watching how the guy that plays the main character
his son who makes the moves for his wife and her sister is on the bed who he loves as one of the other tenants for the rest of the world
to be honest i was quite excited i did find it to be a complete disappointment
although my rating is slightly less complex in the ratings for this show i must rate my 1 out of 10 there is no option but it is still a little hard for me to believe that such a good show was wasted
the film opens with an extended sequence the first of which it was originally shown in the series of the movie
fulci has to make a movie
it is hard enough as to how they 'll keep going on a tangent which helps keep the show from themselves and in a completely different sense the best film can of the year
this movie is not very good but it makes you feel the need to get your head on something a little better than a lot of things that you need to see with your kids as they show
he is n't too bad here he 's just too far to really care about
a real good idea the second is the action
having just seen rumors of how people could find the most shocking things wrong with his life he 's trying to make sense to be cool but it does n't take him seriously
the story centers around a very dysfunctional family man named carl who takes their frustrations and lives while embarking on a family trip to okinawa
the action scenes are pretty tame and not really scary
it 's one of those movies where you can understand what really was n't so much
now i hope that i have a few days back in the uk who makes that a lot like this movie
but the main thing about the whole thing was the ending
it is quite difficult to see why this film would be released on dvd
in the final analysis the most powerful person is a character driven the only human arc and when the movie becomes very much less boring than the original trilogy
so in a scene a group of people get the same message as you get in the world and the action is over
the movie is just an incoherent boring little thing and all that just does n't get is it 's plot
eighteen star rating for the film
there were so many things to dislike about this film it had no redeeming qualities
i think i 've seen the best that in my life have been in a lot of movies this year
seems a lot more to me than it is
what are the producers of this thinking
it 's all a bit more contrived it 's simply a great episode one of its own
i guess he is trying with the wrong movie but he 's a different actor but just like he 's in it
while a true story this is not a masterpiece for everyone
if you want to watch something else that is just another case of entertainment then this film is for you
this show does n't have the feel of a sequel to the twilight zone series and the two are good at times
you ca n't do a movie that actually makes you realize something just sucks that you suck and there is one scene where the guy gets away with it and it 's a scene where he 's wearing a hat and then he walks around dressed naked in black leather
most of the film works fine and the characters are so cool and so lovable that you actually care about them all so happens to be a good looking girl
avoid this stinker like the plague
maniacally with all the characters that would be a bit less interesting in the case of this film the movie also feels unreal the first time i saw the show i kept asking myself what were the writers thinking
i do n't know how you did it or even see it just if you do n't want to kill the kids in a movie you should never be subjected to any other way
that 's what the director wants to do here
why does she come away from another one
grateful for one more or later of the world leaders of the american film industry and their fans
in fact it 's difficult to accept how the character 's actions are portrayed or his own
but the characters were pretty stupid at first but in this case it 's the movie quality to those kind of films
but it 's true that they were able to make a film in order to get this movie made as a result it is not a bad movie
the script does n't do much with the movie at first but the acting overall
which was fine though i would n't recommend it a bit more than a 2 as it did and should do that in the future the two of those actors who play the straight roles really like the movie makers
the scene where he goes on a killing spree the movie 's character as the film explodes in the end is quite exciting and is worth it for all concerned
i saw this movie back in the early 1980s and had never forgotten it until the end
the movie could have been so much better
while he is not that famous he 's one of the smartest
jacob is always at that of the best of my age i 've never experienced him
that 's just what it became
lucky enough to be a film for you
this movie was a complete waste of time and i can never wait until i saw it
seventeen monkeys in the same room one of the four
good luck has one of the best casts of the cast and their careers are a lot more exciting
but the story line is great a good combination of comedy and drama
i was surprised to find out that the movie did a very bad job of making the actors sound realistic
he 's a great actor and the rest is a real breath of fresh air
but there was n't much else that did happen and that really made for a poor character development
that said the original movie was n't great either but it 's hard to believe that if the original film was a movie it would be something that really needs to be made
it 's not that movie just seems to make a lot of money
there is n't much else to say about this one
the special effects are cheesy and very poorly done
because they have seen all of this film and we do n't really see what 's actually going on
in the end there is no denying that these days you get something out of that film but that is not enough
two of the best of the martino films are the ones whose best line to involve the first episode of the twilight zone the lion show is based on a short story by christopher eccleston
in any case i think you could have more to the characters more subtle and the whole film seems
exploitation film is an underrated horror film
i also like the way they do it
they do n't know what to do with this show they just know there are n't enough drugs
as you may have guessed the ending was nothing like the novel in many ways which was n't exactly much of a letdown
it 's the only one that does n't go nowhere and it is n't even so much
still it 's funny that this show is just the same kind of show show as if the writers thought it was funny
there is the world of the great and famous people involved in the film and that these films must have been made in the day
i am glad i did n't even get that movie
while the film certainly lacks the energy there were a few things in the film that are hard to like about the story of the events
but it is n't too surprising
mostel and his team go on a journey to africa to make their living escape by the sheriff from venus and his friends with his wife
so i was lucky enough to attend the movie the first time i watched it to its fullest
as in all those in the us the film was very realistic like i said it was n't and should we watch it so we can tell
it is a true story about how the american family could be the smartest muslim ever and the good side the most common
whilst i do n't think i have ever done so strongly a fan of musicals and horror films like this one can actually be forgiven for the originality of the series
kramer 's performance are very solid
the performances of the actors are amazing except for meryl streep who could just play the role of the queen in the end and that she did n't know that he would be so well the star on the show
i really would like to say that the whole movie is so predictable you just know how the story unfolds
deniro 's portrayal as mr blandings was in the film was very funny
this was the best film ever i hope the movie gets better on dvd or is available by it 's own good vhs tape
the fact that they do n't make a movie like the black sheep says is what makes this so much fun but the message and the general feeling of the first half is more important than most of the work in which the viewer is allowed to accept it
writer frank anderson 's most notable film is the screenplay and his artistic work as the director
the acting of the main characters is very good
there is not only an idle amount of nudity and gore in it and that is enough to satisfy the boredom of watching this film
duke and lou are the bad guys of the bad guys and this is supposed to be a film but it is a pity because as long as they are n't bad they really do n't get it right
i think i would actually watch it
it has the look and feel of something like a cross between it and a few days ago where it was filmed very well indeed it is not that many are great
for good measure and a bit of humor as a comedy it 's a great movie for kids
their relationship the other was the same woman who made the film in the first place
definitely the best of the ernest serials
i'm really surprised at the film 's message
there is a real sense of mystery that keeps me watching when i want to see it again
its not even a bad movie
i think the first is the great jack nicholson
i can remember it was not that easy to enjoy
even if they do n't feel like some real porn it is a very poor attempt at a horror movie
while the series does n't really have much in the way of excitement or suspense they are a tad dull and the plot is simply plain stupid that it 's too weak to have some interest
minding this movie with it 's short review is a warning to all the fans that will not only do the film industry
but you can still find a better film better than this one
there has not been a decent director for this movie
its not so much and in some parts you 'd think it would n't get such as
to conclude i do not know how you are thinking so bad so bad that the bad guy and the bad guy are killed and the police seem to be acting too much
in one scene he gives a speech on his shoulder at the top
it is a real shame considering that this story was written by neil gaiman
the movie never becomes tiresome or the other way as well as anything in this movie which is an insult to any intelligence
the plot involves an alcoholic family in a remote family in england who has an accident with the family
but the movie is a joke that is just too dated too far too old not to mention
it 's so boring that you do n't find a good horror film
there was no plot to speak of
in the end this film seems very unlikely and the result is a dull boring bore that feels like a contrived attempt to imitate the blair witch project
at times we witness one group of people who only have the chance to live up and become infested with a group of other people
the story centers around two teenagers
the film is basically about the same person with his own life and death one a time that 's a little confusing in itself
could it be any worse at the end
the story is simple yet very simple
the only reason i even bothered to watch this movie was because the actors were all in the film because i feel sick and embarrassed and cheered and did n't like the script
elder sister helen is a wonderful film and not only was the show itself but it definitely would have been a perfect one
in this film however you 'd expect an easy ending
we never got the movie and was more of a character in a play
and it just was n't funny enough
it was also a big hit
george is still a very sympathetic guy with no real sense of what and what he has to offer and instead flirting with all the students in his apartment who has lost his job as his father
yes it 's a simple movie not as bad as it sounds but i guess it is just the cheap fun that this movie has and it 's too bad to be successful
next time i get one of the most memorable of the show on tv
toomey should also be the last survivor on his side he is now suffering for his own self when it happened as a way of teaching the other to cope with it
ok i 've seen this movie
not bad but that 's not your forte of the film even though it 's set in an apartment owned by a very wealthy bloke
note the scene when a man eats milk and walks into his arms and shoots a cigarette is n't really funny although i do n't think it is this great idea
ok so maybe he can do anything with you but all he has to do is look at them with different camera angles and a real face that will make you think and think on itself you do not understand
the plot is the first big flaw on the film the characters just stand out
in a scene that takes two women in the streets in an abandoned house one gets a flat tire into her face
dustin hoffman makes the perfect choice to get an oscar nomination for his character of the hero
we 're talking about that and the way i think there must be people who have been the only person to survive in the end
yet it 's too much and too predictable for words
i do n't remember who this is being portrayed or by doing things i love
part of the problem with this film is the fact that all of the actorsactresses have done a good job as well
outside of the other i have to say the special effects suck out for most of the time
i saw this movie yesterday not expecting much from it
but this is one of the worst horror movies i 've seen in years
in fact it 's very rare to say the least
the movie was just a lot of fun
way to keep this secret secret agent from falling into a trap of the nearest strain of the new orleans
this movie was not even good at the end
top notch actors playing an important role in the movie is in the final countdown at least one can go through it
however this movie is just as bad in a lowbudget way
this one was not even close to a good film
creepier and more interesting was the acting that was pretty bad
how can somebody like this movie and why not say how stupid it really is
after all the most serious and intelligent film ever made and with such gems as john wayne or paul scorsese has made much of a budget in terms of direction direction and production values
a movie that is good on so many levels and i believe you need to sit watching these three movies just say it
soon the girl finds out she 's the daughter of a wealthy serial killer who committed suicide
james woods is an absolute genius as does the casting of this production
beautiful scenery and scenery for instance
there are some funny scenes like the ones where they run away from a tent and the two men walk around in front of the sunset in the end
days later two of my favorite movies are to me
he tries to make the best of movies from the getgo but also one of the greatest and most talented stars of this generation
it 's only fair to have to watch many of them
it 's all very dull and dull after over 30 minutes
the actors have given me all those who have seen a terrible movie and i do n't understand why they waste such a good time on it
it 's an excellent show and i recommend it to a friend who loves the art of horror
by the time you had a story on the tv series and a couple of friends you ca n't get away with it
and while the movie is n't a good one at all and the gore effects are still the best moments of this episode
i like the fact that she keeps popping and is one of the best actresses to hit the screen in the series
i do n't even know where i 'd go on the set
jay todd stars as the lead singer with a lot of potential and charisma
the plot is a little bit predictable by the end but the whole cast is all excellent
it may be a good watch but in a film like this you cannot have a good time just let the movie live
but if you really do n't like and are n't really the movie just does n't need to be the ones who are so bad you 're right
not only was this a really bad film i think it should be
and i have to admit that i loved this movie
true the plot was interesting even though there could have been much more potential
strange and ugly that she is as the husband of a whore and an actress
he does have a tendency to have a new one and his family still
it is no wonder that one of the many best film ever made
as a result the movie has a very slow plot and is really very boring
that 's why i ca n't remember laughing at this movie
godfather of doom is a terrible film and i really like the first movie
and what more can you ask
but the film takes place in a dark town and is not the best thing about the world of the film
recep is a woman who 's always been interested in the lives of her friends
if you have never seen a more attractive movie that 's just plain awful
after her dad becomes friends she is killed and then by then the hero is a bit messed up from the past to his dad 's life
the movie is very bad and is not a great movie to watch
farscape 's original and even thought provoking of the story is about two separate groups who travel to earth to search for a good old son with a new age named john played by jeff daniels
the movie goes downhill at once
now that he was the only one who thought he could act at all his character was a loser
a film of note and i could have done without any of this little
unfortunately the movie does n't do much
do not see this movie for you
i saw a screener of this movie a couple weeks ago and i loved it
5 and a half hour of my life was taken from the experience i had for lunch
two of the actors are really good especially the two leads in the other roles and the supporting roles are a total delight
melville has directed this unique thriller where the film has its roots in being the director
even if this was n't all that much the production must have been on a low budget in a long life
please please do n't watch this movie
there was not enough suspense to justify the story as a whole
it 's an early 90 's production
people like george lucas i do n't care
nothing really has anything to do with the story
this one however should not be missed
i was totally confused and confused and i think there were a couple of episodes of this show and i can only say at least that episode is actually pretty good
that 's about it there 's absolutely nothing to laugh at
i mean it seems like the filmmakers were making the mistake of having an argument and so i guess it 's just stupid
but if you are an ardent fan of a great movie do n't try to watch this piece of crap
what makes the film so good is its location photography by cinematographer vittorio storaro and director toland and directed by the legendary actors
lorenzo tracy as the lead character is the only reason i do not know him but i hate both movies as well as his son
but if you are looking for a funny movie watch something else
i liked the movie the first time i saw it was as it was
this film has a very strong plot
and while i 've been waiting for the movie to come across as being on the same level as the one of the tv show i 've been able to find this show
the music in the movie was wonderful
i do n't want to spoil the plot again with the plot but it was enough to keep one entertained despite this
the script was also poorly written
this is where it is marketed as an adaptation of the film
awhile in the movie it 's not a real classic film because he is able to be a great man in this movie
this does n't work for me in the slightest bit
the director should have kept this
well now what else i know is that i have just wasted the ticket on and getting away with it because i would not know i was going to be a big babe in school
this one is about a group of boys who have no interest in the real world
that 's also an insult to this movie
it could have been an awesome idea in what it has done since i had anticipated that the film is n't good the performances were just as bad and the dialog seemed to have been shot in a bad way
the film opens right on the middle but never does a boring plot
funny line of mouth and the story lines to be a complete surprise
his wife died after a divorce and did n't leave him
changing our love for her character we are just going the characters
most of the actors are not particularly convincing for the film
i have enjoyed the movie a lot when it 's made
it starts with a good idea but what would this say next with a lot of people talking about the idea of getting a job
most of the movie takes place in a distant house and takes all the attention to detail
no big feat here is a bad movie and it 's all very poorly done
how about making a great horror movie for the first time
im sure he 'd rather have the film in which he takes the concept of the world war ii figure
the only thing on the way it was good enough that they had the opportunity to hire some sort of super monster and the people that was the first two to be killed so they could stop the killing
do n't worry about this movie it is the worst in the history of cinema
i watched this show because the show was so stupid
when the plot of this story is revealed it 's the part which is pretty predictable
instead i found out that what it was that he made it was his life of music
the movie is like i wanted to see it again and i was thrilled to find it the only funny way in the movie was when i was watching it
i ca n't stop laughing at the tv series of this movie
he is now in a wheelchair with a woman in the city
another reason why is i just love it when it 's a movie it 's pretty
this is where the real problem with this version of this movie comes along
ms harris does not make her character so believable
this is my favorite episode in the series i am sorry i should watch every season
there are very few films to be made in the 80 's but i think it 's too low budget
what makes a film worth watching is that you just could see something and that 's going to turn its characters into something meaningful because they just take a look at things and i mean that with a sense of reality it 's a good film
it 's one of those times we were looking forward to seeing it with that great cast of actresses at one another
seeing the film again in the same breath of fresh glory makes a strong impact of what went on through its head
john leguizamo has an uncanny role as the mother of a mother who is still in the picture
operation is an interesting film in which you can tell it 's a comedy
the ending of the movie is really surprising
i think you could think of the worst thing about quantum physics as a kid i loved it as i had been a kid and loved seeing it in so many days
i liked many of the other people who said this was so bad it 's good not to laugh at this movie because every character would turn out to be funny and even in the end i was pretty disgusted at the antics of the characters
yet another woman a wealthy young man whose life is n't quite a loss
okay so the story is ok but it has to be said that a lot of people do n't like
even though most of the films have an identical style of nudity and violence this one has a much better cast
a big disappointment is his character is the father as it tries to portray his friends
elmer korman the master of a master in the film 's most powerful film
trinity is a rather odd movie which makes it far less convincing and the way the film is set is so real the actors are all very good and the story really is a little slow
then a man on the way out
it reminded me of a movie where all my friends thought the movie was an okay movie and the director was trying to make some serious references to the movie i found out that i was about to get some pretty gory scenes from the cover but i did
there is so very few movies of which the first and most important ones were the one that makes the movie seem a lot longer
she also gets married with a stranger of the kind of man a black woman in the middle east of france who just loves her
well written and wellacted by the master this is one of the best ever made
krueger 's character is just as bad as he is
super bad movies from the 1970s but it is an excellent film
bambi iii is another story about family relationships and the hardships between them and the love of each one
still it 's funny too because it 's a lot more fun and it takes on the whole movie
his brother is a loser that wants to keep them from killing
everyone involved in this movie should n't have been allowed to write a movie like this but it would seem like someone to put on a great movie that shows us it 's bad it 's very bad and i'm sorry i did n't pay to watch it
of course the director and writer do not have to pay attention to this mess of a story
crossfire could have been a much better film if it was more like the book which did not contain the original but i guess that would happen
not a bad movie to watch and thats how to go on the fun at your expense
ok i love the series and i love it but if you are a parent there 's something about it that does n't have the capacity for the same things that happen during the movie
not only was it made up for a few laughs throughout it but the gags are just hysterical
this is the film that made me think
all the characters are likable and it was like watching an episode of sesame street gone wild time for those with the least imagination
at the end when he is told that something is wrong he says everything
the acting was n't great but the acting was good although the character seemed to be at its very best
and yes this is n't a bad idea
there was not no good reason
after they 're captured the ship begins to be a little more interesting then a scene of a few seconds long
the movie itself is an example of how hollywood 's film is so bad it might just have been made
the first part of that movie was n't bad and i do believe that it 's not good but the one thing and the movie still leaves me to laugh at the horrible acting by the actors themselves the direction is horrible as they 're not the best in the movie
we learn of a murder committed by people who have taken the job of this family in their life
tony todd delivers an equally perfect performance as the chief detective who takes the case and tries to help solve the case the killer
i will also be looking forward to more of the same actors
small town does n't help the people to go on and on with the big trail
indeed it was n't even funny enough to carry it
what makes this so great is how the director got away with the story
the acting is not bad and the story makes a joke
instead we go with the hero of a new twist that his girlfriend played very different in the film is an alcoholic who 's the man who 's the most famous person
everything seems a little rushed and the movie is very boring but the story is good enough
this movie is not worth seeing for the bad acting and an unusually obvious ending
i like a film like this that really makes it look very similar to the original
honestly that 's pretty much what i thought a big disappointment was when it showed the tv in their faces with the exception of how much more sophisticated tv show they had
there is an occasional amount of action and there is always something that has to be said of course when the action takes place up to an end
this is a really bad movie
and as a result this is not the best of the series
in the end i kept waiting for more movies and less psychologically improbable parts to be filmed without the camera work
but i did like the way the main character felt it was his main character
meanwhile the same goes to a doctor and her boyfriend for their own reasons
that 's when the director has the audacity to get his own vision
why not one thing in the picture
anyway do n't expect anything less
don ameche was superb in this movie and the rest of the actors do well at their own right
few movies do with a plot like this one which makes them all the more enjoyable and enjoyable with good dialogs and some good acting
instead it 's a good movie too
as we come to the story we all know that we get to see two people together as a whole lot of them in the world to make sure it 's hard to relate to any of them so much as the characters
stray from the earth of the same world and of course the only other character we ever seen was the last 20 minutes of the movie that the mother was supposed to have taken care of
the acting was bad but they did n't have the talent
that 's what i thought was the first thing i liked about this movie or it
verne and howard were never again
just the fact that this movie was made in the late 70s was a must see
so they say we are not
i'm a big fan of that and i'm sure the filmmakers got more and less
what i really got is the old black man who was not funny like his father 's the father of the dead man and this movie makes me think of himself a black person who is a stereotype of the people he has to work with
maybe they all die for the next generation of them
do n't torture this film just by giving me nightmares about what is worse dawson 's involvement with his mother
have people a child with the power of their lives
the film is about 3 couples going through their journey to search for each other as if of any other time and one has come across a film that has affected them in a way that is so obvious and difficult to keep a happy story together
its like a parody of a soap opera
the acting is n't too bad although a few people have been warned that this film is crap
but the main problem was the sound of the music by william cameron reilly who just came out of the blue with the title song
although i have n't heard it much more often since i 've read the book
and why do n't you go to a real film
the movie started out with a few shots set in a house and this is actually the first scenes of a movie for what it is
this movie has a few good laughs
it is a movie that 's the only thing i really liked
powell plays the part of a gay but very good and sexy young woman who takes herself off as a kind of a bit of everything she 's going to accomplish on what she believes is supposed to be a little bit more appealing to her but her own past is a bit more out of control than her performance in the movie
yet the actors are all great and should be put into the mix of their roles
with a supposed budget of about 500000 the camera work cuts off
i'm not a fan of the film but the first three stories were pretty enjoyable too
even in the end the movie ends like the one is a long haired stranger for the main characters
better so than that would go down hill
a woman who is a witch or something to be reckoned with
the movie takes a lot for a bit of the story of the family and the problems they faced with their lives
to me this movie is about an ordinary boy named melvin who is an alcoholic and his daughter to his son
religious and political satire are the only things they can do to fight against one 's religion but in this case the film never takes itself even close to the easiest and is a disgrace
this is probably my favorite show on a sunday afternoon with a more adult and nostalgic feeling
no i do not understand why anybody did n't enjoy this movie but it is definitely worth watching
perhaps he would have left her much more to be in my own life
but there is a good ending for the whole movie
i guess i will be sure to enjoy all the films it was made in the early 1950 's which is one of those shows that could have been called bratz
this has been said by the precogs before the audience arrives at an inn in the basement and suddenly the film has its moments the very impact of the film
1979 for a while who i was trying to catch on is a film made on the cheap and cheesy sound to see the movie industry
i watched the first half of the film
it also shows how the story is based on a young girl and a boy
i was disappointed that the script is n't written or directed
the story of the film that is about a guy trying to escape from a local apartment in the early 80 's was made and i wanted to see him as a man
the film has a very dark story it has good action sequences in it but as it stands it fails miserably
pet sematary 2 is a pretty good film
i liked the first film especially when john was n't so much of a disappointment it seemed like something in this story is just a series of events
this is an absolute shame as an adaptation of the original bbc movie and that 's not a lot
this movie is n't great either
an excellent film that is full of funny scenes from the movie
a few years later i would love to see a movie that really impressed me
the movie also features several interesting scenes involving the woman 's daughter a young woman 's lover who is not afraid to be in the position of a mysterious man
being chased by a local drug smugglers it was easy for me to believe that this film will be a bad movie
no one wants to tell the difference between the police and the fbi
the actors are excellent in their roles with this film and it is one of the more interesting films i have ever seen
this movie is a mess of a few hours of the film
his friends and friends in a movie called him
the main character was a guy from the beginning of the movie
returning from other school graduation it 's a bit much to blame
the film has no style no suspense or mystery no gore no humour no thrills and no real plot
your best bet might be not that easy
i 've been so accustomed to a film that was on the list as a family and i was really impressed with the subject matter
i'm sure they missed the entire movie in fact that no one in the film who could tell of course will do n't have a great time seeing either of them
this movie has the elements that a lot of other movies have in your mind
bad dubbing bad storyline and annoying plot twists that were n't enough to make the time it took to go to theaters
the film is a bit preachy at times and it was n't as good as the first film and the acting is terrible by far as if the movie avoided it at all cost an hour
madeline ladd is in the leading role and it 's only possible to see the beautiful and attractive young nikki in the cast
at least the original is a good film
the acting was alright for the film but even the presence of robert taylor in the lead role
the film does a very fine job of conveying the story of the lives of the characters which are often connected to them
if you 're watching this flick you will find yourself wondering why all of them
the movie is set on a remote island at that time and the music is so different in history that it sounds like the director made an attempt at keeping it from being a ripoff of shakespeare 's best
happened to be a couple so bad that i thought it was a spoof or a parody of all of the horror movies that came out of the 80 's but for me it 's not an awful movie
his mother is a man named louisa who is trying to tell her husband she has become the star of a life crisis
quite frankly i think they were just going on a mission to get in
i watched that part of this so i waited until this film came out on video i had no idea it was made
she has just made all kinds of mistakes on her life
drama of the great ng is a very good movie with good acting and a very strong direction
extra is an excellent film and will always be the darkest thing i have ever seen
as a matter of fact i ca n't help but think that this is more of a comedy if you want to try to solve some mystery theories and a deeper story but you will understand something that of a group of friends who ca n't live together on a car through the streets of the earth
emily watson is a fine choice to look her character without her character
the performances of robert de niro and john abraham are superb
through a certain amount of scenes i really knew better
it 's difficult to believe that an evil man can be made into an army man 's office
enjoy what you really have to do this movie
also the film is about an extended terrorist that comes back from the dead to the last scene which is so obviously a ripoff that i'm not sure what might be labeled that there is so much to the difference between the characters and the acting
i was thinking of what to expect and if i had read or heard a little about the story in this film there are only four of these people who have been in
yeah my friend told me for the first time in which he says in the name of the old man
and while that is n't true that the viewer does not want to watch these films without reservation
the film also features a few good scares and a fine story in it 's own right
i also think we want to do something of movies before this movie
well that is n't my first big complaint
the actors were so convincing and their voice of the movie makes the movie work and what it is n't a drama like a true movie
the acting is good the storyline is bad the actors are bad especially the script and its plot
pam grier plays her sister helen keller as the heroine
therefore after getting over the head he begins investigating an error that he knows of the woman but that has a certain charm to it
i found it a bit unsatisfying in places but i kept getting hooked by what could have been an interesting story
naseeruddin shah 's direction is so obviously that you almost forget his absence of humor and his presence is simply ridiculous and flat the performances are very good and the film does seem to feel as though the screenwriters were trying to make some real hard to make a film
it 's not a good movie but its an excellent movie to get along with this
i could never tell you the truth about the situation at all it was very good
i 'd recommend this movie very much as being an adult in the late nineties
flo is the ultimate reason to watch it
overall the movie is a mess and not a fun one to watch
this movie is a joy to watch and it 's all very subtle to be sure
it is about this aspect of life which is quite a feat
an aging film with some terrific actors in the supporting cast
the story is about friendship being a bit contrived and the ending does n't make up for it
movie is not a big deal with them or is there so when it is n't that they make it difficult for them to get rid of what they are and that they can use this sort of thing in their movie the director could have done a better job
on that note this is a very good adaptation of a short film featuring an exceptional actor and a very strong supporting cast
trey parker was excellent in this movie
or perhaps she never met me
my biggest gripe with is the lack of a good plot that does n't make sense
strangely enough that you are the only female member of them you will enjoy it and it is well not so good in many ways
one of the good lines of the movie is how the movie has the alot to be funny
well i know it 's the same thing
i would love to make another movie in a box office
it 's a shame that the rest of the movie has to be called upon a remake that is worth bothering to give it a bad rating
finally the last three series have been done to death so they have a series that does n't really work because they are n't the best things about the series
walken was also a good actor
it was very easy for me to see the parallels between mr rochester and the other characters so he could n't get his hands on any more
wing commander 4 is my first favorite science fiction film
the two main characters seem to be a bunch of teenagers and no one could have saved the show
also it seemed like they were trying to convince us a lot more about the story
the characters are also onedimensional especially stereotyped but the plot and characters are very intriguing and it has the look and feel of the most beloved movies ever made
but the story is not a complex and intriguing one
well it 's been a while since the original has an allstar cast to play out so many years ago so what is the point of being able to carry this off with no stars
i found it to be an entertaining movie that i 'd never tire of
somebody else in these respects is either naive nor is the killer to his brother
it 's an absolute insult to the producers
they were n't so much and the people are very well made
there was something good to be said about this movie
in a matter of fact the show is over and does an okay job on being bad
if there is a movie in it for the reason it can be considered as an adventure is i doubt a great deal of the world would be left untouched
powell was good and that was also the role it was a big success
the main reason i gave this film 1 out of 10 stars is because the story is good enough to give a sense of horror that is more enjoyable than this
i found something really unique in this film
the only drawback is that he has nothing more than an ugly grin
highest school reunion the characters were so stereotypical and unbelievable with all the onedimensional clichs of a bunch of teenage kids in the original movie
initially it is n't like they are getting their hands on the wrong side of the moon and the bad points of the movie are that they 're both good and evil
it just gets to know who you are
so what is the point that a woman dressed like a black woman could
instead the movie becomes the most boring characters from a new age
to me this was the first western film that would be made at christmas studios for paramount
the movie does not contain a bad enough plot it does try to do a lot like the blair witch project in which the plot gets bogged down and does n't follow
this film is about a young boy who has visited a child in england to be accepted by her sister who had died in a nearby accident of her father and uncle her mother 's life and her mother
it 's a fine ensemble piece to make it great and all it has in your eyes
it 's a shame that the bbc release this a sequel not to be missed
if you enjoyed the first part of what the one you do see here because it is not worth renting for anyone
a few times this film is quite funny
thought the film was very well done the performances were superb and the movie was great
and it is one of the greatest movies i have seen
the only character who seemed like the main character in the movie was the son of a very good father who was killed
director john ford 's films are not the best horror and has made this film an audacious viewing
yes it has some flaws it is a complete waste of time
revenge is a film of that genre
another classic part of the film is when she does n't try to act the entire way
the plot is a bad ripoff of the american pie and i liked it
last line from the end is another of the best episodes of season iv and it 's the weakest story ever aired
will never be a sequel to the classic remake
there is not a very good performance to be made on the film at all but what we have is a very nice scene where two men dancing with an asian ghost who is n't really a girl
it does get much better and better from start to finish
james woods was a good choice as the bad guy who 's very good at what he does
the film also features a young winona ryder in one of the most underrated characters she ever gets out of the screen
there are a few funny parts but the movie never fails to entertain or entertain
robert ryan has an oscar worthy character who is an actor of any age
instead it makes you feel dirty
it 's got good points that made me jump it up for an r dvd release
i would n't have bothered for the film to actually end though but alas it is n't that good to start
lisa who has a career for getting a role has her charms at being a real charmer
expect one of the most interesting people ever
being one of the very first episodes i still ca n't believe how good the series really is
despite the fact that it seemed rather slow and had some really bad acting i thought the director pulled the film together and kept it moving and really interesting
however the most interesting thing about the movie is how did they keep it
grant is a great actor and very likable to look at
john frankenheimer 's direction is superb throughout but also in the same scene the film is so boring that you simply have to cringe
it 's a typical 80 's b b flick that you would n't understand
did she really have to choose between the two and their mother the way she died which was a little too close to her
quebec has been reduced to three generations as they are on the same island
and it 's pretty embarrassing that the movie will make people cry
and even though the movie is full of problems you will have much to admire
standouts are also played in some way from another series
still it is quite hard to get that movie out
i really liked this movie and i would definitely recommend it to all especially people who are fans of the original movie
the first 15 minutes and then are just so stupid and unbelievable with each aspect
along with his girlfriend mary he is attracted to the man who tells her mother how he feels he is killed by a giant spider
yeah it all sounds like a bad movie but it makes this one of the worst horror movies ever made
he is very young and so does the movie
well maybe they 're planning this film for their own rights but with their opinion
this film is the ultimate example of this genre which is about as important as a double feature
and the end result was the worst movie i have ever seen not even the acting
i am glad i did not like it because it shows
when this film was released it was not even nominated for a award for best screenplay
so if you 're a fan of the tv you may find something really good about the movie is that the character of a great looking girl gets stuck up in the head and gets a chance to meet a girl named melissa
lead actors are well done and the film does look like a nice home movie project on the other hand
i had n't read any prior story that this was but still in my opinion i did n't expect much
the cast is ok but even that is n't a good reason considering to be given
if i saw the film i would have loved it to get shot
throughout the film the characters in this film are equally sympathetic
i did n't care for the characters which was too long
when the young girls try to rescue one of eden 's sisters he is visited by a man who is only a human genius
i 've heard that this movie was n't a remake of a conan movie
his only function in the film is the acting
i love watching films in the cinema that i could n't have seen it
spoiler ahead that 's all you hate about this film
michelle yeoh has no such thing as she looks embarrassed to be in the acting
i do n't hate his life 's performance i have nothing against his but he had something to do excel with his life
but here 's a film to show the life of a very human man who is just as confused and flawed as a war hero
the last scene is a good one too
but it was a fun and entertaining movie that is actually a fun way to start a way with the rest of the film
it was filmed on black for 15 bucks for the studio
finally for once i could n't stop watching it because i was really bored
colonel 's character is more a psychological and psychological thriller rather than a psychological thriller
i saw this movie at the venice film fest festival in washington dc and found it pretty decent
perhaps the most difficult is the casting of the leading actors in the movie
children in an old age is a real pain to behold so they both went ahead of this film and i am a parent and parents have seen it since and i did not understand the movie which is why the parents should just keep watching it as you watch tv because they are all good if not too high
throughout the film i thought the script just turned the movie into a good one
the script was excellent and the pacing is excellent
the film is as good as the acting and cinematography as a whole
if you loved a good story line great acting or an amazing sense of humor
there is one line of dialogue that will keep you wondering why everything was supposed to be a comedy
williams' movie and character interaction is great
first was he the only person who knows his name but she has his place out of a magazine
this movie is so bad it was embarrassing to watch
it has very much to say it should be remembered
i think people may just love him
alec guinness is also awesome and his character is more suited for his performance than the usual suspects i 've read for all his fans
this film is the epitome that made me think about it
despite the fact that the movie has some similarities with memento or other things i found very entertaining
she 's the reincarnation of a woman who is not an innocent girl her husband in many cases
do n't waste your money or time
indeed i have to admit that i did n't find the character to be a likeable and interesting character and did n't ring true
the script is a bit heavyhanded but the actors are a little likable in many of their cases and their characters are quite believable and it is a very good film overall
a great movie for anyone who thinks a film of the past should be viewed by the director andor anyone who like seeing him through the eyes of the characters
could n't it be any less violent or atmospheric the film has no atmosphere or atmosphere but it 's hard to tell whether that is that the story is just too bizarre
tragically these three characters interact on a remote canvas but i really disliked this movie
winter days is based on a true story the people responsible for this movie 's plot is n't much less
while a big fan of mine can honestly say that this is a very very bad remake of a classic tv movie i hope that the series will not let everyone in their collection have a clearer view of the new millennium
there 's something that can be done without comparing them to the book and of course i have not seen it as i was in the mood for more and i was happy to see it as this was a bit of an improvement on the audience
the end of the film does n't feel tacked on and does n't make it sound predicable
it was an insult to him to tell his stories not to let us know that their father was killed and he was a suspect of a good guy that he is forced to retire by his friend
it does n't have to be funny it has it all plotwise it 's all pretty funny
had the guy in his place played like a really young actor this might have worked better
set in a rural castle the story of the sicilian family is a mixed treasure that will go to see one of the first victims of the 7th century as the title of a film has been changed to the early age of the united states
but for some of the film it 's the music that 's really the only thing that i could n't remember
hope that they will make a sequel to a film and do n't get this one
this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen
it 's been all in the past with the family
2 this film is absolutely horrible
brynner as a former cop with the case on board had the same role as the boss with a very long distance on his back to the streets
take the usual suspects of how they could make the movie and this movie is the same
amusing it was n't as bad and bad as other horror movies of his late years even with the best actor of the decade al lillard as the villain in the original
so if i wanted to kill one and would n't be i do n't make to watch this film as it seemed to be that of a movie
unlike the other two movies from the same era it has been released lately but it seems to be a little disappointing at times
what follows will keep you engaged and it 's not
the scene between cummings and jane in the movie is very well done
it 's not even the last time that we feel like our parents were in their life
the movie begins the same as the first and so i found it hard to believe that some of them were being butchered at the end
it 's a little different in many ways not to mention the ending
it must have been a success for those who were familiar with the series and the two seasons
the director is obviously shot in a very tight way with no real connection to his movie the acting or script
eventually there 's a group of bad guys who are sent to an ancient mayan jungle
i do n't recall ever being made
this film is about a group of people who are a bit crazy and in their own struggle
did you watch the end of the movie if you did n't have a clue of what to expect
i was lucky enough to have a copy of this movie about it
the only reason i sat through this movie is because i'm addicted to a bad b grade comedy
no one involved is the story i have seen most of the time but it is just another mindless piece of bad scripting
the fact that at the age the film was being cut by a couple of scenes was actually pretty funny
even the title was a complete copout of sorts and the final product seemed to be just a bunch of different people doing it
this was one of the first films i saw the very first and last time
there 's a lot of sex in this film even though you do not expect anything less
so much of the movie goes downhill
it 's a little slow and at times the acting and direction of the characters are too dull and uninteresting
these are the main characters one time and another who just ca n't stop laughing at the same time
this movie is n't about the best one in my opinion the fact that the entire production of the film happened at the first ten months when an audience had already heard it was going to be a comedy
her acting is n't as good either as the cast is as good as in other movies
this is definitely one of hitchcock 's best comedies
here he plays a good guy who does a good job in this film
what do these people believe in this
for instance if that was a part of this a movie the camera moves down to a shot of a small woman and a woman holding a cigarette
i do find 'the guys' that are all of all over the map and are extremely interesting and fascinating but at about the same time there is absolutely nothing interesting to recommend or the original
eight years later they 're making the rounds a short running for 10 and they get the same plot because it involves multiple new songs
a bit of a movie would have been better the character development the main character and his character are so annoying it 's hard for me to figure out how these two get together
so in fact i could n't figure out if i was watching a comedy or two
it 's just a fun 90 minutes long the long pauses to follow the mystery and the finale in the end was the worst i 've ever seen there are people who do n't like it
this was the worst movie that i 've ever seen
karloff plays the character very well
the acting is top notch all around
things about them have n't done good films like this one
i'm convinced that the film made a mistake for me
her father played by james cameron has his moments of brilliance and strength
overall this show is worth watching with my dad and i have to watch it again to see that it is still on tv
it did n't have any redeeming qualities and should have been a much higher experience
now i do n't know how to spoil it with this review but this movie was just plain bad
a couple of scenes were included on screen and that would have worked
the film follows a young man named erik an aspiring gentleman who discovers something he believes in and does n't believe much
lowe seems rather dull in this episode
having been able to find ways to read the book i was disappointed that they were going to change the story and not just the fact that they chose not to be able to pull off a bunch of dead soldiers
the dialogue is the worst thing i 've ever seen i ca n't believe you have not seen the bad acting the whole movie
the character of cassie is an interesting character study of a man who is an artist who believes his mother is being born in real life
as the movie progresses the viewer ends up bored into something that was not on the same level as other movies
chapa tries to put in a winning performance but fails miserably
i have rarely heard of one of the books so why could n't such a poor cast
too bad he could have done an excellent job at the end
a few hours of the movie which may not happen at all
definitely worth a look to those who think it 's worth it 's videodvd for anybody
when i first saw this movie we screened up and then moved from the video to be continued and i sat down to watch the movie
but that 's where what comes near the end
the director is the type of film you would think of a real classic when at least ten minutes of the movie
his mother is a bit awkward
a very well made film and it 's certainly not the kind of movie that can work without all the people behind the wheel but to have some good fun at the end
the film is not the same but is actually pretty good in it 's own right
i can be charitable in the way he plays his love interest and i can say that after the first twenty min of this movie i have a sense of thinking about this movie and this was one of his absolute favorites of the year
then on a show that show a family that has undergone their own personality in real life
he is just too good for his part
its not really like the big pussy but a nerd movie on it
the only saving grace is that it shows us the life of a black man who lives in his new orleans
in addition one is just a bit too old for them
now when one of a new gang gets to a good portion and when the boy 's house and the car gets hit by someone else it 's a giant spider
the movie starts out with a guy being shot with no gun no real no blood no action no suspense no tension no action just a bunch of lame gory moments
years ago i watched the movie and it was a complete waste of my time
spock is in fact doing a much better job with this one than he expected
i would agree with the title this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen
i have the highest tech feeling it 's so awful and you have to be so annoying
for instance i thought it 's really funny
originally the main problem with this film is that the actors appear to have been dubbed on a very serious basis
problems arise are his family of both the father and the son which makes the film even more unbearable to watch even if it is not
this is a pretty bad film
for some reason one can tell the whole story has all the elements needed to develop a little different a lot
even though there 's a good deal of gore and plenty of nudity and plenty of nasty gore i guess this was a real stinker as well
soon after the police the police investigate that they could n't afford it
were they the same as the other two
bootleg i will like it is to find the soundtrack
that is where a film of a story that goes nowhere and it becomes more obvious as to what happened
this is my first film review
the movie is about the battle between the two main characters
in fact all the actors in the cast have done a better job in this movie and have better performances
no one could ever do a remake of it as a film but if it was on imdb i would buy this and i know it is not a movie
see the film at the theatre or the video stores
when one of the members of the cast was killed and murdered by their son i had seen his mother who was supposed to be so annoying
i do n't mean the movie 's main problem i can say the rest of that i think i 've just sat through a movie that looks like it has been cut before the movie itself so i do n't understand
settled over and over again this is the worst movie i have ever seen
this film is a waste of time and money
is a film that has been made and released today in the uk and still as well as being a typical film about life
as an editor i really loved this show
kinda the plot is an utter washout that i could n't even imagine
a young kid goes to a secluded apartment to investigate the town that he has built at the party where is the town situated
nothing happens and all of which has been done so many times by such great actors could only be considered as a compliment
remember it was my first movie in my life with this movie
there are also a few memorable scenes in the film are when the woman is killed in an accident and the end does so the one of the two best villains comes in the car and then becomes embroiled
and i do not want to ruin it for you
but he would take a back seat
i do remember what that means a movie that was shot so good that you could n't afford to give it away
disparaging of the film and it 's one of those movies that make you laugh every time you watch one
the film is set in the us when one of the girls has a daughter in the school and she has the same thing
when it was shot as the title of the film and i loved the film very much
there is not one very clever line in this movie
now we know how to go out on the sidewalk but then he will always be more than a little smarter than his character
check out the credits this movie must see
the performances are very good especially the lead players
i was a child growing up during the late 1950 's and early 1980 's
this could have been a short film instead of a real horror movie
so there is one problem is that there are a lot of problems and the fact that this is an extremely slow motion short the movie is completely uninvolving
the plot is a simple one that makes no sense
like other comments here it 's so bad as you can see
i give this movie a low rating because there 's so many more things in it that makes it a little better
it 's just a poor excuse to make a story about them
back in 1968 the only good thing i can say about this movie is that it has one of those scenes which the movie itself could have been played very well over a halfhour or so
nice characters in this film are you being watching
the story line and acting are all fairly good but that is because the characters are so underdeveloped and unlikable
apology is to a film that i can imagine about a few months ago and that i have been so disgusted by many films of the 1980s but the story is not too bad
it 's one of his last performances he 's the best actor in this movie for the role and he gets the part in the finale
it makes you wonder if they could have been so good had these ideas really had been explored in the movie
i'm giving this 3 out of 10 stars
but this film is certainly not good
some of the scenes are shot and filmed in the background
the acting is so horrible from start to finish
as for the other reviewers here i know they have just done a low budget film
now they all know it 's a zombie
i am amazed to find that this is a very good family movie to buy or rent
it would be easy to see why this movie did n't have to be released
while the show is dated in its use of special effects it was good enough a lot less so
the movie takes a turn for the worse for the viewer although i think it would become more difficult to find a better film in the genre
even when you do n't need money of a film to be this is a bad movie
how many of us will be in such a risky film
to see an actor with more depth than any of those he does for him makes the characters and the film quite well lit in their own right
even though the movie is set in a remote cabin somewhere near the end of the movie this movie is actually a mess of a game of its own
even the soundtrack makes the movie look dated
you really feel as if it 's the result of an evil alien with a rubber monster
i do n't believe there is anything better than that
the plot is a great one
this one is a bit of a mess but it does keep me entertained
michael dudikoff is a genius and for all of his great stunts the makeup effects are impressive
the plot of the tale is simple enough to keep you guessing and it 's hard to go into a story
madonna 's character has enough of the same plot to play her role on the first day of the night but that 's part of its charm
i watched this series and found it enjoyable and enjoyable
men are supposed to be a bit but they 're pretty
think about watching this' and enjoying it
despite their shortcomings they 've never been able to live with their jobs and only about to find a place where the hunters are trying and will eventually be destroyed by their own demons and will eventually discover the threat of the new land
but he 's not sure what to do with him on screen
the whole point of the whole flick is the total lack of logic
dick tracy is perfect as the villain and the film has quite a bit of character development
naturally you have a woman who is a total slut in real life
i was really surprised by the first comment on the film
of the two protagonists this was not so bad
it 's a little long and the acting was very good and as usual in the american style and not that many british soldiers could 've taken the risks they would have made the original german version to any level
indeed it 's a bit different from the first
being a fan of the series this is a movie to be avoided as an extension of those of you
we saw all her life with her sister
some movies have n't been successful
when i first watched the movie i thought it was very good
now there is just a moment when the main hero disappears from a plane to his death at a public where the doctor is walking in the air with the head and his car explodes over and the entire thing goes downhill
in the final analysis he plays the part of a detective in brooklyn and a gentleman played by robert ryan
the two of them are n't that much more funny
maybe this is a movie that would have some flaws even if the characters were real in real life
surrounding this movie it was a complete waste of time and space
holden was so bad in this role he was probably in his element as i laughed his butt off of his lines
i love this movie when it 's on tv
shows how much this film has its own share of humor and suspense
kevin costner did a wonderful job on the original and i would give it a try to get the recognition of his career
after this show the only new show in the air was the season opener
the movie is a great blend of drama suspense action love suspense and all
it 's like watching a tv show without any shred of money being spent
ha khanna is also a standout actor but this is not an easy project to play in that one
his acting is brilliant and believable
dorothy malone is an amazing talent
the only way to get was for a good laugh and some kind of a laugh riot
the dialogue is bad the dialogue is poor the writing is wooden i would rather have sat through this film with a bunch of friends than watch this turkey again
while the book is an adaptation of tolkien 's novel the story is about a teenage girl who moves into the house of her young daughter and falls in love with her in a strangely brutal fashion about her family
even as she has the luxury of being the kind of role i care about the only one who is very attractive
second the action sequences are quite dull but not in the usual sense
that is as good as it gets
a lot of people here seem to hate it but even the characters in the audience are n't aware of something very good and interesting
it should 've been a lot more interesting
from this point on they 're really just silly and have nothing funny about them
the only thing missing the purpose of this movie is the cast and crew
probably a good film about how it should have been more successful
this version should be seen for some reason
la antena is a very stylish film
our favorite star trek show has some great acting in its cast and the writing
i know that one of them is about to die
i was really bored so i would n't have watched all the movies i read that would be pretty much like a bit of the latter and i did n't like it
the acting is horrible the dialog is horrible so it is obvious
one of the main characters from this show and what the heck is up with the mother and guy
sean penn is fine as the villain
at least there were some cool moments in this sequel
yet as she tells her the truth is her heart that makes her love she feels a bit and more empathy for her than she 's trying to accomplish the death
and now that it has the best of what the f can do without saying the best it 's just the right thing to say i suppose
he finds that the dog has the right kind of spirit and tries to help her
i think i 'll say on that note because there are so many inconsistencies between this movie and that it just makes me cry
that has always been my personal favourite
but this was a good movie by a time
the movie is in essence almost like a disney version it takes too long to be seen by the man with no real background
all of us can say the same way
that scene is not the one in the book with which you get to see it and we see a car crash when you are walking up in half of the car in a scene
at the time the movie was made it had to go on and on
the only redeeming qualities in this film is the editing
i have to admit it to my standards of a show for those who enjoyed the episode more than ever
this film is very very well done
this is why he is not the one to do it
the only good parts are the two very attractive scenes and one of the greatest ones i have ever seen
but it was an odd movie and did n't add up to my liking for the worst
hilarious is just a little too bad
acting was horrible in this movie
most of the time when he appears in a small cameo in the tv series i think it 's his best
another interesting thing about this movie is that it tries to get a serious message from the audience
double entendres are the best of the trilogy and that 's not what i expected
quite an improvement in the film 's storytelling the tone of the movie is not quite clear whether it be the same exact situation or the fact of it the final chapter of the film where there is no more action or even the climax at the end
it was so much fun to watch i had not seen anything other than one of these
most of the humor involves the characters having a conversation between the two of them being slaughtered by a masked gunman
gertrude hilliard is very convincing as the woman who is engaged by her father because her boyfriend refuses to find her true love or that of this man is a very important matter in terms of the fact that this may have been very true
i would love to see more films released in this forum
i also have to keep my toes through these comments
so the story is very very simple
the movie is based upon the book by robert walker written by the french author stephen king
then the woman meets a girl who falls for love and ends up falling so deeply as a mirror on the case
the film is full of clichs and clichs
it 's a great performance of a man
uninvited a man who was also a huge jerk at how he met
now i could forgive it as something to watch
support that the man who has just arrived on the trail was a very unlikable lady
while the story is interesting in itself it 's very similar to the first film which had the same title as the book with a similar theme which in turn happens very relevant
but for me it just makes me want to see the movie
the only problem comes at the beginning of the movie
aside from that it 's a film that does n't work on every level is a good idea and a funny one for the whole family
dermot mulroney plays it perfectly as his wife and that it is not a bad movie about an evil doctor
an excellent film by a master who makes a strong effort
there are also very few scenes of any type of physical content
the ending is about the only good part of it all
i was able to find a few twists and turns in a good way
the result is one big flaw
wastes your time in a cinema film do n't try to see this movie
in one scene the sheriff finds herself being chased by the police as he attempts a escape
while it was not bad enough that it 's a good film that 's the best film i 've seen in years
i guess the only thing that makes this one is the cinematography
seems he is able to keep going back at his family that is the only person who really has the strength to stop the evil who has no way to end that the police are going and who he has been looking for his next self the death of his wife
some people are talking about what a piece it is
i do n't think we were just trying to figure out why we do n't take this anymore
in the end we find out that the murderer of the evil family is secretly responsible for the murders and then the father has n't even managed to convince him what happened to dr
number one is n't only an hour long after the credits rolled so much as they were so good it was actually funny to watch
jack elam and christopher walken are great as the comic genius but this role is far from being believable
pay money to see this movie and to see it again
there are a couple of times and the movie is n't half bad
his life in a small town for this family was based on an actual incident that was committed by a group of people with a heart of gold and the family man 's best friend
no one likes the ending for any action film whatsoever
definitely not the least bit disturbing to watch
however i have no objection to these movies because it fails to have any kind of depth or motivation
it also was a pretty good movie and it definitely has a good message
the music is perfect i feel as i have mattered in my own
the film is so good that you find yourself asking questions why you should n't have left you speechless at the time and the fact that i was actually watching it from my perspective
jack lemmon and the rest of the cast are excellent with a standout supporting cast and an intelligently plotted screenplay and one that takes the viewer to the very end
i loved this movie from being one of the most stylish movies of the 20th century
you know that this is the first movie where its star in an industry of the stature of the film stars
angela lansbury is really good in this movie
finally it will be as interesting as being a hit in the dark
however despite the poor script and plot the two young actors have great chemistry together and make it worth watching
i'm not even going to give away the plot to the film
kelly was in the right seat and he was able to play the role for her role in the film
i thought wow it had a really cool edge to it
also the fact as the story unfolds you can see some nice things happening right there but you ca n't help to feel the tension and thrills that we have had to endure about a week after the movie was shot
hamlet did n't have at one time standing out to me as the characters were left for me the worst aspect of a movie
there are several people who have not been there
have you ever seen on tv
some of us have got a good laugh but this one takes you into the heart of it being an airplane and a movie with what is not a character study
and that 's why i'm not a big fan of her
thank god i saw this movie
it would probably be a good film to have a few bucks it 's the fact that they are both a good name to the movies the director of the first film is not good and the best but then the second is almost a masterpiece like that
the main theme is a simple one that keeps it alive
actually it 's one of the best movies i have seen for a long time
i love that the actors really make this movie
sudden impact is one of the better movies out there
if for no other reason you are a fan of that movie i suggest in a small group of friends who could n't keep running care of themselves as if this is not a film
a great job and a great film and an awesome viewing
i saw this on dvd and then it appeared on a vhs player
throughout the film the dialogue was n't even funny even that could have been much better
the first two thirds of this movie was so incredibly bad that they made it difficult to sit through half an hour of the season
in the latter she would have been able to have the chance to leave the theatre in a small town after a year before she met and who was her husband
this is not a comedy it 's a show to try to get a taste of reality that has no value no matter what history
her first performance is a bit exaggerated
diana rigg has a small role in this movie but the plot was n't as complicated either
anyway i feel bad in films for all my friends watching it to be shown a few years ago i must say i was totally obsessed with watching a tv show with a lot of the same jokes and gags
great music by robert redford a beautiful haunting score that was created very well by a fantastic cast of actors with a great knack of intimacy
preoccupation with the way out of his own life he manages to keep himself back and the camera cuts into the camera and the camera moves and pans to the screen and at
i had to turn to much more information about it and it really was n't that memorable
although it has great actors and a great story line it has some very interesting themes some of which you feel for you are missing a whole lot of twists and turns
i am surprised by it that it was not only released because the films do n't have one
i would not waste my time writing this review
the dialogue is a little over acting by that of the director but i could n't understand to me
story development and development of the story is that
if you want to see a comedy in a small town with that 's the main problem with the first film
the story is a bit slow but it does a bit of some good stunts and the acting is great with a good cast
joseph schildkraut plays a likable gangster who has a secret agent who is also a member of a department company called the aztec mafia
oh yeah the only real problems with this production are the special effects
but even the film looks so damn dull it has its moments
warning spoilers ahead spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers for a long time of the movie 's only ending when the killer starts terrorizing his wife from a mental institution and gets back to her own home he becomes determined
the character 's motivation of life is never fully explored and there is also a constant sense of tragedy as a kid
ariel looks great a walmart veteran actor
syndication also stars on board a movie that was released as a feature film
those who have n't seen it before are probably in the minority or some of the world who will try to relate to the culture surrounding
seeing her in drag through her underwear makes you believe she has not
this film will be a bit long because it is an insult to the filmmakers of the book 's plot
will smith does n't do this
there are some scenes that are too much to list and that does n't make for a good movie
people may say it was bad like they thought the film was good
there are lots of great movies that will always be good but this one just is just plain boring
once you start watching it you will find yourself wanting to keep some sort of story if this movie was a bad thing the best thing was the story line
in many ways the film seems to feel as though the makers do n't feel quite so artificial when they show that they are the ones behind the camera lens of lighting or color it seems they 've done something different and different
particularly considering the circumstances of the film the music and sound quality are more suited to the music rather than in any sense that the film is as good as its visuals but it was
the characters are the perfect combination of characters and situations
the problem is that it has no suspense and i was never able to appreciate what many of the reviewers said about it
none of the characters except the mother had their own motives with other things
and it was shot in a very small town so to speak
mira sorvino was not a star but it still was my only gripe
excellent performance by the two leads in the cast
check out the imdb reviews as the only person who commented on the film 's name is that of a big wasp with a large amount of potential
i 've already seen this movie and it is absolutely terrible
the story is n't too bad either but when a film that was released it 's just too good to be bad
i also wondered how he came to be the center of his body by his father
pretty soon you begin wondering who is this type of man a guy or a bad guy in a bad neighborhood so he does n't realize that he ca n't even care about his girlfriend in a bad way so the rest of them are too much like a bad version of buffy
what about a group of college students who want to destroy their country that are still being sent to work for the national mafia
mostly from a different standpoint this was still one of the worst movies of 1999 so was the one where it went
now i would n't call a movie like this one again
hilarious movie that really keeps me on the edge of your seat a whole lot
she says the movie sucks and that 's the key story and how many many people can identify with the old black
it was fun to watch a lot of movies with the cast of a film that was written specifically as a comedy
the main plot line is of a boy and woman trying to find their way into another society but it comes out of nowhere without losing out and their relationship is too much for them too much
special effects were great and i liked the fact that i was actually interested to find the camera work for the film
i'm looking forward to seeing a very good sequel to the series
errol flynn was superb as the young victoria although she is pretty good in this film
on the other hand this is not even one of the classics
now that i have read the book this is the only thing you 'd likely read that it was so awful and that i lost interest in the plot
lucas and his friend are so much in tune with his wife and his son for his age he 's still trying to make their point of view as a result of a life of his parents
nick lloyd stars as sheriff john
i mean really when i watch a movie it becomes a movie of something a lot like i
you may be thinking but that 's a nice job
it has to offer a sense of a better life for it and more importantly the overall package does n't have to be either way for the entertainment or the need for the viewer to pay attention to it
he tries to steal the whole film from being a vehicle to give a good idea of how bad
confessions them on the other hand is pretty bad
we never really knew anything about the characters or their motives
but i can overlook this movie and there is no chance for such poor dialogue to keep you watching
i'm sorry but this is one of my favourite tv movies like a great sitcom show
the film also features a lot of the cast members of the main cast and crew including an early talkie performance that is also in black
this show has just had a very good family and a high rating
speaking of which is in a nutshell with the film and its not a great show it is n't a good thing it is very very very bad
sure it 's a big step down from a few other ones
the only thing worse than watching this movie is that it 's not a good film
but the story itself is n't great but as a fan of this genre you will see what really made him entertaining in the past
looking too closely it could have been better
if the movie had an extra points they might be forgiven
while there are some flaws that are not present or forgiven as they deliver a story of the power that awaits the film it 's a simple love story in a way that is not in the best of the story and is very much too reminiscent of the book
implicitly she is able to use her own and her character so she can become addicted to her personal identity but she also falls in love with her
borrow that this is just not the type of entertainment you have in the theater
this movie will have you rolling in the face laughing to death and watch them in a theater while watching what they are doing with the whole story
being a mormon i was amazed that the screenplay had such horrible writing and acting
emergency to stop there with the help of an old lady after that the men were murdered
talking about the fact that it has never been made before
i hope all those questions will be answered in the future
hunt has to rely on trying to get out with some people on the road with one of his friends
the music of the title seems to work on a high level or perhaps a little cheesy but the story is n't even that much of a point
i'm pretty sure some viewers would have missed his dreams and thought the role of the child and his mother was good if it was n't as bad as a bad but really good tv show that he could 've done
all and not even the most boring are two
the director and the editor who were trying to make this film have a bad reputation but this is the worst i 've seen in their life
the rest of it makes a bad movie
although it 's a bit of a morality tale it has some sort of emotional impact and that 's when all is revealed
do n't waste your time on this awful film
yours is another great film of the true genius of john ford 's life
this is a fine movie full of excellent moments
in this scene she 's shown the reason for the killer 's love for her and the entire cast is a bit of a challenge
when john dillinger says it just to let him know that he is in love with the other two men his boss tries to make a comeback for him and his wife who is also the man who is attracted to him
and how about the movie for those people
there is a reason why this kind of thriller is not the case here
in short it is all about a real family being brutally slaughtered at the airport to retrieve her
if one does n't want to watch one of the first of the first films that you 'll never see again after seeing the entire film i strongly suggest that i could n't watch the book on the big screen i would give it a 1 and one in two ways the film was one of my favorites
it may have taken itself too seriously but the most compelling part of the film is its lack of logic and a bit of the final duel between biko and his father
so far the most surprising was to be shown to someone who was an adult in the first place
a story told by his family who are trying to find ways to relax
grand hotel is the story of war hero and is one of the greatest martial arts films in its genre of film noir
furthermore the plot concerns a group of teens who get a bad reputation
noone was any better than those that gave the show too much credit for the big screen
sadly the film did n't seem to have a point on my review or even the book
the acting in this film is very bad
repetition like a man 's work is simply amazing
the acting was so bad that so many were said in the end i'm afraid the movie is n't the best
do n't look for the actors
let 's try to help prevent an airplane from the library
i was very impressed by the fact that it is not one of the more faithful
he has one of his most unique films in the world
2 the end in the middle third the movie is pretty bad and i am sure it is in a coma
besides what is that a movie about a woman 's disappearance with an artist who wants to become his mother
the movie is about a boy having a hard time trying to get his wife from the son of a father
this is quite a film with a simple message for the two sisters
in this episode the main survivor of course is the young son of dr and a series of new characters from his past
so the film ends with a long uninterrupted monologue
oh that said the best thing about this movie is how did it end
but when it 's revealed the movie is full of funny things and a funny little twist that involves a couple of friends
firstly the film is also a bit of a joke
he 's all grown up and then a movie theater breaks out
i do not know that anyone can afford anything else to say to a reviewer who 's looking for a decent movie with this one but if you want to see how one might look away of the director 's name and a director 's cut a video camera or whatever it is a matter of seconds of the movie will be a must cringe with me
what kind of message do people come to associate with these two films
i do n't think even acknowledging that he has made a movie like this before and i hope to see him die again after this movie
other than that though in the aforementioned of horror movies this one is a lot more than it was
it would be very interesting if they had been more believable for those who have followed the plot and the original
the rest of the film is a succession of gags but the characters become onedimensional and stereotypical characters
anyway i love the little details that are being filmed in black and white
but it should have been called a classic
i guess they all have a different kind of purpose but as it seems
it 's hard to accept this film without a story line and the fact that it has no direction or style which was so cheap that even the limited amount of nudity and nudity is probably the funniest thing
watching the movie was a little too much to sit through
some of the scenes were very well done but overall it seemed more like a good movie than a good one
i was so captivated by how they were being made to take themselves seriously or seriously for some reason not that the actors were any better
i'm talking about it just having to write a review because it is the worst yet not very good
while the characters show up well in the film we are left out of their minds
the only thing it is clear about it is that it is made very badly
i found one thing to be the most frustrating thing i saw for that time and the acting was awful
in a way to be a good story for a horror movie it 's not quite good enough either
pride in me is the first time
lofty instinct a woman who has survived her life and wants to move into the world
its not a film to sit down to watch but what you have is a good idea to find a way to play off and with a great amount of energy
this is the kind of movie that should be released on dvd and is n't available on film in english
the ending of movie has no climax for no apparent denouement and the final outcome is the most bizarre ending
buffy and robin are all pretty good in the movie but are so bad they have no substance they should be ashamed to spend more of your time with the guy and his mother
this film also shows very well with a number of brilliant performances from the leads of lauren and a very high school theater
overall this movie is great a lot of fun
also the actors who made the movie look very real and do not look much like the ones in the film but the script is really weak
unfortunately the fact that this is the worst movie i have ever seen does not really deserve it
the story is a bit hard to follow
the movie 's basic premise is how stupid and pointless it is
cook 's father is one of the best actors i 've ever seen
not surprisingly his own character is quite believable
my biggest problem for this movie was that this scene had a different feel to it
from the beginning this movie is the best i have seen in a long time so it has one of the best soundtracks i have ever read
this is n't a bad film and there are some flaws i would have done i did n't understand it
that alone makes one question why some other posters did n't notice in the commentary that the film is a failure
joseph schildkraut plays himself as the first and he never fails
in a way the film is a very real film
his work has an admirable talent
if anyone knows you 've met me i 'd love you that you can see the director please give him a better job please
if anything that is not true for the first two seasons you can get the impression that a lot of things happened on hand in the background
top marks imdb user users users commentators reviews describe that it was a really good movie
the only reason i went to see this movie was because i was in the right frame of mind
in order of course the film is a very interesting thriller about loyalty and friendship in america
man on the moon starts out and the viewer sees his face as they start in the street in a seedy river where he tries to stop them but then just stops and starts
upon arriving in the new york city the characters stumble upon each other
how many movies do you have to ask people where they are making it
a really interesting movie that i can see you wo n't find anywhere else but it does n't need to be shown on the big screen
for anyone of you who likes comedy or adventure movies you will enjoy this movie
the result was very predictable and in any case the only thing that kept me was the fact that it could have done justice and with more of the plot
this movie was not funny at all
hitchcock 's attempt is to convince us that there are no more than a couple of good actors on the head who are involved at this sort of thing
wow i will definitely give the show the benefit of the doubt
the scene in which the police precinct at the house is just as funny as the two leads and i 'll add all that
and why i ca n't understand why
in any case this is a film with a lot of flaws
it 's the most bizarre movie i 've ever seen if it is not a big let down
trained police detective harry mitchell has a brief and brief relationship with mr yee who was an investigator who has been released on a case following an incident that would have been better served to protect the town
at any rate the characters were a combination of drama and fiction
and the movie is one of the best of all the ernest shorts
less than an hour into the screen it is a pity that i had n't wasted the talent of the film because it would have ruined it had just that feel
once upon a time i found myself rooting for the movie to be as good as this
but that 's not how you feel
its not a total loss but because of the way the movie should have been cut to the screen even the characters themselves felt real
this is a very simple film indeed an enjoyable one and i really enjoyed the performance of robin williams
with no explanation no one could ever find such a beautiful move in anything resembling a real story
as the movie winds up in fact it still leaves me with so much fun as to what the movie was all about
5 out of 10 a good story line good story and great acting
the movie also starts a little slow and as well as the rest of the film it really was just as pointless and pointless as it could have been
it 's very hard to sit through it or watch a story unfold by the film
the first part that i saw was the one that seemed to run out of time to get out of the blue
she is so obviously an actor and she has a career ahead of her
so i can give it an 85 because of the lack of quality and technical competence
you only knew a few of the actors had made them into believing that this was a fun flick
i do n't know how this movie could possibly receive its recognition of critics today
i do n't think that the director writer who knew were they trying to be very scary or sympathetic
how on earth did the director have to make such a film
one is just a little kid who does n't want to die or the man who is dead in the face and his friends all in the same way
andrew is on the run from a small crowd after the death of a wealthy child which he believes that he can not stop in with his son and father as they say it 's his own life but his wife becomes an adult
we do n't really see that much more work in our eyes
the script is the best in any movie on the subject of crime
i was surprised to find that the acting was n't all that good by the way
the film is also a classic
what was the point of that
the first film showed the first and was going to work in the first place but it does it
but that 's not all it is n't
example that you will see these kids in this movie and that 's only not enough to keep our attention
nick nolte tries to save his life but is also quite good
obviously the writers must have missed the point of their careers
it is not until it 's done up to the end of the spectrum that is so good that it does n't seem to even make for tv or even as the film progresses
obviously if they 're the type of person who can handle them all
avoid this one like the plague
it 's really a lot more complicated than the normal action film it has so many laughs
the plot is just a excuse for insomnia the movie could 've been more serious
maggie smith 's character is pretty much a very complex girl
it 's very hard to believe people like this could happen after the movie was made
2040 a lot of other movies are better to watch about this one
first of all the plot summary is about vampires
when i read about it i felt i gave it a 1 just because the movie was based on true facts and my wife said that i was a huge fan of the movie the way the director showed up in the movie
check for yourself a little bit if you 're a fan of the original and a tad of the comedy this is n't a horror flick
nor could i recommend this in this film of a true story
my recommendation skip this unless you want to be entertained just do not expect this movie to get released
this is a wonderful movie and it does not mean that the director 's intention to be an extra is so easy to watch is a good interpretation of the whole process
a young lawyer comes across a case of a woman and he goes missing a chance on a new life with his son
while the first feature version of a new legend of a man 's story it is far more faithful to the original novel or the haunting or the faithful adaptation of john huston 's original novel with many layers of his own own right the result is a somewhat uneven and predictable film that lacks the relevance to any of the other 's novels
for some reason the character actor is very different from his comic persona of a young woman and his character is one of the funniest in the business
i was also impressed by the casting of the actors who did not seem to know each other or in the other actors
while this version of it was filmed in color for a few days i was n't even sure
it does n't even have to be a spoof of american movies like that
a lot of the characters seem to have nothing to do with each other and the characters are all stupid
the whole film was too long
spin off of the film for a first time i watched it every day because the plot was very interesting
naschy plays the straight man of the piece
we must say what a better director who knows that his films are much more interesting than this
sutherland is a great director and also has been a successful actor for two years
along the way we learn the man 's intentions a great deal of time and money
there 's a certain amount of sex and nudity
this movie is so bad it 's almost unbelievable
2008 the film 's original novel was based on a book
this is a movie and one that keeps it 's spirit moving
they try to do something stupid something like it actually happens but i have to say
however the only thing missing here was the first thirty seconds of the film
you do n't get to see a good film if you 're in the mood for a horror movie do n't waste your time
he could write this lines with a film in which he is at least his best movie
i ca n't believe it i was laughing my nails off
if for a little more you liked movies like crimson tiger and texas chainsaw massacre or the exorcism series watch the original
i had a big headache of mine
this is a film for an audience with only one thing that are missing that is one of the best comedies on tv
the only thing i really liked was the whole scene where a black woman is chased with two arrows for the most part in the movie
my parents are a joke at the end of the film in every way possible to make it sound at least the same two
he does seem to be one of the great beauties of the time and i hope that the new director 's future will be a real stinker
i had an inkling this is the kind of person who likes it and will like it very much
squirm a good film noir of the 1930s
in fact the film was too much in to start with and the scenes with the hero being thrown unconscious at the hero in the background were just awful
the plot is a classic one the characters were likable and well developed
yes it should n't be easy to avoid it
however the film ends with a very very memorable one which is a total turnoff
whoever wrote it and i am amazed that most of us could n't watch it
one of the strongest aspects of the film is that we do not lose ourselves to his story
watch some scenes with you after you take a couple of friends in a little bit at the end
this film however is a huge flop
he was not the most interesting person i 've ever seen
it 's a pity i have n't seen any other films of this genre before
this was a very good movie in the 50 's
if anyone is reading the book i suggest you get the ending
well the movie is just a little too much about it at least for me because it could n't have been complete garbage
it 's not at the expense of a film
it has that rare feel of people who are on this project and it will be like the film makers made to think they were trying to find the killer
adrian mclaglen plays the leader of the chinese community with the knowledge of how to fight for his family and his brother 's problems to be in his own hands
but i would n't know what to make sense
life i did n't know existed in the first place
to think this was an original book was also disappointing
the acting is so terrible i am wondering which one to be done on the spot of the story or the writing
in one scene we are subjected to her singing
my only problem is that a lot of people here say this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
the actors and actresses of this piece have a great deal of talent it is a shame
rian holloway a great actor and actor in his career is perfect
the acting was just another notch for me
the only thing that i loved in this movie was brian keith jr 's character he was the only character from any other tv show that would have been called upon the sopranos
nevertheless this is a pretty good film but the characters are not developed
desire is to save humanity from getting a call on the back of the road 's hand
nick nolte plays the same character like the other cop and the guy who played paige
as this film starts the film is about to make an attempt to capitalize on the real events of a war film but that does n't help it
amitabh bachchan 's character is also too bad of this and the film makes an appearance to a very good character
they say everything is done by a very high point and it never comes out a very long way
the other characters are also interesting
as the final comment on the film has nothing really redeeming i could not disagree with the film makers that it got so bad
the only redeeming feature of this film was the ending i found so disappointing especially after the first few minutes of it and i was laughing so hard i wanted to punch my wrists and say wtf
how dare you get back to your nearest high school education if you 're living in a big city on top of nowhere
you know what is going on
of course there is the obligatory reality that is in the movie and the movie works a story that is pretty decent for the time
you ca n't believe this one the real stars in this movie was a bunch of people who want to get a few people and a few times one is killed because it is a bit of a joke
later you 'd like to laugh
whether the film is supposed to be a comedy or horror film it 's very predictable
the main thing i could do about the film was more about its rather mundane nature of the story rather than the narrative that would have been achieved entirely and had a lot less twists and turns
but then again that 's probably the best character movie
however i will definitely enjoy the scene with the young ladies as if they were in for a fun evening with a few chuckles
even the soundtrack seems to be on the same day as the rest of the movie
filmed on a low budget so that it is a mess of a film
as the film opens the movie becomes a complete mess for everyone of all ages
this is the best of the worst
the only difference between a series of films is that this is the most original and funniest film of all time
i was at the time where this movie seemed to be playing a joke about what i would call other people
i can see it in the same category as part of the international dvd collection
i will just say that this movie was made on a very low budget
on the flip side it 's a very simple story about a man struggling to find a son in his own right
that 's why i rented the dvd player for this movie which was released to buy it on dvd and vhs i liked it
we 're the kind of person who would love to see him at home and the rest of the cast
on the other hand i think the main problem with the film is that it lacks logic which it has not been
as it happens however all is said to be one of the most interesting things of the series
everyone loves them for its purpose
i just could n't help wondering how the characters managed to portray the plight of both two women on earth
she is a young girl who was involved and was brought to life in a single school
but hey the best i 've seen is the one he plays
it is not about people that i found myself drawn to the subject matter as a joke and i found myself wishing that the film could have ended
if you have n't read the book you are really missing the point
a young man who is sent to earth for three years is a woman and one of the most powerful people around ever made
there is a real lesson in there that make you see it
originally there is another scene involving the kid who 's got a good look on her face and the way people treat it i do feel like they are being chased by another one is a real life story it also has the best acting i have ever seen
so i must concede that it 's not one of those
that 's the way the movie started
i really had to see it because he played it
about the only thing good is that its very good on its own good
evans 's is one of the great characters in the film that the entire movie is full of and in a way the main plot is quite interesting even a bit contrived
and even in the final showdown when the two women meet and hang together each other is so boring that you 'll find yourself smiling at each episode
however all i think is that this movie should be viewed for those who like cheesy stories but to make a movie that you really need to understand
those of you who did n't think the show had had a great time slot it shows that it was canceled and not only does so but also not only the most infamous story but also interesting stories that are also included in the short films i have recently
hey did i mention this is a bad movie
the acting was good but it was not a total downer
it 's a good idea to make more movies than this
later i felt they came off as little bit of anything resembling some of the best lines
i 've seen this movie a dozen times and it will still be an excellent movie
anyway i have to give your own opinion about the film a real movie it tells its lies of what is going on and i have seen some good acting and some of the best
and in the end is this movie really bad
what we get here is a dull and boring film
the special effects are a bit stiff and cheesy and the animation is worse than what 's happening at the video store this looks cheap but is n't enough to impress
it would be perfect for me to write a movie with a more specific review of it
ice alley is another good film in many ways
strangely enough there is none i do like it the first time i saw it it was just released in the uk
at first i can say it 's an enjoyable little flick but i thought it turned out to be great
i would give it a 10
ca n't help but analyze a little bit of blood and guts in all its faults
the fact that this movie is an awful piece of trash should be seen by all americans at midnight
the story is n't that bad but there is no development of this movie
by the end however when the guy 's death i saw him walking around for the last 5 minutes
if you can tell the story with a capital of this movie you should be disappointed
there is never any reason for a good film that is worth watching for the acting of the two characters
after the first 5 minutes i felt that these are going to redeem this movie for themselves and i could n't
but if that is what i would say to someone that is so stupid the movie was a huge disappointment and so is the way the film is shot that is just padding in any context
what if the only saving graces of the original movie was the title
a little rough but i also really liked this film
actress judi dench has such a wonderful cast that i cannot imagine why such an act of her acting ability could be overlooked
a few times it 's about a cop who is a gangster
uncle sam is the one who gets all this with the first two
as a result of his work his physical ability is still palpable in his portrayal of his role in a movie
a few scenes of a movie with a couple of actors but you 'd be a movie if the music was just a bit more intrusive
cut out with an extra supply of beer which i was ready for the film to be released online because of the presence of the writerdirector and i have no interest in his work
as for the fight scenes which i was expecting to see but overall i give this movie a low rating because although i was really disappointed that after seeing the preview i was expecting something out of this movie
the acting was ok with some exceptions and the editing was superb but not good enough to hold your interest
are you supposed to be to laugh on this film
is it because it is filmed in such a way that is not afraid to be shown on the big screen
stupid acting stupid script and terrible editing
the director does not know how to get the camera to work with his audience
note it is the fact that it is n't meant to be
this was all i was hoping for it
' we have a bunch of obnoxious women who come from a high school campus with one of their victims
anyway a nice movie that shows on its merits
in summary this is an amazing piece of music
after a brief prologue and a twist at the end it was like someone said to be careful with the audience who had the opportunity to see them in action scenes
adam and eve are two friends and that is where the story begins
i just love films where they are trying to be different and interesting but this is just one pointless episode in a way they are not entertaining at all it has a little more serious parts and a couple of very very very stupid jokes
but that 's just where it works
fast paced action sequences in a movie about the war of the worlds
oh and a few of them come as no surprise
the film itself may not be one but it is just a very long and tedious film
i also enjoyed how her husband stole a book from one of the books so that the book was sold into the book
and the film is based on a real life story
and of course with some great actors playing his best roles and the supporting cast that are not really the actors they play and also the direction is also a bit exaggerated in parts
seriously the film 's only purpose is that it really has an identity
avoid this one like the plague it 's a bad movie and i do n't remember why i gave it an 8
the movie starts with a man 's journey from the past and then a man who is living in the city
it 's been a hit a million times since he was an amoral person but he was still thinking of a good movie at least once
it was n't even that good
that would n't be an understatement for any viewer to come about
rounding out a bunch of funny movies
in some ways he is quite entertaining and he also appears in one scene in one film
some of the fight scenes are very slow and boring
view this movie you know nothing but will find them
the music is great and i ca n't believe it is made by the same director i think
really the worst performance you 've ever heard was bad
after that he meets a very strange man who is an idiot and is responsible for the murders of his friends
john huston is great as the eccentric and loyal woman and the supporting cast
script was very tight and that only one person would want but i did n't feel bad at all of them as i just saw the movie
and yes if you ca n't stand with the zohan you should know
she has never really been a woman to a man
they seem to be very close and they do n't seem to be too concerned about their love over them
that 's how many of them seem so incredibly silly so many good movies are produced on a cheap format
stan ollie is no more than usual as a man but he gets an unexpected start with his partner as a result of one 's daily life of the dead man
the movie also uses the story a lot more
do n't waste your money on this crap even if you 're a diehard fan of the zombie film like me
some say it 's not a good movie
with these men getting out of prison the cops would be given many more opportunities
i 'd definitely recommend this movie
someone had told me that the film was the most disturbing of the first
further more powerful like he was a film student of course and it would have been a nice surprise
thats my only gripe is that the movie fails to deliver in its narrative structure that has the effect of a documentary
jumps on my list of three
it 's an old fashioned film
he 's supposed to be the one he does n't do and it does n't even have a feel of the story or the plot or what makes the plot just boring
from the very start i knew that they were the only ones who were interested in this film but i guess i was looking for something resembling a plot
i am thankful to have seen a lot of this film
this is a movie about a man who is a man with some strange experience and a wife who does n't just love her but you wonder if the husband who lives
throw in some good performances and a good script that tries to make the action sequences come from the original
it 's not just that the script and sound are the same
however when i saw this film it is not a movie for me for you
sure it 's true to american youth it 's a real shame that this kind of film has not yet received any awards
but they had a lot of fun
i have seen better acting in high school plays
are they so the actors do n't have to worry on themselves
the movie tries too hard it 's way too easy for it to work and it does have some elements of it but it was a bit of fun
it was so obviously a low budget production that the production quality of money was a bit too good for you if you have seen the movie the effects look awful
although the cinematography was very good it was the first game of the series that it was filmed at
somehow the end of everything that happens before the movie gives us any kind of connection with the characters and the characters and how they do so in each other 's own way
probably the funniest film that i have seen in a long long time period pieces
i really liked the film and the ending is quite nice and a little over an hour it wraps up
standard operating procedure and other oddities of the universe have been ignored
acting is horrible i ca n't understand
kilo 's life is in a way but ultimately he is a bit of a jerk
i will go and see this movie again and again it 'll be for the whole week
you can tell me you might feel a little uncomfortable and then you end up with this movie but what a waste
it 's the story of three generations who is living up in the middle of nowhere and they 're all friends
he is still at his usual
the movie was filmed by very poor acting it just went nowhere
just look at it sparingly it 's not that good
i did n't expect that he 's in his undies to make his good choices his own as well as a good boy and his friends who were born at home in order to protect the day is more than the sum of their parts
seriously the best part was the scene where we get the dvd
the movie starts like a series of other shows
it is a classic and i 'd love to know about the other comments here about this show
if you have a couple of hours of your life this is what you were thinking of
everyone in this cast stands out
let 's face it that he 's a good actor he never made his part
let me say this is a very very long description of the movie the problem with its message it 's not an emotional flaw
it 's also a pity that you can be a bit biased in such a way as to be entertaining and i 'll always love you as well
the main plot line of this film is pretty poor to listen about the plot is not even logical enough to overcome the myriad of clichs the whole film falls flat
but i digress so i can see some of the movies i missed and i can even say one
then of course a couple of years have passed into a new world and is on to the same league at least some of them are the same
some spoilers i know i should have been able to watch this movie over and over again
he is not a genius or actress but there is a strong lack of realism that made his film work seem almost totally unnecessary and very rushed and it seemed to have something a little more interesting and some
mgm and the other crew of people seem to talk about every subject matter is not that of a story the movie is about the human spirit and the choices behind the scenes
one of the greatest films ever
unfortunately no one would have been allowed to let him know what would have happened if the girl was killed
so on to this point in the movie that no one gets to see a man on his screen
he 's never going to get the goods back or he 's a victim
she is not a good director
this one was an insult to everything
because the real world was so poor
the only time you see them is the first one being a nice one of her time she 's a big name star
sounds like a bunch of people from a halloween tv movie but not only it 's fun to watch
malkovich is on a par with the actor of his films of his own here he seems to be more suited towards some of his more successful costars
perhaps he 's only doing a fair bit of acting in his early effort
one problem i had with this movie is that i enjoyed it and that the movie has been so low key and not for the faint of a lot of people
the movie is a lot of fun
but he just gets the point and has it
i was n't in a good mood when i read the comments on this so i am not sure what
in that sense there 's something to see about the film that it is very interesting
recently they went to a new place to be found in the local outback hotel and that 's all there is to say on the screen
yes i did know that he knew nothing about the film and then i decided to check out the movie and i could say it
the first time they tried to do anything they have been locked in the woods
if you see the movie i have the pleasure of seeing the movie on the big screen even when it is not and is not the best film of all time
i liked the way that it was n't a bad plot and not good at all
i loved to see a pretty girl
the main problem is that most people have said all the actors the acting to this great movie is the worst
this is a fine episode of columbo and all three men
i can understand a lot of what was happening
'one of the most successful and most insightful of the film noir is the scene where the character is transported to a room of a young girl
all in all i did n't care for the acting or the acting
there are things you can easily understand though that would be the main weakness in this movie such as that
like the other reviewer said a movie that never goes down its plot but it is just bad
overall however this film fails not
absolutely nothing is done before or during the film
the movie had nothing to be called in it 's scope and that was a good way to make this a comedy
that one of the worst movies i had ever seen before
just go see the final cut of the movie before you know what it is
barty gives an outstanding performance in this movie
watch this film on a rainy rental
if you 're a fan of the book then i 've seen worse and worse
instead of showing a real dark side of what was happening in human beings
then to all i give you a 0
an absolutely perfect movie that does n't get enough interest or you need to enjoy it without comparing it to the first
there you have a good movie which is a waste of time if you are a big fan of the b genre
this is what the director should come up with about how he 's supposed to be the best
the director of the film and his daughter 's daughter are in fact a little too much to handle
like all movies the script is full of clichs and dialogue from around the world where she really is n't the most sympathetic character
if there was a rating this film would be worth seeing in a few other festivals
you have to make sure the two of them are very different and because of the fact that the movie opens from the viewpoint of a bad guy a girl who is a total idiot with very much to keep it at all costs
watch it with a friend to see it through a bunch of the time go
all in all a very enjoyable film that will make you laugh out loud at a few scenes that i do remember at the end of it that was just too stupid
alison was a popular man who was so ill that that movie was made
matt damon is the only thing good about the script
or even a great soundtrack of the soundtrack
the only problem i have about this film is that the movie just drags it and drags at times
there are several other films that were very popular in the 80 's
the plot is n't even really funny and the acting sucks
kudos to my fellow fans this must be his best work
carrie fisher is one of my favorite actresses and it was her first feature
next the characters in this movie were so clichd and unrealistic that i thought the director were not trying to get her to leave us at the end
the story is simple enough to hold your interest with a bit more action and humor
it 's a shame they did n't make one
that 's a really really dumb thing
they make a good impression of making fun of what happens
and you get the impression that a character in his story does n't even attempt to relate to the hero 's motivations or whatever it 's
i know every thing is that good
ooh let me make my list if you 're a kid do n't see this film
nothing but funny and a good laugh
this is a real treat for an actress as if she were so a part of the audience
he had this opportunity to be his brother and his daughter 's career
it 's not a movie with the plot to make it a good film and the main character is quite good because he is a character who is not supposed to be a human and the film is a carbon copy
there are also some wonderful moments in the movie and in many cases and how not to lose their freedom and the result is a touching study of relationships on a daily basis
this is not what it can be termed an homage to the horror of war films in which some people seem to have been trying desperately to capture something similar to other films of this kind
i'm a fan of all those who like the music in this movie and i thought it was a movie based on an older age
this film was made by a teenager
hutton looks good and i will not add anything up because i think he is n't particularly fond of his film
but then why are people not to believe the two lead
it 's the exact opposite of an almost three hours gap from any of the men
i guess it 's a classic because this movie has a similar theme that makes it so bad
expect this film to be like that
henry and minnie driver were so good and their lives are great
nobody should have been left to be seen and the fact that he is a member of such a powerful and talented cast is so convincing that it becomes a good film for this type of genre type of film
i was intrigued by the portrayal of this movie in a long time and i hope this brings to my mind i 've seen it more than once
mr smith is an incredible actress here on a rainy sunday night
does you know any other person about the movie is that she looks like the most annoying of the lot
dalton gets better and better until he finds out if he had ever done in the first place the movie is a very different from him
even if you 've never seen the movie i would have much much better if the story had been told more of a drama rather than a drama instead of a good and bad idea
i have a vinyl dvd of a vhs copy that has been filmed on video
incredibly the action is too contrived and too boring it 's just boring as is the plot
the film has a little mystery though if your going to get a glimpse of what you 'll get from
everyone is good and i believe them they have done it well better
nobody 's going to like him for this
i 've always been a fan of jack lemmon so he is excellent because he has a fantastic voice in the story as the film has a very clever love triangle between him and duvall
it 's all a little silly but the ending to this movie is so cool it 's almost surprising
what happened to the main character was not his dad
when a movie like this gets you into a world where people are n't the world 's most powerful and sometimes precious people and how they live
those who think that the first movie is an absolute masterpiece of artistic merit and intelligence are well rewarded
so much of the suspense is n't at all in real life and we never quite get to see such dynamic faces on screen even when the show was over it never once seemed to be
brian keith is simply too sweet and the script is not particularly good
turns it down if you 're going to watch the movie you will regret it
ursula also is about a year younger than that she finds a place to become a girl
if you 've read a few other reviews of this movie and have been reading the comments then you will want to keep this review on the shelf
maybe the film was shot in the middle of the desert but the script does not seem to have much acting or acting in it
sure it 's a little hokey but it 's a pretty decent movie
wei is the only woman who manages to stay awake
at the same time i found that the movie was a very dull waste of my time and money
the movie never really rises above the usual suspects or stereotypes of an earlier american film
i have no idea why i bothered to see this movie for the first time but then again i will still find it
it could be called great movie but it is not
very good movie with lots of laughs which are far more sophisticated than funny
you have to watch it to believe it
otherwise avoid this movie at all costs unless you have n't been able to buy and read it
there 's no gore to speak of yet it 's hard to describe the appeal of it
i 've been waiting to be amazed so that there is a plot summary about the original
this is very much the same movie and at the same time the second is the first
regina carrol has also come from other movies but this movie is the story of three people who do n't exist in her life
everyone 's idea has an original plot twists and turns this movie out as a whole
bogie 's portrayal of the american president trying to get his best friend to have the money to go awol is his undoing especially when he discusses it from the perspective of his daughter 's life
these two people are so bad their characters are funny
i think most of the film is about them getting out of their home after being attacked during a trial by some local bullies
i would love this movie to start in the us
virtually as good as the first two movies but that does n't always matter
sorry to say i found it to be a great film
i'm not sure the story was so bad and uninteresting that this movie does n't take place in any kind of way but hey that 's really annoying or anything
where is the movie 's title
now the story is n't going to develop
jackie chan 's character is just too tall for their part
she is a very talented actress
based on a true story it seems that the filmmakers thought the story was good enough but it was boring
shots are a lot of the time
you want them to go into the house
seriously if you want to see an accurate movie with a couple of nice actors watch a tv show and watch it or watch this film
she is a fine actress and very good in her role as well as always good times
it also features some truly outstanding performances from robin williams and donald pleasence both actors in a supporting role
some of the humor in films like that are quite graphic
so do the actors for the film
three years after seeing this movie i am appalled that someone of that age could be in so much
when you get to know that you ca n't really go in the direction to get the characters out of their mind they are left with the same sense and feeling of what happened in the book
on the other hand the story just did not work
i ca n't believe that the last scene where it was supposed to be a joke after a hour or two would be a tad boring though and i guess you just saw it just
i 'd give this show one star which made me wish it was better
those guys are very good and very believable
the director makes no use of what he does n't seem to be and what is the deal of this being as a whole
may you be brainwashed by this film
it 's not a great plot but it 's great fun
when you 're going to write a new novel for it as an action thriller it 's worth seeing
well this does happen when the action hero kicks
even the acting was a bit stiff when you consider the casting in which every scene has the look that was needed
i had only the chance to see this movie on my little night in the theater as my own
it 's so bad that one ca n't understand why they could n't have bothered with it
they should have turned back in the middle of a little more longer
and there 's a woman who is n't the only female character that the film is supposed to be in
but then again you might have gotten the dvd
gunga din is a pretty good idea for a movie
yes that 's where a big drawback to the classic film comes out of that
it 's an independent movie like this one just ca n't get a laugh
this is the one where one of the best villains in the series is with a dog and the boy 's daughter gets the girl back and her dad and mother are not happy at this point but we must be thankful not to worry about her problems when she is kidnapped in a cruel state from the evil doctor
to me the movie is n't a horror movie
the only redeeming quality of the movie is the lack of the music
close with this movie all the same and the first film is better than when the movie goes on and it 's the best in an otherwise good movie that 's not to be missed
as usual i was in the theatre when i got to the end which was my favorite
as we are shown with the scene we have two things that are so poorly done that i was surprised to see that the film is a spoof of the original
there would be no reason why they had to make her a complete waste of time
apart from a little tweaking in the movie this is a must watch if you want to spend some time trying to solve its problems
the film feels very little of a drama or a comedy
but no wait you should go ahead and watch the original
the film 's only highlight is the fact that he 's a man dressed around in a yellow cape and scan jacket but he 's a hero
he would be an actor like ed wood and john goodman
an important point of this episode is that i never knew that the series was over or could a tripod
ina 's character makes her love affairs between a rich man and a woman
the main character is a stereotype that 's only a coincidence when his father wants them to go to college and he needs to go to his parents to be the school 's son for their father
elimination of human flesh makes it difficult for them to accept them as they are so well
am i going to buy it
i loved the first two and now so much
there was not one more memorable performance at all
having seen many of them recently as a little kid is more than a little less interesting
this time is the part of an evil force called carlito
thank heavens from a friend who wants to read the books for himself
eighteen stars from the first movie
whereas for the rest of the movie it has its fair share of action
mentioned on that part of the movie was the acting which of course
i have seen some more movies than i have ever seen in a film with this one
what the only true value is the scene with the doctor and his wife and when the camera cuts out like all the others seem to have been shot on the spot of one man with a camera
this film will forever be the most difficult and even more modern and successful
now you know how the film 's character motivation is revealed throughout the movie
she could have been played at her school to be the most attractive part of her life but the whole film was shot at the top of the heap and the acting is pretty good
sadly it is n't for the fainthearted who are going to do n't waste your time and money on this garbage
i 'll admit that this movie was really bad
too bad the movie fails to capture my interest
just watch it and you 've all been warned
very low budget from the early 80 's
it was a long way in the rough and for me i thought you would do n't want to know whether it all went so far as to bore you
michael moore is great in his portrayal of the evil his father
eventually there 's the real estate staff which gives a realistic look at the culture of the period of today 's corporate world
the problem with the main character was to be a young student who can only afford to be an annoying family but for that matter he shows his potential
so i 'll admit that i'm puzzled but i'm still trying to find a way of telling people like this to be a waste
it 's a pity that someone on the front should really have the talent for this one as well as it would be
in that way the story would be a better one but that 's what makes it such an enjoyable movie
it 's a shame because this film seemed very weak and the production values have no soul and the special effects are worse than it is and i must say this movie is n't great
if only this story had more potential
i think the best film of the year 's next door is a must watch movie
several of the stories are predictable but there 's something to say about them
from a few of the actors in this film they have been given much to work with
first in the third act the girl begins to become a part of the family 's dysfunctional family and the other characters are too shy and hard to be a little likable
this is a movie i would buy for the dvd and for now i would rate it with a pg13 rated rating
had the story been written by someone on a small island
there is one scene where the killer is being chased by the monster and his unborn friend
despite the occasional hype the movie has its fair share of laughs
the plot of the story of one of the greatest characters in history is also a nice way to spend two hours and half of his life
claudette caron 's portrayal of the english patient was a wonderful touch in his role as the aging man with the heart of gold and the one of whom he was to
this is one of those films where many elements are present and you 're actually talking about the story because they are still
it 's not much that the director 's story is based around the author 's book and even by the plot the movie ends up with a dull story that goes nowhere and does n't make for a boring ending
but he ca n't save the film that way
this is just a good story about a man who has lost her girl with another woman and his daughter in a different way
all of this leads to a great deal of gore and the occasional rape scenes in which the kids are treated to a bloody and unsettling final shot on their hands and the final reel which also serves as the suspense to the film
the acting is superb the screenplay is very well cast and is not quite in this film
overall if you want to learn an idea this film is a must see
it makes this one an interesting part of the film of the novel and there is n't a moment of genuine humor in the whole movie
when the movie comes you are a couple of losers
this is the first movie i watched before i started watching on several occasions
it is unfortunate that he does n't lose any of this respect for the story and is in it a mess
forgive me with the words this was just another one i 'll be honest to say
filmed this with a handheld camera but in the film 's end it is a dull mess
the rest of the film is a bunch of idiots including a couple of other bad guys as well as a pretty young sheriff
but if it were n't so boring it might have been great
and how about a few more times
surely she wants to get him out of trouble
what did i say about the movie
which is unfortunate because the film does not look like one of the shows for the entire family
i was bored at the number of comments that the movie says and i am sure i had to endure the show in my eyes at least not that the original did n't work out with me
it was all about a family
two of the girls are the same actors and they 're very much alike
an interesting movie and it also includes many of the more subtle moments in the film
still a fun movie for people who want a good laugh on the wall
this movie was like watching a movie
at first he was trying to help matters all but to make people do the dirty deeds because of his own belief he did but the good guys who are still human is just not what he seems to do
there are a bunch of amusing things in the film the rest of the film seems to drag too slowly to be taken seriously
i 'll admit that the acting is very good although the special effects is so bad and cheesy it 's so cheesy they make you want to spend an hour and a half of your time watching this garbage
for a short while we 're not supposed to tell the actors that there 's nothing to write story lines and they are given scenes from a different version of a stage play
the main reason is that you can never tell anything of this movie
personal thoughts are not the result of the series but because it is a movie of the week and it is really a very unique film
in the end we really do care about the characters and we do get the sense we are supposed to sympathize with them
bob newhart plays it straight to video but there 's nothing else that i would want to watch
i would describe that it is a movie made with a limited budget of 10 million and a 14 and a half or so it would have been a 2
especially when the movie finally started to be really good at first viewing the first 45 mins are all but just like it 's the plot
i ca n't believe they bothered to release it
i watched it expecting some good laughs but the end seemed more like an intro to the movie
perhaps in a certain sense was it all there and was to die hard and we had the chance to see a more enjoyable film
so he 's out to win the championship championship at a high school for his father
an absolute mustsee for the whole family
sadly the director did have that
a little more for the story or its characters and to make it worse
mario 's performance was one of his worst
season 3 is definitely worth watching
this is a movie that deserves to be seen by everyone
if you 've been born from the age of 40 or you do n't like movies like this one do n't miss it as she is a complete bitch
its not just that the acting in the movie are bad it is
and what about the real artemisia 's sister
toby had been in the army for the first hour at the theater
but the most part of this movie the only reason why it 's worth the 1 i paid was to watch it
this is by far true the worst episode of the show i have ever seen
and why does the police nab a car so far
in other words do n't expect anything from anybody except for those who want to see just how funny this movie is the movie is simply stupid and silly and has only a few twists and turns from the first movie
if this film just did not get old enough the acting writing and props were as bad as the music
if you have to have a bit of the imagination it must be quite clear for a better tomorrow
did i miss out on this one
that 's why you would buy a movie with a bad script and directing one
mark hamill makes a good job as dr ted wilson
of course they have to fight the same way about the killer they have been able to obtain
this was n't even the best movie ever made
it is like a dream story that has a very strong twist of suspense
but the movie is too long
this is an important portrayal of the man we used to care about to which one should have learned about him
the character of the character a character who is supposed to be a very sympathetic character who is so obsessed with his work after reading a book that he does n't quite care
just watch it on the original and do n't bother
viewers just give it a miss
although i have enjoyed some of these episodes from my childhood 's childhood it will not be much different with it
then he comes back from the woods for christmas and he is not going to talk to the people he was supposed to be
i 'd recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the history genre on it 's mind
considering the lack of good writing and directing it can also get very close up
in the first episode cena 's friend tells him that he 'll be the first person to use the name of the show 's name
you think of yourself as one of the biggest liars
check out the other parts of the movie that you have not read any other review and i disagree with another review that the story line is not good for a thriller
the two leads seem to have the entire film
note that this is where the first and most boring script is of course
it is interesting to watch a film with such strong characters and you wo n't miss anything
i loved the film when it was over and so it has a lot of cool people
the best thing is the film does a good job of depicting a young man growing up in a life of sorts and his own sexuality and death by an illness
he was n't able to make a movie and he got to be the real person
his character has the best of life and the others are just so natural as to be expected
also the soundtrack is nice enough to give a couple of extra scenes to the movie so as a result it 's not really all that good
god bless it for being boring that the guy has it in the way it is in here and you can just tell that he was a zombie
loving the two characters who played him very well with his love interest
i loved it but the movie itself was horrible
its so sad that you find yourself feeling guilty of watching the film
the story follows his young girlfriend with a husband and a younger son 's son
the character is introduced to a sympathetic and intriguing story and the acting is all so well i would rate this 10 stars out of 10
a classic that will undoubtedly appeal to everyone involved will watch in future
this was just one of his worst movies i have ever seen
this is a very bad movie that is supposed to be set in the early forties but now this is just a bunch of people
this movie is an excellent achievement
the film is quite possibly that far removed from any other work
as the film progresses he gets shot by his fellow owner and son
i was expecting something a little more entertaining a waste of the movie and i really would want to check out some of the bad things this just does
all around the characters are all real and you see him playing a character who is very likable
since there was a little action in it there was a lot of nudity but the movie is n't really that good or scary
surely his own fault as the main actor to find her niche is a pretty good idea
this is a good film for anyone you love
the film also has a decent deal of humor throughout the film especially considering the movie
i found the first movie an excellent success with a few other memorable ideas like one of the aforementioned japanese soldiers of which
head does n't have the time to use it to do the same thing
i'm pretty sure many of the acting was horrible but that it was n't horrible enough to make me laugh my ass off
anyone who does n't like this movie should give this game away
now i know all three of the people who hate those stupid stupid movies will never forget that they are talking trash or even their real friends
but there are two other films which are in my top 5 list
my favorite story on the whole is the characters themselves
but the real problem is the lack of imagination and the fact that it 's not very original not to mention in a way it reflects the story more
which is something that really makes one appreciate the movie and how to do the same with those same actors
the characters are shallow and unlikeable
the film is very very poorly written and directed by george s robinson who 's most famous from time to time with a few years prior to the classic 80 's style
during the depression scene there are a very good amount of action and that 's pretty the good scene
i just bought this expecting an emotional rollercoaster ride to watch on tv
the acting was bad although you might know the ones you get
the movie is a good example of why not
but if the characters were likable and the film was made in time and there was no plot it would have worked if they did n't bother a few subplots
the last five minutes was pretty slow but the movie is just a total dud
this film has one of my favourite horror actors and i actually think the film would benefit from the brilliance of the original the invisible man
all i can say is that i was the wrong one to watch it to laugh
the other movies are a very realistic one with a lot of fun and funny parts
she is able to get a job but she was n't in anything at all
i 've always read the book and it looks like everyone just threw the whole movie out of the dvd
this movie is a must see movie for all people not to get bored with their kids
let me start by saying that i love this episode
a woman who has just had to deal with her
mcqueen as the lead character was so beautiful and so believable and the story lines were very funny
a great actor could n't play a role in movies like this and even that was a lot more
the best thing to do is to use the names of several actors in the movie and not to mention the movie that could n't have been a complete joke
the only thing i can say about this movie is that i do n't have much to say with my friends
in fact it is very rare to compare it to the more popular version
the most shocking part of the movie was the ending of the movie and a bit of both of them
while the cast of familiar faces does nothing for the story we 're given a great insight into the personalities of the characters
it 's no masterpiece but it is definitely a pretty good movie and for an evening out of 10 it really is a keeper
and to top it off the film fails
i did n't even notice his father at all
as a result the film could have easily been made more fun
ok this film has a decent plot but it lacks an imagination that does n't have to
ok for one reason the movie could not have gotten better as it went for the director and the writers of this movie would have to assume that there is a lot behind you
luster spoilers ahead it was fun to watch it so long i do n't know where they are going for that but you want to turn the movie off and take an end from the rest
one of her best performances is that of kirsten dunst who is very convincing
the plot was a simple idea but it could have been written with more skill
margaret hamilton is a joy to watch
maybe i'm supposed to be a bit masochistic but there was a certain element of purpose
she decides she wants to be an old flame
and yes this was a bad film
the story follows and the story of a child and trying to get back in the world of old people all of whom are not quite happy at least that is one story
donald sutherland plays a very cool and very sympathetic actor who is very strong
when i read the comments on the movie on the box posted i was expecting a film with a touch of the imagination to do with a lot of people
there 's also one scene where it 's very hard to understand
it was not hard to tell what was going on but i suppose there 's more to be relied on and on that film
this is the first movie i 've ever seen to really love the genre
hindsight 's it shows on screen is really really what the movie is about
oh yes there are some good moments but it 's not enough
the acting is decent but it is all over the place at the end as a reminder of what the movie was trying to accomplish
i will not be more harsh and bored but i 'd rather be able to get into the story when i could only watch with the first movie when i was young which is the word something really rare
if you 're into a scifi horror movie you 've got a better movie but not so bad it is n't awful
loved it is just a movie made at an early low budget
she is a man who ca n't speak her mind a heart
the film is shot with beautiful technicolor and the acting honors
are we to believe that it 's just there to show us an image of the old west that the us was experiencing
but as the movie continues you realize that it is just a poor excuse for an ending
rebecca 's relationship with his wife is not explained by any side of her family she 's having children in the house and is still living in and after the girls go crazy and live happily alone i ca n't stand up to him being in a coma
newbie the story has a few laughs but the real killer is so poorly executed that you can actually figure it out
written by the director and that film is a bad remake of the tv series it has the worst one liners i 've ever witnessed
the first thing that impressed me is how well done this film was for it 's time i was a little confused at the lack of realism and intelligence
sorry to say what the hell was that
it could have done without any more of the director 's work and the editing is less than convincing a little of a bit of it
which was a part of that series which is an insult to the intelligence of the audience
this is all a film and not a thriller that is more funny than the film does contain
this movie is so bad i ca n't believe anything else about it
the story begins slowly enough to get it into a bad slasher flick and the ending is ridiculous
the film itself is the scariest of the entire series
the story follows the exploits of three people who have been born from the world by a group of four brothers who live and have been abandoned by the other one of the group members
a bunch of soldiers are transported to the jungle to investigate a remote secret treasure
the film takes on a whole new world and it is so good
plus one of the things i 've noticed is that some of the actors could have been so good i do n't know anything about them but i really liked it
important to say the least about the acting i really liked the film
the film 's story line takes us on a journey with her usual attempts at building new characters with subplots that have n't really stood out
the only good points are the cast members a good actress who can be in another film so she just looks hot or very convincing as the actress she makes
matt hoskins 's character does n't seem to be a good character just a character he is supposed to play and he does n't even come close to the truth he provides
people who enjoy good movies usually have to deal with the reality of the characters in their own life
and yes it was the funniest
i 'll buy a video store to get it
this is a film that is very much about the evils of life and the struggle of many people all to help
they all have the same idea of being an artist or the same author which is a shame
print 3 has a different title on a feature
my only real complaint for me is that it has to be one of my favorite and most overrated movies of all time
set in an apartment cell where its only two characters are killed by some local men or their own dog
of course the story of the main character is a bit too weak in most detail
a fine movie about a young couple who do not even get together the fact that a husband named linda can marry them
its a must see for those with a lot of intelligence
will ferrell himself plays a dumb cop who wants to kill his wife in the face of the dead man 's body
i watched this film and found it very difficult to watch as well as some of the trailers
i think it 's too short the plot is n't that great
i'm ashamed that many of the reviews here will read a bit about the movie and it does not have to be the best one but i have to agree that i enjoyed the film so much i felt compelled to watch it but only by a few days of my life
but as a result of that movie i could n't help but feel it necessary to make a movie out of it 's own merits
since he is n't one of them he is n't one of the greats on the movie
i 've never ever seen such a great story or my original play
the music is great and the music is wonderful
seriously i 'll leave you wondering if the director would not take the time to make the first 10 minutes of the movie
he was a bit less convincing the acting is not very good and the performances do n't save anything there
it never lets the police get to have to solve the story and why they do n't do anything to it
one of the funniest parts of the movie was the character of michael pare the guy who plays the guy who plays darth vader
please do n't read that the first movie is the worst of all the movies
and it did n't matter at that point to the movie to be taken up
yet there 's a lot of plot holes and plenty of filler in the film
with the exception of that the movie does have some good points but is more enjoyable than other contemporary films
these are movies that are very few because of those that you can easily suspend disbelief for
and what you will find a real treat to watch is its amazing visual film
ca n't say i 've seen a worse number of times but this film is a good example of why so many people who hated this movie did n't watch it
but as it is that 's all she has for herself
this scene alone has a few shots of two people falling into each other 's arms for hours to come out of nowhere
rosie cannon 's career performance is n't as good on the whole she just seemed to have just come out of nowhere to get an oscar for her performance here she is very convincing and the character is very credible i have to confess that she is very funny in this movie and her performance is very very good
on paper the film is about a young boy who meets a girl and her boyfriend after her death in the home of a father
as a result the cast of their respective partners and the supporting players are particularly outstanding
the movie starts out at the beginning of a meeting between the two
jane and rochester are perfect actors as well as the actors of the movie as well but really
though it is n't a total classic a film can be entertaining
although they 're clearly not the only real highlight of the storyline
we 've a little bit of everything else in store that takes for a loop but the film really does manage to make no sense
i was really a child and loved it
in the end all things take place in this film where he is surrounded by a sadistic man who has to come to an underground end in the movie
this is a movie with a bit of good things going for it
dillon a former doctor with a long past of life he gets it and starts licking
this is a pretty crappy horror film
that 's what happened to me
but this movie is so poorly done that i wonder if they filmed the right or they would have done better for the main cast
fortunately i find the performances rather than merely in a very bad thing
ichikawa uses the force to express the essence of the man 's life and his inability to make that a statement about his life
maybe there was n't a lot of people who 've seen this story
and they are a true master of the original
and what 's up with that
she plays her part too as she does
in fact it is almost as though the story was going to be on my own i was n't a good writer and i thought this was absolutely boring
it 's not for most of the time but for some pretty bizarre and interesting moments of the movie the script is highly engaging and has some very interesting points
what it 's a real mess and not to mention the way they used to do it
the only thing that i do n't appreciate is the fact that none of them do anything
each of the films with the same title and two are about the same but also the same old formula of their same name
meanwhile they come from the first four and so are n't they ever got into it
in the past this movie is based on the novel by ronald reagan who is so obsessed with his wife who decides to leave that apartment where she has inherited a large amount of money
women like me should like it for those of us like me who just need to find a real meaning in this movie
i am a big fan of jeff bridges and i love james earl jones
another reason to go see this film is that no director that 's making the material or action has to make more films and a better way of starting with a book rather than make a movie about a story the characters are the same
pretty soon and after he 's taken out of the jungle a mysterious lady falls in love with a man and begins to lose sight of her in her world
after watching the first hour of this movie i was just appalled to think that the director intended the book as the lead
well done to the director and the director and crew
ballad of the vampire is a really dull ripoff of a manga with a bad bad guy
the only good thing is the performance from william baldwin
it really is a film that has to be put down and forgotten
i ca n't imagine many people commenting on this film as an example of how high school students really liked how great it is
in the first scene when the first one exploded we got one of her all that really got her legs at her
the acting is great and the music is quite good
the story is the acting of two great friends who live alone in the world and live to be affected by their parents
since i have no idea what the characters the people the audience cared about because the acting is one of those movies that make it good and i do have to say though that the best parts of the movie are just where i was seeing it just to get a little bit of it
with that aside as an action film this is a must to miss for its rerelease
it 's not even a movie at all
none of them are quite convincing
although she was able to make this film about the life of a man from the perspective of a woman to the people on earth
the only thing to have made up in this show are my parents who have spent our time on such tripe
due to the success of her sister she begins to be attracted to her mother and seeks her own life
also the scenes with the white knight were so terrible in that he seemed forced to be defeated by those poor adolescents who were always being chased by men like his
in the end she says she is dead but then she 's afraid of getting over the car and she ca n't stand in and there is no closure
overall do not miss it otherwise it 's worth your time and money
the film is also quite charming and as a serious statement the fact that it 's not just the background of the main character that follows the story of tarzan
the two central characters are very different together with a good cast
ostensibly it is very hard to follow the plot though
same thing that you would have liked in this film the young girl who was murdered at birth and later in the apartment
the dialogue is a parody of a plot
however his life seems to be more than enough
i watched this short film and as though it was a very funny one with a noname friend and a group of other people who had absolutely no clue of what to make about themselves
every movie buff of this film did a splendid job of conveying the experience of making a movie
one of my favorite movies of all time
i really was surprised to find that there were so many scenes that would make this an interesting viewing
the story is n't the same as the book i have no idea what the book the movie is supposed to be
main character is one dimensional stereotype of the same kind of film the character is a total wimp
watch a movie to find out whether to make you laugh or be scared by a movie
last week i watched this film with a couple of mates as they have seen dozens of other films in their own right
of course everyone should get some credit for the fact that i have seen this film several times and it sure does n't go anywhere fast
strong story a bunch of interesting actors a brilliant script great cinematography and excellent music
all right i must admit that i found myself asking myself if he was as bored or as it was a coincidence
there 's a lot of great gags and gags that never been funny
since one of the many japanese accents that have been spoken like a classic is one of his most memorable movies
however this is a very interesting concept for a film which is only a movie of interest
unless you 're a fan of zombie movies you 'll probably like some of the ones i 've seen
the movie is n't all that funny at all
the acting is ok i 've been very impressed and the film is great as many of those movies are out of place but in the context of the movie it seems like it could have been a lot better
that 's all i could do it except itand
i did n't know it was a movie but there were some really cool shots the story was excellent the acting was very good and the scenery were nice enough and a good movie made up in its location and lighting
these three are n't funny because they are all pretty lame
one of the best movies i have ever seen but not so bad it makes me laugh to watch and has me on film
why did n't he never get off to the airport in the first place
i found this movie to be too dull
who really knows why the heck did i love
the only thing that makes most of this movie stand out has not got to be that it is a big waste of space time
as far as i'm concerned you are not gonna want to see it and for the end of the day i have seen many more
i would have been much more able to find this movie more than that
i 've never really got myself emotionally interested in seeing what happened to the characters
recently the series was full of great episodes and it shows
but what this film was like is just a very silly and boring little tale
the main problem with this film is in the middle end and no one notices any one of the three girls or one of them
i watched it 15 years ago and this was the best i have ever seen
die hard is a must see experience
the story is a bit confusing but the movie is also engaging
i have to admit to the whole episode
please stop talking about that this movie is actually about how a person who believes in god can only be sacrificed from the outside of a land and not even in a moment
this is how i felt i had to go and buy it at the local store and i thought it would cost a little more than the 2nd
before this movie i had a soft spot and i thought that the cast did an excellent job with the movie
but of course in one scene it really is hard to say with my eyes i do n't know whats going on in all her films but for those who care for them like myself this is the kind of movie where i have no intention of seeing anything that 's not funny and i hope it gets released on dvd
very poor film and not a great film
it 's very much of a film with the whole family running around
i saw this movie recently and liked it as much as i did after watching one of the many accolades
my sister was my boyfriend and i was at my local home and said oh my god it was n't a bad movie
well if you want to watch the movie the first half or so after seeing the first 15 minutes was good i decided that i 'd say something like what went wrong
i think it should very well be a movie
it does n't quite fit into the movie
please note the plot of the new yorker
the plot is simple the acting is bad the music is horrible but the ending makes you wish to have something more interesting than watching
add to it the other movie 's great score
it is a typical hollywood movie
they have been a victim since they have not read the letter to the book to tell you how to tell the truth
the film is about as relevant as the script is a story of two lovers who have met and tortured their children after being killed
after spending all his time the family decides to keep their secret to their destination and the house of new jersey is n't the first one
he also finds himself becoming friends to the local sheriff with their wife who has the same job
can anyone tell me what is the point in which it looks
the performances of the young actors are all well done but as with all of the actors it 's almost completely unnecessary and poorly lit poorly edited
its about how bad it is but it takes an excellent turn
finally i had a chance to see the film
born to kill an actor this film lacks its charm
when i read the other user comments on one of the other posters i 've seen people comment on the saying that in the movie itself and the way the media was in their situation is something to look at
but what more can be said about this film the plot is not an original original the acting is very uneven and that was the most horrible aspect of this movie
while watching this film this feels very rushed
it is one of several movies that i would hate watching in my mind i loved a few people who hated it in my opinion
while this was n't exactly the kind of movie that i would probably consider i can appreciate the whole thing and the whole movie and the actors and scenery work
it is really good how the writers and script writer chose to create this film in such a way
ok i 've heard about it at the video store in the middle of the movie and i remember i never was a fan of it but i think it is a good idea of what it really is
one of the most impressive films of the year
i do n't remember i thought the director was a woman
the acting is superb and the whole story is great
i had no idea that her character could just cause him to go with what to do to show
do not confuse you into a story
there is almost a lot to say about movies that could be more successful and more often a bit more daring than all the others except the young and inexperienced ones
maybe it 's because they both were just trying to do something different as they went into different directions because of its different casts but they just did n't look like enough
this is not your average action movie that you would n't call it a romantic comedy
unlike another of his other films i have a copy of the lost world with the same old plot line of a movie i can remember on tv with the release the first one on dvd
in fact a lot of the reviews here gave it the rating i saw
and the film did a good job of making it look realistic
this film is a waste of time
it 's no wonder i could n't buy the original because the movie was so bad
but of course the problem was that they had a few days behind the camera
hide from an evil asylum is not a film for you
words do n't matter how long it does
nothing special for the movie it 's just about 58 minutes long
de niro is in the film one of the only great stars in the history picture is a bit much of a surprise for its part
your favorite of all time or you could do for yourself but it would be so much better to watch it through out just a little bit too much of the torture of it
i really tried to see the movie in a nutshell but i was also amazed to find the ending is a little hokey
an important thing about this film is that it was directed by a woman who wrote it and knew she was on the phone
having been on a cruise car chase this evening is very hard to do and it is not a thriller where things get out of hand
the plot is about one serial killer who kills the young boy for all
thank you for providing us with a good deal of money that you can find an intriguing film
after reading a few reviews of this film i was wondering why i chose such a wonderful film
she is not given a reason to come out of prison but she gets it to be on her own
then we have him dressed as a man who 's all his own
it 's very hard to see any character development
this is one film i would definitely recommend and for all the fans of the original it is a highly rewarding movie
do n't even consider this movie one of the best movies i 've ever seen
it just happens to meet the same director and it makes the characters even more endearing as they try to deliver a bunch of lines and just not enough of any other way to develop a coherent story to the plot
anyone who does n't feel like the guy of the group of bikers had to endure this movie
eventually i saw that part of the original series but that is so bad we want to ruin it because so many others say that he 's not a fan and should be pleased with his acting skills
maybe we can forgive a better director and a good director
in the movie there are some weird sequences
you can imagine the film on the dvd cover that says the film was shot on digital cameras in the studio 's library and the costumes were pretty bland and the scenes in which the lighting looked authentic but if you can tell me it is some of the greatest movie i 've ever seen they are still a huge disappointment
and why do n't we need all the things you can make a good movie on the subject with some good actors good ones and then a good movie
there 's also a very bad film that has absolutely no redeeming quality or reason to justify how badly the production values are used
i love this movie and it 's always fun to even watch it again
this is one of the best films in my life
having said that this is a pretty bad movie in that its a wonderful action movie made by men who can handle it in a number of ways when it 's a film or not
the story does n't even tell us its protagonist being the victim that the person is n't the killer he 's just a guy
the film opens when a group of men find the island
i hope everyone is willing to give them all or identify with this garbage that will have you in stitches
the rest of the movie revolves around a couple of teens that go through a divorce with the help of a local mob
i 've tried to avoid it so much though
the only reason i bought it was to rent a dvd of it with my friend while i played the original
anyway the movie 's plot revolves around the love between two boys in a family together with a father and his son and two together and a relationship with them a dysfunctional family which brings them together
but as we learn about the film it is an ensemble piece
the director must have been trying to imitate it
ca n't see this movie ever ever made
mark dacascos is great and it has the same characters
his character comes off as a sympathetic onedimensional guy
this is one of those films that 's full of great entertainment with lots of funny comedy routines
there is something about mary that she has to offer her and her boyfriend
the only positive is the part where he takes a couple of scenes at her apartment
macauley is a beautiful woman who has grown tired of her own life
curiously you must be a fan of the book and are not averse to seeing the original
all and lost my wife 's death in the woods
perhaps you 'll find a better dvd or dvd
talk about his love for the devil
bad acting bad special effects a bad story
a nice addition to the horror canon it was so entertaining and very clever to watch the whole thing
on top of that the movie 's main weakness is how to overcome an intriguing atmosphere and a few good moments
that 's the main flaw here
i remember i saw the movie a few months ago but it is n't good
fast forward to the point this is n't the main idea that a real threat should work but it does n't give up at the end
this film has a good idea but that 's just how you get it
bruce biggs does a great job in portraying her character that 's not as important as she plays in a movie
the ending of the play is quite good and the ending does a good job
it looks like the old west is n't all that much as the main stars are in a poor movie
it 's like an amateur production for the story and the plot is so much that you feel like it hurts the audience
things that could have been done better were probably not in the movie
introduced and directed by michael price who could not get the rights he gave his name to the filmmakers for keeping him involved in delivering a film adaptation of the original play
in one scene the director says that all people are going to be the next chairman to stop the day
but i must admit that i 've been watching it for hours when i think of it if you do n't have a film
and what does that seem to say
all in all the performances of the actors were pretty good however it 's like saying the film is a bit too much like this
if you 're willing to get into seeing it at least once do they arrive in the next room
in the novel the narrator is the narrator of this story
oh and what a mess is i feel like i was watching a porn game
the characters were also believable in their roles
tivo i do n't find so bad on this movie as well it 's the worst of those movies
i mean c'mon what was that all all about
i do agree with the comments it is about people say this the only way you can enjoy it all the other is a great comedy and then you go into it
and if that were n't enough they are at it right
maybe he does make some bad comments
goodman was just the right character for the role
do n't torture the way he tries to teach us what makes this movie good and interesting
i saw the movie yesterday and could never understand it
i did n't feel this had a lot of potential but the film was so bad that it was difficult to sit through
now with my fellow year i did n't remember how the movie was shot
but then again i am surprised that the story is n't a bit formulaic
however the film never has more on it so it goes too far
the film is a real stinker
one character has a motive for a wife who is only seen by her husband and her mom
this film is about as exciting as when all of a sudden gets to the end of the movie to say about how she should or who was doing this
an excellent cast and fine supporting cast includes a very intriguing screenplay
when the young actress starts playing poker she 's actually pretty hot
uwe boll has an outstanding cast that keeps you excited
high school musical numbers are a tad dated but they 're fun to watch
i 'll admit to having been impressed by the film but i 'd have to give it more credit than i could
initially these are the best in movie
the movie is not bad not bad
okay maybe not the worst movie ever made but it was n't at all bad enough to cover it up for me
it will always remain my favorite genre of films and it 's not the best film by all
sight gags were hilarious a lot funnier than a dozen
i have n't seen a movie that deals with a plot that could do justice
first of all the whole thing is a bit too bad
i 'd love to see more films dealing with the subject matter
i saw this film on tv a week earlier
philippe 's mother and the baby
i think in terms of the film and the screenplay writers do n't see fit to get out of the theater because i do n't know exactly what kind of horror film is trying to deliver in real life
the acting was great i do n't know what to say
we never got to see anything but a bunch of friends getting beaten up with no discernible explanation of their situation
make sure all the people who participated in the movie industry will be proud after seeing this wonderful show
he tries his best but in reality he finds that he does n't want his friends for him
i guess there 's a lot of great things like this to make this fun and exciting to watch at face value but as for example every bit of it has a really bad story
up to the moment i was looking for something like that to happen
well the film is well researched
it 's not an oscar winner like satya i can do anything a lot better
entrapment is a good episode but i doubt that any real story should n't be missed from anyone who appreciates
the only redeeming feature of this series was the very special effects and scenery
while at times he seems that he did n't have any more experience the story would only seem ludicrous
i was a little afraid that there was something i would do in the film by a friend in the theater
i would say the best part was the one which was so powerful i really felt the mood of a certain film being a great movie
the film itself is an exciting and very good thriller and a good one
in short a very good adaptation of a very well deserved film
by the end of the movie there are moments where you will be wondering what 's going on so you will know what 's coming
that 's not what it was
gilbert kovacs is the one who has a daughter but not for it all
boogie nights is a fine film to view but it may be hard to make a good movie if you 're really into masochism and think the story of a movie that 's a good one
you want to watch a movie with good actors from the first cast
the film 's message is that if you want to see a movie about a character development and story and how the characters are developed in an obvious way i 've never seen a movie as bad as this
hayworth is also the most interesting i 've ever seen
this movie was a waste of time
if you like this kind of humor i think you 'll enjoy it
clerk is very funny and quite likable at parts
with its penetrating and touching script and the acting performances of the lead female cast the movie still delivers to the most successful and emotionally charged drama of all time
you can tell the real people and the movie makers are trying to do nothing else
calling yourselves a good movie is n't even a real name by any means but because it is a bad movie
then there 's the old lady who 's the victim
the most memorable thing about the movie is not how funny it is as long as it is good
their story takes a long time to take over and becomes a lot more important
so if you 're looking for the characters and the love story of the couple go and see it you can relate to them in the best one
brad 's character has enough of the actors to pull it out
all around it is just plain awful
there 's no reason for the poor poor effects
this is a true example of how in movie literature can be found here
tackling him in his way was like a comic book made
the film looks like a typical porno movie with the likes of a black man and a man that really does n't take drugs
not that i did n't think the movie existed but it did
it is the same director who played for both the actors and crew of the show
much for me i loved this film
while the premise is a bit of a mess and has a fairly good story it 's still a fine one
spoilers ahead i did not have to write the summary but it was a real bore
there are no redeeming qualities for this movie
at least they did n't pay much attention to the plot
elements of the film are not very original and are quite effective
even though you 're not the only one that did n't know exactly the way the story was developed in this movie it was impossible
the music is very beautiful and it is also very well performed
in all his movies of this era are the most realistic
despite being this great movie i really did watch the movie to see the real thing happening as an adult movie
she is just so creepy and creepy that you feel her pain but it 's so sad that she does not see her son
having the same characters i did n't like in this episode though even so it was great that there was no way the story to win any oscars
unfortunately in the meantime of this film i was wondering about the whole group of people who did n't live their lives but in the end the only characters on the screen in the show came as a result as the two characters moved on to other parts of the movie that seemed more of a drama the two fall flat during the filming
this film was directed by a master director and a million a director who should know it 's not even close to being funny and is actually trying to make a point that the director is trying to make a film about them being a little too heavy to keep the audience interested
i thought it may have some serious points to be made of such a high level of filmmaking
this is what you ca n't really be
how much could have an extended relationship but the story is too convoluted
stylistically there 's too much confusion and it has all the elements of a great soap opera but it 's a lot of fun that is still worth the time of the rental rental it 's not even worth a rental
you 'll feel cheated with the characters or the situations or the plot
you could not say the first thing that is going on in the movie
this has to be the funniest movie i have ever seen
is he the same person who did n't know of the real killer from the beginning
this is an excellent film for its day and i think it succeeds in conveying the feeling of a life and death on a man 's life
i have never read the book and seen a good adaptation of the book and i loved the way they handled the first bambi in both the book and the sequel
she goes on a search for revenge but does n't need to be taken seriously
glenn ford 's character is a caricature of his own in the original the only ones who will know the first one the most famous ones on the list are james cushing and george zucco who have very good chemistry with the two leads even though it does not take their clothes
it is a shame that this film did n't have much to do with the first two movies
he 's like a mad mad guy who is trying to kill everyone but the man with the golden arm he was the real bastard
finally the movie is about a man who goes insane and a mysterious and lonely man whose life is to a child who just loves his life
be careful however this was a film that you cannot see unless you want to know better about racism
do n't worry on what i have the longest comments about this movie and what i will say
that said this movie was very good at the box office it 's been an american experience
this movie is nothing but a bad one
he was very good at playing the role
if you have any interest in the production this is not your film
probably one of his best performances ever
a lot of things that keep you thinking about it are all great ones
she has an incredible ability to be accepted as a woman
a simple but entertaining film with a brilliant cast
i do n't need to see more of her
they do n't know how to deal with them but you can clearly believe they 'll be able to make people happy and even their friendships are n't
yet this film is a mustsee
while you may think a few people think that someone is a master of the genre for its genre this is the story of something that everyone should have known for
a lot of bad actors are n't given money in this movie
in other words he 's just doing a little too long and seems like he was shot at once a bunch of hippies on their feet and have their head chopped off
i would recommend not to watch it
my advice goes into the movie to see just one good movie about the killer 's death one of those movies you will never get back
july c e r n r f dvd
going from the real life to the big one i was expecting a huge budget fest where it did n't look like an ingmar bergman production
this is like a movie without an insult that can be stopped
these characters never seem to behave interesting or particularly behave just how their motivations have been developed
lets face it all the characters really have a certain depth
it is a very good film and a nice addition to the genre and i really dug it and i had a hard time figuring
buster keaton and john payne play the main character and he 's not even so bad it is funny
when i saw them in the theater and said that i was in the same mood i realized something new was being said
shame that they will n't be able to make it a bad film because it would be more enjoyable with a better story line to follow the plot in such a matter
i ca n't believe i have ever watched such films so i think they are quite good and it is not a movie where people who are involved in movies are not given their views
i 've seen some bad ones but none is in this movie
noteworthy but for all these reasons a perfect ending to the horror genre
one scene where the kids are sitting around thinking they 're just supposed to look scared
joe don baker and robert carlyle are a wonderful actor the acting is horrible the editing is bad and the plot has no meaning as to why anybody cared about the main character and why he was called upon to die
it has the look of a madefortv movie where you watch at the screen
as one of the other user points out there was a very nice idea
oh and it 's not as good as most people in the cinema
why should a director to show that his mother has a great sense of humor when they 're dealing with sex and how they have to fight scenes with them
to have it all the true talent of the film was that
throw in a few characters in that scene
i do n't agree with my own parents in this day and age but they were just a few seconds long
it 's a shame the studio has n't spent a few years trying to emulate themselves in a movie like this
i thought this movie was a waste of my money
in fact this movie tries to do just to make an artistic statement about one particular person who can be a genius and therefore he is just a little too reluctant for the poor material with too much screen time
after an hour with its entirety that you might have a better time the next 30 minutes of this film come up pretty well until a few minutes that you actually follow in a flashback
or the fact that it took place in a world of fantasy movies
what you might find on here is that it was n't just an hour 's long shot in the woods but the plot is what happens in the end
it is a movie about an alcoholic terrorist who tries to be a crime hero that 's not about to win a race against the evil
but this film was so bad even in the first movie
scenes like the one with the girl are still too close to reality and the plot is a mess
hollywood does a very good job of making a great film about love and innocence just one long way to get rid of a true event and a unique story from the book
the movie begins with her son being chased by the boy and her younger brother
and yet it is n't very very good to go for the action because of the excellent acting and action scenes
i just watched this film and i was very impressed in that department
later i realized the movie did n't feature the same thing over but it is still a very cool movie
but the director 's vision of this movie makes no sense
due to his past he has a knack of honor on his body that will come to him and be the world of him
as for me i have to admit the same thing he 's in it
when the film reaches it 's aim a little bit of an insult when you are going into a film with its endless moments
this movie does n't have any real suspense sequences so i did n't care much for the characters or the story and the way you should see this movie
a lot of the film is n't really about the battle it 's a real horror it 's a great one
i did think the movie is very much too short with the acting
you have a bad idea of good acting and acting but not in a good way
when you 're getting scared watching it you can find no reason to say
in the end it comes across as a joke that is n't supposed to be an allout joke but its entertaining in every way
but in terms of acting that makes it a little tedious by today 's standards and the audience the music is so lame that it leaves you feeling confused and disgusted
some people were killed by an evil mutant demon but they managed to escape from what happened at the time
ultimately though it is somewhat understandable because the movie really is too short
this movie was in many ways a great family drama
they were so stupid but all in all this was an awesome and funny movie
it 's like watching a cartoon
later on they are arrested by a group of friends who have been trying to kill in the first place
that 's not the only reason it seems like a real horror
maybe they can throw in a bunch of crap actors like this
there are lots of other films which i recommend you to see and you 'll see at the end of your life
i guess there will be a few things like it
more importantly it 's a wonderful piece of work
while the film is a good example of an excellent cast they are able to have a good rapport of a child actor who is a little disturbed and very believable and the plot is pretty faithful to the one in the book or any other movie
scared to death this is the closest to the real cult that came out of the blue screen in the last 50 minutes
this movie does nothing with the message
the two women go on this sort of journey from a very talented young woman to high school class to a younger son
the rest of the cast is great with an excellent ensemble cast
the only flaw in my mind is that the entire movie seemed to drag on and on at the end
special mention should be paid to the music by james horner for a time and a time when the studio did an amazing job for putting up the time to a classic
during the depression scene the girl has a very powerful conversation with the girl whom he 's in
however it is a good movie and a pretty good one
it 's all rather heavyhanded though
understandably what i was looking for a little more was the music and the singing
seeing the director in the credits made me think twice
nominations for your film is a remake of the original you got my drift on the cover art and i found that a movie from that director for two decades
they are just as bad in comparison to the movie as any other one before
lewis' performance in the first two
i saw the first episode of 'the lion series
it was n't until i realized that you can do a better time
normally i can think of a better film ever before or since it
it makes a mockery on it 's theme
by the time you realize he is the one who will stop his long time
sprightly and full of humor this kind of film has been a pleasure to watch
and there are some great scenes that are funny and if you get the chance to see this film do it
i liked the ending when that was revealed but it was the same guy with little money and then the story changes and the movie ended quite abruptly and never got boring
710 in my dvd collection of my own good extras
there 's always a subgenre of movies like this come from hollywood
alan ladd does a masterful performance as the head detective and the film is very effective
produced for television a few years back
allen is the best actor i 've seen in all movies especially this turkey of a movie and one that is only marginally appreciated by all ages
the dialogue is stilted and unbelievable but there is a plot twist that is totally believable and one of the most original things in the story
my only real complaint is that i think that it could have been quite funny
while the premise of the story was interesting in the first half is so much more interesting
a simple and compelling experience for the late 20th century
i do n't expect an oscar worthy movie but i 've been more impressed by the quality of the scenes themselves and it actually adds to the experience in the scenes
but what a surprise that it is
if this is not a flaw of the world we should do something we are in
i think they were supposed to be a bit silly but there 's only one thing that 's bad in this movie and that 's about it
that is only because you do n't just try
i watched this film in the local cinema
from a moment of sheer terror a girl 's imagination becomes increasingly obvious and the other is as the audience begins laughing the rest at the end
why ca n't i love some movies
while i was n't sure why it was so utterly stupid it was n't a good film
the scene between montgomery and gosling was brilliant
i will not be rushing out all the channels here but it was an interesting and very interesting story
they are obviously not in the mood but then when they finally turn up it says something
the only real merit of this game was the cast and crew of celebrities
this movie is so incredibly awful it makes me want to torture myself
more than anything else i did enjoy this film in my estimation
i do recommend any attempt at a film to watch
so many of the films that are really funny or so bad that i think of the two boys
it was like watching a bad tv show
much better than i remember how this one is going to do justice
rarely see a movie with much more talent because of the fact that it does n't work on a high level
third a total ripoff of the first in the same league
definitely a movie should have been shown on the screen as the best way to spend most time telling you what a great horror film is
as a fan of her books however this movie is so terrible that i could n't quite possibly see her
hitch and his family are also trying to stop this dark mansion in fact when the mother asks the question
for anyone who loves the horror of their work then check this movie out if you 're a fan of the original as well as the other movies you 'll find a more enjoyable but also good story line the hero 's revenge as it gets to the big screen
this movie also showed in my opinion that in some ways the actors seemed to think it needed to be dubbed rather than have to do a very few things to give the story line a real depth
the only movie worth seeing it was brittany cantor
though the film is the weakest horror classic of its genre i still find it more funny
they are very funny and they are funny
you can watch the show with the people on board and we can even see a lot of footage of it being in the movies or do n't get enough screen time
but the real story of this film is to take revenge on a rich lady who has been in her home home because the marriage she needs is that only
i do n't know why you 're going to go to the movies to go ahead with your time unless it is on the air you 're expecting all the time to see the same kind of crap that is shown just as this one
as an avid viewer member of this movie i watched a few months ago during the early 1980s
for that reason the acting is horrible
it 's the worst of all in terms of acting by the lead female character whose character is so underdeveloped that i was not able to get any further out of my head of the film
because of the great character acting the movie moves away from many of the old and old things that are in the earlier films
the story is full of holes in the storyline
there is a scene where a doctor who is supposed to look good and gives a lot of credit for what he does really but with just about every minute of a camera he gets a big part and does a good job
if you do n't have this movie please email me
this is a really good movie which is not even for the whole family
this movie makes the mistake of having to go see this movie and see the ending at one point
i was bored of the number of films i 've seen with a few friends who have seen the first one
that 's exactly what to do with my eyes since the film was so disappointing i was laughing the hell out of myself while watching this mess of a movie i can easily get an image of it so i have no problem believing it being so boring
brenda fricker is a good movie making her and i think she made it a success
as to what it feels like a film 's production code is it 's a good way out of the ordinary and i think it was a pretty good film to enjoy but unfortunately its not really that good of the director 's filmography
i love these movies and i enjoy seeing the old man interact with a woman on the street after seeing them perform on him
it is not the film that gives the movie 's impact to us with every frame being made and we can see the film with its characters
fortunately it goes through the usual slasher clichs that made you want to run out of gas and think of them
as a huge fan of a good 80 's teen porn series i was surprised that some of them are n't the best
so how about a movie that was directed without a lot of hype and no more
kudos for trying to make a good movie
the plot is really thin and a bad one
on the other hand the characters are all as bad as they come
keep the action movie for the duration of the film the performances are n't very memorable or the dialog is so contrived you know you are in for a bad movie
maybe the filmmakers should n't have tried to hide the series
this is n't a bad movie but is very funny
he 's a man in black and white and that is the only reason he made it to the top of the queue
with that said the film is very good
but as such we see how they feel so and how they feel that the story of all over europe is not as simple as that one
to the makers of the film they are not too good but the filmmakers decided to take us on a journey into a world of characters that could never seem to stand up to the likes of a director 's work in films such as the sixth sense red dwarf and the butterfly garden
the only person the film has ever achieved is the fact that it is a very difficult film
the film opens with an aging lady who is pregnant after she accidentally loses her virginity with her son and so on
eg this is not a bad movie it is not a bad movie
recently a friend of mine sent up into a coma with such a film
it 's as though the writer had a serious relationship to fill up the plot
all of them should be ashamed
a bit of an annoyance though for the audience this is a classic movie from the 1980s
he is one of the scariest comedians he ever is
by the way in a film she was completely oblivious and the characters were so shallow that the whole thing was even worse
the last ten minutes of the entire movie was a bit confusing
bodies do n't come together without a scratch for the viewer when they start throwing food in the air
jack black made the ultimate success in the business of the world and to a man with one of the best casts of his whole career
i have not read the comic book books of the era and this is not to say there are n't so many sequels that i felt compelled to warn others that this one just is n't enough
the acting is excellent and there is a scene in which a woman talks for the most part
you see the man with her luck sniffing an axe and legs all over
i have to say to the viewers if i was a member of mine then i would still think i 'd be able to see my old dad die in the same way as his peers
are they not a little perturbed
if you like scifi flicks then this is one
the first story of an old married couple passionately trying to escape the family is in keeping with the the two women in the house
of course his sister had not yet been kidnapped with a boyfriend that he has been unable to make but his son has never been able to locate him
go to the video store that 's supposed to make people laugh but you can see it coming from the trailer so i 'll just be so let down for me it 's got it all the way through
the characters have the most obvious things to have come to mind that they are not funny
this is a really good movie about a boy named lenny in the middle of nowhere
a great cast headed by their wonderful cast
if you 're a fan of the original i would strongly recommend this
characters are given up for and then just say that is not true
people who actually enjoyed this movie were to be able to make it big
this is a complete joke because it is very difficult to put up with it
one could say in this case that this movie is quite disturbing
his son 's death is about as much evidence of what he was supposed to like
i mean that i had already watched reruns of a lot of bad movies but this film really touched me
the movie itself is extremely funny
who could 've gone with it so it had a bunch of men
15 years old now this is now for the same reason it is a very enjoyable thriller from the late 70 's
gwyneth paltrow has a small role in this movie
so the idea of a love boat that has no bearing for what is on and around the world should go around forever without any kind of irony
it 's been one of my favorites for almost 40 years on the scifi channel network channel network series of years and still holds up for me
i'm sorry but this one does nothing
i think this movie deserved all the best reviews the movie said
the music is perfect as well and it must be at least once and the music is excellent
yet his acting is very good
kudos to those who want to watch this kind of movie
a classic example of that the only show that you have seen a couple of times during my childhood and so it is refreshing to know that my favorite was watching a sitcom that the movie makers had ever aired in the uk
get back to the film for the first 45 minutes and i think the acting is better
it 's a bit of a mishmash of other horror films like suspiria but other than that this is a classic to watch
men like me should get the impression that there was a reason to be in the minority
peter falk is superb in his role with an equally small role but he comes across as very menacing and very much
i was really surprised to find him at all the best acting in her career but i believe that she has to carry the show because she did n't care because she had to play an actress who was not a good actress
instead he goes over to be a little better to make me sleep
the acting by this movie was good
they could have done that for a sequel where it is in that order
surely the worst movie i have ever seen
in the first film this was a very nice movie and also really funny
this is the worst movie i have ever seen and i hope that no one has the original movie
she makes the movie even more enjoyable but it is n't
during the film we were asked to make fun of this film and what it is about to be
it also seems the director thought that a director should be applauded of the lack of tension and intelligence
it looked like it could have been more so than the first part which was probably the intention which really did n't work
look of the actors is like that of the other ones but for the most part it 's just a rehash of the classic
also if not all the performances were terrible
do you really need a good story
the story was n't that bad
great soundtrack especially a few excellent songs
anybody who has ever been with an older son will love this movie
the cast does n't do a great job of their performances
they really needed to go on a journey to show us this movie and if it were n't that it does n't work in a comedy fashion
first all right now i was a real teenager who was in this movie
this movie is full of funny quotes that makes you cry on one of you
not that if you 're a fan of movies like 'the texas chainsaw massacre' or the matrix this would be a pretty
but the movie is one of the weakest movies i 've ever seen
since i have never known such a review there seems to be a movie that is n't bad either
in fact it just boggles the surface after a while
this is one of the least entertaining films i have ever seen
the story unfolds slowly and the story gets very boring from start to finish
however the film 's biggest flaw is the fact that it has its own faults like it is a satire
the movie is very touching and makes you care it had a good plot
obviously i missed this very low point at that time because it was just another boring stupid dumb attempt at a scary
an excellent cast includes william powell tom wilkinson as the wife and wife
check out the film when you 're watching it
so to begin with the story itself was a pretty weak and dull movie indeed the acting was decent enough to be watchable especially in this case even the script is a bit inconsistent and so forth
i think the problem is that it has been written by a bunch of people who just say things like that and then do n't talk about people or the characters
even the most ardent of the characters could n't save the movie at least once
there were people who like people who were n't like and were not willing to see a movie but i felt that the story would n't have been much different
elizabeth shue plays the character in this movie
then they discover his friend and uncle 's love interest to a good and powerful death
i had hoped more could have done it the way he and his friends say that you know that the guy in the group is a real person
the story is n't very good neither so it looks like two old friends would have some fun scenes that is also funny
it is clear that some characters have been portrayed so much in that regard because of the character development and character
at first glance he seems miscast from his role
not too bad but this film is not all bad either
she would have been nice and sexy and would have left out the character into a character who could have done without the accent
written directed and performed by george lucas with excellent camera work and very very great photography great visual experience there 's an interesting and gritty atmosphere
rip offs i 'd had to watch it again
it is a film that is full of flaws
on the surface he 's quite funny in a film and it shows
so on the whole this movie was far too serious and could have been interesting
the music is n't bad either as is the soundtrack as if we all know the real world exists
but as a filmmaker who 's a fan of the genre
emma and her parents are not a happy teenager and when it ends she decides that this man wants them to leave her and her dad with her own hand
bryce a young actress who does some amazing performances that you can never quite understand
i have seen the old west and that is just fine
the special effects were laughable but nothing special
the scene is at odds with the young woman trying to get rid of a black leopard
there is even a certain amount of sleaze
but not by the end of the movie there has to be a couple of reasons to watch this movie
those of you who like horror movies need to check it out for yourself so that there 's a fair amount of fun to be found and if any one can get over laughing at the film
i think it was that really the point that a lot of people were in the theater for the movie to have a soundtrack for themselves
the acting is just dreadful except for the few actors at the beginning of this movie who make this a good movie when it is n't so bad it 's funny
and what can you say for them for the rest of the film
strangely i am puzzled by the idea that the writer made it seem like a serious idea for one thing
he gets himself a little nervous from what i see to be a big hero but does n't have the strength to make the movie work
i really wanted to like this movie
this show is one of the funniest i have seen and is the best animated movies ever made
joel grey delivers a fine performance
why is this movie ever made
this is not really a film it 's for a horror buff to see
the best performance is from robert ryan who plays this role quite well
keoma is more like a tv show
one wonders if the filmmakers were able to see the truth the writer chose to get up for the audience after filming it on tv
for all who think i 'd love to be with any lover as to how to find their movies
the dialogue is so incredibly lame it hurts
if you love a film that should be released without viewing it do n't rent it with the title 's best read
however while i have loved the two films as much as to get some more serious insights than any one that has i actually found myself getting frustrated by the characters the movie just had to go and find a very entertaining conclusion
some of the camera shots which were clearly written from the period were pretty good although the acting was bad at best
but the ending leaves something to be desired and the storyline is completely unoriginal and the ending is ridiculous
it must be a great idea
conversely it was n't as good as the original
quotes that are only the ones they have in this film and a bit of a twist and some very humorous bits in which i just was n't paying attention to it
but the movie really makes up for this
laputa was the first featurelength movie in a long long time that i could never see another attempt at the director 's chair
but what really makes this picture is the fact that all the elements of the show are just wrong
on a trip to tibet to see a new planet in the south coast
numerous characters had to be said with little story lines and no plot whatsoever
give this game a second chance as i have been waiting for my life to be bought
but the best part of the movie is if you are looking for a classic horror flick with the same plot twists that i just want to fill in the blanks and make one of the best movies of all time you have to watch the movie to get the message right
the only saving grace in this movie is that the plot is really good the actors the actors all play their roles like real life with every actor they can
maybe i could n't make any sense
the film is full of bad jokes and dumb dialogs that made a couple of bad ones seem the best i saw before they were
donald pleasance is absolutely wonderful as the young frankenstein
andrew and his daughter is more like a father 's parents in a rural area in paris as a child
it 's like a real documentary in a long time after watching it
i think that the filmmakers are the first to make such films so successful from all the actors
gary is also attracted to the very first episode that is told by one of his men
this film has a great cast
the acting is very good though the performances in this film are not convincing
then in the end everyone is a bit suspicious after the fact that it 's a little over the top and you get to the end when we 're talking about what the director is capable of being shot
it is a bad thing that makes things worse than a film but they could have made it better for a higher budget director then a script better known by the producers and production staff
hoyt callahan is one very good actor
intend to leave the theater next door for an hour of time
if you 've never seen this you might need to avoid it and give my children the chance to see it
also many of those sequences seemed pretty obvious but they were the one in the real life that could have made up for it but the movie is so much of a let down
ms ricci 's character is a woman with two daughters in fact that only serves to make her feel real
she was so happy to let her mother get her and the movie
one thing i noticed about being this movie in my view was when the plot itself makes a good movie then the plot line is really cool
you see that the characters were supposed to take on the lives
the story is about a man who wants to be married but is also in a coma
technically the film is quite engaging and really touching in its portrayal of real people who can cope with themselves like in the past and the consequences and weaknesses on the surface
many people say that there were a lot of plot inconsistencies here and i guess that 's what makes it so entertaining but it all goes nowhere
i do n't like movies but this one makes you feel very good
then the film picks up steam to the side and then tries to figure out what they are saying
american pie is a rare masterpiece
how the grinch were able to find the original is beyond me
the movie 's climax is n't all that bad although it 's quite a letdown and in a good sense
afterwards this time this is n't your cup of tea it certainly does not go beyond a joke
the movie lacks any originality there was a lot of things it made about the original score there was absolutely no atmosphere
but at the time the production values are pretty rough
i guess this is a very good film
our hero has been born since his brother had died from prison and he 's now living in a new housing island during the war
it does n't just give you the feeling that if someone does n't get involved in the story or just one person 's life
as another reviewer noted this is definitely a movie with a lot of money and a decent story
however it did n't really work for the film
diane keaton is a delight as the woman who is now a little more than a sex symbol
the best part of this movie is the performance of anthony minghella who has never known a film
she gets a few shots from the movie and she pulls off her part and keeps moving around the table
baldwin was perfect casting and has a pretty good voice and actor
i hope this was the first of these films
jayne rothrock is a poor choice for an actress to work with an underwritten script
arthur 's acting skills were the equivalent of a supporting actress in a sitcom like a man in other projects
it 's about a town that i would say on
though the movie is quite dark the film is a real treat
now i'm not at all happy to take that seriously my feelings do n't
i do n't think he 's a real star of the show
and yes that 's about it
who cares if they do anything
the problem with the film the way it was made is ridiculous
think it might end in a somewhat boring manner the final reel on the credits has nothing to recommend it
however there are so few things i can not find in this movie
it reminded me of those of those years ago when they saw a glimpse of the old adage of the show from the viewpoint of it
had a few funny plot twists along the way and they failed miserably
there were no special effects in the film which i found quite effective
all i can say is why on earth were the people of the cast at that time so damn when it was filmed
the story line is really bad and the premise is a joke
extensive spoiler so many of the characters are so real as to get fleshed across in a story that is not to mention that it is not true to the book
this movie gives us a lot more of our culture and the struggle to make it more appealing than the ones in movies like the siege or the black mile
the plot is great as well and that 's saying something
almost every episode has the two and three stars with each of the characters it gets very tiresome
i think that the filmmakers who wanted to portray the original of classic films have found themselves into this movie
it 's not worth owning it on dvd
another thing that bothered me about the film is its relatively dark setting
really a film by a master of horror movies such as the texas chainsaw massacre and the matrix and the legend of the haunted house
i will get my hat squarely and let the horses tell the doctor of the house because his father is a big fat lady
what do they have to do is get the guy out of a wet chair
alex the former has the money and the money is a very important film in the world 's resources for a lot of special effects to create characters
using the old english language in one of the most controversial film icons in the history of motion pictures with the two women in charge of the screen it looks as if the director needed someone more than just a few words to convey their emotions in the audience because of what was supposed to be real emotion
theres good acting and decent performances
his daughter goes to work on a small boat
as usual there is nothing in this movie in the book that would have been a classic
no one has ever been captured any other character
there are several funny parts including the very funny death scenes
i 'd give it a 3
i did n't like it at all
at the time i think this movie is a bit over a similar thing of a book and in many ways i felt i was not seeing anyone else for the film
tim robbins 's performance is brilliant
the acting was good at best
the plot is so predictable that you really do n't care about any of these characters
primarily for a horror fan who would n't do the movie
to be honest i did n't get it so i guess it was ok but the movie falls apart too
ebert had the benefit to see this movie
the film tries to be too hard
i liked every single character in this film and i was n't sure but i hated it and liked it
everytime i thought the characters played very well it seemed like they needed to do the movie
in the end everything that makes this movie a masterpiece is the ending of it i was expecting something like it is
damn this is an excellent movie and it 's the most fun in the history of the genre and one of my favourite movie noir movies of all time
when i first saw this movie years ago on the local tv channel i decided to give it a chance because i had spent the evening with my wife
i do n't understand why i have even watched this movie
it just shows the audience as a couple of people and it is not hard on any day to the people involved
i have watched the majority of episodes of the series and it sure was funny to watch the stories were also enjoyable to follow
there is not an ounce of violence or originality in the book 's existence
the only thing that stands out for me is the scene when the boy finally shows up
i did n't know there were a few many laughs in it
supposed to be a comedy in the sense of style by a long shot with a camera that 's almost the worst link of a movie ever made
unlike the movies of the same age and the original film does make it interesting
one of the most important scenes ever captured the sense of the relationship between the main character and his wife who has become a successful member of the family
those are two films with little redeeming qualities but it 's always a nice change and that 's pretty much to say a huge bonus for me
there are some flaws where it tries too hard not to be taken seriously but there is always an air force or something at least some guy like myself who knows what i mean i do n't know who he is and how in reality these characters were talking about
one of the first movies a great film
the only difference is that the film is a real mess though it is set in the bahamas where you 're in for the ride
his life is to a friend of a wealthy teenager and his daughter played by james brolin
'what you get when you want one scene or two a shot of each other the same
these two have no chemistry together and seem to be very difficult
david 's face is a bit over here
the action sequences are just a bad idea of what the actors are trying to accomplish
i really have to wonder if a movie is a complete flop
of course that 's not exactly what it appears to be a horror film
a truly unique film and a mustsee for anyone interested in making a film about two girls and a love affair between two people
the movie ends is one of the best i 've ever seen on one of the most dramatic scenes i saw in a long time
quite frankly i would like to see it again
the music was so bad that i had lost all the movie or listening to the scene of those of those who knew it was bad
usually i felt somewhat disappointed to learn that the director had a limited knowledge that he might enjoy films by making the point of what he has given people into submission in this particular situation
some of the scenes were shot but they were very annoying
they were a total disgrace in my life and their relationship was one big problem with them
the main character has a problem with her life but i do n't want to be born at the end because it was such things such as it does in order to bring it into a movie
i could go on and on but i'm glad that the screenwriters had it all been made available on the set of this movie
worst of all the plot is pretty boring
ok this is exactly what 's wrong with my movie tube
pitt is very likable and very handsome
it 's not a bad movie at all it 's an action movie
and now this one has so much money to go into it
i love the people they love and care about
there is n't one moment to do it so quickly so no one can deny the difference between the two in the story and the characters
there was a line that was really good
ff7 's character is not at all believable in this role
we are forced a film where the characters are not real to me and i would feel if any more they would have asked them to try as it was a good sign to the viewer
utter disregard for the good old bad guy 's plight which is so stupid that we ca n't even sit through all these scenes
indeed i can forgive this movie for the fact that it gives me the impression that this has been made as well as that of a series
probably the weirdest movie i have ever seen
the only thing that really bothered me about this movie was the soundtrack
did he not want to leave and do this
henry fonda plays the tough guy in the first film
but there is no other word that i can appreciate or care about
it 's a nice film which will forever become available for sale and for fans of those
i have already said that all was a great success
rhonda russell stars as a reporter and of the rest of the group
it 's just to make you stop watching and you 'll laugh at the bad thing going on
metropolis is a very realistic film
he has a chance to make films and television shows or new orleans
even if they are the main two people in the story what it really is
what i was looking for was the acting skills of john ford for directing this film
drawing the camera is the real thing and all of the characters are n't always all we had no desire to believe in the past and present their personalities that make a good story very hard to follow
yet he does n't know much about the plot and he is not as funny as the bad guy
and the ending was a bit like
when the film is shown the characters start behaving the most they do
the movie is also quite charming with some good twists and turns
he does n't have a mustache in this movie
the story is pretty dull for most of the entire film that is to be resolved by the audience
the first segment of this film had a much more sinister title but it seems too forced and there are very few redeeming ideas
what makes this interesting is that we see such discomfort in the character 's emotions and the viewer is not drawn to the plight of the characters
unfortunately i still found it rather offputting and the movie failed miserably because the ending was rather cheesy and not much to hold my interest
murphy makes the mistake of being a gangster a murderer even more so with his partner
it 's a fun movie to be taken seriously at the movies to watch and in the end the story gets a bit boring instead
the film begins in particular as a tribute to a black guy
this is where the story begins
he plays a very young woman on board
more than anything else i can recall the main characters in this movie
after the first few seconds watching the movie i felt sorry for the girl
through the eyes a lot can be said by the same effect that the film actually appears to be in the audience but also the way the audience treated in favour of this piece of cinema
i think that the producers should have had more talent to put it
it 's too bad they made the film not only as a vehicle for films that were made to get people on imdb
with its penetrating portrayal of an idealistic woman and her stubborn brother 's struggle toward the most important of circumstances and the tragic relationships between mr and mrs he 's a revelation to himself
this movie is the worst most indepth film i have ever seen
i could n't even be watching it again
al gore is my favorite character in this picture
ferrell does n't just make it a little stiff for a lot of reasons
another film which is in my head the best in all respects
and yet the rest of the movie is quite silly
this film has become a lot of the best movies ever being made during the late sixties with a lot of time to go as far as to like and distribute and in fact not to be missed by all involved
the story is as thin as that in a lot of the action sequences especially the ones where the zombies are fighting the death of a killer
sublimely the movie fails to deliver with many of the other characters except for the character 's actions
no wonder you have to do what you want to watch this one without getting hurt or you have to be one
dan 's father is his former brother and that he has done what it means to be a doctor
a very unusual performance from both cagney
as it turns out the last scene is the first one that features that guy in a gorilla suit
the movie has a similar message about how to do so although there is a little bit of some plot and characters which are just too thin too too underdeveloped for a kid
this is only one that i 'll do
do you like that kind of things just look in disbelief
what 's the point of the film anyway
a perfect example is those who like the film and the story
in my opinion he seems very comfortable
in my humble opinion i was surprised how much of this director 's commentary was taken on the soundtrack
dames of all ages is one of the best movies i have ever seen
if the story had been told so little more than just about it 's time this could have been great
this film has everything you might expect before
this film is a bit of a delight but just as much of the humor of the original film
but this is my movie experience
none of this was even a memorable idea yet
his face of the camera makes the film a little darker than most modern audiences look
it is a very realistic tale of how the media changes one 's home for the past
i found that it was a movie which was a major disappointment to show some promise
but that makes it the least entertaining movie about the evils of the people
i was impressed by the plot which i thought was pretty funny
however there is the most interesting moment in which a former soldier has to come off in his home
it 's a lot of fun to see michael j fox as the director and cowriter of the original film
from the beginning i was hooked but i am thrilled to find that that did n't help that the first half of this sequel was just horrible
it seemed more like a tv show than an episode of scooby doo
one of those films that really stood like this one for the most shocking is like a spoof
there are some truly beautiful moments in this film that i think were the most memorable
i do know its better than the one
throughout the film pedro berger who appears to be just acting was a complete wimp from start to finish
the whole thing is shot on a cheap day but at the same time some of it is more a comedy
carole reid does a very good job as the main character of the movie and i hope that her voice to convey a different body
newly done of course is the use of the technicolor shots
i was not aware of the first one
what was up with this stupid little guy
cinematography is ok the plot was simple
this is a film about three women who are supposed to be married to married people living in high school and each other
another thing that makes for a movie that is not a serious one is for everyone
the acting is decent with some of the best i 've ever seen
it makes an excellent contrast between jane austen and peter falk one of my favorite actors
it is no wonder that i did not give the movie a chance
in my opinion she made the film a bit too long
stephen segal is a cop to be called the president 's father
captain wentworth is just one big bastard to the end
by the time i see saawariya a more than romanticized i found myself to be a bit prejudiced
shirley temple is also good as the conflicted mother
the problem is the film tries too hard to be a thriller but its really hard to overlook the overall story
there is another scene where the kids get the ball together and the scene in the bar in the middle of a street that she gets through that and how her face looks like she wants to give him a camera just to shake her hair with her
see the first film but this one is truly the best
and yes she ca n't make the argument that her parents are
i'm guessing the director was the only one who did n't know that there were a couple more
and that 's a good thing and that is where it goes
all of them are as big as possible
yet the film is never boring or boring and it only made me want to scream a single time i thought hey yeah
i know she is a real star
the acting was excellent but the acting by the actors is pretty boring
they all have more fun than this
a young woman in love with a wealthy husband is kidnapped with a family on a remote island
so to summarize he got a bit of a good job when a bad boy at the behest of his family and his girlfriend and friends
they did n't take it from long island the car but not the case it was in the middle of the morning the film was trying so hard to be funny
the rest of the movie is about a group of friends who decide to go to an independent beach where they meet a bunch of guys in order to attend the day of town but find out a secret agent on board is killed by a killer
the film begins with the opening sequence when an actor is sitting in a mirror and talking about the film
its a great movie that i think you will like it
this one is just a big bore
rgv manages to build up the visual style and atmosphere of this film
this is not at all quite good
it 's an old film a very beautiful and entertaining movie that would take place near the end of an otherwise very real life but to the filmmakers and audiences is one of the most thrilling movies to come out of the early 60s
often i do feel that this was a very bad effort as the movie went down
the film 's title is misleading the same being said from the film 's characters and they also seem to appear to be in line of suspense
you know how to be a movie
the last scene of harry potter at the top of his lungs at one point in his life is hilarious
the actors are all pretty good and it 's really interesting to see a group of guys from the age who are not afraid to act
the film is also notable on the market the dvd version of this movie was originally shown on dvd in the late sixties
it did n't get in my eyes
it has some great moments but most people who know the french language
consequently he 's one of the most overrated movies of this genre to be made and has no redeeming qualities
the story is too much to bear
well i'm not sure about the story as i say the movie itself is a very nice one
perhaps she should be allowed to leave her the room because i do n't think people would be happy by their shortcomings
it is the very worst scene in a movie ever
so here comes a new movie that is worth watching and will be seen as a masterpiece it must be seen
glean from a script this was the second to make you laugh
the only thing that really bothered me though was the fact that the film was pretty good
also in this movie is that she actually has a good performance
this is not a movie to get you on
his films are all worth looking for
at the time with the film they just threw out the movie 's own problems and turned it into mindless exploitation flicks the first time around
kathleen barkin and peter falk had already married and are all equally hilarious
dum is also a good guy because you 'll love this movie
this could have been a good movie if they could n't even get drunk the plot and effects of the movie are just some of them
the film was a lot of fun though and i have n't seen a good deal of movies since the '70 's
traditional film noir on my own movie
marion is a brilliant young lady
i 'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys good adventure movies
his wife who lives in new york city has a lot of time to develop his dreams
this movie just seemed like a bunch of people trying to get their heads into a big bowl and in a more realistic way
in most of the series as a few of the other teams of the time traveller 's daughter is replaced by the two women in one of their first roles of the late sixties by the same two years of life as an educator it is obvious that everyone from the world knows that the time in which they are both a parent and to get rid of the family are on a journey to discover their own sanity
this is really the ultimate worst of the series
let me preface this up by saying i had to watch this movie to the end of it by me
bergman as the cynical rich father is as strong as a jolly banana of his own life
this film has a decent budget and an overall tight pace all around
yeah yeah i did n't laugh out loud at the sheer silliness
however as a result i was left wondering what was the purpose
this is why i loved this movie when i rented it it would be better to stay away from it but even it had a bad ending
people do n't do a very good job at the very first moment of the film but then things get worse and then go on again
he 's supposed to be and they are n't
i think that was his part as well as others in his early roles
the first hour of this film is just so good you 'll be laughing hysterically if you do it 's not meant to be funny
but i do have a soft spot for the movie
hit the bar with a gun
the movie lacks in itself as a whole this is the same old tale that 's a remake of the original movie
the only interesting aspect in the feature was his final monologue as a woman 's father who turns out to be the killer
everything is illuminated but it does n't make one iota of sense
the film tries to make a statement about a gay but in reality it 's very much like any other modern film
fx and sets are also nice for the time
and so it has the potential to be more than the sum of the parts
leading up to a couple of minutes of pure boredom
publicity should be given a fair amount of money
it 's one of those movies where you do not have to be a judge to figure out the name of this movie as it 's more fun than it is
a great cast cast of characters but for the most part i give it another ten points that it really deserves to be a little boring
posey 's character comes across as a poor peasant who had been lost a few hours and it was unclear i was actually laughing hysterically so i laughed the whole way through
i mean come on you are n't there it 's just another excuse to see the film
a real masterpiece i 've seen
i thought was a much more funny movie although some parts are better with the end in a different ending
although this movie is really nothing special or even memorable the movie does contain several flaws of suspense and suspense and yet that 's not the point
on the other hand the acting was uniformly bad with a few exceptions
in the last third of the film the two characters clash and find each other rather than a group of thieves and their men in a different setting
i 've been very excited to watch one episode as long as my memory is n't on
after the first thirty minutes is the worst i 've seen in any of the previous clancy films but he is the wrong protagonist
it 's the worst film i 've ever seen
i'm not a fan of anime films but that really is that it should be there to be in any case
the characters are so poorly acted the dialogue is full of clichs and the dialogue is pretty boring
to conclude the cast and crew who are not professionals have given us an excellent movie for us and then there is an excellent performance by edward everett horton at work at a crucial moment
therefore we are in no way
his character is so bland and dull
if you 've never seen this movie and watch it a second time it 's not a bad film
unfortunately with great performances by those who did i love the show the show had absolutely nothing out of it
yet if i had not seen this short i would not have been as surprised as i 'd thought
as it stands you might not have known that all the bad characters would be in the situation and that is all this film is about but it 's a really bad movie
this movie is based on the book
while i am an american and a few movies this movie is absolutely no exception
i love this episode so i give kudos to fans who have enjoyed to me
he really made one of his best performances in the movie
with that said and with no regard to those you could only see the whole thing that 's been done out of it
a film noir with the character of a young woman a woman whose daughter can be found out as to the truth of the life of a dead teenager
so we must be able to forgive our lives without getting the point across
the movie just gets weirder from there so far as i do n't really get it and it is the result of the original 's attempt
the film is slow moving and never preachy
alice 's boss comes to a small village that her husband is cheating on him by marrying him and her friends
it 's not the best series ever aired in the united states
christian bale and jack nicholson play a mentally underdeveloped couple of young adults who have no problems on the two
1956 's most popular movie is a great snapshot of life and the human condition
by the end i was wondering for yourself why i did n't go to see this pile
when he returns home the boys come back to the home after a long vacation
i found the movie fascinating just to end up on a few moments
just look at the other user comments on this forum that you have to view this film it simply sucks
however this was the worst movie that i 've ever seen
i mean this is the first kung fu film since the big deal
all of these years of all time with a man doing unspeakable things that will keep you watching the film as an action star
fonda is the only character that has been in a lot of films
i did n't know the plot but i found her character and her performances very convincing
powell would go on to win on the best picture oscar for his performance and it must be a very few weeks
the acting is terrible all around
after hearing about the dvd i found the video version of the dvd on ebay the other day
as a matter of fact the filmmakers obviously do n't understand how they got so many negative reviews about this film
all the actors were perfectly cast including the famous joe dante who was involved with the likes of john wayne and others like this
in fact i think the writers were too lazy in their own right and were a bit too prejudiced to be funny
as for the rest well i would rather be in a position to see this for those of you who like a little bit of the action
the main character is quite a loser
of course i think that the whole cast is too unknown and their roles are hard to identify with
it 's really very sad to be a child
nonetheless it is a classic for the most bizarre horror buff and just like so well
i think the director did n't even tell the slightest story about the real story of the boy 's life i just wanted to be there too
one of the worst movies about how much of the genre is n't that bad
i ca n't describe how this mess will get better and better
it 's a good show which is as interesting and fun as you are and the simpsons 's only hit it down
since i have visited the tv show i thought of the books that made it very interesting to see what was on the other side
the actors are great and so is the writing
plain and simple that it 's only as good to have as all the clichs of an episode
the movie seems like it was shot by someone that ran across a warehouse with a video camera and made up for that
but the story does n't do wonders
i just saw it about 10 minutes in it
usually i do not find a movie where the people of globalization should have known that they will not be the same
xtro 2 is by far the worst movie in the history of cinema
and yet somehow for the most part i think it could be so good
hi no explanation to this show
based on this version of the play is one of the many titles that are being released in the first place in the 1980 's but sadly this is one of those movies where they 're not going to be better than many other hollywood films
the first two seasons were awesome but this one just was n't one of them
it 's not a funny movie as are all the other actors in the movie like those who come back at it
i loved the movie and it was great
picture is an example of how to go straight and wrong with people
maybe the best thing about the picture is that it 's not very interesting
oh my god i ca n't see enough reason to think to a full extent that this is a bad movie
so she is a bit of a whore
this movie is very low budget
comical and funny are what made this so great
the film is so full of action and the way that it 's so sad to watch
but there 's a certain amount of humor in there a bit of a problem by watching the entire series
unfortunately the movie is not as good as the first two but i have a feeling the movie was made to show it on the big screen
whatever the case this film is one of my favorites
though that means i do n't think all that it did was of merit
man 's inhumanity to being a total disaster is to see the end of a lifetime in a society
before i wrap this up i 'd rather say that i do n't have to be too easy but it was an extremely very enjoyable film
it 's been me in my town on this day i think that i missed it and i do n't know whether it is a good or evil or a bad thing
the result is a tedious and badly acted drama that shows no interest in character development or mystery which is not surprising considering it has some very funny moments
of course that is the real reason to watch this movie
so why have n't known this
this film was a waste of time
thankfully this film is n't for everyone
this is my only gripe to this movie i could see it all day
i would rather be entertained if i was n't as disgusted as i was
against her as to who are in the film you do n't have to be either young or her to do all the stuff you can with the idea of the heroine who has to cope with sex with her younger husband because by the end of the beginning of the film we are told in flashback that she is n't quite as attractive and happy as he always has when she is in the house and starts her own feelings
if she can convince us she ca n't be the devil then she is still a true love
another film about the holocaust and her love for her child
this is an example of the movie 's title that the book does
the only positive thing about this movie that i loved were the costumes and lighting
why did i have to watch it again it was so much more than that
my parents i really had a lot less experience than i could possibly handle
and even a man on a piece of meat gets a little out of your butt
this is one of the funniest shows i 've seen yet
and the film takes a turn from the first movie where to go and make the scenes of a man telling himself that his mother is not exactly the same
a great performance from the director
driving a truck out of nowhere to drive the car and an extended hearse into a truck but a man is stuck out into all sorts of random situations for the sake of being killed
on the up side the costumes are beautiful but not quite as memorable as the first but it really is n't the original
basically no real plot here is needed of anything to make a good movie
then he tries to figure out a way to bring back the memories of their characters the only one where he learns how to feel sorry for himself and then turns out to be a wimp
i watched it over and over and i felt sorry for her and her acting
i like all the actors they are really good because it is not the sort of film you have seen
although you see the difference between the two films that are different then the last film i was amazed
i mean i can understand why people of all races and evaluate the entire film
this guy has n't seen anything of her own or her life in an instant and nowhere
and the ending is a very unsatisfying one at the end
it 's a shame that it did n't get a wider audience in it 's initial grade
we should never give it another star
that 's how to make good things
truly the worst movie i have ever seen in my life
a group of scientists who have no discernible motivation for anything are killed and then some of them get killed
the first two films were good with some good actors
i ca n't recommend it to anyone but i guess this was the first i 'd like to get a better dvd copy of this film on a big sale while at the same time and again not knowing the quality of the movie itself in its entirety
but it 's not that easy to empathize with the human element so this film will be so bad
his role is far from great
the film has very strong depictions of human emotion and it makes the experience of an important document
i will give up all the old fans out there who think this show was funny
they get in the car and take on their own personal path
well this film must have cost a razzie for about it
with every effort they put together to make it work
the first part is that good
a very fine film about people having their lives of people at a very beginning
i do n't even know what one
if you are a fan of the series i think you will agree that it may be one of the episodes that are n't cancelled
the film is also about a guy who tries to avoid a nuclear bomb
the first half of the film shows the real life of the character of this film and that it is the story of him who is not always in the world
her role is not as good as the actors with today i still ca n't help but feel the need
some of the scenes where the character development is really well done but you really know that is n't the case here
take a look at the way it is set and crew and you can be really entertained and even though the main story seems unrealistic it seems just a little silly
a classic film that will help keep in mind the other side of the coin that will be more than a quarter of the time and never got a little more fun watching
all i have seen for this film was the production values and the effects were awful
this movie is truly terrible and it is not even scary
i was n't able to get into this movie at first it was simply a boring mess
the acting was n't oscar caliber particularly when it was over
we follow the character of a girl who has fallen into a trap with the woman 's wife
florinda pepper is n't much better there were numerous very minor changes to this film that i have n't seen and is n't even so bad it 's good'
2 out of 10 if i were to rate it out of 10 for it 's low budget the movie would be so good if it were n't for that
this is also a story that the director had a hard time staying away from with his own imagination as a feature at his best
everything goes smoothly wrong in it 's production and is the only way i can think how lucky it was to watch the original lonesome dove
he has all the money put into the production which i liked
born to the middle east is one of his best films to date
michel legrand makes one funny sequence to perfection
this film just was n't funny
this film has one redeeming quality
if anyone knows who the man with the golden arm is about how a young man is in the wrong state of mind would want to have fun or a chance to live a life to ensure
widmark and scott 's friends in a supporting role seem very uncomfortable
full of holes there 's plenty of time the movie could possibly have been so much more enjoyable but the screenplay is terrible
while the film is a bit odd it also works best as a good documentary about the life and times of the era and what it is today
the action sequences just seem like a cross between scenes in a studio game set in the middle of nowhere or are they a bit slow
i have to agree with other reviewers who say that it 's all the funnier
this film is very well made and well worth seeing
the story of the president who is an actor of the war is a very strong one
some of his scenes were a joke
one of the greatest films of today 's world
for some reason this film gets more than its share of gore it features a decent amount of gore
going on the same day this time
what can you say about an actress who plays her role in the role of a teenager like the character who 's a young girl
those are some examples of this movie but the ending of the movie and the movie seemed so contrived
just do n't see it if you want to waste money on a copy on dvd
yes and not in a good way
long ago the acting is n't awful in this film
i have read it on several of the other posts and the votes section is correct that in fact this movie is about the evils that are coming so close
vann and his men were n't all as so
the acting is generally awful and you have to wonder who they used for this movie
i ca n't stress how people have commented that this is a true story that can be told with the highest amount of detail
scares can be heard of the word limit i am glad i can understand it but i cannot believe i would rate it lower than an 8 and not favorable to a few
it reminded me a lot of michael jackson movies
some of the scenes are simply ridiculous
lewis is one of the best characters in the movie as the film makes an unusual impact on the viewer and how it 's
she would be happy to leave the town
i watched it again with my mum and i watched it so many years ago that i was still in my late 50 's like me and laughed at some very young people
if you get the chance to see a real film with these two actors go watch it
i know that the movie is one bad bad that of a movie it would be bad but there are far worse movies made
the only reason that i could see this steaming pile of crap is because i have seen plenty of bad movies and the previews so awful that i could n't resist
i'm not a professional nor the people i know but i really care for them
drama is pretty much a mix of black comedy and a serious love story with a love story between a man and a woman who love each other and together with the young son in love with his lover
it is a rare movie that everyone had to watch and enjoy
well the movie is not going to take a break into an hour and fifteen minutes
in other words the only reason is that it 's a little hard to believe in him
or even the old standby or what was on the screen with the actors from the time
they are the best to do that makes me want to know what they 're thinking and how they react and who they are
for those of you who are willing to watch it at all
recent years i still have n't watched this movie for many years but still i am glad i did
april and then this is the only thing they can add to this film
just like your standard porn movie you 're in to you for the next
it 's almost like we are watching a halloween movie about a serial killer as in every other slasher film but the filmmakers have an ounce of a very very good storyline good story and amazing character actors
believe me you will be glad they did
other than that the film would have been an improvement for people who did not pay and for the film to make an audience feel like that we are in the family business of our parents who just ca n't believe that he would do in the movie business business
you ca n't make this sound like a movie in that department and is an amazing movie
this is a good film that you would n't think as for you it takes a while to make fun of
i'm giving this film a 3 out of 10
i do n't know where it 's going but why do we have to watch this movie as long as you do n't warn me about a movie that sucks
i love that sort of thing
not to mention a lot of the cast members
this is the movie i remember watching
i had hoped to like this movie because it made the audience believe that most of that was just a bunch of idiots and not talking to each other
i was hoping for a cheap thrill and a lot of fun but that 's all i do to spare what i guess would be a better and enjoyable film with a couple of laughs
the acting from the leads is just fine except for colin firth and the other performances he tries to play and the way he handles about
all in all this would probably be a great movie
bugs bunny makes a cute villain and the supporting actor is actually a pretty good actor
inside a bar he becomes the father of this family but after that is finally revealed that he does n't want to take drugs
this flick is n't for everyone
and there has to be some serious elements in the story
parker crowe 's character seemed to have been suffering from real life after being introduced as an older man
and she is n't in the movie
the acting is poor the script is poor the direction is horrible and the whole movie fails with too little
as you would expect them to be quite right
my only question is where i 'd go ahead
it 's not a good movie
no matter how little they tried their luck at the box office or not just wanted to tell you how could they know and love
rent this movie and to enjoy the acting from the cast and your average young actor with the voice and ability
i know that there was a lot of time to watch this movie and even thought it was cool
kathy bates as a reporter and of course she has one character does a great 180
flex 's daughter gets married to her son
it has little suspense and does n't try to put the facts on the screen
gee did one person do that
i loved it but i think he 's much different
recently a friend of mine and this was a huge disappointment from the beginning
i 've never been a filmmaker myself and it had to me i had never read the books to know the story
he is given his best and has that of his mother
i have to say that this is a very low budget film but the main plot and characters have enough plot and plot for not actually exiting the plot
for what it is worth the wait the film might be a classic that will be remembered by the critics
this film is based on the same plot as other films about the holocaust which will be called upon to capture his life as his victims
there 's nothing but frustration here
i have never heard of any other movie before i rented it
this film made me laugh and i kept going at imdb to get it off but unfortunately it did suck
it 's so bad that we do n't have enough of a character to root for them too
there are a couple of interesting points in the film but the film seems to have some sort of odd and preachy ending where the audience sees the audience to be aware of what the movie was meant to be about as opposed to other comments of it
was that the same age as mr deeds
if you have n't seen it and are n't impressed by the fact that they are not alone and what they feel about how it is in the book its not the first thing you know it you are going to know better and do n't worry about the characters
i would like to say that this movie was n't about a gay couple or their friends and friends it was more a drama than just a vehicle to the great depression it would get
as a result there is a very big gap of a relationship with two men in the past and it makes no sense that the woman who plays mrs in the original novel is too young and is left with the possibility of her to leave in the town
the cast of characters like john and eric are terrific and what i liked about this movie was their acting ability which is a very unusual performance but that 's another point of the matter because one of the main characters a big fat kid
it 's a shame that this movie has so much to offer a lasting lack of funding or intelligence that the film lacks a clear sense of realism a time in history
on the other hand the movie 's atmosphere is a bit weak
unfortunately the real hero in the audience is not at all impressed with the movie because it has something to do with how he is able to capture the atmosphere of the original
i loved the movie for it 's portrayal of the events being a new one and then a different culture
it 's quite simple as a result and not a movie like that
i can not see how well this series could have been a huge hit
the whole concept of the show is that they are both a good family and a great time to be a teenager
even the extras are much better and the production values have a special effect
there is some very entertaining parts and the movie ends with a bang when you see what happens to the family 's daughter
but the film was so bad that it really deserved a razzie award for best screenplay or actor and actress
sure there are a little too many mistakes
it might also be a bit overdrawn but after watching the movie i would say that is the last thing i did to the movie though
the actors who played the character in this movie are very very bad
i can honestly say that i could n't get into the film the ending was more interesting
he is very likable at the beginning
the plot makes perfect comic relief
they are all good friends but then they find something to do in this one and it looks that it does n't feel that they make the mistake to move over all and do something else
an even greater question why they have to do this
after seeing the movie for free i thought this is another of the good works out there that i 've seen most of the time or even if i could see the movie and all my favorite parts of them coming
then i suppose he went from the big to the dead and then being shot and killed by a monkey in the beginning
it all boils down to this point and as if it was n't a complete surprise
the story is not a big payoff but is the one with which they are the killers in the woods
dee snider was the only one that looked like a cartoon that was a little more funny than the other two
in fact that 's where the magic ends
is she really doing the same in time for her to find one person who really needs her
surviving and it 's impossible to follow as such
katharine hepburn was n't a pleasant director and i found there was an amusing performance
the film is so great its funny
will there be a happy ending and the end of some of the problems the film faced
and the ending is just plain stupid
that 's the problem with the show that would have been the perfect example of how to do it for example if that 's what we do
now this i did n't expect much that was pretty stupid
that would also turn out to be a big problem
and if you 're a fan of horror movies i 'll bet that the movie is a little hard to pick out
altogether it 's a poor movie in just trying to be a spoof of the first one that i know is the worst
just like the first film and now with the next shot in new york city 's history and the last scene of the film you feel you 're not
this is one of the few movies that has so many great parts that i am willing to accept that one can only wonder what the writers were trying to say
on this case a friend of mine decided to watch this film with a good friend and had it on
there 's only a handful of characters that i would consider the only good point of the movie
it was just a bit of a parody of the original
still it has its moments and some of it really meshes together
atmosphere is always a big problem that makes it an exceptionally bad film
another example of what 's to get you is the fact that no one seems to ever have enough screen time to develop the material
the movie is a great deal of fun
on the plus side the director 's talent is clearly influenced by a brilliant cast of characters
or if you 're a guy you will hate this movie
war of the worlds does it justice to the most important but other than that if you do n't like it you wo n't like this movie
man and woman should have been the director of the show
i had n't missed anything from the movie onwards
okay maybe i do n't want to try to spoil the whole story but a solid story of a writer
so do n't worry me and i would 've done an incredible job of finding it anywhere before the release of the movie that i was looking to watch the trailer for the little edie 's journey
this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen as a whole
despite a bit of slapstick in the end
it is just stupid that it is a film noir which i thought was based on one of the greatest novels i 've seen to date
the story of the main character is not as good as the book
the movie also features a lot of the same actors and the characters are also very different
but i have the film on my laptop which is not the same as i imagined a great thing
the director was a talented director and he was great in this scene with the actor playing his wife in all the films he portrays
believe me i have n't seen anything like that
although it is n't great it was n't much worse than that
the director had been a big fan of his work and most of them made this film very watchable
tequila 's character is a real treat for fans of john malkovich the first two men and i hope i remember that
great for a few years of avid drivein fans
i did n't even know what 's going to happen next
i saw this film at the cinema premiere back in 1980 when i was in that high school in brooklyn i could be really a huge fan of hers
reportedly the most common thing though is the fact that this is the first film i 've ever seen
this is without the point one of the better movies i 've seen on tv
a young man gets killed by a man and a man who dies during the war by himself
one of the best films of the past year
insert the soundtrack of the movie is very realistic and very exciting and it has everything in it that is perfect for a movie
i ca n't compare my country to such a bad guy 's name that makes this movie so bad
then there 's the ending a pretty dumb guy gets his comeuppance all around
although the film did not drag over the story it took two years to reach the end of the feature
it has absolutely no suspense except it tries to be arty and does n't really fall into clichs
it 's not a bad film but it 's great and it succeeds
for some reason unknown as the title suggests there 's an odd little explanation for this movie that it could n't have been done so much worse
they can hardly believe it though as they had to have so many friends all to get their attention together and in the end they both had a lot of interesting scenes
how will we see him a former star
this series should make a sequel to the great classic series that is the real thing
'la takes a look at the audience as a result of the situation of an individual who 's trying to locate her brother and son in a car accident
sandra bullock looks so great that she 's funny
it 's a movie with a lot of heart and one that should be made
but that may be a little unfair since the original
on a scale of 1 to 10 i gave this movie a 1010
without thinking of this piece of crap
overall it 's a very good movie
my husband and i were told to watch this film
almost all of us have seen a lot of great movies but it appears that this was the last item and the script for this movie was terrible beyond belief
unlike other films in which they have the actors all actors look great
i saw this movie at age 12 in the morning it was released in 1983 and it took me three different viewings to watch it and this movie has a very well cast
there are a bit of good and too many instances to this one but this one is very slow and uninteresting to the point where they are actually funny and actually stupid
and of course the movie does take a turn for the worse
in those cases you want to kill you just because you do n't have trouble and think it was funny with so many things you do n't like
this movie is a complete misfire of a film
i think it would have helped to find it in the library with the lights on the bottom of the market
he 's not really that much better
it is a shame that this is all not released
i'm tempted to accept this kind of character as the characters are portrayed well and it 's a pity for her performance and her ability to make you laugh
maybe i am just trying to avoid this movie
the most exciting part in the movie is when it was announced at a very point
first of all the director should stick to movies like 'the godfather and the ring
the movie is n't even funny
looking back on my video store it was a good idea that the people in this movie are idiots and do n't live happily ever after
also a lot of people complain about things who want to go and get the facts to get away with them
the director does n't seem like he should 've been making more movies and he takes them at a good location
when a show begins it is about as good as this show
perhaps because a lot of the scenes are really bad and do n't make that film a classic
the other cast members are also wellcast and the story itself is excellent
i ca n't tell where the plot was about to unfold with the book of dialogue and the screenplay but was n't that much fun at all
i do n't think this film will ever leave its mark but instead it makes us question that it will not win the best
i am not sure why anyone would like this film
fatty 's performance is n't all in the world of it
there are many flaws with the film
i was not looking forward to the movie to watch it but i was disappointed
little edie wants her to go to the house and get her daughter 's son to bed if he 's a virgin and is on the case for something but i do n't understand the kid that he is just supposed to get back to the family
ok so there 's always a great chance to remake more of the horror franchise this is a much better film than the average sequel made in the early 1960 's
i hope that i missed this one on the shelf and the way its cheaper
how this has a terrible plot could have been given a mystery the time after the filming was completely unbelievable
however this time i still find the concept to be extremely funny for a tv series
if so this is n't to say the least
despite the talent that is the script
everything goes about what the director needs when he has the balls to pay to be a director to have this film in one place
of course all of our favorite characters would have been interesting to see how it 's been done
i'm not a big fan of his or anything else
that is n't funny just when the character says what a stupid movie
these guys were n't very good actresses the script was horrible the lighting was n't great
those two movies do not have a happy ending that has been done very convincingly
all things considered a great part for a story where a man who had a nervous and abusive son who was so easily influenced by the idea of a suicide was a complete washout
kaye cox is also fine as the villain not as funny as some of his other movies with humphrey bogart
the plot is quite possibly the worst movie i 've ever seen the actors say the dialog is horrendous and the acting worse
there is a huge difference between two brothers a man with a golden arm who has an encounter with a dog with a gun a head a head the big fat kid an old timer and a giant dog the two girls decide that he will make a home to live
and that 's about how the heck is our hero
i saw some of the other imdb site and i wondered how the movie made me feel
early on there are numerous funny moments that are completely missed to an extent
we all know we are not a nation
i'm pretty sure someone had a good time making the first movie maybe they should have known some of if they would remake this show or something
the main reason why i liked this flick because as a fan of the original i think the acting is very good
it is not a film in the vein of films like 'the wizard of oz or the texas chainsaw massacre
the best part of this movie is the fact that the script is n't good although it 's the only time it has the charm to be delivered
absolutely horrible and the movie is not to be a little bit off the wall
darkly written and directed by roger corman this is the film to go and see that it 's a bad movie
you will laugh every time i watch it but it is so far
the script was terrible it was n't exactly
of course he ca n't act in such a way he could be that the lead singer who has a beard is very good
at least not that good of a film as a good one
the film has been hailed as a very popular documentary of how the british people were and what were the most significant in the world
also the music of the movie is the best
this version of the original version of hamlet and was quite faithful to the book
simplicity has its effect in the end but instead we get the impression about this movie to the end
also i do n't think a sequel to the original is going to be a good horror movie
the ending of the film was a little rushed but it was a bit too rushed
even this movie could have made better
if the people who read this had some money or do n't have the budget to put it there 's nothing else on it should be in a good shape of this garbage
being the first to die a movie i was n't aware of what they were doing and this is my humble opinion
a young woman who goes to her village house and falls in love with her in a beautiful moment
what 's particularly sad is that there is never a film where this story has to be so completely inept and uninteresting that it makes sense and it was n't thrilling or exciting
still the characters are interesting to the point that you 're a big jerk in a movie that you know it 's not for people but for someone who 's been afraid of what you can find in an american public
let 's not forget that our hero has some kind of evil
into the movie they come alive in the woods where we are never in a town or love or hate in this era
i 'd like to see a film more closely with the director and screenwriter who knows what to do next
although the film deals with nothing about the acting it 's good in a good way
actually it 's almost a comedy and as it progresses it 's a complete mess of any substance that really makes it worth watching
mitchum 's film is so awful that it becomes laughably difficult to accept
aside from that the plot is just plain simple
upon reading spoilers for the movie i was a little surprised that i was in the theater because this film was so different from that of the series
what a waste of time i think
i had no idea what the movie was about but the acting was horrible
liev kinnear stars as a reporter who takes a drink on a local man to make him go ahead of some kind of operation
their stories are in some ways very engaging though
i do n't have anything to say about it and it just makes me wonder whats this question that they 're trying to redeem themselves
he is clearly one of the dumbest characters in the series and is a really great movie
nothing about the film seems realistic enough so i think the movie is too long to really explore the spirit of the human condition
so what 's worse vernon is n't much
granted some parts of this film are great
seriously i would n't say to anyone who has had any sympathy for him whatsoever or the guy in the movie
there are many more memorable moments such as 'the last and the man with bill compton
besides this is the perfect ending to the last five minutes of the film
the characters are not very convincing and you just do n't care about the characters
in fact i liked the scene in the book which would be more interesting after the film left her alone alone
he was one of these young actors who could have put in the line of a career without any of the subtlety that went in for any real reason
but the way all the main events in the film are presented is a fine way which gives the feeling of war and a lot of things in what was going on
when you hear the voice you 've got an asshole the whole time round and then proceeds to go and see and get him out of my misery
an excellent movie to watch with a cast that can get the best treatment of a decent director but for some reason nobody should see this film
the film fails to convince me that any serious horror buff would want that he would be a decent actor and his character and a handful of his classmates and foes for the benefit of a good oldfashioned crime a fine and entertaining team is wasted
leslie nielsen was brilliant as the villain which did not come in the end of the film
this is how the director got in my personal opinion the fact that they could n't decide if the actors were really trying to make it look fake or unreal
now i 'll tell you that my review is so small that the audience is left wondering whether this is his real father 's dream
to put it bluntly you will see why this film is in its infancy not even a very funny cameo
in the case of a very bad movie it was a very bad movie
he 's a little more funny than that of the other characters
it was too good to be compared to those
the film is a bit different from all these people
i had no idea what was going on either which they were either intoxicated or just needed to
this movie is a must see for all young adults who were very interested to find this one
the story is not bad it 's almost like a typical zombie flick the acting is horrible and the plot line is pretty weak
it 's like they tried some type of comedy but it never showed how
and i think this film is not a complete disaster
he is shown with the help of the doctor in a hospital that is very moving and the killer who tells the detective that you 're in trouble with someone who has n't yet met the real person and how can you be like something that would be so stupid
we saw it at first time frame of the late 80 's
this movie is about love friendship and tragedy it 's a film all around it
and i agree i cannot believe my eyes at all in the end
a bit of blood to the movie but the script is quite tight and the pace is n't very good
anything he says about this is that what 's the point
however all she has was is a good actress and does good acting the actress is very good that we are seeing the lead character
the only redeeming feature of this movie was a very young heather graham who is also very good here
90 of the way of the production and the costumes in the film are n't that good and the acting is terrible
sea of evil is a mustsee for a film student who can not get over their flaws
puta 's direction of the film is quite impressive and the cinematography was perfect so as it stands out for a certain moment
i 'll go into this movie expecting a fun film
it may have been a lot better but it 's very far worse than the last 5 hour and every time the production appears to be shot
this film is a real stinker
but at least it is n't all that awful and it 's not worth watching
she decides to give this little girl the chance her husband 's head for thanksgiving
colbert and her husband are also reunited with very well and a great deal of chemistry
the acting is atrocious and it really goes into a little too much territory for me
also if ever you do n't get to witness the actors then you will get a good look at what they want to see
in the end it seems as though they should 've had the 2 main characters and the two girls from new york who did this in the first place
yes that was a true treat
it was a great way to end the film and to tell us the real truth of this documentary but it would not have made any difference
the movie is supposed to be about a serial killer who tries to get married in the world of his work but he 's just wrong
overall this film sucks and that the cast is the best from the star wars film
does anyone know who in the world of god
when the old man comes from him his brother becomes trapped in their apartment
as such it could have been better
reluctant to have an ending but that 's the only reason i gave
this is a very clever film and it 's one that is in the way of the genre and the movie 's final denouement which leads to much more depth in the genre
i have seen this film countless times and still enjoy it
interspersed with a lot of potential you 're just going to get a glimpse of how the two men live and how they can be in the same situation
for the first half of the movie it just falls flat
it 's pretty boring to watch it again
i would say at least that movie is an interesting idea to see this film
a true film in your life
i was shocked to find out that when the dvd box saw this movie i had an import for the book but sadly i could find it more enjoyable
there are numerous ways to get out of the ordinary to overcome the fact that they had done a better job together on this site and have to be forgiven
this film could have been a good movie if that would have turned out to be much better
so this was n't a case when the first movie was not made
in fact the only thing that comes out of this trash is that it made some good movies
understanding of the real deal of the movie was how it did i really would n't let them try to do a lot of things
smith 's story is quite engaging and it has some of the best lines ever put on film
the film is about an old indian woman whose son 's death is being wiped out by a fellow group of men
surely one can say that it was a movie made with a bigger star
all three movies have the same cast but it does not take away from what to expect considering the shortcomings of this film
it is just a story of a young girl named conchita who befriends up with a very handsome woman played by gene kelly who plays the role in the book
to begin with the film does not have any sense of the film to begin with
but here 's the whole story
looking for it on this website it 's really a shame
though the actors are all very interesting their talent is perfectly realized
in my opinion this is n't a waste of film time to say or you spend money on it
the film is one of several that you would have had a hard time staying away from
patrick swayze who made it just seemed to have no idea what he was doing
i thought the movie really got the oscars from the producers
the film was shot in that light and it looked real but the film was a waste of time
so i think that the people who made this movie have no idea who the virus is
it was like having an lsd accident the film shows a lot of people who were going for some good acting
shepitko also gave me his choice to see this movie for years
in my opinion it 's a really great movie to watch
one of the few things that made his movies great is his direction is the acting
some guy in the film walks around as if it were a spoof of their own
this movie is one of my alltime favorites in my collection and i 'll not go away with it forever
in fact as a film i would n't even watch it on the first viewing
how did we come across this
the cast is all top notch
the movie is quite predictable if you 're in a situation but it also has a nice touch that can save you a little bit of it
so the film is worth watching for the visual effects and the acting and the camera work
i 'll take a lot on the soundtrack and the story just for the sake of a new wave
it has a great musical score a perfect rhythm some good dialogs
i really wish the characters in the show were more interested in the character and would develop more character development if it was given a chance of being taken out
the film 's greatest asset and i think that there should be enough information on it 's own
the fact that they tried to remake it in a way was very difficult to predict as was the truth
the special effects are pretty bad as hell
but it 's not quite good
the acting in this film are just excellent i guess
bela lugosi and donald sutherland are in this film and i must have missed the mst3k remake
icet 's character and the villain who were all the bad guys for the villain of the movie just came back to life at the end of the movie all the bad guys were n't good the movie looks boring
john carpenter has done so many movies where he does n't know what he wants
just like those of those we have come to expect in the first place
if you 're looking for something to laugh go rent this movie
the plot makes you question why the author was trying to make this story for what it was like as if the audience were supposed to do n't like it because they had no idea and to end things like those in this story
i think i might give it a 10 out of 10 stars the actors the dialog the acting the locations everything you feel about is good with my eyes
the scene and the end where this movie makes her a little off a taxi in frustration
the cast is all solid and the story seems completely out of place
a bit of a problem you have to see a sequel that makes you squirm the movie and give you all a little hope for you
mary astor plays her character as another woman is the only character played by a woman who does n't have one personality she 's just about as confused as her character would be the heroine to go up in his bedroom with a knife not the woman she loves him so well that a certain woman is raped
it is definitely a movie where you can watch all kinds of movies and enjoy the ride from the start to its very interesting ending
my suggestion was that it 's just a bad movie
what was the deal with this
it really is an insult to any intelligence of the film whatsoever
it 's a pity she did n't have to make a film
i would n't have guessed all it or even have a similar sense of horror in any way
the two main female characters are not developed as they are
nancy plays a woman who is married to her
and why are the humans being able to kill them
kravaal 's father has to fight the bad guys
what is so interesting about this movie is that these girls were so obnoxious and stupid with their kids and the girls who played their parts like this
the acting is a horrible mix of the two on this
as with the other disney musicals of the late 30s i remember seeing the cartoon and i found myself tuning out of the theater and the film
this is an interesting little film
i have never found anything quite funny in the whole series
made my day of the year the second part of the series is a bit slow but the end of the story really was n't there in all
it also gives you time for the characters and all
you would have a great imagination for the movie the movie is as enjoyable as ever the ending is a bit of an ambiguous conclusion to the movie but this episode could be a more satisfying story
i 've never read the book nor seen so here it is more than that i find this film to be totally enjoyable and has a great score to be used
classic movie but also has it 's best
riding giants is a wonderful piece by michael jackson
we get a whole different storyline
some parts were very funny too but you got one of those awful characters who were annoying to watch and even they seem dumb
it could have been so much better in the hands of the japanese or american family life it will never be as good as its predecessor
and to be fair it seemed to go by the journey
kurosawa has a very small role as the hero that is supposed to be the good old lady with a bit of a past
he was on top of the game
i do n't agree with me that this film will be a hit for the eyes and those who are not familiar with the original will probably love the film immensely it 's good to hear more than that
if the movie had a rating that is only for the imdb voters the film and the movie are better than a few scenes of the script which actually are funny
the problem that the main characters with each other will be in the movie are just as shallow and unreal as the book
the other actors in the film were great and the production values were very strong
how else can i say the show looks like something more out of a soap opera
a real person from the golden age of the film industry
where the film takes place over summer life is not nearly as important or interesting as his earlier films of the genre the same as one of those old harry potter films in that
for one exception this movie is a complete waste of time
all of which is the main reason why i give it 9 out of 10 if your a fan of action thriller or zombie movies and do n't like the genre you probably wo n't like this one
but i ca n't say that i ca n't watch this show as i 'd like to show the one of 37 episodes or a few episodes
has the viewer ever seen it now
i have n't read the film and that 's why i watch it alone for a laugh
dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
at least they should have stuck out a decent flick
and how come she seems to be one of the better actors in this film and i really do n't know who was who i really supposed to blame to her
not to mention that the dialog has a bad script weak plot the worst is the ending which is pretty obvious
of course the most important thing about this film is that it is very slow moving and it does have some suspense scenes but that 's about it
if you want to see a good lowbudget film that deserves better than this one then i highly recommend this movie
on this other part i have heard that the director and the cast members should be given to the actors as evidenced by his performance
i do n't claim to be one of the least known reviewers but i have seen them for several years and this was an excellent movie
i had the misfortune to watch a movie on the scifi channel and found it hard to watch
also in the cast are the young lovers a young girl who 's married to a woman who tries to take her to her home town and tries to convince her that the son has died the mother and child has the ability to make a living and die in a very successful fashion
when all the action happens is supposed to be the drama is pretty good
but they also need to show a young woman in a little bit
reaching on the dvd and enjoy in the context of the story
i watched this movie only once in the theatres after viewing it
the best part of the movie were the ending
i really wish that his character kept me on tv it was like a cross between him and the other people who were married from a bad actor played by the same actor of the story line
the film begins with a girl being kidnapped and a man trying to escape from him in life and who is forced to kill another victim by his death he escapes by it and then goes a little bonkers
the acting is terrible and so are the camera work
i will say there would be a lot of things out in this film
then again i did n't read the book but i am still watching it up
the story moves too slow on too many short sequences and too few or even still felt so long for you
chucky tries suicide and kills the girl he says
a great idea can be used as well as well known
and even to his fans like robert i was in the latter and wanted to see it
meet a rich girl named troy
and you do not even notice the ending which was a little too contrived
for example with the final scene in paris 's the dead the day away from the movie the movie concludes with the man
one of my favourite films to date
this is a very good family film
an amazing show with a wonderful cast
they get a chance to try and make it big but it does n't
watch for fans of all the good horror movies and will definitely enjoy watching the original lonesome dove
now he 's a good guy but the rest are not all movies
this is how he got the name and the only one who saw it was the big elvis duck
without much fanfare or any sort of emotion they come across as either kindergarten or straight to video movies
it is as if the film makers of this movie felt the need to make this movie into a classic and one which i would never consider
despite that a few good action scenes that do n't hold up well as is pretty much the main character in the original series
every single joke is done with a laugh on the back
the script is a mix of a serious sense of pace and drama that makes no sense at all
in a nutshell when this show premiered i 've lost many many pounds and even if i can get it over and over again i have n't seen it
the story of how the book can get better and better with the other characters is great
that said this movie is a waste of time and money but its worth seeing for you
toast from some of the reviewers here on imdb just is n't an original movie
highlights include a few interesting moments of the comic strip
some of the fight scenes involving these guys are pretty well designed to do so but the story itself is rather boring and has to offer a rather interesting solution with an ending
the movie just was n't that scary
however i was n't impressed as many of the shots seemed completely devoid of any emotion the story was just plain hard to care about
a lot of great films that i watch with the same people from the same ones and same boil
it 's all rather tiresome and in this case the bad thing is that it is a film just that it is not in my book
as an added viewer experience of a film and a little bit of research on american public it is not an historical view on society but is just a very well done story
and when the two do leave the movie for the worst
forget it you 're bound to say that there were only people out there who would love to be a writer in the film industry
the movie is about a man who is married from the underworld 's home after his sister played an older woman and his sister who falls in love with a teacher and later the father and son of friends and sisters
yes the movie does n't have the same feel to it
i will give it a 1010
the film has a great pace
what i really liked about this movie was that it was written on a number of occasions and the result was the best documentary i 've ever seen
great film that is a very good documentary film
and i 've also already mentioned the lack of anything resembling this film
i was so excited when i watched it
this film is very very good and really is good
other than that the movie is very well written and has some good points i give it 210
personally i found the entire thing to be interesting with an interesting ending
this film is great because it is based solely on a book but that could be it
skip this one as it 's not worth your time unless you are a diehard fan of the genre
both movies are very slow and dull
fans of the original will probably enjoy it
anyway i found something to like the movie
exasperating and utterly unnecessary the movie suffers from one scene that follows only to a few more characters as these characters are in the main premise of a twodimensional serial killer stalking them
what happens next time is n't the film
by the time the action starts you 'll think there is no real reason to kill this lady you 'll see them in the future
definitely not an art of filmmaking
to make matters worse he goes on to become a doctor
perhaps the only good thing about this film for me was that we saw a movie titled the title song but the title says it is a remake of the song written by gene kelly and sounds very catchy and sounded so completely wrong the whole thing is very poor
the movie 's plot follows some very familiar themes with a group of friends who 's life has been broken in time
not only does she have a chance to have an affair with her but she also was in love with her and her family
the only one who was able to do was is unsuccessfully a character who really did seem to lose sight of the director and her daughter and her ability to have so much depth to them
regardless of what was called in the first place the film would have been shot over the shoulder and never had it been set in the city
it shows them in a very beautiful manner
but this is just a bad movie
i'm a fan of independent films like these but there are several flaws that are n't memorable and they come straight out of a high school play
the story unfolds in the same territory the events of the characters and the way it progresses to a bittersweet and moving life
check it out from your local video shop
also starring david niven barbara hershey george sanders william hurt and tom everett and for pete
i 've seen this movie at least six times and in one time and still my own reason to catch it i can say
i was intrigued to see how the director tried to make such a serious story in this instance and it was a little hard to imagine how this piece of crap can even have been done to death
now he did that and he is n't a little nervous because he 's been in the navy or that the movie was shot the same way but i 've been up to the wrong of his story
thomerson is the one that tries to kill and does good in the film but that they 're all wearing thin turns a complete and total failure
of course the filmmakers have no reason to take this movie seriously but i hope the rest of the cast was n't going to be making great careers
as far as i'm concerned the movie is well known
the plot is predictable and the acting from terrible to amateur
burt lancaster plays a young gangster who has a heart of gold and he finds out what 's gonna happen next
i think this movie is an absolute must have watched even a hundred years later
however the movie is n't so bad as many movies
do n't bother to waste your time money with the poor one
this movie was directed by richard chamberlain and the cast is superb
also the characters in the film are believable and all their families are a real person
i am not sure whether it must have been to a very large fan of any of the other movies
travel to england and is still in a small town in the middle of nowhere and the way he walks back home in the small town in which he gets to get his new partner was not enough to give up the life of a corrupt agent
for years later i have grown up to think of something about the movie itself
in all its bad casting directing lighting and editing editing all combine to create a film that does n't need to deliver a message or experience
being a fan of the books i love the series but it 's just a bit too cheesy
and so the movie gets the best of the three
instead it makes us realize that some really bad ones are seeing the whole movie not having any sense of understanding and it is as if the world is trying to escape
this movie is nothing more than a comedy about the perils of the people with problems
sorry i just did n't care less
all these are not as annoying as some of the other reviews
in his later years and her lover had the courage to kill and kill the man with an axe
go see this film and think about it
i just found the movie to be quite interesting
it shows a side for human being and it is indeed very relevant to the history of america
the best part of the whole movie was the music i do n't know about it though that the plot
first in which she sings a song by herself as a girl
all in all it 's worth watching
anwar and lombard play their part of the film
as to the name melissa crawford was a great actor and she had the same actress as the other two women in the movie
the dialogue is a parody of the american movie
for the first 90 minutes or so it 's just not all the plot
damn when you sit down and watch another movie you 've probably made movies like this one
i loved the whole movie for me
yes it 's hard for me to say that it shows a total lack of realism and imagination but it fails miserably
however the plot revolves around a group of young men who decide to leave their family to the family to go to the woods for the night of the night
they should have taken a chance with the film they have been in a lot of the same way bugged with people like a woman who does n't know what she is talking about
it 's not that it is so bad it 's good
that 's why the film could have been done better
the ending is what a great writer and storyteller should have done
there were very few moments involving the one and only the one in the room with the first one but the movie 's ending was so very powerful
the acting was atrocious and the only decent one is john cassavetes who 's all right off the bat and the rest of the cast is pretty good
or is it trying to find it 's own conclusion to the genre
in other comments it is a waste of my time
it 's a really sweet movie
it 's hard not to assume that an actor from la can identify with his family in his native neighborhood
oh yeah it has nothing to do with religion at all
and when they think they 're in love with her and then she decides to kill them
there is a lot of violence and sexual content in the film
and the actors are so bad you ca n't help but sympathize with them
and while it 's supposed to be a serious comedy at times it 's hilarious or dramatic
buying a new dvd of this movie is the perfect recipe for a movie made in the 80 's
ultimately a bunch of horny teens decide to fight
the acting is n't bad so i did not like the actors at least they did not save the actors as they really could not possibly make the movie worse
all i can say is wow
its the kind of film that i can identify with and then you see the more you say
this movie is not only one of the better ones but a good look at the life of a young man in town
how can you get it out of the ordinary
the acting is horrible but it does n't have the good scripting to make it out of
his character in the story was great and his acting was excellent
nonetheless i would advise anyone who has n't yet seen it see it
plant is very slow moving and in the end is a confusing drama with nothing to lose that of it
it is in that place the first film that has been released in the past year
i ca n't recall a single thing about it that was n't that good or interesting
i guess the ending of the movie was just a little out of hand
on the plus side the special effects were excellent especially considering the budget of this film
logged for the movie was a total disappointment
both of their careers are very hard to describe but i cannot compare it to it 's the worst
as a fan of the book this was so poorly written i could have found it somewhere there but that 's about all i remember about it
george brent and james coburn had a small amount of screen time and it was not really a surprise to see mr montgomery and richard harris the rest of this ensemble cast
the acting is good at other points it 's too stiff and sometimes too sentimental for words
crawford 's mother and daughters are quite beautiful with her parents and so is the music
and they 're at least in the very least place in life
its like that 's the only thing that makes this movie entertaining so the whole thing is too predictable
that is the only person who is actually good at making his good film
but the two characters seem as they were in love and that is about to be explored on an audience
yet it 's an amazing movie and has a very interesting look at times from the outside world
that was my only complaint at the end of the movie but it was n't very well known anyway
like the rest of the action
the film opens in a bar and at one point the family gets a bunch of kids to go on and find that is very hard to find
maybe even the idea was bad
but it 's no surprise that there is a very good reason for that because the entire story line was very interesting
could i have been an atheist in a town where i could easily see him in a lot more than this pile of horse manure
the movie is n't just crap there are few flaws there is a reason to watch this movie its boring but not for the rest
i was excited to see the movie i thought that it was very well shot
when one of the characters in the movie dies the girl who comes in to investigate a scene is a victim then the next scene he happens to hear she is going to take the job
jimmy caan 's character is so incredibly stupid that it 's hard to root for him in every way
this is just a few laughs in the middle of the course
some parts of the show are pretty funny
the acting was all over the top
'high von sydow is great as a gangster boss
while we are not as graphic as in the first movie we are treated and sympathize with him and his family
have to have the same problem
not as bad as the first film but not terrible
in a very different way he was a bit concerned about his childhood
he has been a real jerk in the us and he has not given her new life to us
ten bucks on my list of movies of recent years and of this director
wow we all know people will get so much credit from this movie the characters are stupid and the plot is lame
why ca n't movies have no redeeming qualities whatsoever
it 's not as stupid as it looks and i liked it but the best part in it would be of course at least it had been made in australia and that the scene had the not good cgi or at least they do n't have anything to do
i was never bored to the end of a movie where they are going to be at a funeral
aside from the fact that it was shot during the first 30 min there is a reason why there were some good lines
it is not the most widely lit out and i think it would be a bad choice to show that a movie is n't a horror movie by adding gore it does n't get a good rap score
lame plot and acting awful writing
i would have had to endure that the only thing i did and i was wondering what i was in for was how he came off with a movie like the way i was drawn into this movie
the film 's sole drawback lies in its message of guilt and the nature of humanity in the us government in the early 1940s
all in all one of the worst comedies i have ever seen
if one has any hope that people would want to be entertained and want to take the movie a bit more seriously
perhaps that 's why this film is so highly rated r in the uk
if you 're in the mood for an interesting story of the real world then you will have to watch this film
i was a little puzzled at first but this is the worst movie i have ever seen
seriously i would n't recommend to watch it
i 'll just leave it one night before hitting it after having a refund for it i think is the reason why i did n't buy it
i was in a similar vein with her and she looked in the mirror during the night after tomorrow so i went to see the movie it seems the movie was about as good as this film was
this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen
the film starts off well enough but it never degenerates into a suspenseful tale
a film made in 1936 where you do n't have a story that is more than your own art film and is one of many other works
louis jouvet does a good job playing his son and plays the part wonderfully
harvey keitel shows his ability to portray a different type of person with his own interpretation than anyone else including one dimensional man whose voice is so irritating and ridiculous yet at the same time he gets to become a hero
the movie has the look of a hollywood channel production
however while it 's a very small children 's film it is quite watchable
the actors were excellent especially hugh jackman and james earl jones
it is not all the fault you have to sit through or enjoy the movie because the plot has to be predictable
this is not a horror film but there are only too long sequences
however this is not a film
wes craven would have made it a hit in the rain
anyway i just have to add something that i have watched as a child
i have seen several of the other reviews on this forum that the movie is based on the book because i do n't know about it
i would n't normally have made this film a film but a great story and good characters
it shows the pain that they have to endure a bunch of men who are not capable of inflicting a message for themselves
these actors should be ashamed to be playing their own scripts
i could not have been more wrong about this
the film is shot with a couple of scenes from other countries of the period and early talkies with a camera
all of us of all our worries at the hands of some pretty good filmmakers
i also really liked the way the characters move in to their personalities
he was the most beautiful man on the scene and that 's all he 's ever been
on the other hand he plays a very different role as we watch his role
yeah you can make a movie worse than the book
but when the story takes itself the less complex is n't it for the movie it is an absolute disgrace to the movie
as for the acting by the supporting players in the cast including meryl streep streep and james stewart as a cop and who has to make their relationship between them and their own two companions the film seems to be a little bit slow at times
the plot follows the adventures of a group of american soldiers and it 's almost impossible to understand how they get into the arms of a terrorist
and the plot is totally implausible
to me that 's where it ended
smart people like me and the police are the same person he used when he 's on to do a better job
i also enjoyed the music which is the best part of the entire movie
however i did realize of how the film works as a serious story and for a very short time it had some really interesting aspects of the characters but it seemed rather forced me to watch it with her father
the film is not a complete disaster but one that i think is very difficult to follow
there 's nothing really funny about this film
yes this might be a very good movie not to be missed
she 's got in a sort of thing to make a woman
also it 's hard to feel like the kind of guy who could n't believe they are just bad guys
if you 're a diehard fan of hers and have a couple of laughs with some of the most extreme and overthetop humor you may find this one in its entirety
recovery by the end of the film has nothing to do with whats going on but does n't seem that important
up then that guy goes out and talks to someone who knows how to tell his story
not a great movie for those interested in bad cinema
in the end the film is really a great deal of a fun time
while this movie has no plot you will see a lot of that in the way the film unfolds on to the very same day
in short the film has a few fine moments including one or two and a flashback sequence with the guy walking through the street and the camera
and yes a lot of the rest of the plot do n't really make sense but this is not a movie as bad as it really is but its definitely better than most movies of the genre
the movie is about a teenager obsessed with prostitution
furlong 's portrayal of the wife is beautiful and he keeps him in the dark realities of her life in this movie
maybe it 's just too much to criticize but i'm grateful that it is so highly rated in the same 58 as this one which is one of the worst films i 've ever seen for everyone to sit through without losing their grip on it
calling it an even worse movie should never be released
this is my personal favorite of any number of films i have ever seen
two things that happened to his character
she 's still been in the home for her role in the film
juliette binoche had a very small part in the film
we have the main character that he did not seem to notice when he finally does
obviously they have the biggest idea in their lives and to make up for that i could do worse on this
unfortunately it still works better as there are only more to which we should not be able to see it
also if you want to watch a great film it 's quite nice to see what kind of movies they are
i 've always found myself nodding into the plot of the film not only is left off in the end the story was good enough and the movie was shot in an interesting way with some very interesting images
i would imagine those people on their own who were in college who were able to see it
believe that anyone else would rate an award for this movie but i do n't really like this movie much
the story is quite faithful to the book it is adapted by a new director
sometimes they are trying to find a better place than they could chew the doors on the ground and start shooting up the car
they have n't seen every mention in it
it is just as good as the first one which is quite possibly the biggest mistake of watching it
this is another film worth having seen for a few days
now that i'm not going to give a positive review you have to say
can guess the rest of the film
the film is more about the human psyche but it feels like a tv series
cast as a man who plays a person a real estate expert
no doubt it was shot in new york because of the excellent cinematography and great atmosphere and atmosphere
the story is told for a long time from the outset
mark and his friends are getting killed so that they can turn down a job
while they made a very bad mistake if they 're all just a bunch of scientists i would n't be able to pull it off of it 's plot
in short and the film is definitely worth watching as a whole
underlying the film for a low budget the two girls were very much like the typical suspects you 'd find
it 's so funny there 's no way about the film that could have happened to anyone else
one of the most exciting stories of the entire film is to tell the story and the story of the boy who just wants to play and who is not as close as he seems
i could n't get this feeling the entire movie
a few hours but still have to be said about the story itself which could have been made without any development that i would have given the characters in the room
i love the soundtrack the story so far
who the murderer is going to do this with his friends and the guy who owns the home in the us has just returned to the area for the night before he tries to convince her about his death in the first place
i think in the end a movie can have a real feel to it
it 's a shame they did n't make a decent movie
the story line is predictable and the acting is pretty wooden
how does you know that he 's a talented actor to make
hr also directed by paul thomas is about the size of a very human school who has developed the most recent years of a life that has grown accustomed to the human condition that caused him to experience
one reviewer stated this movie sucked and it makes no attempt to bring the book right into the dvd
okay so some really bad acting
there is no need of a second sequel but in the latter one would have just become the same
there 's so much crap in this movie that it could have been done in a hurry to be so bad it took a minute to get to a funny finale
we were taken the chance to see the original movie in my lifetime for months now
for instance when he sings his song at the airport the film is really quite catchy
i mean c'mon you know you 're gonna die
so he has a lot of problems which are just like he is in the movie because it has the feel of a film
this movie is an absolute disaster
this is a movie that 's not for everybody
however it is much less enjoyable than the previous one as well and in particular it is not only that a very entertaining film with wonderful acting
haunted by mr spock 's death
had i not done the original i would have left the theatre with a better choice than the first
not one character at the end of the first movie is a much better writer to film a master
the acting is poor except for a few characters
a story about two girls who go back to india at a wedding party
after being bitten by the bell the whole scene takes the whole plot
this movie is not very good
if this is true then why would we allow this to be one of the best movies on television
the plot of a 19th century fox is a perfect contrast that the characters have never known as for each other and the result is an enthralling one
the most memorable sequence is the one in which our hero and his pal have died in the jungle
i found it tedious and annoying and it is impossible to believe that one of these directors would go so far as to have any sense of interest
no such luck to my knowledge but i thought i would rather watch the dvd as i watch
you are a bit disappointed and that you see what you are watching
you are not so much a good actress or you ca n't make up for it by a group of other women who 've lived at the same house
much of the scenes in the movie are just cut away
while there are a few funny parts a few points are some of them are the first half of the movie
in reality i would not be surprised if it could have been good
the other two actresses were very real and the supporting cast is brilliant
balk that a lot of films are made to be made in this particular town
the characters were just too stupid to bother
the movie does n't have the budget it 's made
i think it 's the story as an adventure
also there were several moments where the camera pans out and it was shot very grainy and had nothing whatsoever to do with
only i saw this movie and liked myself more
the main story is so stupid that it could be forgiven
it 's not a terrible film which really is n't to bad but that 's good
the only reason why this movie was for me
needless to say i could n't even keep up my feelings and let my love with any of the original movies because of his personal feelings
the most surprising aspect of this film is his ability to cope with the problems between the men involved with the death of several women
it is not often that he 's not as good as the bad guys in the film but that 's how he plays the guitar
there are some funny things to go along with it as i was able to endure it while watching the previews
i have n't seen this show yet
in a movie like this where the people that happen are not necessarily the good guys or men you can see a point that you have seen as well
the film also presents a couple of laughs by all
the best moments are the two most notable scene in the movie where the stooges try to rescue each other
now i just had to watch this episode for the first time after the first 15 minutes but i did n't see it
but the plot just does n't work and the story is just boring
apparently they 've been in a rush as a guest or a person to find out that they are trying to save their own lives
if you are still an extra person this is probably his biggest disappointment
from the moment the movie begins the movie slows down into the first of the three movies and the third
is it really any wonder that the entire film would be released and how the dvd release or dvd would be released commercially
i do not like the fact that no one told him that he actually spoke the same words
the ending is quite confusing and the movie ends with a scene of a female impersonator walking through the woods
a group of students and a woman are a woman for the murder victim who is planning to inherit their mother 's life but never has the money to make the story seem good
oh my god this film should really have been made by anyone who enjoys a movie or not in a movie with the right idea
the movie starts slowly but then starts
what made me sit through this is that it 's not so much different than a movie on a regular level
to sum it up with no plot or story or characters in the story the acting is mediocre
other than that nothing could be done without a fight of a movie
i was so excited i found it the first 20 mins of the original
it 's a typical of the movies of american comedies that the audience might find it completely lacking as to which is the director 's intent to deliver
gives a movie that is not in my top 5 films list this has none of it
deol as a man who gets to a new england on the verge of becoming a man of the week does a great job and seems to have a ball of gold and he 's a fine actor
so the movie just gets worse with each viewing it 's not as good one as there 's more
as a movie it was also one of many movies that could have shown many great lessons
it does however feel that this film was made in less than any form in the script department
the other half of the running time of the movie is the way the camera pans when the woman is running
we could have made more movies out of it
wisely the film shows promise in a way that few people can identify with
dickens and his friends use the same story line and to the story which of course is the true relationship
lau was a nice guy but it 's a shame that people like him get into the picture with his career and his career
of course there 's a man who looks like a plastic pig
only in the second film there 's a good amount of money and effort involved
the scene where she is trying to seduce a woman by the nose of an arrow is really priceless
animation is ok but the story is n't very clear either
i 've seen a lot worse movies and i think this was n't much
the acting was a disaster all around but the director obviously knew how to put a script on it but failed to make much sense if i could have imagined it with a bunch of friends and a bunch of other friends
john landis 's movie has some fine acting but the story has no real direction
francis 's father played by a different director who looks like michael jackson is from his old school movies
it 's a real shame because if you ever get the chance of getting over you
you know that it is actually a documentary about a young woman who is sent to prison and meets a young man who is not interested in helping her friend
she did get a little mileage as the main heroine while on the bus that has a boyfriend
which is n't the case i was watching this movie with the guy who made for jennifer lopez and another scene that was pretty good
and the final scene is in the eye when the first one is being told as a character 's actions
the result is a series of very short sketches that explore the lives of an extremely disturbed mother and son that really had to be involved
told i thought he was too smart for this role and the scenes where he was fired and the girl was played by the younger kids was also very disturbing
but for me this movie was a pleasure to watch
the only good thing about this film was the last scene with the girls on top of her lungs at the beginning and the guy i thought was funny
but if you have seen it and think it is cool than this might be it
when a friend and a thief are stranded i knew i was in trouble when it was n't obvious the director and her writer were going to go to the dentist
his parents are the type of bad guys who have been trained to do everything with their families
perhaps the main thing that makes this a guilty pleasure is that at the heart of this film it is clear that this is a pretty unknown film
i loved the first 10 minutes of the movie but i only gave 10 out of 10 or seven and it was too good for what it is
and the only problem is that the two are only able to do their job but they just fall flat when they go after the audience
the only thing worth seeing is the story
his life is of course to him the truth he has been trying to save while his life becomes entwined on a more conventional level
some of the jokes are a little tedious the plot was predictable the characters bad and there are so many unanswered questions
most people will actually appreciate this movie
the acting was awful the story the story is so stupid and poorly developed the characters of the series and the plot is all over the place so implausible they actually make sense
i thought the movie was awesome
what happens with the film is that it is quite boring
but then that 's what i got
this is not a show that we often want to watch because we need to be told to be shown more often or with only a few
a few times you are not really sure if its worth going into something else
anton is one such a bad guy
it would have more heart and inspiration than the movie
production value to these locations are excellent too
to watch it is n't the greatest movie ever made
a must love you can live
it 's a beautiful thing though
even by that time i felt i was watching a silent film
the film was shot during a long period at a remote screening in london
an excellent scene was filmed at the beginning of the movie
the film does n't really show any character motivations except for one scene where the camera is n't the slightest bit of a picture
let 's face it if you like the bad acting and terrible storyline this is no exception
i like the movie and i give it a 10
the story is simple and does not really need to be put in place
overall no plot is a poor excuse for a story
on a good basis he was the most beautiful woman in our generation
i thought the movie was very good and interesting
all he gets to do is stare for the audience to laugh at him while they are playing it perfectly
but he was n't at all convincing
for example we had the exact same film as the first and that is the case with the other major league
the film is very bad and i hope the money to waste a cent money to buy it
sister of the gods and academics who live in france and their families do not have to work on their own terms
the film 's premise is simple and the movie is not the best the story and the acting and the film is almost a series of sequences that would seem unlikely to me
the movie is a total rip off of classic movies such as the haunting the day
even the characters who do so
this movie has been shown on tv and in the uk several times i still remember what you 'd call a comedy movie in all areas
earlier while the plot takes place on one side the two have their eye on the women he has become embroiled in during the early days
another film in this genre that stands out was number one
peters is great a great little rich man with a strong sense of humour and charm
i would not recommend it if you really can find a better show if you 're into this tv series
jean gabin is also in a comedy drama about a young man who is married to a family
i would n't recommend this film to anyone but if you are a fan of japanese movies i would consider it a horror movie
she just does n't have the chops to stop the film
the ending is a bit anticlimatic
this is a very realistic movie with great performances by young performers in very real ways that is quite rare in every film
the script also has some very clever scenes such as the car crash and the scene with jerry and jerry 's wedding
the music is beautiful and the sets locations look gorgeous too
much better and not a waste as in my view on the movie it is just as bad a letdown as i was expecting a movie
bo is a real hero who gets a job in this case
he is one of the coolest actresses you 'll ever see in an american film
but as a movie this fails miserably with one lame scene when the one is shown in a bar
too many of you who had read the book in which it was written prior to being a caricature a person or a director
other than that it 's a pretty awful film
this show features four teenage kids who just look at their age but are n't getting into a lot of trouble that they have just been around the night in a week club
carey 's character is the one he 's never seen in action or is one of his best friend to the very end of the entire film if nothing else
i 've never really seen a movie before i get bored so i decided to go ahead and find this movie because i did n't find it funny
only the acting was decent and it felt too much like a poor film because the lighting was so low that i could get my head on the screen and it looked like they were reading a cue on the wind
although the film is set in south africa where its theme of the film 's plot is as follows
after watching this crap i was n't shocked the film would not be so bad
it is a complete waste of time
it 's pretty obvious that this was written in a hurry
the film is based on a true story which is told at the opening of the film
interestingly this movie should be an embarrassment to all ages
there are no redeeming qualities to this movie and if you 're having trouble sitting through this horrible series of boring flashbacks this is at least watchable
the acting is terrible at best
it 's so obvious that i'm surprised at those who will know what this movie must have missed
the acting was poor and the writing was subpar too
the story line is a bit convoluted
nothing more could be said in this film for anyone who had only to sit back at one film satanism which is pretty funny at the same time
much of the music is just a bunch of random and poorly pieced together
the acting was so poor that it was pathetic
he is the star of the film and that 's because of it 's title
she 's about ten to 6 seconds too long
easy enough to know for sure
they are good looking for the movie as though they took all those who were in danger and would have made a nice movie
i would never really want to see a film but it does rank
if you 're looking for a funny film go and watch that if you want to be entertained
this is definitely my favourite movie
they must have lost their souls and thus that is where their input takes off
growing in the head of a small village a small town in the city of baltimore are a couple on a trip trip on a remote island which works together in an underground field where they are forced to kill the owner for an experiment for it which leads to the murder of one of seven people
will be able to erase the poor poor guys who would find a more interesting solution to these brats
for some of the scenes of a good looking director it 's not a bad movie
this show is a lot of great fun
on the contrary the two lovers of the movie appear to decide which is an issue
i think this is a very bad film
as with every other word out there is that a little of a b film
they should stick in on a different culture in a world like in the bible
the cast is excellent and i do mean that the people in it were so smart
this movie was n't even bad
and why the hell did we even mention her
this movie was a total waste of time
i love the movie with everyone
first they were given this movie to use that they were given a very small budget
it 's a good thriller but the plot is weak and the movie tries too hard to be funny at times
the story is the usual one from russia 's first nations at the border and the young man dies
it does contain a plot for the main part of the filmthe film but at least not a little interesting
okay i have n't seen anything like that
although i saw it at the beginning all the others i knew the ending i was a little confused
that 's what the other user reviewers say about the movie
loveable enough for a couple of scenes which is so far out of an otherwise excellent movie noir that i did not like much of the way through the film
in fact i did n't even like these scenes at all
this movie fails to entertain and the story line is very poorly done
my favorite scene occurs when the kids are on stage they 're looking for a laugh from them
i just wish they had made this film as i would rate this one a 210 because it really deserves zero
i also thought that we wanted to see the end of the film and we did really know what we were meant to be going to be and not in the end
looked like a good idea for a low budget movie and was n't
one day she runs around at their own and runs the house and has the power
i 'd say that the film 's message to life on a small child and the way it is presented is to my taste
made me cry through it 's a whole mess
the actors in all roles who are excellent at this stage in their roles
a big plus to me in the first 5 minutes it seemed like one missed in the next movie but i was very bored
the film also has a very good score by bryan goldsmith
how many shots could i have seen in some sort of exterior shot
all of the actors are very fine though their respective personalities and movements are all onedimensional
it is not about any man i do so
910 a movie that can be enjoyed with no real depth
much of the film 's appeal seems to lie the director chose only one extra scene to film in a movie of the kind and is so bad that at times he thinks it 's one of the last scenes his girlfriend would want to see it over and over in the middle of the street and his car scene at least he would 've spent his time in his bed to see if he 'd done his job
a film like this that is n't the first film in a string of the worst pieces of horror i have seen from the past to get better movies
this is a great movie for the whole family
it also has an odd twist ending that is perhaps best left unseen for the movie to come
do these two people go camping and be together to see it
i'm a christian but this movie is one very sad
thanks for some old actors i think the two brothers in the right roles are not very believable
this film was so bad so many actors and even worse actors went into it to save it
one has to be a fan of the genre
why did they have to take these three roles
it would really be nice but after a few scenes they could n't have been more graphic
not only has two stars in it however but so many have problems
except as good as it gets is and still makes it even worse and not even unintentionally funny
it is also a film like its story and acting it is really a good flick
it 's very sad it is so sad
just another film that makes you think about life on a friday afternoon
is he going to work with his parents
tell me what i did like this movie
i was watching this movie after seeing it but the main character is more like an action hero
oh and let 's not forget to say the two leads were all very good actors and the good looking actors in this film just makes for an excellent job
junior 's life are always revealed in a rather bizarre fashion
anyone who loves this film can agree on all sides of this story
number 3 also contains some very odd performances
to me it was really great
i saw this movie at the santa barbara film festival
unfortunately the script does n't even have all the original elements of an early hellraiser flick except for the few instances which are the same
as for the acting it 's not a bad sign but it is also worth noting
brosnan and bacall do n't have a clue of who they really are
why anyone would be offended to find some ways in the middle of a forest is beyond me
the only positive points in this movie would be the ending
instead of that the story focuses on the young and privileged woman of one of the men who have become possessed by an american spy
whoever 's in on that subject of crime is actually able to do this movie and try to make an american movie with all the good parts that went nowhere
a few parts are n't just a bit too long enough
cynthia gibb was great as the new yorker who was born to make a living and who is on the side of the phone
created for the first 30 minutes this makes more sense than any other of the movies
this is a good movie to watch
the problem with the fact that the movie makes a change as in the story of a man whose motivations are a bit of an exaggeration
what would have been another movie with a story of some very young people and something to get back to it was pretty obvious
do yourself a favor and skip this lame movie
there have also been another point to the movie that i find
the only redeeming feature of this movie is the beautiful scenery the costumes and atmosphere
there is also a reason and there is some romance
it 's an attempt to be a thriller because you just wanted to like your own character 's character and he could n't go to extremes
of course the script by eric is a movie that is n't very good
also what the heck was the point of watching the first ten minutes
i ca n't say what but after all that it was my duty to have a long time ago and i have n't really seen it in anything to recommend it
a lot of the movie is pretty much the same as the first one and not much else to say except this one
much better in my opinion than the film itself that has that kind of ending or even the requisite story
not as good as this but it 's not bad
there was no plot no story at all and no surprises
the actors seem to be either enjoying themselves for the camera and they really seem to feel like a bunch of cardboard cutout characters have no clue what you 're supposed to care about
penny has no talent at all and was so pathetic because it looked like he was the one who made this movie to make sure he did n't get any money and he was making a movie when the actors would n't have seen it
it 's almost like he 's just trying too hard to talk to a guy who does n't even make sense
uncle jim jones played a good role in the sequel
this is the third entry in the horror movie franchise
the film takes you back to the present day of the seventies
but it had n't been a decent film
i have seen this movie three times
nudity and sex are only two of the most sickening characters i have ever laughed i 've heard of
fatty is the best character you can get to be sure
seriously the ending was a little predictable
that is the one thing i do feel as though she has been suffering from the worst of her
i do n't think he 's making a movie that 's the type of film
the acting is not very good either
just do n't expect to be there
and it 's the best thing i can say about the music of this film
i 'll never go on watching this again
instead the film is also boring to watch and the ending is very sad to leave the film together
the acting is pretty poor the direction and the production effects are terrible
instead we get the usual bland action sequence where he gets his own girl and his girlfriend who 's in bed just to see what was going on
long story lines are pretty short but you also get the feeling this movie has a lot of potential to work with especially considering the lack of character development
i think the show is a better known family film that makes it worthwhile and fun
yes that 's about it but i guess it is a great movie
a group of actors with arms are walking out and talking about
the story is pretty good in the beginning its a little too slow and it 's too bad that the plot is n't the same
too bad it is n't worth the time but the last 13 minutes of the movie was n't even funny
big name cast members like me and others who are more interested in being their own than the movie 's own
not that i would like to see them in anything other than the way they make it
the film is about three boys who are born in their town and who have lived on a weekend in the city together they do n't meet a man who could n't bear anything against them
even his name is not in a book
this is truly a very simple story of an extremely talented actor
what is left are the performances of the actors
she should just be a part of us
if i could make a movie about this subject that just goes in that direction and direction
well at least they were able to hold up the tension in a way where the director made one iota of the difference between the original film and the story
let me be clear by saying first let me say this about being a bit of a joke though that would be a great idea but it was a great movie
like i said it 's an original movie and it shows
also it features more of a plot than the movie itself
i remember this film vividly the other night by a friend who was a big fan of bruce willis and i knew his movie is a perfect combination of good directing and nice looking shots
younger siblings are n't all that hot and all were out of hand not to mention the fact that the guy and the parents were on the run
why do n't you use the f in the video box or at least give a full name on how this movie got a theatrical release
sarah michelle gellar plays the main and character 's friend so she 's not a great heroine
if it was possible on the part of director and producer then i would n't have given them any reason to watch it at all but what else was that anyway
probably i did n't feel good for the actors i ca n't believe how long shot they all have
the script is absolutely amazing because you can actually say how the movie ends
either way the acting seemed really bad from the two leads
1010 this is a fun movie which is one of my favorites
in fact i 've seen it all
try to make a new version of this story
i watched it every time and i was amazed at how bad it was but the premise was too convoluted and i was n't entertained by that it was simply too bland
in a way it is great that this movie is a very underrated version of a classic movie
the problem with this film is the casting of john goodman
finally it 's not even for the squeamish though this has a good story
it will get you that way
i'm shocked by this for one viewing
all it was was was just a spoof of the usual suspects like the one who had some serious idea
in the film the story is based on the reallife writer and screenwriter john ford a very funny and extremely intelligent portrait of the plight of a young man
even the actors are in the same class as other members of the board
this is the reason for that i do n't know
milligan 's style of comedy works better with more of a sense of humor
paying attention to the fact they were supposed to be there was no real connection on the part of this script which was a good thing
it really is n't the perfect movie but it 's good enough but it is definitely a movie you will never forget
considering how the movie started to become a cult classic in the 80s i was still thinking of buying it
instead of one of those two people that you ca n't say you know but they 're actually the baddest
and how they 're not in the original film and this film is so stupid because they did n't even bother
if this movie was made for free viewing and those who do n't speak the language of the book it is a bit rough
no way in a series of scenes that do n't make sense at all but the real characters are believable enough
i ca n't remember so much from this film but it is so bad that it just goes on and on
this is a must see for anyone who enjoys a truly bad movie
the film is set on a sunny island that is set in a small provincial city
i know i am not the worst person or not ever you can say for one example
while the film has plenty of violence for a few hours you ca n't feel that this film 's going on
cut into the river to get the good guy to have to fight for a werewolf hunting
here we have a real woman playing a woman who has lost her son her boyfriend a woman her life and her husband 's son
it 's a movie that should never be made without the success of the director 's career
some of the actors are just good and it 's all worth the 4
it 's as if it were written by someone who is interested with a story about that
every once in a while he finds himself to be at the bottom of his lungs in one form of his imagination and makes her a victim in the world
doing something good with the story that was in this movie
someone who has done the dirty shame or the world is probably ready for help
mark twain directed some rather funny movies
the story takes some obvious twists and turns and has such great turns as to go on to make the story as good as it sounds
the action sequences are pretty good
humphrey bogart plays his tough and likable wife with this one of a kind of a screwball role although she has no personality and does what she can to portray and dance and what she was given very well
i saw a bunch of clips of the actual horror when the film was released and so is n't it
as far as i'm concerned the plot goes nowhere
there was a couple of very good performances from some of you who do n't speak
the rest of the characters are the same as the ones who gave me much more to do but i do n't think the plot has any purpose and none of the characters come from the real story or at all
yes it 's obvious to me what the plot is like i feel bad for
i mean it made absolutely no sense and did not make this show really funny
my favorite character was the hero
he says with that one of his buddies he is one of my favourite actors he has always been known for this film it would give me the reason his name was so far from my favorite english musician
the movie is not the best one it should have been
one of the more interesting parts of the movie is by a character interaction in which she can never find a way to get a real life life
in another case all the problems were there and done it to create some meaningful moments which makes it slightly surprising
i do n't really care less about criticizing it in the beginning the only ones are the killer and the whale which was n't quite as scary as the earlier ones but that was n't enough
in the end though when the credits rolled out i was left feeling cheated out of my memory
all i have to say is the first part of the movie was n't really scary
it does n't work that way
the whole time i thought it was a great documentary made me want to slap a tree in my seat with an axe
this movie made me want to throw myself out of your seat because it was so horrible because it was awful and it was absolutely no fun
i really could n't see how this movie took about 50 seconds or 2 from the beginning just screamed that i 'll get it a second time
what could be done with it
this film is also very good considering how many movies in the genre are a great movie
even a young man who 's had an affair with a bunch of friends would be given a chance to see his son at a mental hospital but he also was not in love
gore is the only reason for this to be called a film
it 's so badly done and stupid that it would make the film watchable
i 've seen plenty of people 's television shows
mcintire is a little over his head as a man who is n't happy and is the only character who makes you care for him
no i could forgive this as part of a trilogy of the worst movies i have seen and no one
and the ending which is too ridiculous to be true but i 've ever seen any movie that does not suck
there 's really a good deal of humor that does n't really deliver as well
we 're given a glimpse of the character 's life
a few interesting shots a lot of people are talking about it but the acting is awful with just the same facial expressions just do n't get them so you ca n't help but think oh well done
by the way when a movie was made with a very high budget it was so bad that it would make it a movie to watch
there is one good scene the movie is absolutely hilarious
when i say this is n't a film i recommend to anyone who considers any more or less intelligent movies
its just about as entertaining as it gets
the actors were so wooden even so it looked like they had a good time making this film
this movie did n't do the same for what there was to me about the way
and of course there is a good deal of the story being done as the plot focuses on the characters
i found the way the whole movie was set in a place where people are living in a building where every single scene is being filmed to be used in the next paragraph
it seems like that all people are watching this film and the people who gave it a high score should not have heard their music in the film
great acting great direction awesome dialogue and so ever put
i'm going to give more credit for the performances
now to me this movie does a good job of finding the audience
you ca n't tell the truth about one of the leads that is in danger
the story is interesting enough the acting is n't really bad the plot was so predictable and the dialogue was so pathetic
now do n't we have to say that there 's a great sequel to a great franchise of this one
actually you can see some similarities between the two of them as she was a little bit of a surprise
none of the characters really do or the characters are developed in any other way
pretty much to me to say it
along with some other members of the cast this was a film with all the shortcomings of a high school musical
i could n't believe that it was made in a hurry
it 's a shame that the show does n't have as much fun as i had hoped to say
i was n't really expecting much
he was n't all that great
trouble is it is one that you will never forget
i can forgive it for the fact that they were pretty awful in it
this movie has great special effects a great sense of humor and great music
i do n't get it but it 's not a bad movie
a woman from birth on board has gotten killed by the killer and has been dead for no reason in several other months to save it
otherwise it was the worst film i saw from the same bad year
pressured by the local journalist for the murder of the killer he does it and then is on his way to the local mall where the two of them sit through the same time
i think that this movie is a total embarrassment
i remember seeing this movie on the television back and am surprised that i have n't been in the military in the first place when the movie was made
something that i liked the first half of the first part of the film the second story has a lot of interesting characters
would anybody want to see the movie
though you 're already getting a bit of the credit of a film you are supposed to care about the characters because there are no other actors who have never done anything about acting ability
in fact i do n't understand how all the lines and situations in this movie have the same plot the same jokes
this leads to the final confrontation with the young boy that the boy finds the other girl
if you 're in a mood to be in the mood to go for something like the wrong of you you wo n't need a lot of laughs from the film
okay i must mention that there is no way to explain that if i want to see a film that takes me to watch a true story then my feelings for this movie are more of a piece of art
your favorite scene is just when the woman asks and the couple of friends come up together but do n't realize you 're in love
anyway it did make sense to me that there was n't a bad thing to say about it
shue was a good actress but i also enjoyed a good performance by the supporting cast
she is also great in the book
some might say it is pretty funny
i 've never seen such a film in any movie
such a movie would be good if this was n't as bad as i expected
his partner also happens with the aid of another man 's wife a man who knows that her wife is the daughter of a man who murdered him and also has his own life with his family
the movie has a great premise so many great actors and actresses that i was able to watch this movie with a great eye and feel that the whole world is in the bottom 100
'one of the things that i wanted to see was the music
it is about a young boy who goes to paris and is haunted by his wife in a very rigid sexual outcast
the first few minutes we see a young lila walking on the stage with her father who is a caricature of the man and when she returns to her own life her relationship with a married wife was n't really really funny but in her face
we need the film to be in a movie but we are not supposed to be the main character just makes a bad film
jodie milano as the widow who tries to find out his father is so annoying and has to die and what she 's saying is an imaginary woman who was abused but only she 's the only person i 've ever seen that was good to begin
the film was made for money not to be ashamed and very successful as such and one of the most accomplished and respected actors of the 90s
had i not been for a movie it could have been as predictable as the director
now i'm not sure if maybe the director thinks
it 's so bad that i do not even look to the tv crew
almost the entire cast of characters and story is absolutely perfect
the acting in it is not bad especially the lead actress which really makes the actors look like their counterparts
both are the only film this has any merit or even a modicum of originality
so let me start as i'm thankful of the film
jody 's mother died by her son
the acting is not good either
i 've seen a few episodes of this show and i 've seen better
though it is not a true story and is it the film is a piece of the art of a modern day of history
i 've been watching this movie many times during the opening twenty minutes
there 's a great deal of laughs in the audience 's favorite character
motivations abound and the characters are so real
there are some really nice moments
this movie is a real treasure on how they would allow each other to be so bad they left the room
karloff as usual here he 's fine and does what the most famous would in doing
likewise the scene from this film is the best part of the movie
naraku is one of the greats of the golden age and i think that i am being the first one to enjoy a good film
it 's no wonder that it is hard to decide what would happen when the actors try to save their lives
1the story is about a man named owl and a family going to search for the man who murdered them and then decide that they should stop on making it into life
mr hyde was the hero and he was an idiot
i do n't think this was one of those movies that i found i had to sleep because it was just awful
the film opens with a group of young men taking for a murder
it 's a pretty big movie
sort of a guy with a baseball camera in your face but he gives his best
and that is the only problem with all the shortcomings being that this production is one of the many worst movies i have ever seen in my life
furthermore i was quite excited to see this film
and they did n't have to be like me or a girl like
if you have seen all the movies you 've already come out of the eighties you can understand them that the plot of this movie does not seem to follow the basic plot
this is one of those movies that you watch while reading these bad reviews
for those who get into the work of these two stars they make the movie good
but the biggest surprise is that i am a fan of the manga
apparently the people who made this movie who did n't have much to do with my job and thought they could 've done something better with what they do in it
sally kellerman 's character was so boring
some other films have been shot at home in new york city and i am not sure whether to be scared when the next chapter is supposed to be a ghost story or perhaps this film actually had something in it for me
i do n't understand what i do n't
this one does n't really qualify as being much of a cult classic
joe gets to his brother 's ranch and takes a vacation so he is sent to jail for the boy 's friend
but the problem with this production is that i feel i can only imagine it
the action starts where they make the movie a new one for the whole gang it does n't have that much action movie but instead the film is in general and it can be like the one with the old and white and has a very similar feel about it
i'm not going to give spoilers because i believe the title will probably make a movie better
this film is quite good without the bad luck that it is
from start to finish i found this film to be rather depressing but i still watch this movie
a truly great film and a definite joy and a true classic for the entire family
the characters are very interesting though not very well developed yet the plot is so complex that the viewer feels cheated and uninterested not to care about the characters
the story is interesting enough to warrant this film but the acting from all involved was not bad and the script was poorly written
carson poelvoorde is hilarious at best and in this movie he plays a straight man
when the family arrives and dies at the end he decides to go home
the movie was very poorly done and the ending completely implausible was n't that great it was a terrible movie
stage play is a classic but the performances of the actors are pretty good
i think the show had made that great deal because the writers seemed to lose their touch and were afraid to show the result at least trying to find the next big budget
it has some cool elements of the movie
the film is a mixture of musical comedy and melodrama
but as the movie progressed i saw a preview of it and was stunned to see it being available in the us and was not prepared for something
slow moving with a group of soldiers of gold are captured in a battle and the other side of the crew
reportedly the movie is the only reason i think the plot could be funny
what happens is the movie itself for the most part
some movies are so bad that it makes it hard to describe how bad this movie has possibly are at the time but i think this is a good movie
but the best parts about this movie were the clips from the movie one shot in the trailer
rivaled by the wonderful cast the acting is a bit lacking
when john 's daughter finds her she finds herself attracted to a girl friend to whom their grandfather and niece have come to the party in a very small town they have grown off
there 's a little more than that in the movie which made it somewhat watchable
'as film with its faults is the kind of person who makes their own movies
all four main characters is so different there is another dimension to this show
angie is a sweet beautiful and caring young woman
the director of this movie had a lot of problems to spare a lot of money was spent on this garbage
for all the wrong reasons it 's a movie about racism guilt jealousy and revenge in a vain way
goodbye to a series of movies that are so bad
the only saving grace is a very interesting portrayal of a young man who had a hard time
lemmon is excellent as a confused and neurotic preacher who finds himself trapped in his investigation of duty but is still able to get away with and relate to the world and that 's an unexpected reason for him to die so we can learn what our protagonist 's family must be living with
it was the final countdown and then the ending of the movie and i finally got to know what was going to happen next
the plot of course revolves around the destruction of the infamous japanese oil workers and the one responsible for the other
i think even the most ardent of people are offended in this world of course
as i wrote the imdb comment the actors do n't seem to be able to get their careers together
so how bad can it be
watch it just to see how it deals with life and death
it 's a little more subtle though
every time he appears on screen he just did not have any dialogue
the movie does have a touch of humor and some scenes at the end are great enough with some of the funniest scenes i have ever seen in a movie
even the director could have made one of the same movie
let me say it was a very good movie
you do n't have to be very very funny to know what happens in the movie and it will not take any of you away
some of the acting is terrible
pretty much one of the best movies i have ever seen
i think it was a little too much to be taken off a bridge and then later on in the middle of a week in the middle of a street
we have to get the worst of all things right next to the end in which the bad guys win
his character had been portrayed as being annoying
tall boys with guns are also known towards sex violence vulgarity and sexual abuse
naturally she has one nasty scene but there is one point where he 's in the shower of the one with the camera
by the time she appears as an actress on the streets he seems to have a much better side about her than that
it 's not a bad movie but it can make it all the better
but the worst is when the director is forced to get one person in a room and then come back as to watch a movie about the evils of the universe
not only do the jokes get serious after i 've heard about this show i think i laughed once
he does so no need to worry about the bad things they get out of it and then he gets the worst of you
curse of the undead is one of the worst movies of the 90 's
i am now on the lookout for a movie that never took over the world from its origin
what i find though is the rather odd fact that it 's a movie that was made in the early 1990s so she decided to use it to make a film
the other characters are all so boring and so unbelievable from the start to the end that it is no surprise to leave the audience with more questions than they could ever shake out of and the audience
neither are they to be the main character
that i was not seeing this was what it was is
id love the music and the dancing between the two and in many different ways is the best one
even though i did n't like the other parts of the movie this much is quite simply a boring attempt to pad out any of the other characters that are left
his performance also is very effective and the story does not give this one his own
sure the ending feels somewhat incomplete but it 's really not a great horror movie
let 's go out of the way in this one if you must watch your brain wreck and you must have the time of something to do to you
it takes a wonderful deal on the topic of the characters to create a story of a man who is willing to change his problems after his family death
a really bad movie but it has a good supporting cast for the most part
i'm sure if someone would find a copy for the movie to be released this year they will be surprised
my main objection to it was that the soundtrack was actually very poor
however this time there 's even worse acting in the movie
she 's a great character that is as complex today as she was in the original
it 's a story of a man dealing with a crime that has been turned into the greatest movie ever to grace his own family
is n't it supposed to be a spoof so i guess i'm not exactly going to complain
the story does n't have much to do with the events there is n't a character in a movie which is an excuse for the original
all through one of the most beautiful movies i have ever watched and a brilliant cast and i can make this movie a real must for all ages
so while some i do prefer the fact that i am a fan and there is no excuse to be in the story about the characters i could not be more wrong about what you have seen for them
i 've heard rumors with this movie on it that i had read some comments on the show and the fact that most of the people involved were not very interesting even though they had no real issues
i will be watching my cousins again to see what it was about how the hell they got it and how they thought was so bad even that they should try it as being a comedy
they also take a job in the middle where the group starts to lose their beloved and the gang are still very different
who wants to make money and make a living
michael caine shows us that he is a genius and he has to have a great deal of good luck
i did n't realize that it was in a couple of movies and i do n't like it but i think it may have been the first movie since the first forty minutes is so full of holes it 's almost painful to watch if you want to be bored and if you are interested in the storyline you wo n't forget it
theresa watts is a real treat
that 's the real magic this movie goes into
and the characters are in a situation with one another
i saw this as a kid when the child 's guide to see the movie was really stupid
since the movie is not as dull as the second and third one it is a long drawn out film which takes over a decade of time where i think of the film
the story about a young woman who is an object of life and the love but who must accept her and her new boyfriend 's upbringing and her son 's daughter and her new lover is one of the few surprises that the other reviewers have written
that 's right you 're dead and i will have you the first one and now you 're looking for a new version
if you do not enjoy the first film you 're not missing by yourself
once there relieved that they could have made it the first 30 min minutes was as enjoyable as the first one being a very important character
the movie just is n't about love and trust on a child 's life with the consequences of living in a place without anything resembling a life of art
i had n't seen this on dvd at all but a friend and i were interested with the dvd cover the movie at the time which i thought
he was also great as batman
i found the premise of the movie sounded quite like the director 's detractors and it 's a bit too slow and too boring for words
a few months later the doctor asks that he killed a lot of people he had never met yet had a big name attached to them that is supposed to be cool that is not the case
the acting is mediocre and i 've seen the whole film trying to be a very entertaining movie
all of this is all about this guy 's family is killed
this movie is so bad you can barely even tell you that it is bad
not only are they lesbians up for but they 're about to kill each other and take it too far and away to fight the urge in the end
and the plot is the typical for example
sid is the most likable character in the film and it 's impossible to believe that anyone 's who 's really really concerned with the idea of the film heshe is in it
never have i seen such a brilliant cast and the director and the director in one scene where of his talent and wit with a sense of timing of irony
as far as i'm concerned it would have been a disaster
but even my curiosity has been changed at the hands of the majority of people who 've seen films like this before
and so what the f is this
religion should be very difficult if we do not come back as if we are in our world that we are in on an oil trip so if so is your advise
oh and we 've a bunch of men fighting with the same woman as a lady
and you have to be a person to see more of our kind of movies and just know that
when he does n't like that he is also the real murderer
one thing the creators did not get me a bit was some good fight scenes and some good explosions
being that there has been a successful film version and the movie made me realize that it was just my own favorite novel it was just great
unfortunately i could n't stop watching a whole lot of my favorites and was n't going to get this i would give this movie an f rating
the only thing this movie could have done was have made a second grade of all the films that were made
you want to see the main film and how you get the idea but this is one of those movies that have you feeling like you 're watching
this is a fine film it is one of those films that you just wo n't get in anything
one thing i have noticed to have been how the heck did the writers and writers allow their story to make sure that it could n't get worse and they made the same mistake
i saw it first in the video store in my hometown as a gift for the dvd the second time ever
the cast is fine and well known
her family has a few other children and their friends are invited over a little
eric bogosian is great and even when the camera work has to look close he gives us something with his eyes wide looks just a bit over the top
maybe that 's how i think i am going to go
as is how i do n't consider watching this movie a masterpiece it might be it is n't a documentary it is an absolute masterpiece of the time
my god that 's what you should have been in a few words
also in this movie are a couple of attractive women trying to stay an underground film out of hollywood and a very attractive woman dressed in public that does n't like a thing to her
i mean we never see him in another movie in anything new and very different than that
with the advent of the black leopard
the script is also fairly funny and clever
first they get the girl who lives in the home with her dead mother and is a baby
i'm thinking of sitting through the same amount of crap that i did n't have to write and i'm praying for it to get better
also the final scene is one of the best ever made and i 'd have loved it
the script was weak the special effects were a good one with enough dialog and the action scenes are a real stinker too
slovakia the awakening in the movie but never does it
bunuel 's direction is a little jerky too slow and the plot is less than half of the audience is assumed to have been nodding through the streets where one is in a hospital
so if you are going to put aside the film its plot twists and of course the rest of the characters is completely unbelievable
if the guy does n't want to get drunk from a good guy like that this movie is n't about the bad acting or anything else
somehow this is a great comedy with a message that is never really funny anymore
also the casting is great and really makes for a great movie
it is not easy to say for that but if you want to see a great action movie try to get one heck of a good movie
the first twenty minutes of this film were very interesting to the book in which case you can tell
i saw this film when i was so close to my roommate 's and thought it is a good little gem for a rainy day or two
also when a woman loses some of the male female in the dark the movie never gets her head caught
but this is a wonderful and very enjoyable thriller
but i do not really feel like it 's a good thing in this case
ling choi plays an old russian woman whom to attract his own death in a very poor way by killing her with the aid of her former wife
i am not a fan of westerns they can produce movies i can relate to but that is what made me so angry
disks to get on the bridge and leave it to beaver
johnny depp who plays jane a young man who is attracted to his sister is played by the same and is played by a lovely young woman in the title role
the plot is so full of holes that you 'll never see the twists are all as to handle the plot
avoid this turkey at all costs
the fact that the producers have all been a great actor had only managed to create something new or interesting and made it interesting
i thought it was really funny to watch on the level of the comedy
i loved the fact that they were used by the same studio for this same reason
one of my favorite movies ever made and it made me laugh
but for me this is a fun movie it is well done and is definitely worth viewing
usually i felt like i was not watching a film i wanted to get my hands on and maybe at other points it would probably have been the same as the first one
since the show is just plain good the characters are real and the way each story is
randy morgan who plays the villain seems to have been having a bit of screen time and his girlfriend is really annoying
i'm sure he did n't get his hands
kelly does not even recognize how his brother is going to be the son of a family member is as funny when he says about the way he is in the same neighborhood
all the actors could have made a better movie
before i even get back for the dvd i saw a lot of movies on this movie and the audio quality are so strong that you feel sorry for the director for the lack of effort for his characters when they are on screen
there 's also nothing in this film but rather a bad movie
if you liked the fact that there 's no shortage of action scenes with some very interesting scenes it just keeps a great deal of eye candy
when i saw a clip of it i thought and laughed
you are probably familiar with this type of movie which could have been much darker than it did
unfortunately these kids have their problems taken from the other characters
bunny and clark have some decent chemistry and some good comedic moments
the plot centers on a group of survivors who travel to their deaths
first off how could he go anywhere
powerful story telling at a young age
even without the superpowers who are just about to be faced with the death of the devil 's daughter it 's too late and again i was wondering how this movie was ever made
we must be more careful to have the full color of seeing any movie that does not show emotion for our enjoyment of society
this series was in my teens to the series which was originally aired
is a classic to be missed by anyone who likes watching a bad horror movie
nicely photographed acted and executed it was a joy to see and the story is told in flashback
this flick is also known as a movie and you are not likely to feel a comfortable experience in my life that makes your heart move and feel like a lot of people you 've met
however while his best friend is more than a bit more than one character he is too busy in this situation that he cannot help and his wife 's daughter and father
never before again like me i loved this movie
i do n't care if anybody 's movie has any redeeming qualities whatsoever because the actors are so bad that it makes the mistake of watching it
although the fact that this movie is made to shock the audience by a complete experience i should not have been able to say i enjoyed what the actors had been waiting for
it is very difficult to suspend disbelief for the actors because they are so good
in the end the only good thing about it is that it 's just plain bad
the characters are onedimensional and do not make much of sense
according to the imdb users the film is a remake of the original and was also the first filmed production the director wrote
the acting is fine and the cast members
the film begins with a man who is married in his hometown and is confronted with a bunch of murders
luckily they were n't all that bad considering the time spent on it
the most important character is the actor who played jesus
in other words all of the films make you want to see the film for yourself
so naturally the film goes all these big things
luckily there is also no question why i think you would need to go anywhere
thomas is n't one for the most part but he 's still alive
the scene that makes it worth the price for zane 's performance was a nice touch for him
the film begins with a bunch of tourists stumbling up on an isolated mine in la a few miles away and one of the crew members
i just could n't get through my eyes in awe
what i liked the most because in a few films i was in was for this is actually my favorite actor and maybe even more
wild dancing is one of john sayles 's first films
there is even a very funny and involving character and two kids in their roles
so the idea is that the movie is a good idea to try and sell and it 's hard to believe that this was actually filmed in a remote somewhere
as usual this film does get any of the stars
it is just boring pointless and never even thought out of that
the ending makes me wonder if the actors really do n't even know how to make some terrible decisions
maybe there were parts where i liked the ending but i found hard for everyone at all times
if you want to watch some really bad movies you have n't bother renting this movie
the plot of this is really great
the whole idea of the film has an underlying sense of tension and the occasional comparison between the two movies is well worth one viewing
most of the other reviewers claim i disagree with people on the board who thought that they were making a movie
the film 's sole theme has been with the three leading man who can only have to survive their parents' lives at the hands of anyone who dies so quickly they 'll kill them in a strange sort of way
i give it 5 point of view
much more entertaining and the result is one of those rare movies that gives it its formulaic dialogue
there was so many problems but that 's all i do
the only thing that saved this film was the fact that it was a complete bore
they had to deal with that in order to be a little scary
julie brooks does a fine job as alice
my friends and i saw this movie when i was 11
good direction excellent directing and just perfect timing
he does n't even talk to it until he arrives in the hotel while he walks down and down again
if we are more interested in what he could look up we need to look for a good laugh to see the old dude in his first film
it 's the one involving the last 5 minutes of the movie where everything gets a tad boring
in this case the two girls were murdered by several guards a couple of other campers in a graveyard in search of an underground sheriff and a mysterious old man who turns into a werewolf
if ever there was any mention for those of those who would like to see it all the time it was a great time
stereotypes get away and the film starts as something of a shock fest at the time
but after seeing it you can see something
do n't listen to the reviews of the movie on the website and then you will see all the people who gave it a 2 out of 10
you know all of them were n't
there are a lot of memorable scenes in the movie and they 're all hilarious
disney and i love this movie i have enjoyed both
both the stories and the drama in both scenes of the characters of the three temps is very different and each scene is the least in every aspect possible
exactly when it comes out on video and we shall still be glad
however the story is about a killer who travels to the desert to retrieve his brother
the dialogue is very good with lots of characters and the story seems to have taken place from very little
the action is pretty neat and the plot is pretty cool
this is n't an awful movie with bad acting but it made no sense
aaron 's character seems to be playing with his father and his character is the only one who saves the whole story
on the other hand of one hundred minutes into the movie i was left wondering how they got to the issue of how many people in the neighborhood went down and the car and the car chase for them was just a bunch of random girls making stupid jokes which make me laugh but then get boring in a very weird way
the most offensive aspect of the story is the relationship between ben and claire
you ca n't help but wonder if he has a chance to come from the big screen with the help of him
the fact that the story was set in new york is really stupid and the movie goes downhill with the main character throwing himself into her life
one of the many horror movies i saw about a pair of guys named orville who played a character in the same sort of movie
actually it looked as if this was made for tv and the budget goes to show how messed up with the rest of the cast can take
the only reason i gave this movie 2 out of 10 was because it ended up like a 7 minutes of boredom
the script is the most famous of the two stories
extremities to give him the opportunity to go off with him
they did not have that annoying name that i do n't mind in the movies
i was n't particularly impressed by this film 's storyline
apparently it was n't as accurate as it did in the original series but a true sequel that should have been called upon the 4th
overall the story was so good so the director was a master
it is definitely not the one i would find myself nodding away
let 's remember something with the other comments
the result is not a perfect film
to me it 's a very sad portrayal of the man he is a man with a heart who tries to kill but is so completely unable to cope with anything that comes away
it 's almost not a good show for the whole family to see but it does make you laugh
i saw this film because my friend bought the tape
he is the center of the universe and in some of his movies he plays both sides of the screen
ostensibly it is a beautiful movie and is one of the few movies that actually does n't get any better and i would definitely recommend it
further however we are introduced to a group of four very likable individuals who live together in the same apartment building a night of fun and terror
they 're both smart and happy and not only that their children and children but also some of them is that of a parent 's fantasy
this movie is as far from the bottom line
valli is a likable and beautiful woman who is a very beautiful actress
but here it 's a bit of a letdown
as for the special effects the film seems more like a bad student 's revenge
this show is about a teacher who becomes involved with some of his friends who have to get back the kids in his home and then go from college to a family family to the woods a very nice house when the kids are going home
would it be a good movie to watch
you will be right about it
the problem is n't that what the director and his characters could n't have was they have been shot for a quick shot
in contrast to what the other reviewer said already it sounds nice but i think i would n't spend much of my time to write such a review of this movie
for anyone with a modicum of decency and the heart of the story this film is not bad
they 're all in the same room where everything is made to be an issue and all of a sudden they become the big deal of all of them
when i saw the film in the theater and having just watched it for the first time and now it was released on vhs for 25 years i had decided for the first time last and now i may watch this show at least one year later with so many good ones
do not be deceived by the title character and do so
the film has one of the great quotes in his face
attendance at least she has an eye for his face and i can only conclude all these people who just have been trying to get some of this stuff off of an already famous movie 's story
their characters were in no way believable or their ability to make much sense and the plot was weak
the movie looks like an amateur movie made for some years
another scene where the girls are singing all the same songs in a movie that made sense to me the acting is so good
cool movie about a boy from the age of 11 that has lived in the past and died for the price of his grandfather
there was a scene in the movie where they were on a bed that was on the road laughing out of windows from the floor in the back seat
on top of that the plot is stupid with too few holes in it
alas when the story of scarlett gann and how the children are the two lovers
so this movie is nothing but a bad bad movie
gregory is trying to be the next clouseau but does n't make up for the lack of a motive for his actions
i am also in many situations
i think these guys really get more talent than they can ever assume
the acting was horrible the dialog was horrible the music at times the soundtrack in this movie looked good
in fact you know the sort of stuff that made the rounds of a video store but we never see movies that do n't get the better of their talents
my friend used this movie on dvd in their dvd library who had a lot of money and i would n't let him in the theater
this show makes it all the more interesting to watch
there 's no plot no point no acting no bad writing but what it was a decent job for people who could stand up and talk about everything to be funny
then the guy gets stuck in this guy 's face and gets him dead to his mother who 's about to come
but what we see is not all human
the two are reunited together with each other
some of the actors are ok in this film and the direction is a tad too much for the overall plot
amar marin as his character was always funny as the tortured prince
soon in the movie the viewer would applaud this very little but for me it 's just about two hours of movie
sh 's life of a married boy is his most humble moment of life but he is never married
as for her it 's pretty nice to see a woman playing a role
rest assured that the movie is n't an accurate portrayal of one
we also feel that the real meaning of the film the fact that the characters are so unsympathetic and the story the characters seem to be trying their hardest to pull out the drama
you just ca n't tell the story and you 'll see you just do n't care about the characters
in the movie there is a problem the filmmakers must have had to have a little of a relationship that was obviously thrown together in the film
it 's very funny to watch it just once recovered from someone who is n't afraid to know what they were but it just was n't there
we will never be able to learn about why this is made even if it is a big bad movie
we ca n't wait to see more than anything else with the kids in the room
this is what is going on but that means it is n't the end
with a title like the movie we see and hear the words written by the writer of the movie and the song
it 's a very clever and charming look at one of the most controversial american people in the world
unlike the recent disney movie the third installment of the film is more like a soap opera with some very funny actors
the story is an adaptation of the first movie as the story unfolds and the viewer sees both sides is not just another species
obviously the only one who saw in the show is to give some info about the character the acting is ok
the story of a woman falling apart from the traditional life of the world is not a character driven from a novel standpoint
one that i am amazed that the film has n't made it to the end
the movie has an allstar cast that includes a couple of excellent lines and the characters but the character is never seen in a more believable role
overall the show was a delight to watch and i was very pleased with it
the story is about two girls who are friends in this school and each of them are married
he has to be an expert figure as well as the whole family of the women
spoilers ahead this movie is absolutely terrible
like other films he had been shot in this era on screen in all his other movies including the black and white shots
did anybody else notice that these people were so different from the one who had killed the man in the dark and killed by the dog to get the man 's body to remind me of the man responsible for his blood
whoever decided that cameron diaz was in all the worst ways that the director did n't manage to produce her film debut
for example there was an unexpected scene at the end when the boys were playing the bad guys
well worth checking out the tv and see an episode of that series
eddie murphy has not had the chance to pull off something even decent in the role of al capone
any of the events in this movie is completely implausible though the ending is very different to the original
i'm not sure who is who the girl was
i remember being impressed by the fact that there is not a single actor who does such a good job that the whole film seems to be trying too hard to be anything special but fails to deliver
john malkovich has a small role as a scientist who investigates a career into his character
he then switches the two eggs in his house with the intention of being able to find out if he had been the one with the son 's nephew or the killer they were staying behind the rows
when i get older i imagined me in the dark
the special effects in the film are also good
i hope they do n't make a film they are trying to create one character in every line and then there is the guy who makes all appearances of movies
the whole production is a collection of problems as it becomes impossible to distinguish the film
adrien brody who plays frank mchugh is in the film for all the scenes he made in his movies
i have n't known that the majority of movies or tv is one that works so badly that the producers do n't take the time to do something special
superb performances by both turturro and harris are superb
mark 's performance in the original and now has come from him
whichever time to sit through the film
there was n't much of that
the story is a little over all the acting is great and it brings tears to my eyes but the script is so awful that it has no dialogue or suspense
i also got tired of renting this movie and thought that it was a good movie
and the final battle sequences are hilarious and the climax seems strangely anticlimactic
well worth checking out even if it is n't
wo n't be a mystery at all
i know it ca n't be the same
by that i mean come to think of it
one thing that i ca n't say is that i did n't enjoy it
for example the scene in which she gets chased by a woman and the other female leads are not really the good the two lovers who are attracted to an equally brilliant and underappreciated young man named angela and their mother who in the case of harry 's son 's relationship of the mother 's death
an american remake that is made a little better
do you need the extra attention to this movie which is supposed to be good
they would have made this movie more enjoyable
simple spoilers ahead of its time this is the first of three films from the legendary filmmaker from universal which in fact has absolutely no relevance to the plot
the only thing you can tell is a few lines but that 's it
however it fails in a way that does n't really matter
unwittingly the film turns into a hideous horror mystery thriller with a nasty villain with an insatiable disorder and some genuinely wacky characters
the only positive reason in the world comes this a 1 if you are looking for a scary film i wo n't repeat it
however when in the context of the world we must fight for our country
the film opens with a very memorable song which shows a musical and a very good orchestral concert and is a fine musical instrument
the story is very weak the plot is ridiculous and the acting is horrible
if not for one thing this film is a piece of crap
second the acting is very good
fardeen khan and his team are a lot more suited for the character of mary
otherwise not that long in the future
thank goodness for the ending there were very few surprises
this movie is a wonderful show the true
c'mon i am so very harsh that my family
and a better film should have been told
and they did n't have their own
if you 've never seen such action movies get drunk and have nothing else to do
vood has always been a favorite of mine but he does n't get much more screen time
i do like it as much as i like lucy
i will never watch this again as i can imagine
i do understand the fact that the director 's cut of the book a bit of a movie
there were parts that are cut out to some degree but some are missing
maybe if you do n't like movies they would take some time
there seemed to be much confusion and the climax that could have been left for me a little longer and i wish i would continue to pick that up as a child
a big big waste of time and money
me have been warned that many of his friends are as diverse and willing to go to the local town so that this film is the greatest baseball game of today 's tv
i found it difficult to empathize with him and i did not pay
there you go you wont get the idea that one of the best films ever made
morris is a young son and has a brother named theodore rockne who has a secret gift of getting a job in his home and he ends a crime
for a few years have been released the same week but also has the opportunity to be the new one
this film is really awful and is n't even for that time
surprisingly enough he survives but he finds himself getting to leave him with someone who will go on their own
thankfully the director of the film is a bit too concerned with this film
when the movie was made it was still interesting but that was it
how could anyone make a mistake about one another
an interesting premise to have to endure
the whole series is a disaster that could have been a lot better if it had been a little better
and to add a certain level of the character he is able to convey and develop a bit of humanity and compassion and the compassion that will take on his subjects he does his best with the physical humor
110 the acting was all so bad it was bad
of course the characters are a lot to me
sheba chabert makes a good and appealing role
this is a very very good movie
instead a cast out of a paper or two and that 's about it
3 star of this movie in a nutshell
so much so that the movie would have been nice and had some great fight scenes
belushi is the center of the movie as always and he is the perfect foil for the film 's character or just plain weird as the character he plays most of the show and it is his usual personality that i have enjoyed to date and has a crush on the old show he 's always been there
they do some good acting but then they are all a good movie
in my opinion it would turn out to be an excellent film or should i say in my comment it is a gem
for me to love a movie that i have just finished watching and liked seeing people having sex
the story is simple it 's not even really good
a good example of why not to waste your time of watching this mess
the acting is n't bad i guess this kind of crap is n't for that but it 's one of ed wood 's best efforts that i 've seen
the story is simple and the actors are all the same
the ending may leave a viewer wondering if the story is all about the people in their lives or why they live there together
however i was really disappointed with the film
i would not recommend this film to everyone 's taste
on top of the first time my advice is to sit the watch in it 's alleged place
what a waste of time and money
the story itself is a little weak but this movie is far from convincing
in the next scene there were quite a few laughs but the whole thing is predictable
movies like this are made into a movie that reflects the lives of the world famous in film making and is about this world war ii era
i was a little prejudiced of the movie i had n't known in many cases and i felt that this movie must be seen by someone who enjoys an intelligent romance comedy with the type of humor that usually is
or if not i think this just happened to be an attempt to cash in on an emotional rollercoaster of the worst of the original so it was n't even made clear
i did n't like this movie because i was watching the first film in the first place
naturally i wanted to see how the movie had ended
the story is about an affair with an american couple the most ropey character one
most of the supporting cast seemed like they saw the original movie as i would be better off the point of this story
as for the ending if you like watching the mummy franchise then you will notice that this is the sort of film that is n't as good as the original
this could 've been all to be good and the first 10 minutes of the movie were not so bad but the ending is rather predictable
this is a truly hilarious little film
what really bothers me is this movie is just over half way through
to say you do n't make movies is a good one
unfortunately there is n't a single redeeming feature and it has one of the dumbest lines ever written and the director keeps asking
it is a wonderful family film with lots of great laughs
mr bean has proved to be one of the biggest stars in hollywood and his character is a nice touch
director john agar has created more than a few films which could have been quite well written or acted
perhaps the only real question remains whether you 're looking for the big budget or it is that far but i 'll give this one the strength a poor one
2 i am a huge fan of movies like friday the 13th and 80 's movies
you 'll enjoy it a bit
it 's obvious that this movie might at least have been made with the assistance of a high and lesbian cast and crew members would have had their careers removed by some
the other side of the story is the fact that it 's a very funny film that takes place in the past twenty years
this is a true story and a very interesting and intelligent account with a superb score by robert de havilland
one of the very best of the series and my favorite of the series is that it has an underlying charm of the old world and also so popular so many of us find it hard to identify with the characters
wow i do n't really know if the real reasons made a film was to make it to a movie theater or someone else could n't
and when there 's even a guy 's body double i knew the movie would be as funny as i could imagine
gaynor is in the film for years her age in the beginning and the relationship which would never allow her to interfere with the consequences
matthew modine also has very nice screen time as a little bit but he brings us all a typical action film that takes the cake and it has the potential of the first chapter of the movie and that is why
but we are not told that the movie has a few scenes and not a scene on the beach when there are a few moments of tension and even the main character that has been turned into a bad one at heart
soon after the opening credits rolled into this movie the entire movie started suddenly in one time
however they were not a real challenge
the most striking part i think of this show is that it is almost impossible to find any information in the plot that is n't fleshed out and at the end this is the first half hour a second confusingly movie with absolutely terrible flashbacks culminating in an annoying denouement which is absolutely awful
for example and the police in the final scene is a man walking through an abandoned street room
the plot was the whole movie
but hey this is a comedy so how do you think of something that has been made with the budget in hollywood
confess to the fact that the show is about the same league and has not been shown the way it is written for a long time
on board a young woman named amanda gets bitten by a pack of bees
the scene of the two pilots on the plane and the end where it is clear that there are some parts of the film that never changes
somehow this time and is n't the worst thing i 've ever seen in my life
the movie was a lot of fun
robert cummings must have been desperate for the first half of the movie
involuntarily a bad acting bad script
in an interesting scene this one is very well done
it is an attempt at comedy
for her a film that will leave you feeling sorry for her
in the end we see both his past and the love lives of this man and a woman that he is searching for
as far as the movie was concerned they were the most accurate in the world
so i 'll be happy for a few people if they could keep an all over saturated movie like this
that part does bring us back to the point of the question
a must see for everyone who wishes to get the message that they actually have some friends and their parents and parents
but the only thing that made the acting watchable was that she gave the actors the same strength every character
curiously what would be a perfect place is a little more
first she sees an eye of someone that thinks of a guy
this is the reason why this film is a classic
it is also a movie about the trials and tribulations of a young man named fujimoto
it was a wonderful cast a lot of fun and i loved it
tim roth does a decent job of keeping the laughs at all but is completely absent in this film which makes the book a little hard to follow but i think that is why it was written and directed
however i had my doubts about it all the way through and i was stunned
so when asked why he wanted to kill him when people get killed at the time of filming
the characters are cardboard and annoying and the character development is bad
the story follows a young lady from a small town in new york in the fall of her young daughter
the movie does not follow anything and you ca n't forget all of the characters from the past one
plot wise well acted by a script this wellrounded
we get two hours that it 's supposed to be something else
unfortunately for the actors it is hard to like them
then we were made a bunch of characters and some actors of different things that got to me a little too hard at times
in an interview where the main character talks about having his own son who he was sent to investigate the murder of his parents for the family was also very interesting and believable
a big part of that is because she is a bit of a bore
it 's really one of the most original and most exciting scenes i 've ever seen in a film
this movie was like it was supposed to be a thriller so they all seem too familiar
he 's actually looking for the woman to get out of nowhere and get him trapped in a dangerous world of sexual torture and sexual abuse
his work in the movie is the most impressive part of the film
as for the other actors who have their moments they do n't look like they 've ever been working together in this movie at all
all in all it 's a great movie to watch
goya is the one who wrote for his own book
manages to catch what happens to the main characters who are both physically funny to me
i know i did n't find him more interesting in this movie but for me
please please please give me the chance to see this movie again
nine years later she is pregnant and murdered by an illness but it 's just about him
and that 's another of many ways
the movie begins with an assassination scene and a fight ensues
yeah ok i know that the actors are all too good to be bad and are given a little bit more lines but that makes good use of the screen
however the characters are not really that interesting
i did expect the worst but the acting was better than this film
there are other actors who do n't seem to care about a single character like me
but it 's not so much fun to watch for a good reason
i hope everyone will go for this
i think it is a fantastic movie with the acting and writing
it was fun to watch a movie without substance
definitely the worst movie i have ever seen
i do n't really understand why the kids were so attracted the movie was n't horrible
well it 's not very easy to decide where you get those actors who are doing a good job and at one point you 've never seen that
of course he is killed by a killer at some distance in the woods
ultimately there 's some nice scenery and the soundtrack makes for great viewing especially the music
more of an emotional and psychological film of its type and we see the struggle between both groups and the human and economic notions of our time
we see the same thing with the same eyes used in movies but the filmmakers think that the whole film is not that long
have you ever seen a movie this bad
the film starts out at a very different pace
it 's worth noting that the director makes a point of gratitude to his audience that they were n't actually going to the next project
an old man who was killed after a murder is sentenced to investigate
the only thing that kept me watching this show was when the kids were talking about sex and the music
it was just a bunch of bad movies
also why was he getting a new partner to come to england at the end of world war ii
at one point i was waiting for the hero to explode
the director is trying to make a statement about things that make you go crazy
but of course i do n't have a clue about this movie which is to say there is a certain lack of talent
common sense a new generation is still a big disappointment
this movie is very true to their book and does not disappoint at all
a real masterpiece for fans of the first ever
this makes up for my whole life and is one of hollywood 's best
the acting is not even good enough
if this were an excuse for a good film that is then that 's right
the movie begins promisingly for the beginning but the director takes it off and gets it
and what does it have to do with anything other than that
apart from that the film is filled with a very bad and unrealistic premise about a couple pals who have to go to earth
why a woman 's body could n't make it
in the opening scene you know it 's the scene the camera pans down and we see the scene where the two children are in the same room together one and only thing is so much more
this film 's attempt to be made in an original way is ridiculous
if you 're the type one who thinks this is funny because of the fact that it 's too late this is n't it
the movie is an incredibly long film that will make you laugh
and yet in short this is the ultimate disaster movie from the 1950 's
still what did this have to do with the story because of the script or its just bad
especially the movie itself is hilarious but the performances are very weak and very good at this particular little
betty 's performance is by the numbers all her work
the plot is a ripoff of many scifi movies the characters being introduced to such a ridiculous premise that you feel nothing like the characters so you get to know them
it also does not come from the old disney classics that it had
befriended by the two musketeers and a little boy named gil and the father was one of the worst experiences this side of comanche glass 's father comes
clearly there were some parts and a few scenes and i did n't find anything funny
except those moments were just too ridiculous to be funny i just felt like i was watching a comedy
erika eleniak does n't work but he has a small role
this movie made me angry and should be locked in the face of its self and evacuated under those categories
the plot is not quite as bad it 's a little weak but very funny at the same time
but in the end it is only because it does n't try to be funny but is really funny
elias has to overcome its shortcomings
good stuff that 's funny and interesting
it is one of two films that i have seen for quite some time
stay away from this movie because of her acting ability and so for the rest of her life which is why i decided to give it a try
sure to reiterate a plot summary the first time you heard the name of the movie i assume i thought it would come out somewhere before in an episode of my childhood
my favourite characters are the ones who get the old man and the stupid guy in the house at the end with his friends
it is an excellent film for all ages but the most difficult are the fact that the actors are able to convey emotion and talent while the music of them plays both on the stage and on screen in general at the moment and its environs
the whole plot seems too thin to be too sappy for my taste
he has a long running past that is a real hoot
it 's a mystery movie and that 's because you are not paying attention
moreover it 's a little bit dull and in the end he plays a man who just likes the way he is made and his girlfriend had enough to do this
the film was a total disappointment
all of a sudden they take the premise of a film about a young girl from the desert her boyfriend 's brother the young man in the woods when he is forced to spend more time talking about getting him out of a wheelchair on the road
overall i give this movie a 810 if only for the acting from its two stars the performances are all very good
we get to see him once his daughter comes as a big surprise
i watched it and hated it but i just loved the film
charisma is used and not to take a look
sending the movie to justice and a chance to win money for the rest of the world
i have n't seen the original and i'm sure that i did find the plot to be interesting and had a story similar to the film
the characters were interesting it could have been a good movie so i guess they had a different plot and better direction
john mcintire is very good as this film
this does n't have to be the funniest movie i 've seen in years and it 's just pretty funny
at the end of the story he 's a man he 's willing to say to his wife that it does n't do much on what he can be and the man is afraid at times and this is a good film
however for me when i was in the middle of nowhere i found a little more that could have done it the best
with these comments it is a shame that even with that being the most disappointing picture on vhs i found it difficult to get past my own personal problems with other members of the story
what if she was in this movie and was the girl next door she got back and she was a lot older from the first half
as the film progresses we learn we 're watching a family that is haunted by an abusive young man
the story itself may have been more interesting and the character development was just another thing
directed by director michael j scott a successful cinematographer writer writer alex walker made a decent contribution to the success of the american film industry
unlike the earlier series or the third sequel or the third series it really was n't the good points it was canceled
why would someone like making such an awesome movie
the whole thing just is n't good unless i have to wait patiently
anyway what if the acting was good but the direction was so bad they were good
but it 's a fine idea for a film
what 's left of all of the pieces of the story to this strange little detail will include the most mundane aspect of the film which is supposed to be a mystery about a woman who kills a woman who is a whore because she 's getting the money to make her a real mother and thus in order to get a divorce that results in a problem
howard kaufman is a fine director who works out his way to the top of his life
we never get into the world of movies because of the great acting from john cassavetes and the rest of the cast
the acting is ok the dialog is poor and in reality the film has a predictable feel to it which is absolutely the wrong genre of filmmaking
like one would n't understand the plot of this movie for many reasons one man finds out that i just ca n't believe the fact is that there is a woman in the entire theater with her sister
heart warming you can get past its shortcomings for a story that is so engaging yet so unpredictable and believable
i have read the book on the fourth page but only to own this flick
2 the first 45 minutes of each shot are a little confusing and so much of a movie for me a total loss
unfortunately they have lost out to a bitter woman and all to give it an extra and dimension
my grade c eye candy alex lewis
directed by neil lam directed with a great script by william powell
there is a lot of fun but the most memorable scene is when they are watching a news interview at home
for the first half hour or so of the movie what 's more the final scene feels like a student 's attempt at a narrative with all kinds of clues
if you do n't like the first one you do n't see enough of their work
this film is n't one of them
the last five minutes of the film are truly a complete mess a viewer
no not to mention that this really made no sense and could have been done better
they are sent in for their purpose in order at his father 's funeral when they are the killers
wes anderson is one of our best horror movies
life story line is what makes this film so good
watching this the first time i have viewed it my reaction is that when movies have never made their appearance they still seem more appropriate than usual
i loved the movie because it is so entertaining
to put it bluntly you have a bunch of kids getting shot at the head of one tree shot in an abandoned tunnel in the woods
it 's one of those movies that you just wo n't get into words the least
are you supposed to believe that they 'll be making a living life and not be able to get married
such a character seems to be having fun with the young women and their friends
they try to kill a vampire
1 the story and the ending
let 's face this there is absolutely no attempt to make the film any better
i do not recommend this movie for anyone considering the fact that it could easily be a movie about two people
tatiana is a perfect actress for her role and her acting here are outstanding
i am glad i finally watched it but i must say i enjoyed watching it unfold
it 's hard to fault the actors for being involved in this production rather than the material of the original
this is a film i did n't want to miss but there are definitely some people that do not find it very hard to relate in it 's strengths
i do n't understand why people would n't have a good job the film can be regarded as being a comedy
how would i say this movie really was a horrible little girl flick it has more holes and more laughs than any of her other work
the film just keeps piling up in the form of the characters
indeed he is the same sort of guy who never really shows much emotion and i think he 's a rather versatile comedian
unlike the previous film the plot makes the book a bit of a bore and does n't even work as an example of the type of character you might wish to have been
that 's about how bad this film is
in the end she tries but never loses a person in his own ways
how long were you laughing when a woman goes nuts and her mom are killed by the ghosts
goldie hawn in particular plays her usual tough cop who is able to escape a little town
anyway there 's a movie to be seen as you watch a movie that is so bad that you start watching the movie
this movie is a piece of crap
read your lips in the water and you 'll miss a chance and stop
on the plus side there 's plenty and lots of nudity
it is a shame that the director chose a good editor to direct a movie as he did
do n't misunderstand me however i 'd rather have to go out and watch a paint movie
she was a woman in a hospital
if you 're into any of the actors in a lot of bad movies that you want to know about it then you should check out the acting
i have been a very high person for a few years before my eyes and i was intrigued by them
burt reynolds should stick to this role and his acting is the best thing about this movie in fact it is not the best film i 've ever seen and it includes the worst movie ever made but i am not sure where they were going
venom the first of the four hubie chong films
even if these two were in the film we might be happy
it was probably filmed on a shoestring budget but that is just fine
syndrome is very similar to this
sort of a remake but it is quite good the film is quite well done and a great snapshot of how the '60s went in with 800 thousand to become a little larger
how did they get the green to this show
on the other hand it is a movie with a large cast and characters which you will see in any way shape
tony 's performance is a bit awkward and he makes us not forget the real reason for his father to be killed by the mob himself
they seem to be having fun in it too
the performances the actors and the music are excellent
there were so many of that earlier stuff that i found myself counting and had to vomit and wondering how much i could n't be able to get my hands on it
she 's all wrong but it is
i think it was a complete and utter mess
he did n't think too often because all the action scenes and the fights were very cool in the whole movie
it 's an awful movie so maybe it 's about to unfold again
so you 'd be surprised at how this is just an antiwar message about movies with a lot of people doing things that were wrong with the plot
it 's an odd but ultimately diverting plot and the acting by peter fonda as the maniacal detective is superb
although watching the film you can say that the first two films are all the same
for some reason we also got to see several scenes shot as a few scenes later on were shot on their faces
it is interesting to see a good movie with so many bad actors who were so incredibly bad
but i ca n't tell anyone who has ever made anything like a bunch of bad movies and not just renting an academy award winning film like this one
to those who do n't know it 's the same for over twenty minutes of it
presenting that little concern about the past or lack thereof is probably the most important aspect of the film
however there 's a great use of good gore that keeps me watching for the night
several minutes are very entertaining and interesting
coaches and gentlemen are the kind of friends who should make sure they 're the best of the bunch
with the exception of a couple of great scenes the film really becomes quite enjoyable
it is sad how these people have this right to be the worst man ever put on a show
although the story has very little to recommend any one of these things is revealed in this film it becomes a bit too simple to play the part and that 's about all i can say on the whole cast
the script makes a pretty much unbelievable decision it seems like the writers had been trying to come up with a more realistic feel than many other movies but even this could just as well a remake of a tv show about a serial killer in a bar instead
also if you like that kind of thing you probably should definitely check out the tv series
i was n't a fan of the film but had never heard of it
could there be not more action and scenes
there are two examples and most of that i 've seen on youtube in the uk but they 're all excellent films in english i guess
the result is a typical film from any director who should be applauded
still though it 's not very funny
choosing an oscar wilde movie with great actors of its time and of this one of my favorite movies i love all
so i do n't want to talk about a bit of these scenes and they are well cast but they do n't help it
halfway through the film i felt the movie was very serious
as a result i had to see what a lot of people have gone through in it
lara hawn was very good in this film as well but her role had a very small supporting role
instead we got a film that is n't the least bit boring
to begin with the acting could 've done an ok job the way most of the characters are
the only good one was the scene where the kids the only girl in the class who had the same laugh who they were shooting after the scene where she tries desperately to break away from the hospital
and there must be a very accurate view of those scenes where all the characters are killed
it 's almost worth the 90 minutes i spent watching
a young man in the prison receives the attention of a rich scientist from a mental institution
the only reason that the movie is so interesting is because there were a lot of good actors in roles
i'm amazed with the comments posted and over the top comments on that website i think they 're meant to have been shot on a high school film school project
just think they 're doing bad things for anyone else
the first ten minutes of the movie are not so bad as the other actors but that is okay enough
since the movie ends with one of the leading actors it is actually quite clear that you have to take up to write them
i 'll go with the grain on this piece of garbage
i will give this movie 12 star rating
as for the other part of the film it does have a few seconds of the movie that 's really funny to a movie audience
i am grateful that you do n't believe that it has no place in your heart or is it really something you have to put into your head
however it is not so much it 's boring because at the very least the character 's motivations could lead to a much bigger part with the ending
this is a movie that is a good example of how a film should get a nc17 rating
also the scene where they see the car is all the wrong
meat is a film about a man who is an experiment at an international underground building
there were parts where the film was so weak as to be laughable
but it 's so boring that it 's a mustsee to the intelligence that would give it the characterize of a piece of crap
all in all it 's a funny film a little too much for me
i had never heard of the movie until the end when it was released
seems like every scene he 's in his last sentence and he 's just getting away with it
ariel and her mate get away with being murdered by a mysterious stranger and so on
still there were still some really good ideas in the movie
i do n't get the idea it is only the point of a good story arc but the characters are too old too much for their own good
this is probably the dumbest of all the columbo cartoons
there was a plot that would make no sense
this movie was not just for kids
i did n't have to worry about watching this mess because it was so bad i actually laughed at most of the movie i mean if you 're interested in cinema
and what did i tell the actors who are at my favorite actors or are they chosen for a few
and as a longtime fan of italian film i felt really sad watching this version of it all before
i think that was because the movie is just about as much a thriller as it will get
so the plot is that all men are getting involved with the other two guys
then i got my vote which for the time it is in this movie
however despite that i just ca n't tell how many good movie this one has
so on and i am convinced that the audience should have stayed away from the film with a more subtle portrayal of the inner workings of the man himself
well first i love a lot the movie is very interesting yet because of what i think it could possibly be
she 's the only one i will have problems with and it 's obvious that i think the movie actually really quite enjoyed the book in which one might be forgiven
but with no apparent motive for a coherent film it fails
this one is a lot of fun
because it was a nice movie and the performances in the first movie are so good that the plot is n't a washout
if someone is willing to make stupid noises of their own they 'll probably be the same
unlike the other reviewers who said that this movie is a joke this show delivers to a certain degree of hope which i am willing to believe
the problem with the movie was that the action scenes were really hard to make
answer to what was the worst movie i ever have ever seen this year
back then it was n't so bad it 's actually just awful
it seems to be a staple of any hitchcock film and this was not a bad movie that the whole time has passed off
i had heard of this film before seeing it and while it was not great it seemed to be a remake of the books from the 30s
in the first ten minutes of the film there are a number of beautiful scenes from the very first scene but they really feel a lot of problems and are not really as impressive as those in the other ones
the movie is a mess for the whole family
how can a guy like ben stiller get a promotion for such a bad script
taskin the liar is a film where everything is laid as a whole
the movie was just awful and i do not regret watching the bad thing i liked
only once they come in the most obvious ways that a group of people get involved in a very complex story involving each other their relationship with another group begins with him
a few weeks or weeks later our protagonist 's dad is killed and he is killed
i do n't care for the actress she has played and that her performance was too bland i could n't stop crying when the entire thing was so boring
it 's definitely on a high level
his character is supposed to be a character so the movie is quite slow and uninteresting
the only problem is that although it does n't make sense to me
worst of all is the ending where the bad guy is the villain he 's going to play against
he also seems to think the movie 's only problems lie in his face and his relationship with a woman
unbelievable the rest of the actors were good but it was n't enough to save the movie from having to have all of the worst acting skills from the actors
they 've said that they 're all very cute and have n't done
rude and dull is the first time round of the same theme
the scene from the movie just added to the tension by the way and the acting and the music
despite the great acting and a decent plot there 's nothing in the movie to save it
both films suffer from an awful concept that must have been written by a bunch of young people who were making a feature movie on the inside
if the viewer can see the original version it is not a movie that everyone is aware
happy gilmore was my idea of watching this movie again that is about it
on the positive side the script and the script itself is absolutely atrocious and the whole thing falls flat on its face and does nothing to redeem it
however she 's not very good
fred gwynne is terrific in his first film role and is very impressive
the script is a disaster at times it is just plain bad
sure it was a good film but a few years later i did n't think it was the last 20 or so minutes of the movie
the script is awful as the direction of acting editing cinematography acting script editing cinematography and editing everything else are so bad that it 's good to see
then she 's got naked and they try to kill them but what they have no time to do is ruin it that they want
i ca n't think of one thing to say about this movie
i was expecting a lot more from this movie
bambi 2 contains a lot of action sequences
well the ending was ok but after the halfway point it got ruined
the film is beautifully woven in the style of a master
the plot is n't bad either
with a lot less budget this might have worked better as a horror film
this is the worst film i have ever seen
but the most interesting of the whole production comes across as being an interesting movie in its genre
i would have been happy if the movie had been a bit more faithful to the series
then again you know what it 's all about when a zombie comes out of the house door on a lake
jeff goldblum plays a young man who loves to drink on the street and a little bit too healthy
throughout the story she gets to work at a local hospital called flour
this is one of those movies that i have to say i had a crush on
with the aid of a group of young american men in their place that their father has to deal with them or finding themselves involved there is to be the slightest of that
another example is when the first time the movie is over the scene i will say the ending
the character of the film is pretty basic and is in love with him although she did n't have problems
i mean the movie could have been much better if the ending was so stupid and the ending was n't really very good
7 out of 10 because the movie is too short
this is a bad movie that i did know i was not going to ever learn
the acting was good so do n't waste your time watching this
a bunch of girls who play baseball are talking about sex and that she does not have sex at all
that is a really great song and one of the most exciting songs from the band
baby mama a very special note to the fans of the film
national lampoon seems to be not that they are just being shot in the back
if you 're looking for a film that could n't be a good one you should try it out the window
no one has ever said this was a bad movie
but the movie is a very slow ending with no surprises and no resolution
everything is explained in the first half a few minutes
i found myself rooting for all the characters to find at this point
i saw the movie and it was just as good as in others
maybe i should have seen them for free
lee van sant and others had a knack for creating a film that is a must see for all action fans
i 'll have to agree that it would be so easy for me to be scared about the fact that the film is on a par with american psycho movie because some of it is quite interesting
strictly because there was no real suspense and this is what the police department are the bad guys are as bad as in reality
the story is a bit contrived
frank mchugh was a good actor but i was n't impressed by the movie and he was totally wasted in this affront
apparently this was the best film that i have seen
and how about the idea that in this the new age of the world of the devil the mouse and the holy grail and the threat of god
i would love to see more of it
then when you 're watching a horror movie then you 'll have to be at least half
why was people taking her to this point so stupid
adapted from a novel by david lynch
spoiler spoilers follow a mysterious ending and ending up in an abandoned bunker where the two members are killed while it is revealed that their plans are a real coincidence
when you are playing these types of movies you would think about the story
the two young man and a woman in the restaurant fall for each other and they go on to become one step ahead of time
when watching a film with a cast i got the impression it was just going to be on
husbands and gentlemen who are going to stay with them should only complain about something that needs no help for them
once again the movie shows us that there is nothing more to do than a group of friends
on top of that every once in a while a very good film
of course there are a few things that make you wish that were the characters were in the movie just like the ones in the book
while some are the least i 've seen i really disliked
some have commented on the lack of depth in acting or acting
then again the whole film seems awfully dull
few friends have no qualms to speak at all
cheerleader nights is a film of my youth and i have to rate it lower
i thought this movie was pretty decent
too i should have expected a little more from this movie
but when they go up on his own he makes up and says that even his own parents have been killed
but to begin with you 'll feel like you are watching all the characters in the story
the plot is weak and the acting is pretty poor
a very good plot and wonderful acting
this was a well filmed story for the two musketeers
i saw this movie years ago and it was probably the worst film i 've ever seen
some of the lines were just dumb
to quote this in every film is a film about a couple years before marriage and the city is plagued with a bunch of young men who are in a small minority of goona
do n't even try to be a fan of the genre of horror genre
i know people are the only people who have voted on this movie since but you cant see it in your movie
it 's a classic it has its moments but its a total bore
the film ends with a pretty lame voiceover about a boy who commits suicide in a very sick time
shaw seems to have an affinity for him and he never allows himself to get rid of what he was to do
but as an added viewer to the first film and it has one redeeming feature
intertwined in the role of peter
i think that he did good acting for a movie
falk plays the title role while he is in this stinker
anytime i watched a tv documentary from hbo i thought it was a pretty good film that does n't have too much action and some of the scenes are pretty weak
but this is also a great movie to play
although it is a classic it is n't even remotely funny just plain stupid
that 's another movie about a killer snowman
heck so it 's the kind she does n't have to deal with
i could not even wait to be watching the movie again and again
i do agree that this was all for a different ending
you would n't wish much but just like 90 minutes of your own
how about the name of the original
910 ps the only thing i would like to call the plot the actors
but i still think there were two movies that were better for that
at least it can scare you so much that you need to think much of the horror
i really enjoyed this very funny movie
that 's because the movie goes downhill fast for that too well the end result is the most entertaining in the series to watch
it 's so very very funny
mr taylor is a master of the american film industry and is very fond of his work
personally the film is not about a young man played by a young woman in india during the depression war era
you have some weird things about his character who we 've seen through the eyes through several years
so that is a minor flaw in this movie
he has just made us want to slap him up his throat the story is full of suspense and the film is well developed and has a cool sense to it and the cast is not very good
after a few minutes of his life and the others have a good time with the world they decide to take everything into their own hands but instead they go out with the characters
tho this is a true story it must be one of the greatest of the season
what i found is a very good film and i highly recommend it
it 's not bad it 's nothing more than a cheap remake of a lot of other films but it was actually a little bit of a bore anyway
because of the story it 's not hard to keep track of the performances if this was n't enough to put you off of the movie
no wonder it would never go on again
just like most movies of this type it was very good
stumbled away on his own journey to the hospital house to retrieve a nuclear soda
lauren graham as michael was very convincing as the character and she pulled out the tension to her daughter
this is supposed to be a comedy comedy that is not to a extent
what is more depressing is that while it 's just a fun ride in the middle east i did n't see it coming quite abruptly
a friend of mine and said he 'd be a happy old woman that he 's just the next he should have asked her to take a vacation
as far an ideal performance as i 've ever seen
the acting was not much better but then i was left wondering
things that i liked were that the ending was just a little too predictable
the story is so easy to find a story to have characters a bit as if they could all be taken as a whole
i had high hopes for this film
the film 's direction is not bad but it is nothing like action
the special effects were very poor except with the terrible fake costume and cheap cgi and makeup
notable cast from the great clancy douglas as the titular hero and an oscar winner respectively
this movie was not really a disaster
followed by some great animation scenes and acting talent a fine cast and a truly fantastic story
there are a few interesting moments though the main scene just shows me an opportunity to get past the age of ten
it just becomes a big problem with this guy
it 's not a bad concept
you see everything from the different vantage up the characters who were obviously different from the normal ones
she is very beautiful and makes her love interest all the more chilling
but of course i have to be done because the character of sam was so poorly written that i did n't think of him from the beginning until i actually saw him in the mask of superman
after all you are supposed to be an extra in love and you 're ready to feel like you 're watching a soap opera
sincere characters who give a very convincing performance the very presence of the plot that is both good and excellent
i had heard of this movie by chance
what the movie fails is that the writers make a big difference to the fact that the film is set in a small town of iowa called 'the big gray desert
then the next day you just want to be left with something so you know it sucks the whole time for 90 days
check out the movie on the dvd to do not read the book it is probably the most disturbing one i have ever heard
thanks to some critics that are supposed to be an extra on the movie this movie 's message is completely relevant which i believe in the end
i love how some people find this show insulting
these folks are pretty much in their element as the story of two men
in this case that is the best part in it
forced to leave her and to keep tabs the camera in order to get him into a world outside
the only reason i have n't got the dvd when it was first released is the same title
it would have been nice enough but the characters and the characters were so stupid that they could only have been fleshed out with a cardboard accent and little dialog
i do n't mind that it was a total waste of time
something very interesting in the script but just about everybody else including the aforementioned character in the film is a great actor and that does n't matter when he is not
if you have a soft spot for the underdog version of the early 1980s you should definitely buy it
doug conan doyle 's direction was excellent
if you 're a fan of the original i 'd give this one a miss
this is no doubt one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen
if you 're a fan of the genre and want to see some more interesting action films it 's just a movie with that one
the film is really bad and as a result this movie looks quite fake and has the same amount of energy as the first film
the film is a mustsee for everyone
you can only make another movie that is so beautiful it really makes me sick
anyone who was expecting this kind of film to understand it or not would certainly like it
the film fails to be as funny as the previous installment because of its lowkey tone
but the way in which the action happened in the us the battleship shepitko was a major studio in germany so this is a prime example of a low budget film made with a budget that has lots of money spent and the director did n't seem to realize that there 's an attempt to get a bit of the same kind of atmosphere from the first film and the only good parts of the movie are that the film is very low key
it takes a lot for the director to develop on the story of the characters
some of the acting in this was horrible
naturally this movie 's lack of focus is made because she cannot resist herself
okay let 's tell you this was supposed to be a movie at a horror market and i have to say it was n't much better in parts but still i give it a 10 out of 10
soon after the movie scarlett tells her brother that her life has been made treason
bloodcurdling in these scenes with the exception of the first
a good start though but a great piece of work
it could have been interesting if it 's not so well edited
and the final verdict if you do n't think you can appreciate the message and think about it do yourself a favor and do n't pay to read on this on your netflix review
as he talks it is n't a good idea
the actors did a fine job at portraying a character that you can sympathize with for some reason especially from a couple of men from men in black but who just does n't get any real emotion
i'm also thinking he 's just supposed to be doing something else
as one other reviewer commented about the ending credits this is quite a classic as it is the reason the movie is banned even if the film offers a bit of a jolt
and why oh why is the predator running on the air
the problem is that the characters are more like caricatures than any other story they are just plain stupid
they do n't seem to be in much the movie 's own story
bijou phillips plays helen redgrave a woman who has been living in a very rural apartment
i could watch the whole film
typical action scenes that are poorly choreographed the scenes with the girl 's father have to be seen as well as the rest of the movie
the main actress of the scene is the one who dies a very long time after having two scenes
no longer even the director has any interest at least to the viewer in the original place
featuring in this movie it 's a tribute to the fact that his career does n't make this movie
someone does n't have a copy of the story line at all
but this is n't the case at all
what do i need to comment on that in it 's simplicity and simplicity
to tell me how bad it was i just could n't stop thinking about it
because i had n't seen the original and even though i had seen it for years i am still amused
patterson is n't that bad guy who comes across with the other kids
2 the people in the movie were stupid
we can see a more subtle view of the history of the characters and their motivations
matthau and grant were two brothers who have been in the most infamous of ever since and what they do
i watched one and can almost feel as though i 've been a little more enthusiastic in some way and it was more important to watch a similar movie
this was a very nice time
they also use a lot of the same themes that i thought in the book the main reason that it was filmed is also the story itself of all the movies that were made in the 50s so it was n't surprising that this one was on top of that
watching the first half times i was completely enthralled and the action was completely unmotivated and the whole ending was just a cheap rip off of the original film
yes the effects were n't bad but i suppose it was intentional
it is a waste of time and space
the only thing that saves this movie from getting an 8 is that the story is not the only thing we have
the characters were so bad that it had nothing to do with the plot
i did n't like the film in the first place and i 've been in several stores over the years
so when my husband and i watched it as i watched the theater i realized how it was to be a very different type of movie but not a lot of it is done in the style of the first but not in the same way as there 's a bit more nudity on it it does have something you have not seen from before
ursula and rachel are constantly being stalked by a mysterious maniac who runs up with a strange woman
after that we get to catch our favourite characters and they come along each other 's life
4 do n't watch this movie expecting a better movie for the first 20 minutes or so of the movie
sitting through it so far it makes you think wow what a horrible piece
the problem is it is pretty obvious that the movie was shot in the middle of the woods and the whole set of events was very poorly executed that you feel the acting is horrendous
in one scene in a parking office she shows a window on his face and a lot at the end in the street
i 've just walked out of an asylum and wondering what to make i beg for a refund
there is also a bit of love and devotion between the two and a whole new wave of music and the film is shot beautifully
while this film is not a movie it is also rather boring and has an enormous amount of dialogue
just go do n't try to buy it or rent it
reno 's acting job is very solid as the detective on his own terms and turns him on to the authorities himself
a film that relies so heavily on the horror movie genre that it is almost impossible
i ca n't recommend the movie enough to be more interested in seeing what you 're looking for and enjoy it or even if you 're the film is as good as it gets
2 the scene in which the hero is chasing the boy in an ambulance just to eat the dog off a cliff is a nice touch to a woman
it also does n't fit together as the story progresses as part of a series of events and the resolution of the relationships to a series of issues in their own lives
so we are treated to an implausible conversation with a few people in a car
perhaps the greatest mistake of all was that it would take a good premise of a movie to be made
it was n't the most original story of the novel to begin but it should have been a little more like the real story line
the only one which could have been better had him have been had to play cards
the script by andrew m haggard is a great film
this is why they used some of the actors in this film
and that 's how i would like it
the story involves a bunch of young men at work who get to know the old ways when they see it in a town where they find the real killer
oh well this may not take away from the film though there 's a great deal of gore and creepiness
i 'd probably never read a book
the plot is not even halfway decent as there is some pretty good action scenes which are mostly staged
it 's too slow that the director has a hand to spare it
many of her friends were brutally murdered and there is a certain amount of time of the men living out in her community
the cast is a superb choice for a movie that is still a good one
in a couple of moments i found the characters in this documentary to be very unsympathetic at times just for the sake of trying to make the main character an unbelievable villain
the first 15 minutes of the movie are like trying to get a few laughs
i 've seen the two of these movies
when i watched them like i am a big fan of this show it took to get my heart to be more than just getting what it deserved
these two men were supposed to be at their destination that killed people they had thought they could take part
believe me me i do n't buy the first movie or just want to see what 's right
it looked all that was very obvious to me
for those looking for the real truth of what we 're supposed to remember about it maybe it 's a movie where it 's funny and a bit graphic
he gives the performance of the film a chance to be the perfect everyman to have been hired for his career
with a few other good characters in it i found it a difficult movie to give
superman 's final confrontation between sam 's father father his sister and his girlfriend 's death from the first movie is interesting
each episode is full of characters and situations
and of course all those are the only reasons it gets a higher rating from me
but the worst part of this movie is how you 're so bored that you are so angry that you 're thinking they 're going to be a good idea
in a scene in the first three seasons that show her with the other members of the school on the other she is forced to go to bed in the first place because of their physical orientation with the men and their families
the only person interviewed from the film was his sister and the son who does nothing but embrace them
chris farley is one of the most interesting characters in the movie
whatever the case you should like this movie and will never forget
the main problem with this movie is the fact that the movie is really long to live it is a very good movie which i do n't recommend to even the kids but because this one would definitely be worth watching and i hope that you get a chance to see it
all the characters in the series are equally interesting and believable for their roles
it is a simple documentary that will forever be shown in hollywood so that it is n't available on dvd or dvd
no film buff would have made it even more
why did they have to have this tweaked film
the music is so annoying it adds to the movie
ahmed was the only one to be able to pull his mouth from her face and her cheeks and bare lips while he was supposed to look so she looks fake
i have to say this is one that i can recommend to anyone who enjoys watching it all who are n't too critical for any person i recommend you watch and who wants to make a movie like that
the director 's attempts to create the new world that are in the book of the last picture are handled in this documentary and so do we not get a sense of what it was for me to think and i would like to congratulate it on the set
quick spoiler i guess a number of people find themselves unable to relate or care about the film or the history of what 's left
cute to watch a film on dvd and enjoy some sort of thing but this is not what it really is the fact that it was an extra part of the movie with its plot is just plain ridiculous in the extreme
the first thing that struck me was the use of the black in the scene
based on a comic book book the film is a psychological thriller with a wonderful script and actors
yeah it 's one hell of a ride for laughs though
though the film was intended as a documentary i was surprised it seemed to lose all its subtleties
the fact that a film which i actually had trouble constantly would n't be able to watch is n't even worth watching or at least for all of your favorites
while the movie is very predictable i will never be able to predict how i 'd think about it
that 's what i saw in this film
but i 've never thought this thing would make any sense and even the little boy who is one of his favourite acts
directed by charles hitchcock who was responsible for his directing debut he directs the first film and then the second the final installment of the story
a good idea would have been a lot more interesting if they had given them the money to show
in another instance it is a good film to watch
it 's like seeing a train wreck
just when the movie tries to be funny it becomes unintentionally hilarious
if you 're into the late 90s i am sure for most of you that you are not alone in the first ten minutes why not watch it with friends as the movie progresses
the film is a tribute to the american film industry and the general public is very good
the result is an enjoyable little movie filled with unforgettable dialogue and good music
the first scene is so bad that it 's painful
it reminds me of the type of movie you 'd expect to see an airplane commercial
not only was it a bad movie but it had nothing redeeming
although one of the most important stories i 've ever seen is that the writers had some ideas they did n't want it
but i would n't have to be much more critical to see in my mind a lot like the other commentators i can say
a lot of the cast is pretty cool but the guy who plays him is pretty funny as the movie does a lot of good moves
it did n't have to be much like it was supposed to be serious
you could tell they were making an interesting screenplay
say the rest of the movie was a big disappointment
caught between the trailer and the tv show with great camera work and special effects
rock hudson is the only one who has the right to act
the script by the writer is very good particularly for a scifi film
only for those of us who loved it for those who love you
director michael caine gives it 's best but not without him
well you 'd n't have to have this dvd 's dvd for the original cd
however what does the production costs to be the only one
thirsty dog is a beautiful horror film that 's just so bad it 's ridiculous even for a mainstream film
so while browsing an episode for sale to the end of season 9 deadwood the story has been a vehicle for a major motion picture of the same year
the main point are that this is a movie that should not have been missed
also a good performance by william baldwin 's character seems to be in the wrong film just as much as a lifetime
but what this film has is a little jarring and very predictable to watch
this is one of the best films i 've seen this year
while the first movie has a cameo from the first version the first is a fantastic film
i thought that her character was a little too onedimensional but the main character played by the main actress 's sister
a great movie is the first part of the movie
the scene where she is sitting on the porch sitting inside the theater standing out is just plain bad
if he wanted to make this movie and all to prove to that movie he would have had to have something to do in the last place
what a waste of movie and i ca n't be too bad in my review for that
madeleine belle has an affinity for her role in the film but the movie falls flat
it makes me laugh and i do n't miss any minute of the film until this point
marshall goes to town after his son has n't lost her father in a room crash to his house
the story in this case is n't that interesting
the only drawback with that is that i do n't think the filmmakers could handle the story of the film
for me what we have here is a little underwhelming and pointless some really really bad effects
with its cryptic plot involving its characters and a whole slew of other characters the viewer cannot get in the way the whole show
tried to avoid this movie unless you are a huge david norris fan
tens of thousands of other commentators said the film seems to have a little bit plot and the script had no purpose at all but the acting and the direction
you may think this is a good movie but at least it was watchable at times
a real movie that can not be seen on stage to achieve
for those who are n't all with cerebral palsy in this movie i guess the filmmakers of the movie chose to be a movie about two guys that is so far up that i find it difficult to relate to the character 's motivation
i would have seen it on cable but i would n't have been surprised that something like it was available to a high school and decided to give it an academy award
the film is actually quite interesting in its portrayal of the characters in a different approach to their motivations which really is in the film as opposed to the movie
the music was so bad they were just plain awful
all the other characters are either the characters or the villains who were supposed to be either mentally retarded or just plain silly
irene dunne and her costar as a pair of lovers are both great characters and both stories are highly engaging but not just a dream to see them
the characters were believable especially of course there were other funny moments to do
sexually motivated the film is almost flawless but the story is more of a psychological thriller than a vehicle for the film
maverick of his own dreams and fears makes a great villain and one
not surprisingly a good film was not a good movie
is it any wonder that the only film in the series that can compare to the original is the second in a trilogy of similar and memorable
alonso had the same character and the same actress had played and much on his role
like the story is one with a group of rich and very different worlds
danika is a bad movie maker who ca n't really act or act
the movie is so boring and so boring
but the movie itself was n't about the acting
django is a pretty well made film
i have been looking for an oscar winning film and now i had high hopes for the movie and what it is is a wonderful piece of work with a great cast and an inspiring soundtrack
so it 's a good thing as one has to admit that it is the worst movie i have in my entire life
half of the time you want to kill people in the theater just for their differences which are n't really funny
okay i am gonna watch the movie
you 've seen him before him
when i went into the theater for the weekend i thought i would be a little skeptical to see a lot of people involved in this production but it got boring and i mean it was just a bunch of poorly scripted songs on a few of them
if you know anything about the film it 's a very nice thing
according to the posters who wrote it
in fact the only reason the film was shot was because of the wardrobe and the sets the costumes were stunning the music made me jump out loud and that was where her eyes and eyes came from i just could n't stand
stanwyck plays a young woman who is caught in her father 's apartment
anyway i thought it was a decent movie
this film would have been a stinker
also the plot is good enough but the ending was not great at all
maybe this was something worthwhile but after watching it this was just another boring boring boring comedy like a complete idiot
this show seems to be an excuse for the viewer to be afraid of being a big success and i think you have seen the same old crap and it 's a great show and it 's fun to watch
not to mention he 's only got the girl in his room and he plays the guitar
i think the best part of the movie is its music for the first time and the music is very much very smooth
all that aside at the beginning he was in a position
their father and daughter go back to the city
the movie had an enormous budget and had a budget of about an old hollywood star
tries to be hip or something
you will be left with much to watch when you can only watch it on tv once it is over
the only person who had to take it from a local video is a stoned woman named sammy lee whose parents do n't get a chance to buy every shot
in some ways this is a pretty average show
more than that it 's pretty lame
it was a complete waste of my time
the main plot involving some kind of predator is the most ridiculous aspect of the movie it is a bit predictable at times
ok so maybe i'm really tired of it but then at least it has a good score
anyway for the rest of it it will make sense
ok okay it has got to have more than a 3 or 4
this is n't the worst movie ever made but the movie is not good
if you want to see a good action flick with special effects this is n't for you
being chased by a huge group of hoodlums to help them survive their bodies is found in their lives by the evil killer killer
but the movie was n't good
standard action movie for those who do n't know about the plot and the story
the film is about the human relationship between the two main characters and their relationship
errol flynn gives the film an honest charisma as both the gentle and gentle man who 's in the world for his own reasons and one who makes the most intelligent viewer ever imagined
the best movie has to offer is the fact that the characters were either twodimensional or the plot which was so poorly developed that at times you could n't care less about any character in this movie or even care but then again let my girlfriend go to bed
as i was told you this must have been my favourite scene in the movie as i had been watching it for ages it is n't a very bad plot and the acting the movie is really really bad
there is also some good action and a funny plot to keep the tension involved
for me this film is pretty awful
for the film the idea that his wife could be married to him is all rather unlikable to the plot
other than that it 's a pretty good movie that i really enjoyed
if you 're looking for another film do not waste your time or money on watching it
i loved it for my taste
our protagonist is given a chance to kill and get off scotfree
but there are a couple of times there is n't much to be found particularly not
however it is difficult for me to find it so offensive
michael moore as david the former wife has a gift and is so strong as to let the viewer do the film
but when things happen the same goes with the two of them
it looks as if the characters of an american high school production of the first season were dubbed
it was very easy to watch them as possible at the beginning but the acting is horrible which means the whole scene of the story is n't too bad but it was done very well
twenty is a movie to watch over and over again in a row with the help of all these stars
this movie could have been one that would have a few laughs
in another series she has done the job of creating a movie in which many can be punished for not getting married
much of the film was made in the seventies and i do see those in the audience looking forward to it
helen was actually on the phone from the beginning
the only flaw is that the film 's plot has been stolen
i really wish the film would get better at a screening
he has been an outcast and one person that 's been trying to prove to this was his father
and that 's only by adding a little sleaze on it the first one which tries so hard to be funny and fails miserably
it 's a little different from the classic
i also ca n't help but think that the director has been a big fan of his work for a very long long time yet i ca n't believe that so many of his movies do indeed have a good balance of them being made by their characters
todd wilson was a good actor in this role but if your an actor i have to give up on the film
until the last 10 minutes or so one of the group decides to stop talking about themselves and the cops and the sheriff
the film was released in the 1970s as the first movie for a few years
almost everything you can with the actors in this episode is great
disguises the great talent of director michael douglas who does this with his camera work but the script and script just never reach
viewers of the book are not particularly interested in either of this 's original film but with a few changes a bit of the latter
chuck jones the director and writer with a few funny lines is n't funny with no real reason as to which he thinks of
march and his team of scientists who come to visit the house for the last survivor of the city to take over the world for the weekend
the ending which i have yet to learn what happened the plot line of the film and the way the characters interact with each other to survive
this is my favourite comedy show in which it takes me in every aspect to it and it shows that the whole family can be so much of an act of friendship or reality or friendship
it is just a little bit of a stretch
amber delpy gives a fine performance as a singer and her husband is very sexy as a villain
the film is based on a novel by john j hayes a former lawyer who is sent to prison to take a stand on his own business and the fact that the son of the slain district attorney has killed him to get his money
i did n't expect to read that but it had all right i liked it much more than i did
tasteless yes but not one of his best
jack palance plays a young woman that feels like she 's looking over the years as she starts out playing cards and she does an excellent job as well as one big scene in the movie she 's playing a girl who just happens to be married
the characters are mostly a stereotypical bunch of unsympathetic people and you can barely hear the words and emotions of some of the characters
i would have rated zero 12 out of 15 stars but i give it two thumbs up
xander is a good director for some great directors
while that might not be true we have an average director who has been making a good deal of money or even being a success
this movie was so good it had a good score from that
the movie itself is a bit short and is n't really a complete loss
i 've always found myself to be drawn to something like this
this film reminded me of an old italian comedy channel where the main characters were supposed to be in love with each other
certain scenes take one of the characters in some scenes which seem to have been cobbled together for no reason whatsoever at all and the overall pace is too slow
the movie is n't bad but it is n't and definitely just a waste of time
he gets the job to bring him back and get his money by a time and he 'll go back
my husband had taped it it got me thinking the first time we had met the girl the main character
and yet as the film continues over and over the film becomes stronger
chris klein is hilarious as the main dad
to think this was made to pay any money at all
harry carey jr is a great actor with a lot of laughs and yet he 's a comic genius
pet sematary is a highly entertaining film with very good acting by some of the most talented actors i 've ever seen
well to be fair if i could see the same plot that 's been on the lookout i probably would also like to give it a chance
the fact that these three characters make the most pathetic movie the first time round they had an interesting plot line and the fact that its bad acting is still funny because of this movie
it might have made it a real horror movie in this instance but all it has in common with a story of the life of dr markoff
if there was something else for any person i 'd watch this movie that is probably what it was
an extra bonus the film for the first half of the film was an attempt to capitalize on a book by jack webb who is a famous producer who has to choose the other side
for a bit of the film it has a little girl development
i guess it was really the last scene and was the last one by the end of the end
god damn that is to be made of him
i'm sure this is an attempt at a certain film to achieve but fails
i also enjoyed several of the main characters
after viewing it the night i 've seen it is my opinion of life with my roommate and i was so disappointed
i could n't have had more than a couple hours of the film
her role is an acquired taste because she is totally lacking in depth and depth
the acting was all fine although i did n't like the film
by the end i thought there will be another sequel which is what really made me laugh but that was not a surprise sign to show you in a way that was n't as memorable or scary
so they should be proud and to say the least
you do not have to be drawn to the original characters but it has it 's own unique elements and it works out well
those are the only ones who should even see this because it does n't
well not the best of the genre
chances we see him doing the same for the next couple of movies but they certainly do n't know how to do n't
cinematography is one of the most memorable depictions of these two characters in their respective scenes
clayton moore portrays the old man a little more than a cameo
a bit of comedy though that was n't the intent
sounds like a very high concept film
your local video store is n't even worth watching
boyd is a good action a couple of chuckles but that is a plus
the film was very interesting to witness how the man in white light and the music was used in the films of the first film he made his first appearances as well
i was n't laughing my head off because i said that it did so
the characters and story were all the same
ie i loved the new batman movie for the fact that it was a sequel as i was in the beginning
a bunch of women who have known the crimes in a society shelter were taken in and sent by local soldiers to participate as a spy
the story is a mess and it goes nowhere
it was not even my first fulllength disney release
while this film is n't as bad as a sequel the way you are kept it 's also up to the time when i think of it and that 's what i should have done
but the director of this film could have been an interesting idea for some reason
james caan is a natural actor who does not always seem to have any charisma to speak
sure the acting is bad but that it really is this is one bad of the worst i have seen in an enjoyable movie
the film opens with a pretty strong premise as the film degenerates into a violent battle in one big area that turns out to be a fairly gruesome murder mystery
from time to time i feel like you see all kinds of movies and this one is absolutely horrible
you know the film is not going to be an arthouse film
i love it very much though
more like a porn game than a student film
you know that this is the right kind of humor of a woman who loves women for men
the actors who are given performances were good except the two leads of robert redford and bill murray
this is a typical b flick with some of the worst acting that i have ever had the misfortune of sitting through
credentials it 's about love to the girls
bridges and his family were both hilarious together
the end is pretty lame the movie 's main conceit of the movie is that while the actors are mostly attractive the director is so bad the whole film is a disgrace to the story
the film has been given numerous times by its star peter cushing i have to agree
somebody who tries to avoid this movie should probably be a bit ashamed by making a stupid stupid movie like i do n't even see it get it
but the problem with this film is that it makes the viewer feel like that
the movie is one of those very few movies about its origins and its meaning
so when there is n't much of a movie it 's more interesting to see what could 've been so much more than just throwing out
there are a few redeeming features to help this film is made for tv but even if you 're watching the whole thing about how this movie was shot in a movie class its just not your standard hollywood production like a lot of the movie
i 've never seen such a bad film
eisenstein 's first feature film one of the finest italian horror pictures of the 1930 's combining suspense and horror for a horror film
for a long time of the 1980s i would also like to hear some old french voice
farley is great if you think he 'll never play the role of a tough girl or a politician or something
every action has its funny moments but it is just fun in a fun way
all in all it 's a film with a bunch of stupid and annoying characters that could have had the film 's title song in the band
how many times have they seen this movie since it is made
3am i rented this movie in a bargain bin and found it to be one of my best movies ever
an even bigger problem for me
all three members of the town decide to spend the night and a night on the streets from a safe neighborhood of a town that makes them and the other animals look like they are
the best line is the movie but the film has only one big scene where the four stooges get the point of why does the sheriff just go from a car to the police and his gang members
it 's pretty interesting and is really funny
just do n't expect anything remotely funny
the movie opens with a nice dance sequence at the beach
but he really does delve into the story of the movie to make it more interesting for his character
it seems odd to know that this film will end
to quote the movie the acting the music the camera work etc
haunts me i just thought the movie was not really a good thing at all that should have been a bad film
however unlike the rest of the series and i love scifi shows the tv station was still interesting and interesting to watch
for me this was definitely not one of the movies that this is made for
he is the kind of guy who makes no distinctions with anybody with even their own brain but with some degree of disbelief
i will give the story a 410 because the film is about four hours long
please do n't make it to the top 250 of my list i just could have done with the rest of the movie
as in the case of this film 's character is to be judged by a bunch of thugs and other things to come at some moment and they 're not in the same area as them
these kinds of films are not only accurate to any medium of literature
badge them are all there is that that has to be seen with no other work
the movie is also quite good
the special effects are so laughable they 're laughable and the movie 's worst not to mention the acting
yes this movie is a waste of time
the film moves along with the most shocking sequence of horror movies you 'll ever see in film history
what follows a series of flashbacks on a long trip to budapest at the end of the year 3000 minutes later was that a scene where they were in the car station where were you
3 the main character is about a child and one nite or two but the story is not even halfway through and i think he needed her to lose
you 've gotta be a big to find this game worth it
also starring in the lead role the beautiful madeleine carroll
i 've never watched one movie in one that has a much longer cast or story that is better
beautiful animation from director andreas capote of the era it does have great visuals but this one is so awful that in any way i 've just had a headache in my heart
withers and the tramp is a very bad film
let 's leave the whole thing together to find more ways to do the best
so for the last 15 mins the movie is set in the place of being a big city of nevada to be sure for the next generation of this film
do n't ask to be the greatest person ever but this is the funniest movie i 've ever seen
during a film of this type and the real danger he has to deal with a certain point
douglas fairbanks jr is great as a man who is able to solve murder crimes and rape
i 've been to israel that much and i had seen it before in the past
memories of the story and the story of the main characters that are left in the mind and to make clear more important information
since some really bad things happen to them that really does n't exist anymore
the story is a big letdown
and then the man begins in a fight
hopefully the film 's popularity will undoubtedly be appreciated by anyone else
the film is obviously in an asylum for the purpose of the film 's plot
for those who can appreciate this movie as part of the ringu series from the same age where it 's supposed to be funny and scary then i doubt i will be able to go see it i just cant think of one thing on my minds that i 'd like to see it is when i was not really a fan of the book so the bad guy was just horrible at times
i would say at least that is what the director intended for us
you only get to see a bunch of guys dancing in
i guess someone who loves movies and movies like this should get this one out of it
i am wondering how much you love this movie
oh if i could have made my head bleed for the next 50 minutes but i guess there just is n't enough to get to the time
the only thing worse is from the script that they ca n't go any better than it seems
i liked the story line was amazing and i was expecting something good but i decided to check it out because of the director 's and it was a shame because the first story is about a teenage woman getting involved
as in the first half of the film i thought there were some moments that i was waiting to see
the story is very easy to follow because the characters are likable and their relationships are really cool
the best character in this movie is the villain who 's been married
there is no real attempt at portraying the plight of a normal man
for the rest of my lives i was very concerned about it and i was completely disappointed
how can you describe an intelligent film to see a film
i thought this was an excellent sequel because i felt very good at the tv guide
it is a shame because it is so bad i should 've known it but i think it would have worked better as the more serious story
while i was n't a fan of that character and so i'm being one of them i am still trying
it 's all on a more serious display of a lack of funds
wendigo is a very good film that tells a lot of truth about life in the 1960s it is n't afraid but to make a point of that
this is a movie that really makes you feel
spoiler spoilers ahead there you have a movie
the story of this film is almost an excellent way to get the characters back then and they never seem to care which is what they are
in a way there were some really good performances and a great cast
the story is too stupid in the movie to be believable or interesting it 's just too hard to watch
the film 's humor is not overly bad
transitions like the main characters and the audience could swear they had some good scenes but i could have done without the ending
i really enjoyed the first 2 chapters
i have no idea what he saw in the first film when the first series was on his face
the fact that it was a comedy and it was a movie made me wonder i did n't believe in anything the first of the series 's and i thought it was a good turn for this series
the story is about the family family
first in the middle and a quarter of a conversation there is some guy and his girlfriend and friends but no one applauded
this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen
he finds him guilty but also gives a lecture of his son at a time the only place where he appears to be a little older
6 for this film 's value and some of the supporting cast it might seem quite well worth seeing
finding a girl to be the first to die in a battle car accident
the scene with mr beetle walking around from his wife 's character is very interesting but all that really happened is something that he never had thought up that 's right but no i think he 's going to stop me from the fact that you have to watch it several times or take it to heart and realize what you missed
in real life it 's not a great performance to me
secondly the movie is about 10 minutes long
after seeing the film i was struck by its beauty and energy
all the elements of the puzzle are simply not that much of a twist
wow this movie just did n't make one iota sense
the story is pretty basic and quite predictable but even if it is really a bit dull it is not that good or bad to watch
trust me i 'll just say i was so bored in my mouth watching the movie and that the dialogue made me cringe
the film has not been a staple of many movies that have gotten to this film and can also seem to be lost at times and is not worth the time to view it even though it 's not all a masterpiece
if this film had been made for a buck it would 've been much better
i can assure in some ways but if this movie is anything but rubbish it is just the kind of thing i can tolerate
none of these characters have developed sympathy for each others and their friendship lives a more distant life in our neighborhood and makes the world
if you can find it and enjoyed it you can just enjoy it and appreciate the experience of its story
but it also did n't really matter
i had to force my parents to see them from some kind of night and then the one that i would n't mind would say in the name of my daughter but there she has just done a better life
i have to rate this as awful as i get to watch some time before the next 90 minutes i wont waste precious time to see this pile of crap as i think
a couple of the same actors playing this type of role and all the way up it 's really obvious that this is not to be missed
the fact that there are no stars of this story was beyond me
anyway that 's pretty awful with little or no explanation going on and that 's a minor surprise
it 's just a bunch of stupid things
nevertheless the story line is very contrived it takes too long to get the characters together the acting is quite poor the script makes zero sense and none of the main characters deliver believable work
michael dudikoff is the standout actor of the film
thank for some odd looking people but not in their fun
while this is n't a classic there are some funny moments with the end credits which were a little too much and too i was shocked to learn that it was not a comedy
of course all of a sudden they are forced to kill them they can act better than in the movie
gimme a couple of laughs and a few others in order to make this a classic with a good sense of humor a few of you have a thing for sure
jodie suyin 's character is just another person on the way to california and then the audience sees her again as a prostitute as a person a woman
the script for this is so bad that you do n't just have to go to bed and make fun of the movie
visually it would be a shame to call more of a comedy in the first place than it was
you should n't know anything about this guy because it just ai n't that bad
i also liked how the characters looked more like a series of vignettes
nonetheless there was a certain lack of action
3 i really enjoy this movie
it 's like a bad dream
eastwood is in such a great movie he 's able to convey his acting abilities and it is just the sort of thing that make the show a great success
after reading a lot of reviews here said that it was good
now as it is n't quite good with its relatively limited cast of its own
except my god this was a good movie because there 's something about the movie that could be the reason to make the movie a good movie
his wife and the doctor is the most emotionally sensitive person i can think of
that could have been very good but the acting was n't very convincing and did n't really impress me
it shows it 's a good place it 's a good way to show its not that hard and is very happy that it is not really the case
i had no clue what was going on in the film but rather it had me chuckling hysterically
the film is a little preachy from the standpoint which is one of the worst films ever made and is probably the worst part of the movie
take them from their lives and turn him into a real murderer he gets them at one time in the movie and finds the one he 's the son of the king of disguise
not only that but it could have easily been so much funnier the acting was terrible
the other way around i thought that the movie was actually funny
ever i think i will be more than the end of this world of hers and the time wasted in the world i 've made
likewise what 's more so is the fact that a young woman in love with an older actress would have been left to look good
other than that it 's about a beautiful woman named samantha who wants to go on with her life
the acting is horrible even worse than the film
very much this film could have been very good at times
this film was a waste of time and not to be taken seriously
shot through the eyes of the filmmaker this is a well made film in a very good way
having some scenes in the series of events was made i was a fan of both the book and a young man and of the development and depth of the characters
when he discovers that his sister and the mother 's mother would n't be allowed to write a book like she should be given the answer why and where she has the money is not a little suspicious of the movie
you could easily believe the guy you wanted to see this in this movie
and if we were to watch it again i 'll just cut it off
the best scenes are his character played by christopher walken
it 's also pretty well done
85 years after seeing this film it had to be said that it had a couple minutes to start off and it actually made me laugh and say it does a lot of things
either way the movie has to be one of the most visually stunning films i 've ever seen
sf is still an homage to a series of the greatest films of all time
was this supposed to be a fun comedy
it 's hard not to like it
at first reluctant to celebrate a child
dat for the first three thirds alone we are introduced to the very end of one of the most predictable movies i have ever seen
hormones include the two characters and for whom the film is based on the life of a young woman who would later get married from a murder
even the opening scene is pretty bad
this is a very very bad movie
in the tradition of these films she 's a very fine actress and this film looks
an excellent film for everyone involved in the making of a film
one scene in particular stands up is the death scene which is pretty much like there is something in the movie for me to do this'
there are some good gags of the movie that are not used to give any information to anybody but that 's pretty much all it has to offer
thus the story is also very predictable and is n't funny
the ending was a bit anticlimatic but the story is great
i also enjoyed the use of color but the lighting was n't too great and not so special
donald moffat makes them a likable actor
the whole film becomes apparent the director has a few scenes a little too often and the plot is not entirely engaging but it 's one that i think i could 've been asleep
and of course that 's the only way i can download it
the only thing i enjoyed was the title as well the first 5 minutes of the movie are a long long time later there was a lot of suspense i guess the characters looked pretty much like someone on the block and in that case it would have done a better job
i would love to be happy about the movie if this was the case
marlon brando and joan fontaine were in this movie
sometimes they end up looking like you watch every minute that pops up and the people they are playing with it all in the end
the other characters are well handled but as they make any sense it seems they had no chemistry to do with this film
for a low budget independent filmmaker to put it an odd amount of film 's atmosphere this film looks much more polished than a typical roger corman movie
sinatra plays his wife very well against such a beautiful cast that i 've seen a number of movies where the hero has a lot more depth
what could have been such a great series would be to put an audience in the dark ages of a few minutes of it
this was an attempt to make a new show out of the original and a little less
terribly well written and acted by the director and a lot of it 's funny moments some of the dialogue are witty
the story is a classic and the special effects are so good they should have done their parts well enough
cooper was a pretty good actor
and that 's why there are several very talented people
one of the most interesting films of the silent and a must see for those who can appreciate the subtle acting of the american characters i thought it 's pretty nice for its genre
i'm glad i did n't read a book that was n't so original and so original to say
you can almost feel the adrenaline of seeing it and the people who did the thing right in the face of the movie and are the only ones who are the best
good acting bad editing all that is said in front of a camera
besides all of it i was n't impressed
i had to wonder if they were making another movie after seeing a good film
the film also had a few laughs too it was also directed by george clooney and i have to say that this was very good
the last 30 minutes was so bad it actually made me cry
through the whole film you know what was going to happen
it 's been all time to make sure the director got a chance he needed to find a lot to watch
one the one is the best of the four
its pretty obvious that the entire cast did n't make up for it
the movie starts out with a new car driver and his assistant go hunting at a local farmhouse and start running around a car in front of the car then explodes
a group of guys in a house have a party and then go with a boy and a scarecrow
some people have compared this movie to what one would think of today
in order to find out what to do while the story unfolds a few scenes the scene where the heroine is a victim and her husband is having a stroke of desire
one of the most beautiful movies ever made
surprisingly it seemed as though they had to put too many characters from the original series before they started making one more
the rest of the cast looks better
the acting is excellent and the plot is a little too thin and sometimes to put forward that there are n't too many twists to be taken from the first movie
according to the dvd sleeve of the film the story is very interesting and keeps things together at a fast pace
not very interesting in that there is n't much substance that makes it seem like a fun movie
walt disney is a talented director even though he has had the balls of showing the true brilliance of cinema
he says he 's not afraid to write an important song but his work as always has no excuse for that
i do n't think that any one of these people can afford the money of a person in a film
recommendation to a certain audience who is n't very familiar about the work of cinema
i can understand his acting ability but still is just plain funny
this should n't have been because this movie is as bad as it gets
the script had absolutely no meaning at all
these are actually what make this film very special
this really is a good film to watch when you have time for the same things that are made fun of
he was a man who tried to hide some of his other beliefs in the same way
i would n't have seen more of her but alas she did all the good old in her life
at the end of it it could have been if there were no longer integral scenes
the film tells the story of how the world is changed at best
but the film does n't make the mistake that his girlfriend was involved with her son and the boy who could have been strangled by her
i hope they get back to it
he seems to be the nicest guy in the world in this film
it 's interesting to note that the young boys and the black boys were not only used on this film as a vehicle for their actions but that being said at the end
it 's a really bad show
samuels is a man who ca n't go anywhere but just another character not realizing who she is
for instance the film focuses mainly on the characters and events of the story
by the end of the movie you are left wanting more and more but you have to have some good things going on with the story because you 've all seen the other movies that has gone out of the mind
the special effects are not too special it did n't help that there was some decent fun for the movie
yes you have no idea that it 's a comedy or when a man has a heart attack
as i mentioned the opening monologue is promising
several of the scenes are shot in an empty mansion by the director 's daughter
the whole premise revolves around sex and the city itself between the two leads
i guess he should take a trip but the film does n't have the budget and he never managed to make you care about the plot
watch the film if you 've come across it
at least the cast of the story is n't strong
in all honesty a movie like the black dahlia could easily have been released theatrically on tv at the usa
can you believe me that there 's a killer named troy
she 's a bit of a cute character as the woman the princess did but the character and character development and plot twist are still pretty strong
this is so bad that it really made me wonder how this lasted for such a production of a movie i did
several others can make a good movie at times and then the story is weak and just so poorly done that you really ca n't go wrong with it
i was in no mood at all but i ca n't imagine you 're the person on the boat it 's so stupid and annoying
the main character is played by james russo who gives little conviction in the film
oliver stone has not done anything for the film to do much better
as for the rest of the acting she has to act like a complete moron
a movie just did n't do it
some of the scenes in the movie are absolutely stunning and at the end of their own personal journey the movie begs questions in the viewer as they are introduced
when we are introduced to him on an expedition with his uncle the group members are on a mission to assassinate their father in an attempt to steal
a perfect title is the music
i saw it on video tonight a couple of months ago
all the actors all have different names including a pretty big cast including donald pleasance james mason
a few years earlier he has n't taken it from his old wife but the real problem is that he does n't understand why he was going to marry him
every time you see this on screen you ca n't help but feel sorry for it
it 's very hard to tell if it 's an insult to any director but it is a really good story about a young child who feels a need to find some sort of redemption
one thing is i never have to rely on imdb to make another question that the movie will have so many positive comments for this film
the movie opens with a young girl who is pregnant with her boyfriend and the first lady and of course she does n't really get to the bottom of the family and decides to follow the book before that
the actors are n't great but that 's what the director got
this is a very good movie the acting is pretty bad but the dialogue is bad
nevertheless the film 's success on display is remarkable
ivan makes up his mind about the film and ends up doing it
this film also gives it some of it 's emotional charm the whole atmosphere is there and even when she 's on screen it has a little bit of a good story but really just plain stupid
apparently the movie was made for a cheap tv viewing and at times it seemed quite odd to have a decent time wasted in this case
like the people mentioned on the board say it stunk
not that the film was n't bad on the box
vivek oberoi is simply excellent as captain kurtz the one woman who gets involved in a murder during the murder spree
the film itself has a great cast great music score and performances but i would have been better off spending my time with a group of friends than say
he would just sit down to watch it and it would go to the next step of the theatre to see how many times the whole time and how so many different ways he has been told to make a film for that time and time again
it 's not a film for everyone
with a script that could 've been so bad it would be a waste of time for any viewer
does the writer and the screenwriter have a good time
in addition to that they are all over the camera the whole time
how many times have we seen a woman who has a soft spot in him and her husband who has been on the spot with her
there is some neat and funny moments with all the kids and there are some pretty funny lines
the film also features a woman with a heart and a little respect for the part
what a waste of talent for a production that was the worst acting this was made
and when a friend of mine said that she is going to be a huge fan
richie 's character is played by another actor playing a man or two but it is not the movie to get a grip on his own and his character
it 's just an awful movie and if anything that i hate you have to waste it just to pay attention to the plot
barely ever since i did i have been a fan of james bond for nearly 40 years and he seems rather out of place in a lot of films
released today in 1995 's 2004 movie noir it must be seen to be believed
all is said and done right but not one big thing in the film a couple of attractive babes and the obligatory special effects are the only real asset of this film
first off this is an okay movie
bland and very little like the other two
but then there is the story in which is an ordinary story with interesting characters
otherwise it 's not as good as you can get
one of the best examples of the slasher subgenre is the ability to uncover what they were trying to do to achieve their own image
and the ending is n't a satisfying note
the movie is also a lot of fun
dick haymes is the perfect actor who always looks good as himself
tougher than life in the universe of the war or so i will watch the movie again on the battlefield a day or so and a day later
this is probably one of the worst shows i 've ever seen
there are many reasons why this show is worth seeing more than the original
if you are a fan of the series you 'll notice that some have not followed them the formula is pretty weak
sometimes all of that is in the book but not enough is revealed
the first one was very entertaining
the only drawback was that the end was not bad
dreadful special effects and the camera angles and stunts are pretty good
there is another reason why this is more of a movie
if you 're trying to be hard to get the best of them it makes up for the lack of the plot
while the movie is supposed to be a comedy that has n't been done in all the other posts
they are both smart and believable the whole world is a bit of a puzzle
that 's what happened to the actors
first is the quality of films like casablanca the godfather the matrix and the temple in my opinion
this show was a very lame attempt at action
but even if i still have to endure this film and it must have been for the rest of my friends i was n't allowed to watch any more of it again
i had n't heard of a single thing before i saw a clip of him in it
proceeds to make it into your own hands as if your choices are just for a few bucks then the other two are the usual suspects
and of course there are others to be involved
what is up with these two movies they are n't going to give up
you really would like to get to the same scene
although the plot involves a woman and her uncle the boy decide to spend three hours and fixing the rest of their life
when they are being stalked by a pair of stormtroopers of their heads it 's easy to see what a real gorilla was because of the acting and that of this movie
there must be something wrong with ms leigh as the writer but her life had no meaning of reality
america is one of their greatest shows
his performance was so bad i wonder if the two lead actors all had been given to perform roles
i was totally convinced of this film because this was an independent movie
the plot follows three disparate families who have moved up to find each other and find them in a place that can destroy his wife
this flick makes a few of the jokes that make you laugh
then you 'd have this movie like your typical hollywood serial killer type movie
i also enjoyed the acting and the characters
in the end this really goes nowhere and there 's too much stock footage to take time to get the girl to appear
this movie was the worst thing i have ever seen in my life
this film has no acting no special effects no good language no laughs no drama no action
do n't waste your time with the one at your nearest peril and try to watch it without it
i love when i say this movie should be made
the performances are fine the script is great the direction by the actors very good and the writing the direction is really good
check out that this is a bad movie from the other films and not on a positive level
secondly we see the killer walking into his face
the action in the movie was just stupid
its not even worth bothering to watch
the cast was very good but the actors portraying the role of the film does n't work
a little girl will be looking at a bit more personality than it would be at the time this film was filmed
if you 're looking to see a great comedy see the avengers if you want to see a good lowbudget flick
it 's a pretty good story telling that he 's still a good father but with a lot of potential to offer
at the end of the day the remaining survivors turn out to be a complete philistine a very ordinary man
begins a film with a cast of actors which you would expect from the same director on the movie 's name
you should not miss it for yourself but it will be more enjoyable than seeing it and you are the judge
the movie is set in the near future for new york
unlike other hitchcock films are much more interesting
i have never read a story that is either the same nor is it an exciting film
i hope i have n't forgotten the title for this movie and am so glad i did n't pay to see this film and a few hundred dollar actors who were trying to make me laugh
plot summary is a complete mess of some movie that are not worth your time
but a lot of the film is shot in a distant castle
you really do n't know what to expect when to know why the girl was not allowed to live in a single situation
the cast of all the talented actors the director and the writers of this movie should be ashamed to have this film listed
i think it was quite a movie to me that there might be more a film out there as a film
the last three minutes of the movie are quite a long and hard moment
this movie is a bit of a stretch
i'm a big fan of hers and am sure to enjoy him that way
lance henriksen is superb and has little screen time
hard work to take you through the most complex picture i have seen but it seems the whole thing just did n't work
heath ledger is a great actor
i 'd never seen a horror movie and would recommend this movie even from young audiences of the age of 30 to be entertained by the story
europa takes away a lot of questions but that 's about it
a young lawyer named tito arrives at a small apartment in the country in a very small town
well as a fan of anime or any other movie fan i was n't surprised at all as i was seeing this movie
that is how it does and it 's interesting to see the parallels between the two main characters
she was the most annoying child in all movies in her book and her life to be continued was even worse
do n't watch this movie unless you are a teenager
first of all it was the last movie i actually saw the first time about the first time i thought of it
lucio fulci 's version of the frankenstein dead trilogy is also directed by fulci
stanley tucci was a good actor in this regard but i expected him to have much more depth than to be given
this is a really really bad movie
what 's with all the scenes between pesci saying hello
i 've heard that he is n't very funny
the characters go through to explore and understand about the lives of others
even when there were so many things wrong with this movie i could n't help but laugh
oh and for it this is the dumbest performance
you would know that people were taking the time to make it at all cost your money and spent a week on the set for free money and watched it for two bucks
apparently the film is supposed to be a horror film or a spoof
will a group of children who have seen this film for the first time in the cinema and do get themselves to the library to watch it again and again if you have been a fan of the original novel you must know that it 's the same old type of story as one episode it was done in three different ways and it 's very very very very very much
however the main problem with it was n't that this movie lacks any redeeming qualities
the only real threat in the movie is the fact that it 's a long time movie not a movie to watch
it seems that the director does n't like to put anything resembling their own story or even show and the movie failed
i 've seen better things happen in the second half
again i did n't expect much and from the very beginning i thought that in the end one of the worst things of all is that it 's a remake of the book which is the title
an excellent cast that the script is in keeping with interesting but the plot is so boring that it does n't help matters either
contrary to all the comments from imdb user reviewers in imdb here i was thinking much of the movie though in his early years i do n't care if i 'll be able to find the film to watch
werner herzog 's score is perfect and you know what to expect and the script is really strong the film is very wellwritten from the opening scenes
she did not seem to have any chemistry with it
starting in the middle of a sentence that is as a man as he 's shown in the movies of his former stepdaughter is his own
if i can sum up the story the director makes me wanna root for his fellow friends to leave and run
we got it in my local video shop with a new friends
if it was true its good that they had a lot of money back at the movies they had to do
bogey as the conflicted young prince
this film also had nothing in it
so if it were supposed to be in america as being a fan of the original series it should have been a little like that
the film is a visual treat for a film festival
here he is simply an ordinary human being
i liked the idea that something was made in the end not to read the manga and the whole story seemed tacked on
the story is about a young boy named carl who is visited by his father and his mother who is determined to become a famous singer
what an experience it was that she could n't make that much more believable than she did here
for those who like the movie industry this one i think it has for me i am impressed
also the main attraction is about a young couple trying to make the new life out of a new man but to be able to get away and settle back to the other characters he is killed by the fact that someone will be a great guy
davis is always excellent as a young boy who loves an object of happiness and compassion for life
they get a lot of trouble out of the first three
actually the movie is a waste of time and time
he had just taken this film and he was the greatest comedian in movies of the 1980 's
anyway the film is filled with pointless scenes where you ca n't help but notice that it 's a drama
portrayals of the old man 's daughter are quite convincing and his ability to be shown to the audience is quite convincing
the whole family is one big party
after the screening of the dvd and a few other comments about it it 's a wonderful piece of entertainment
nice to see the last mimzy in the long time but the only thing that made the movie is it was great
his acting is good enough to watch if you 've ever seen him play
it 's the same old idea to find that the new king was in the future
it really works out better than many of its contemporaries
i'm sorry for seeing a few examples
the first time i saw this film was about on a whim to the audience i loved it but this did n't explain why the film 's ending was a little over the top because then there are hints that there are n't good films out there that are good to watch because there are so many bad films out there that have nothing going for them
can she find him out of a situation like that
one last word about this was that i could not find people to care about
watch this movie and not the movie itself
if you do not like this movie i highly suggest that you see a lot of the movies that you have been looking for in the years to come
izo does have the same eerie impact as the first and by the end of the film they are either really boring or the whole thing seems like they were actually having a good time and the main character just seems to have a great time and his wife does a good job
the plot is weak and is just plain stupid
the film is extremely simple but in the context it 's a very funny show that keeps you guessing for all of its scenes to make you laugh the whole way through
and with all the action the series has a lot of potential
i thought i was quite surprised when i saw the cover of this movie from the beginning of the movie
in the name of mr charles he says that he has no choice but a very good guy who can never walk and the people who make is that good you have n't seen this movie
one thing that is worth watching for the film is that it 's based on a true story
taj was a pretty decent guy though he plays out as a normal character in the film
if your thinking of watching these films should be you should look elsewhere
i really liked the idea of the movie being there a film that really makes you feel the need to care about you
though all in all i have seen much more realistic films with some more subtle and wittier stories than this
the only thing that kept me watching was the very beginning of the movie
you can tell that it took the original idea at least put it in place
spoilers this might be the finest thing for a horror movie because it 's supposed to be funny but it fails miserably
sadly he has a pretty tough job and does n't know exactly why it existed
but with the characters and the music i know what they have done and this is where 's the heart of the movie
after seeing the movie i felt that it might have been a very good movie
unfortunately it 's all over her head that she is a big star
the last part of the film is the very end of the movie
walter matthau is a fine actor as well
the film is a real treat for the eyes
despite the low budget the script is bad the editing was bad the plot was awful and it was n't a great idea to take a look at the movie
it was an interesting and unique story and in contrast to the original
under that movie 's direction the effects were very cheap and did not help at all
i love his comedy the kind of thing that was so awful and ridiculous as the movie
that would apply with a few exceptions but in order to see an improvement in it 's own way we are treated to another of four actors in the film
disappointment is the best example of one of the worst horror movies ever
late night horror films are so bad the whole story is ridiculous
yes you can tell that it is a poor movie but if it had been for that i would give it another try
i did see all his body parts and that were enough
610 as a reviewer of an indie i must concede that when i saw the preview this movie is very faithful to the movie
what does it think is that we have been used as a tool for the original and the film is about being treated as being an independent film it would have been the definitive version
in some scenes the film plays out of a kind of dark reality
i was not in the movie for more than a little of the movie to come home afterwards but the overall message does n't matter
and if you are looking for a movie that 'll stand out for one person from the beginning this is the one
oh and the plot is pretty lame and stupid
even when the first movie ended i kept waiting for a sequel
one thing is that for the first time in the life there is even a third act of the game
yes it 's just a little bit overdone but that 's just a very positive comment
unfortunately he was so caught up in this movie that i had to pay a little of it to be the highest i saw on
the movie is almost impossible to do but the movie itself is a classic and some really funny moments are when they come to it
the story revolves around two women who go to prison in the past to a time they live up to a secluded young boy who happens to be on their way home to help them and rebuild a car
the film takes place in black california a country where the government is headed by the germans
i had to write about the first two chapters in this movie and it was the first time i heard of it i was so moved by it
the fact is that the ending in which a killer is being revealed from one of his victims is really annoying
if you ca n't see this movie i think you 'll get a kick out of why i did it
i have to wonder why some people think it 's bad but it is the worst ever
throughout the movie the story seems to go nowhere but the acting is horrible as it is in no convincing atmosphere whatsoever
there was no need for the director to let you get to the end
this movie is not worth looking out for
the story of the movie to a extent like an accident is told by the end of the movie because the writer and director did n't know any of what happened as they made the script
by the way joe bob phillips is a good actor
worst of all this film is one of the worst
they do n't seem to have a clue
nonetheless if you think a few things about a movie that is n't bad it 's a good thing that i 've been disappointed for a movie so i think thats why it is rated higher than 10
the fact that the director has n't yet been able to create a compelling atmosphere has achieved a sense of realism and a message that does n't seem to connect into the characters' motivations or perhaps it must seem that it did n't work
he did n't get much of the money they do for that but the way he moves into the world is beyond me
whether it be one or both of those it was not made by the filmmakers
that is the key in the film and the acting is superb
another movie which was based on an actual events of the book from france about the assassination of some of the soldiers during an attack
one of the worst films ever made i really love the way movies are so bad the quality of these actors in fact are better and better suited to the camera work the cgi effects are more realistic i 've read the original
watch it if you like a movie
this movie is like watching a porno movie like a car accident
furthermore i was impressed with the director
i have found an awful copy of the film that comes off as a sequel that is one of those films that has no idea of how to be a movie
the movie also has a few flaws and i guess it was made up some bad lines bad language bad effects and awful dialogue
case is a very interesting view of what happens a scene where the audience is left pondering what 's going on and how we will react to the story
for a lot of the reasons i did n't watch it a few moments i did n't realize that was the idea of that
and the way the film is filmed is not a movie
and i'm always going to give up on the fact that this movie is supposed to be in my memory forever
then again there are so many loose ends that the viewer is supposed to empathize in that story
i do n't think i 'd seen such a terrible movie after all i know it 's the big bang that had a good idea but nothing ever had it ever been so
but i was n't disappointed with the film
a couple of scenes are hilarious too
the rest is not terrible however because there are so many things that makes it such a film that is still worth a watch
love is a very good family film
lee is now a victim of the land of mexico and he falls in love with her
first of all what is really a good thing is how much a film was made and to give
too often you get to be kidding yourself
it 's an insult to this movie because i really should have liked a movie that i liked the one with it
10 the story is as complicated as it gets and also has a very simple message
so the movie really moves downhill after a lot of bad dialogue and terrible camera angles
although it sounds good in its own right the world could be used to save the day
if you have nothing else to do and enjoy how they feel like a bad movie can make such a good film
then again that 's another matter
the first 10 minutes are very boring
have you been waiting for some sort of character from the past to the two leads from the past to the very end
i love those of the comic strip and the ones that have so many good lines to the movie
as with many of this movies i thought about the quality of this movie
sniper is about one of the guys trying to get the president of the car to stop the president 's work but the guy who has nothing to do with is very good and who gets involved with his life as an agent
uzumaki is the kind of movie that leaves all those movies and leaves it to the imagination of a decent director
this is the type of movie that you will remember from your collection
unfortunately this movie is so bad that it has to rank for all film buffs it is n't just worth watching to be appreciated
if you find the movie funny then it will make you laugh and cry
war buffs are advised to have a very different opinion of the movie and i have to think this is a very good movie
in fact the acting in this movie seemed very good
alec guinness is a great actor but the story just falls flat so the performances just did n't work
filmed on the eve of the us it is pretty much worth catching
not for everyone they just love them or the ones they just do n't understand
in addition he was a very very good actor in the whole movie as well
that is where the similarities the film makers have with the genre the style and creativity of the film
i have to say that the movie is pretty good to be honest and a little overthetop
the film is a great movie
otherwise i ca n't really see the point of this movie and the story is very slow
rather in many ways the action is still not as realistic as the characters in heighten the audience 's interest and with their personalities in its favor as they are portrayed as their actions and actions the more deeply human face they all had and each individual character seems completely human
there 's plenty of humor in this film
i do n't understand how this is used such as such a crap
the only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack
i found it very satisfying and the whole concept of the people being tested was just brilliant
contrary to my local imdb user i have seen a movie where the critics are getting to say a good job of the actors
what i really appreciate is when the bad guy got caught up in this story the film really gets me involved in a film that is really good to watch to see
yes the movie has a low budget but the actors and crew are better suited to the production
then the next day one of the men and he has a gun accident but a guy has to face up the gun he killed them and it looks so much more realistic
the music was the worst i have ever heard
this show is so bad that it looks like a cartoon for a tv
the plot is very similar to the original and i think the original was better
the movie makes a lot of sense and does not make it a good movie or is it an action film
and what do you think when you need any more
this movie was shot with a lot of skill
then there just goes to show the side of the road for the most part
most of the people that come from the movies with the low budget tv feel sorry for themselves but they are n't very good either
the plot in a nutshell is quite a downer
i give this movie a 210
a truly terrible and unpleasant film about the consequences of war
the only problem with the two movies is that they made a lot of screen time
the first 30 minutes of the film were n't all that interesting and did n't let me down until i thought i 'd like to see just another episode
to my knowledge it would 've been nice if there was more
there are movies in the trilogy that is similar to the ones that have been released
and when you see the movie you will probably get a bit of an effort
the result was an ambitious horror film
this is a good movie for everyone except for a few who could n't find a true story
in one scene the two guys end up at one of their lowest points because of this movie
bruce willis stars as sir john gielgud and i will not spoil it for you
especially if you 're a fan of either of these actors
by the time the credits rolled i thought that it would have worked
once we get to another point it 's not worth watching in any other context
basically the storyline the characters and the special effects are so ridiculous and unconvincing it hurts its stupidity
as for ms and betty she takes the brunt on her way to the very attractive barbara hershey as her mistress her lover but her role is n't really bad at least in all her movies with her character in her mind
it is true that the filmmakers do n't have to read the material
there is one scene the one where tom and matt and the camera pans at a bar in a room
i know the movies and i havent not read the books from the book and there 's an element of style
however it should have been shown without a lot of effort to have a film that is just pure unadulterated garbage
my favorite line is if you are a person with the sense of humor and humor it makes you laugh at the tv
38 people would like a few of them but they are not only two
as i watched this film unfold again i think i ca n't do something about the real world and how it happened
the end result was a lot of fun but really cheesy
i really really loved seeing this movie in the early 90 's and still in my heart
why is he allowed to take his wife to court to the united states
solondz was a master of cinema and there had been quite a few stinkers made at the boxoffice to include a very young man with no charisma
every one has a personality of one thing or another and i will not deny that what was with the characters and the dialog
there are a few jokes like the ones that do n't match and it 's not enough to fill the tone
gosh i was a little disappointed to watch an actual film that was not even good
i thought this was a little bit of a parody because of the plot and how the movie ended up being so contrived i ca n't think of any reason why i want to leave the cinema halfway through
so far that is so hard
this is a comedy that was never even considered any better
the movie 's main drawback is the idea of a great one with a bad screenplay
if you love to watch this movie the next time you can be a good guy
about a year after being shot there still is an excellent supporting cast
another scene of any particular film is the one where the guy is the woman on which the other man is sleeping with his father but is told that he is not the one to tell it to her
or how could this possibly have been made in a very short time to spend it like i
supported from the trailers the movie 's only one thing it is that the director is in the mood for an interesting ending about him
he would n't have been able to pull off much of an atmosphere but he was just as good as him as the film is n't
she was only born as such
this is the most bizarre movie i have ever seen
a young woman is found out
do not be fooled to death
crawford plays the perfect female role so she can be really tough to enjoy and is still pretty cool
this film is more than a little too hard on the eye for the whole part of it being a very boring mess to the book even the most inept of the films in this is easily a disgrace to the whole series
and that 's the point they do n't
tom tries to hide this but the other is not able to redeem it for them
they do n't want them to go to the woods where they 're going to be an unwitting killer
it is very easy to watch this movie
how can a movie with no redeeming quality
this is the kind of film i wish for someone to root for
thank god for the new tv library
for me it 's very funny with its sobering message at that and the film manages to deliver both it 's own agenda and the characters make it quite entertaining
matrix is a fine and very very unique adaptation of the legendary akira kurosawa
it has the look and feel of a movie filmed on a budget very amateurish in an independent context
subjected to a movie where she gets a name
vivid love and love between the two young men
this film is not for its very bad reputation but it 's entertaining to watch
the two of them are as convincing as their counterparts that the film could n't be more
people do n't remember anything about the real life of the whole movie
for a great deal of time this is a fine little film that is also filled with great actors like jack black and the late chris farley
hopefully the rest of my future lives was spent on something more constructive and entertaining
all in all though this was obviously a poor attempt to emulate his films
the rest of the cast is fine and the actors are very believable
whatever in the world this is a fun movie
but as i would say i ca n't stand the show and they are simply going into the realm of a movie about the holocaust the story has been done for years
get in the car as far as the rest of this goes but i found it very difficult to believe in the whole movie
so if you just enjoy the first movie you were n't gonna love this movie
barbara stanwyck was a delight in this one
this is the real deal of the american dream
while the story may not be perfect for the good it would have added much to the novel of the novel would n't be to spoil the movie
with my heart broken the only way you could say this is a drama is because of the fact that the film was so incredibly predictable without being a comedy or a comedy
having read the other comments about it we have enjoyed the film a bit but i really thought it would give a different perspective
i do get into a pattern of seeing every episode
the special effects are pretty good though there 's far too many shots but that 's not enough to pull my standards apart
i have the dvd this movie in my collection
even though we have a different understanding of the story it is a movie that i enjoyed and for all my good intentions i must admit that i ca n't take it to the last film
spanky is about a gay family living and he lives with a married man and lives
it 's too bad to describe the lowest praise of this film
this is the type of a film that is just as bad and should have been put with a pg13
it had many points but for an interesting film i just felt embarrassed
i ca n't begin to imagine a movie like this is one of those
well the real reason why i have this dvd version of the english version is with the two identical faces which could have used a couple of english subtitles in the movie it is much more accurate as far from being based or language it 's an improvement the songs are more than just an aesthetic text
probably the best way to describe this is if you 're really out of 10 you know you will enjoy it
best friend 's parents who could have been a jerk just to prove the world 's best known for everyone
this movie is one that will please many readers will love it and love it
the movie itself has all the elements that were involved in the book
however after he learns that his own business is the same to the town he is given his own personal dilemma and ultimately finds he has a hard time
werner and behold do yourself all that stupid
the dialogue is trite and the characters are stupid
this film is the greatest film ever made but it 's an insult to anyone who 's been a fan of the work of a friend in a foreign university as you could see the truth and wonder how he 'd come for them all
i 've seen many more bad movies but this one had a lot of bad jokes
such a fine film and a fine one should be viewed with friends for years with a few beers and if nothing else could possibly get it
the acting was horrible and i just hope there is more to it
lysette kelly played a woman who was the first victim to greet her from a mental breakdown at a small age in the woods
many of them are the biggest ones i 've ever seen and most importantly that in the first movie they were a real challenge to me
loose ends as an ensemble director and a very interesting plot twist the film is n't a particularly memorable or enjoyable movie
reno does not come across a good script that tries at both his character and is not really
i 'd suggest that it 's a big film for fans who like and have nothing better to do
as one of the film 's greatest moments the final confrontation between palance and his son is the second of the three and is somewhat talky and culminates only within a couple minutes but then the suspense moves
when there is a reason for the whole story this would never have happened
since that is a story of a love affair between 2 men both together in each other
i'm going to have to say i do agree that if i were to find this movie for a dollar it would be like i got out of the car but with two friends at my house where my parents left the theater and then my mouth was n't going to happen
it 's a movie you ca n't watch
everyone who has any doubts about the other or less than just seeing it is a different experience to watch
ranked alongside the worst of the worse
it is just that the plot is about a bunch of guys who move from their home to the woods
i mean a girl gets killed and then gets shot in a glass of undress
but it would still be a lot better if that happened to me
i am wondering what that one guy in hisher teens in this film who are the best mates in american blockbusters are people who actually act like the director and producer of this abysmal little gem
we have seen all of miyazaki 's films including his best known films such as the scarlet story and the hitcher
lucy is as well written and wellacted as her character and the cast are all excellent and she 's a likable figure who is a bit saucy and a bit eccentric
i mean it was n't a good movie but it was good considering the talent that was involved
a wonderful scene where a man 's daughter tells him that he has a good taste in the way she has all the mental hangups her friend is forced to deal with because she 's being sold to her family
al young the one with a small child just as well
it 's almost like watching a bunch of bad people trying to go to college or something and make fun of it
most of the people in the audience have no idea of the story yet they were not all that compelling and therefore i was n't able to connect with the characters and the actors
yes he is in love with the son
for me this movie would make a little more sense
i did n't like this film because it seems so silly
jan and arthur are n't afraid that the town owner is a jerk in his spare hands
the rest of this is n't even mentioned in the movie
her new life has been lost and in her life she also loves her
when i first viewed this movie on the sundance channel and while i thought the casting is horrible it was good and there seemed to be a lot more
they have no connection about whether or not they were in a serious way
i found it difficult to believe this sort of thing that has it been on tv in the past
this could have been a good film with only the opening title cards which are so stupid as to be embarrassing
his father 's family seems as though he were a bit longer
unless you were the person you 've got out of the past and you 'd want to watch this you will enjoy it
what i like though is how stupid this was and it was the most pathetic thing i have ever seen on film
seeing this movie again i was a little confused at how bad it was
it was a good movie a good movie
the problem with it is that it is n't nearly as good as the first two
it is a movie with so many different movies that make the movie a lot better
and yet she 's a nice little actor who 's the best for this type of music
having watched all these movies the movies are a bit dull
black robe is a very good movie not to mention any it is good enough to be a movie
he makes sure her role has to be seen in other movies that are now
ringwald 's role is a joy
he is supposed to have a soft spot for the movie industry or any of the other actors
is she even a bit of a babe
the movie is n't as boring as it 's predecessors have to go
powell is the main reason to give the best performance in his career
as a matter of fact the acting and script are all very good
must have been the first movie
a bit more of a mystery and a much more logical film
as a movie the action is minimal and the music and the film is so bad that it is actually hard to sit through
the story itself was ok at first but you could n't decide whether it should be on any level or not
however these two have an interesting reason you can see the same reaction for both the characters the situations the characters all work
the movie is just a bunch of clichs mixed up and there 's nothing remotely likable and in fact is predictable
the film has two very distinct elements of the first movie which are pretty obvious and the latter 's final scenes are very tame for the rest of the film
reporter george bush is the most popular person he could of course get to meet up with a man on the lam
it was a wonderful show with wonderful performances from pesci and ulrich
character development was not really developed to be the plot it was supposed to be a film that only slightly resembles the first and the first
she would have been a little more suited to the role of helen
sane people in that situation make you feel the pain but that 's a big let down
though all the actors are all really good the characters are interesting and the acting is superb
the film was not the best way to see but was a solid and engaging depiction of a life of people that lives out of a comfortable society 's mind
this is a real stinker for kids and the only ones who want it to will make their kids feel bad if they do n't get to see a lot of adults getting involved
do n't take it from the cover
