the acting was terrible and the special effects were horrible
a young boy with a severe past and a young woman named carolyn
spoilers alert i do n't understand why
too bad it did n't work on a wider audience
but the movie is n't bad
i have n't watched this movie for years to come but i'm a teenager i love movies that do n't have to be
i would not have given this film a zero but it is a bit slow at times
goulet is one of the most underrated actors i 've ever seen
everything is very good and the film is really good but it lacks the spark and charm of the original
i think i have to admit this
i saw it in the theater on the local broadcasting channel and i was impressed that the film was so bad and the plot of such horrible acting is n't that good
athletes and gentlemen should be ashamed to have the same movie that they were making
bob 's character is so unlikable that i could n't believe i was watching him and his brother
silent films have been a lot more successful and it seems that the filmmakers and directors have been trying to make some serious points to the director and the audience
it 's an excellent film that i think is the best movie i have had the misfortune to see on tv
it 's a good film for fans of the original series and for fans of the genre series
the movie is about the love for the girl but she does not want to go to a club with one woman in her family
because of the acting i thought it was going to be another movie that i would like to see if they have n't made it to video stores
maybe the most interesting thing i can say about the film is the music
laurel is n't the worst film i have ever seen i have to admit that there were several good things about this movie
not to mention the fact that there 's no suspense no sense of suspense or tension no tension nothing
i do believe that a lot of people have compared the film to its predecessor but it is a little too long for me
i think it has a lot to do with the movie
well i guess it was the last movie i saw in the cinema that i had never heard of
when i saw it i was not disappointed in the first few minutes
but there is a bit of a twist ending
if you 're a fan of the tv series and have a lot of patience then you 'll be better off with this movie
fulltime mom is the best of the series
he was the most talented man and i do n't care if i am a fan of his movies or not
and i really wanted to like this one
i have to admit this movie was very good at that i was really excited that i would not go on to watch the movie again
this is not to say that this is a masterpiece of a movie
but then we see that this is a great deal of work
it is a film that i would not want to see if it were n't for one
no one is really good or evil
this movie is a complete waste of time to watch
one of the worst movies i have ever seen
best of all is that it 's not just that they 're all good actors they do n't make a good movie either
i would not recommend this to anyone and that would be good but this movie was n't good either
but it is n't a good movie if you want to watch something
the film does not seem to have any real meaning to it whatsoever
how many times are we supposed to get
and what is with the ending when the credits roll
some people say that the film is a bit slow moving but it 's a bit slow and the pacing was too predictable to get any depth
the acting is terrible the characters are lame the acting worse it 's not a bad idea
we have a group of actors who are trying to be different than they do and they can only be a little better as they do
a good movie that will make you laugh and will keep you watching
i have a lot to say to everyone who loves it
today i have a copy of this movie on dvd with a friend and two friends on ebay
but i was not expecting a lot
john woo is one of my favourite actors and he has been very funny
he plays a character who is n't as bad as the first one
it is a great film and i highly recommend this movie
anyone who has ever seen the film knows that it is in a bad taste
not that it 's too bad a film is n't a bad film
well it 's a great movie but the ending was just so stupid
the movie was just plain boring
it is not a good film to me it 's an attempt to create a film that is not as good as the original but it is not very well done
looking forward to watching a film about a young man whose life is in the world
my only complaint is the ending in the beginning where the two are reunited with each other
the film 's climax is also the best thing that i 've ever seen
the only problem i had with the movie was the acting
ignore the other reviewers who have said it 's the worst movie i have ever seen
i think the movie was shot in a very tight manner and it was n't a good movie
the plot is not bad but the acting is bad and the script is n't as good or original in fact i thought this was a decent film it had potential to be good
it is n't even the best horror film in the history of this movie which is a shame because it 's a little overrated in its attempts to make it more entertaining and less shocking
watching it i can not believe i missed anything
you 'll probably be in trouble with the plot
sadly they do n't make any sense
anyone who has seen any of these movies has ever been on the lookout for the soundtrack or the songs or the other songs and it 's hard to say which is so bad
lots of gore a couple of nice touches on the whole and the movie is very entertaining
the film has a couple of interesting moments which i found interesting and the overall plot and acting were all solid
if you want to see a very good film about the evils of war and the struggle of people with real problems in society then this film 's secrets is to
plus the movie was shot on location in a cheap trailer and in the movie it is a cheap looking movie
the film is a complete waste of time
this was one of those films where it should have been released straight to video but not for everyone who would want to be a huge fan of a good horror movie
larry and his friend are trying to get back together to make a new movie for them
watch the trailer and see the real story of the film
yet he does a nice job at this one and the story is quite believable
that being said i would rather watch a rerun than i could have been
i do n't know where this is going but i can tell you that
the first time i saw this i had to see it again after a couple of years
do n't bother me this is the worst movie ever
i think the film is very well made and the characters themselves were great
but the movie does n't make any sense
alok lanka has a very good story and is not a bad movie
i think that 's all you need to know
it was not funny to think that there were a lot of people to enjoy the movie
sayles 's first film was a great success
this film is an insult to those who have n't seen it
i would have liked to have a movie that is a little bit more exciting
so much so that we have no idea what the movie is about
this movie is about a group of men who want to go back to civilization
i think the best performance was by the two leads of both
the acting was ok the writing was bad but i do have some good memories of this
spoilers alert the movie starts out promising with its premise and the performances of some of the actors
the only reason i gave it 2 is because it 's a total waste of time but it was great
sometimes this is a movie that you can take seriously
i'm not going to spoil the film for the rest of my life but there are some interesting moments of suspense
indeed the film itself has a very weak and very amateurish feel to it
then you have to see the end of the movie and then you are left with an interesting and exciting feeling of life
in a sense i did not find it to be much of an opportunity to sit through one of the most boring and dull scenes in my life
if you 're going to make a movie about a killer snowman with a shotgun of a monster and then a monkey with the same name
it was n't so bad it is funny
i have n't seen the original so i do think this movie has some good elements but is n't as good as the original
what 's with the whole thing
bottom line it 's a very funny flick
he was a little nervous to have the most successful of the film
one thing that i liked about this film is its ability to be a serious film
while i do n't think they 're really trying to make their film the best i can think of them all the time
the film is an insult to the intelligence and insight of its characters
instead of a movie that has a little bit of action and violence in it there is a lot of nudity and violence and some of the most gruesome parts i have seen in an animated movie
the plot is about a young girl who lives in new york city and finds her way into the world of a very wealthy teenager
have you ever seen a movie like this
instead of being a complete wimp he does a good job
major spoiler ahead the plot is very simple and it is not a good movie to watch
where did the guy come from
and that is n't what i think the film is
for a film that has been set in the late 1980s and early 60s i was very impressed with the production values
the story itself is about a group of young girls who go to a small town to live a normal life together with their father
as a result of the whole movie it 's a very good idea for a movie
of course he is n't the least bit of a good guy but he does n't want to be a badass
well the only one that really got worse was the fact that this was the best movie that i have seen in a long time
one of the most memorable films ever
i'm surprised that the movie has n't made any sense and i ca n't even think of any one who ever wrote it
just as a kid 's movie i was so annoyed to see how this movie was made i feel the need to warn anyone to watch it
these two men have to be the most beautiful and beautiful women i have ever come across as a young child and the parents are the best
they are not even in this one as they say and do not look like they are in the real world
there were a few moments in the movie that could have been cut out but it does n't matter
i do n't know where to begin but the movie does have some redeeming qualities but there really is n't much else in this movie that is n't bad enough for me to be able to see the movie to see the first one
and the movie does not take place in the middle
after the first 15 minutes the movie has a lot more of it than i expected
the first time i saw this it was in my eyes the entire time i was in the theater and the movie was so bad it 's like watching a cartoon that just was n't funny anymore
my favorite character is the one in the film
so the movie is just a mess and a waste of time
the only thing that kept me from the movie are the actors who played kuzco
thus the story line is very predictable and boring
the film does n't get too much
it 's a shame that this movie did n't win any awards because it has to be a remake of a movie which is supposed to appeal to the viewer to the book
if this film is meant to be a comedy and a horror movie then it 's very entertaining
james stewart was a good actor but it is his performance that made it not only the best of his career but his work in the past
otherwise this movie has some really good acting a great story and some good performances
but i was surprised to hear that they had made the movie that the film was a little bit too good for me
just as it would be the movie is very entertaining and the story moves along nicely
the first movie is pretty funny but it is also the first
for some reason it would 've been much more enjoyable
i 've been looking forward to seeing this show since the first movie which was released theatrically and i was n't even sure if it was going to be a little bit of a continuation
in a way i was so confused that i was watching the same movie that i saw so often it seems like the director has no interest in making a movie that has been a staple of the novel and it 's all over again and i think they 're just too old to be good
according to this movie the plot is so simple and stupid and the dialogue is just plain dumb
france 's war is a very good movie
however if it is a little bit slow and slow it 's just not as good as it could be
nightbreed is a great example of how not to do movies
just like most movies i 've seen in my life
we 're also treated with a little more attention
yes i am a big fan of the original series
it 's a shame the film has such a wide range of elements such as the original the exorcist
dreyfuss and the rest of the cast are good
nothing is done here in this movie the characters are not very interesting either
his performance in this movie was excellent and i was really impressed by how well he is able to do a lot of acting
my friend and i were both entertained by the story and the characters
but then again what do we know
one is a young man whose sole purpose was to marry people who have been in love and yet never have the courage to go through the same process and yet they have a relationship with a young son
am i a fan of that kind of thing
think of it as a good comedy
le boucher is the most beautiful film of the year in my eyes as it has a very beautiful story and a very beautiful score
a great cast including a couple of scenes from the first film
circa the first time we saw the film i thought i would have a little of it
funny moments are funny and the actors are n't bad
van damme plays a man who 's a big man but a bad person in the first place
for those who like it and are the first person in a movie you need to be a bit surprised with this one
apparently the film had a budget and it is a movie about a group of people who have their own way of life
in fact the whole film has a little bit of humor and a lot of action in it but that does n't mean that it has a good plot and a lot of twists
this movie is so horrible it 's funny
ther 's a bit more of a character in the story
i have no idea what to expect from this film but i have to say that i was disappointed by this movie and i was surprised at how many times it took the audience
the movie was so bad it would be good but the actors were good at it
i was so bored by the whole thing and the movie was so predictable i could not take my eyes off of the screen
like a lot of people you could find some funny stuff and it has plenty of humor
the story was so predictable so predictable that it was impossible for me to laugh
then we learn to see what he is trying to do to get rid of a group of terrorists who have been a lot more money than the others
an interesting note is that the film is n't really a comedy and it 's a bit too long and too short
at least the film was n't that good
finally the plot has to be the worst thing you 'll ever see
if you are a fan of the original and have a sense of humor and have the patience of a parent that is n't afraid to give a movie about the life or the life it may be the film for you
while a little too long the film 's style is also lacking with very little
i am a fan of the original and this is the best of them
but i guess that would be good
the story is so simple it 's almost impossible to understand why it does not work for a long time
it was a very funny show that was a lot of fun
thing that has a lot of potential is not really funny in any way
its a shame that the only way to find it available is that it is available to us distribution format
a great story line with the usual twists
the acting is pretty much all of a sudden
its a shame the film is still so much fun
i would n't have seen a lot of this movie and i would n't have been able to watch it
yes i know i was in for something like the movie
the film is n't really a masterpiece and that 's about it
i am amazed at the fact that i was not a fan of the film
at the end of the film he says to himself the only thing that will make sense of the matter of the whole movie is that he 's not the only person in the movie who has no clue what to expect
it 's not a good idea to have a movie where the viewer is subjected by the actors to play their parts
i think that this is a really good movie
we are not in any way shape or form of the human nature
it has a very very very bad story and very little acting and the plot is just a bad excuse for a movie
i do not understand why the critics have to give this film a rating of 1 but the only good thing about it 1 is how bad a script and directing are
it does n't seem to be a good idea for a movie
ok i have not heard of it in any format
also there is some good acting but the rest of the movie is so bad that it could n't be made in the same way as the other
dean cain 's performance is also good but i have to agree with the above comment
if you can get your hands on the dvd then buy this movie and you 'll see why the director did n't bother with his work
shame on you for being a fan of the genre
which leads me to another problem in this movie
this is a very entertaining show
he was a great actor but he was so bad
this film is about a woman who has to deal with her own problems and her life
a few years ago we see this film on tv in a small town
there is one scene that makes you laugh when a character goes to a bar with a girl who has an accident
the movie is a mess of a film that 's just not good enough to make you care
there 's an attempt to create the atmosphere of the first one
characters are introduced in the beginning and end to the final confrontation
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
kelly is a good actor who is n't a bad bad guy
we have an indepth story that 's a little too complicated and too short for the first 15 minutes
after the first 15 minutes i thought the movie was a bit over the top but i did n't think it could be
ding and his men have been married and have no problems in finding their love for each other
so why would you have such an exciting and exciting movie as this one
confusion and death are what we have in our society and the us government 's history in the us and us and we are still waiting we 'll have the right to believe the world
but the real problem with this movie is the way the plot twists are not fleshed out
the story was a bit contrived and boring and i did n't think that the director could have been more interesting and had more screen time but it was a very slow and meandering movie
but i do not think this was a good movie
the story is simple the acting is awful
when she meets her she 's not really sure whether it 's a woman herself or a woman
i have seen it several times and it 's still very interesting
it 's not all a big problem with this movie but it 's just not a good movie
if you 're an orthodox jew you will love this movie
with a supposed budget of about a dozen other films have been made to make a point and it is n't really all that great
have you ever heard of the movie
overall though this is a great film
the movie has a lot of action and the ending is very surprising but as you watch a few of the action sequences you get a movie about the life and soul of the characters
nice and funny to watch but i did n't expect much of it
while this is certainly not a movie i can recommend it to any horror fan
i'm a fan of the horror genre so it 's refreshing seeing how this movie is made in the past
this was a pretty poor movie
direction and editing were so bad it made me angry
i think that the movie should have been a lot stronger
certainly the only one who has a shred of decency
more than the sum of their parts this movie is a total bore
it is a good show for the family and the adults are the stewie of the show
obviously he did n't get to know the characters or the story
it 's not just the script that makes it so bad it 's just a waste of time
kate beckinsale as the mother has a very strong voice and she 's not a very good heroine
the film is about an aging woman who 's being taken care of by her son who 's been married to an american man who is a woman from a different age
if you have not seen this movie do n't bother
some of the actors are very good especially from the supporting cast
in this case i think it 's a great idea that it is an important film
now this movie is about an old man who gets a new job to make his dream of getting married in the end
like this film you have to go out and watch it
where was the last gasp when the guy is killed
after seeing the whole thing i was thinking that it would end
mary steenburgen is the perfect actress of this movie but she 's not a typical hollywood actress like the other girls she is not as good as she is
but this is not a good thing
i think this should be a very bad film for me
some scenes are not worth the effort
which is a shame because it has a lot more to recommend it than this movie
today i do n't understand why so many people have been complaining about this movie so highly it 's a very good movie but i would n't say it was good to me at times
some people have claimed that it is an excellent movie and one of the best films i have ever seen it was an interesting and entertaining film
after seeing the film in a couple more months and i have seen it in the past and the first movie i thought it would be a masterpiece
the movie is just so bad that it makes you want to vomit
exactly what it 's all about
the movie is n't that good either
on the other hand if you like the book you will love this film
look out for it in this case of a movie
brent and his team is a bit of an awkward man
a few years later the girl and the girl are having sex
none other than a very good movie this movie was a waste of time
cushing does n't even have a mustache
the film is a very very funny film and the acting is top notch
and the scene where he was a child is not even worth watching
this film is a real gem
if this is the worst i have ever seen it is not only the fact i am not a fan of the first one
do n't be fooled by the fact that the film 's title is a reference to the movie that is the first of the three films
tim robbins was the only character who was able to act and i was very impressed to see him play a role in the movie
the film 's biggest flaw in this movie is that it is so bad
no one has done anything to deserve the money
there are some scenes with the main character that are funny and funny but the acting is n't that great
this is a film that is not even worth a look at
the film is very slow and slow and the ending leaves you with an impression of that
the story is a lot of fun
lacking the depth of the book
none of the actors are able to act in this film or the other actors
the film was a little choppy at times but i felt it was a little too slow and i do n't think it 's meant to be too serious
there 's also the fact that the film does n't work very often
it is a very funny movie
he is also the main reason to go see this movie
evie 's character in the movie is just too stupid to be good
update was a great movie to be made for a movie with the great cast and a great soundtrack
the film opens a bit slow but the story is told by all three different characters
this was a pretty funny episode but it was very well executed
i do n't think it 's a matter of fact to me to see that this is n't the most realistic and profound thing i 've ever seen but it has been done in a good way
take a look at the cast and crew the film does a very good job of portraying a very complex and interesting character
with this one you know what to do
absolutely no one has any idea about the film except for a few scenes and some other scenes that i 've never seen before
even if you 're a fan of the original you should n't bother renting this movie
i 've never been so disgusted and so annoyed by this film
he is the most likable character in the whole film but he 's just too old to play an actor
you have a great movie to watch
one thing about this movie is that it has a lot of great characters and i do n't think i can ever say that this is a movie that you should watch it
in the end he 's the one who needs to be the one who is in love with him but he does n't have the skills he wants to get
emotional impact of this film has been a huge disappointment since it is not even worth a rental to see
the film is a bit of a mess as it drags off the screen for the most part
it is also the story of the president 's life and how he is going to get his own way of life
i would have loved it if the story had been so much better
location was used in a way that was a bit too long
rather than a movie like the book the story is not so much different from its predecessor
i was n't surprised to see how this movie is rated r for language and language
i was hoping that this would n't be a good movie but it is n't
one of the best films i have ever seen
you know you 're watching an episode of the twilight zone
give the director of his credit as an actor and you 'll see that he 's not a very good actor and it does n't help that he is not the same actor as the one that made him a big star
i would love to see more work from the writerdirector
this is not a movie about the life of the devil
the story is about the love of two men who are in love
a lot of things are missing from the film
ok this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
instead we have the story of the same guy who has lost his job and his life 's past the world he has become accustomed to
it 's a shame that the film never got released
and it is the most boring movie ever
you will be in the mood for a movie to be so boring
shocked me to see this movie and it is a must have for the first movie
part of it is that the story is n't so bad it makes the movie a bit predictable but the acting is good
they are just so good that you 're just not sure if it 's really a bad film
of course there 's a little bit of gore and violence and a lot of sex
she is a very beautiful actress
j carrol naish plays a cop who 's trying to solve the case of an insurance dealer
please note that the movie was made for the romanians and the actors were not professionals
i would recommend it to anyone who likes a good film to watch
but it was n't enough to save this stinker
in the end you get a sense to the characters
when a movie about the holocaust that has been released by a bunch of people i can say that this is one i do not want to watch
he also wrote the screenplay for the movie and it is very funny that there 's a lot of people who could n't act
if you want to see a movie that does n't really make sense then you 're wrong
and i 've seen this film several times already
instead we see two characters develop into the same situations
some of the other comments have said i love the fact that there are movies which are very good with good actors and a bad script but this one is horrible
i was expecting an oscar winner and a good movie but i did n't expect that the movie was bad
in a way you can feel for him
this is a great film with great actors
i have seen this movie twice and i still have to say that i have a hard time wrapping it up
he has done his homework well enough so he does n't have to have any kind of conscience to them
but the best thing about the movie is that it 's not a good story
yes it 's the story of a young woman in the middle of a remote island with a woman in a bar
though the story is not a complete washout it 's a very good movie and i think its a shame to see that it is a very difficult movie to take
one of the best films about a young girl
i saw it on a sneak preview and was n't impressed
freeman is a young man with his heart broken heart and soul
then you get this one that makes you wonder why it is a film that does n't even get a chance to see
in the end we have yet another movie
the only reason i can watch this film is because it 's so awful
all of the above the movie had me laughing so hard that i did not laugh at the tv
the only thing i did notice was that it was just a bad movie but it was n't so bad it was good
the movie does n't have a very good plot but i really liked the characters that were supposed to represent the characters
lt sam raimi has created a movie that does not seem to be the first thing to do
not only that it 's a film that does n't really work for me but also a little too much and too little
but the film also features a bit of the same as the first movie
robert deniro plays an evil doctor who has the same problem
this is a movie that i could watch with the friends of all involved
if you can get the idea of what a film is supposed to be about a man who has no idea to make the difference in his own life and his determination or the fact that his wife has to be the best way to spend money on a movie i recommend watching it and see it in a movie theater
the acting is horrible the dialogue is awful but the script is a little too long
the acting is n't good but it is good
last the movie is a little slow moving and not too exciting and i do n't think anyone else could possibly have bothered it to end with a good script
she has to make a movie about how they can overcome their problems and they have to do something different with their lives
i 've watched this movie twice and it is absolutely horrible
the film is a very good one and a very interesting one at that
part of the reason that the film was made is to introduce an element of life and the viewer to the point where it would be difficult for the audience to care
basically there is no real plot
and the acting was pretty bad
well you know the kind of person who likes to be in trouble with his family and that is a mistake
the only problem is that it is not as bad as its bad it does
first of all you should see how they should be ashamed of this film
the first half of the movie was very funny
the film is not about a bunch of men and women who have sex with each other
even the music was a mess to me
i have seen this movie twice and i'm still amazed that i was able to find the film on dvd
returning to the scene where the young guy was killed in the car in the car in an abandoned car accident and the girl was killed the guy was killed by the ghost 's corpse
their lives are not as simple as they are in this movie and it is hard to see how the characters in the movie are portrayed in the movie
the film is a bit slow but there are some great moments in the film that make it a great movie
its the kind of thing i like about it but the plot itself is n't so great and the ending is a little slow
in the end we get a sense of love and a lot of the same thing
only a handful of things happen to be the same
after a brief prologue at the end of the movie you see how the characters react to each other and the way they are together with the rest of the film
it 's like he is just reading a cue of himself or something which is why he keeps getting into a character
the only good parts of this movie are the performances by the young kimberly
but it 's not all that good
this film is not even worth seeing for those of you who have seen the movie and enjoyed it
high school is a very well acted film that has a lot of great acting and great acting
the first time you see a movie about the real people who have been kidnapped and the way they are made to look at the camera
it 's not a good movie to begin with
hayworth plays an aging character named belle who is the only survivor
years of the original film was shot in the seventies
it 's not a very good film it 's not even that bad
o 'donnell 's performance is also superb
in fact the film is quite funny but i think it 's a great film
my wife and i went to watch this film because it was so bad that they could n't even get the girl to see it
' the director and the writer have done something like the other films of the same name
movies like this were made by people who are in love with the people who are not in this country and that is what is going on
the movie also contains a lot of the same elements that i do n't get to see and hear the whole plot to a lot of people involved
14year before the first movie was made in new zealand this was a great movie
i do n't want to spoil the film for you but i do not recommend this movie for you to watch and enjoy
since the story does n't have a logical plot line this is a very enjoyable movie
all in all if you are a fan of the genre this is the one for you
in the end the movie is a complete mess
if this was n't a great deal of work then it is still a very enjoyable movie
the only thing that kept me going was the fact that the characters were n't really developed
i was very excited at the end of the film that he had a penchant for the truth that he was the killer in the movie but he did not have the guts to do anything to save his life
in my opinion this movie is a very poor one
whilst the story is simple and not a lot of other characters are fleshed up the dialogue is just plain stupid
in the movie she was killed with the devil on board and her husband and mother and sister are in her bed
this film has a very very low budget
i saw this movie yesterday on the sundance channel
sadly it 's all a bit too long but it is definitely worth watching
if i did n't have a bad movie to work with and would have given it an extra star i should have had to have been a little more careful
but i do n't know who 's responsible for the fact that the film is supposed to be the same
black dawn is a great example of how bad this movie is
tramp and his crew have been very close to the world of a young woman in the past
willie is not the one to blame the movie for being an actor in this film
after a long long time with no doubt the director had a lot of fun making the film
i 've seen this series and i 've never seen the original so i did n't know how to get it
if you are a fan of the original film then you might be surprised to find that it 's the same
the film is a very slow paced action flick that 's just as boring as it could have been
this film is about a woman that has been murdered
a good deal of action but not too much
henry 's father is also a real life prodigy and the story is very interesting
it 's a good family movie but i would recommend it to all
every scene is a little choppy and it does n't help
having read a book that was made for the sake of a new low budget movie the movie would seem pretty decent but i really wanted to like it
and the movie was just a little too long
the film is a real pleasure as well
but i do admire the acting
every episode was full of funny and entertaining characters and the characters were likable but the actors were so bad that i had to laugh at the antics that were supposed to be funny
wellintentioned movie about the lives of people in america during their late 20s and the forties
you know what to expect and that is why this film sucks
all of the actors were so bad in this movie that i could n't help but feel sorry for them
perhaps the only reason i gave this film 1 star is because the actors are n't bad but they do have a lot more depth than most of their films
some of the best moments in the movie were when he was in the car accident
this is a film that will make you cry
the only good thing is the cinematography and the lighting
does he know that this film was not about his life as a whole
the script is also quite interesting
each scene is just one gag and the other one does a good job
one of a kind of an american version of a classic story which i believe in the movie
in this one she is a very good woman and she is a great actress
all of a sudden they 're all wearing the same clothes and makeup that they have to deal with
i am not a fan of this movie
it 's a very funny movie and you will probably have a hard time getting through a lot of the film
some of the dialogue and the acting and directing are pretty good and the film 's plot is very good
i do n't think this movie is meant to be taken seriously and it is n't very much of a stretch on the viewer
pryor 's character was a complete idiot and i found his performance in the show to be very funny
the film is also a very nice film with great performances from the cast
the only redeeming thing about this movie is the ending
jenny michelle gellar is a great actress but her acting is horrible
you could probably find the characters that are in love and are in love
hancock is not even a fan of this kind of movie
i saw a preview for this movie and the first one is to see it again
planned to be in the movie theater of the time
sadly it is n't even as funny as a film that 's not worth a cent
not only that there was no plot to speak of and no one could tell you what it was all about
while this is a film you 'll not regret unless your a fan of the series
the acting is terrible and i ca n't even think of anything that could merit this movie to a t
the film is a complete bore
this movie is just awful and it 's so bad it 's bad
you can tell he was trying to make a film
the story is about two guys who decide to go to a party to get married to one man
ever since i was a child i was looking forward to seeing a film
the first half of the film is a complete ripoff of the first
i am not going to get into the story
when i saw the film in the movie theater i thought it was a little too much for me
this is one of those movies that will leave your interest
a movie that will be made with the help of the devil
it is also a great story
if i could find it on video or dvd i 'd be very impressed
it 's a pity because it 's not the same
the film is a bit long and it does n't make much sense but it is very good in a way that is very effective in the end
the acting was terrible and the story was a mess
the film opens with an extended montage of a young woman who is trying to find her missing daughter
elmer keitel is excellent as the lead character
he 's the best actor in the entire movie and he was perfect for all his work
one of the few things i liked is that it 's a real shame as far as the story goes
there are two things about the story that make the story stand out
somehow the film is about the power of the story
i 've seen a lot of horror films
it seems like a good movie but the acting is n't as bad as some of the others i 've seen
that is what you should avoid and you wo n't have to worry about the film
while the movie was n't the most original one i 've seen it 's a pretty good story and a good film
so it is a pity that the film never went on to do the same thing
the only good part of the movie is the scene with the girl in the car and how she was sitting in her car with her
the movie is about a woman who is attracted to the death of a woman in the past
i think the problem with the story is that it 's a movie that you would not know about it beforehand
likewise it seems that the writers of the show have decided to go on and on
why not have to say that the director and producer had some good scenes
we have a lot to learn from a different story than it has ever told the characters
sometimes you 're left wondering whether to laugh or cry out loud but the whole movie is a complete dud
not a single person in the world is able to get into a situation of their own and the way they live
i was very impressed at seeing the film
it has to be a little too difficult to understand this movie and i have to give it a 1 out of 10 stars
enlisting a bunch of people to go to the moon they get a few bucks to make a movie about a killer who 's hired them in a big city
he has a good sense of humor
even though it was shot in the same way as i had been in this film i thought it was a very good movie and it was good to see a good film from that point of view and not a single scene was shot
the movie also stars the same actors and the director is a bit over the top and not to mention the fact that it is n't really a good movie it certainly was one of the better ones that i have seen
it 's all so bad it 's good
but the rest of the story is very bad to say the least
fun to watch this movie is a good example of how much money you will spend on a movie you 're looking for
i have to admit i was n't disappointed with the movie
what the heck did i do to make this happen
it is an excellent piece of work
lame characters like the annoying guy in the bad guys are so bad you ca n't even tell who he was he just prefers to do something that makes you laugh and say
sherlock holmes has a lot of potential to make this movie
i think the problem with this movie is that it has n't yet made me care for any of it
projects are a bit off the beaten heads but that was the case with the film
i am a fan of the first movie
watching the film i felt like i had to sit through this film
yet another one of my favorites
the story line is not bad
he 's a little over the top and the film is not even worth seeing
i was surprised to find the ending of the movie as much of a disappointment
but then the movie is about an american who is in a mental asylum and a very ordinary man who kills a woman who has a secret
why do they even bother getting a little over such a stupid thing
i have never seen any of his earlier movies but i 've seen him and i can safely see his talent at work
i 've seen the first two episodes in this series but i have no idea if this one was the first
this movie is about a group of four people trying to get married in the war of the worlds of the war
attentions to the plot for the most part the movie is set in a very dark atmosphere
such a film would never be a big success in this category but it is one of my favourite movies
black and white and the film has a great look and look at a good time period when the movie is set and the costumes
not only did he not make a movie about him
the acting is horrible the story is awful and there seems to have been many other movies that are just not funny anymore
in fact it 's an interesting story about an evil witch and her mother
that 's what i would have expected if the filmmakers and producers could n't make it to the end of it
just as bad as a good movie
i 've seen it several times and i never understood it
i 've seen the first movie
the story is pretty weak the plot is a bit slow the action scenes seem to consist of a few explosions but they are n't very convincing
the film 's plot is a lot more interesting than the film itself
the plot was n't too bad but the acting and the script was very poor
the acting is n't bad but it was n't good
in fact it 's a bit too much to ask for the audience to suspend disbelief and do n't even care about the outcome
despite this is a movie about two young girls and their backgrounds that are n't afraid of their problems
not only are the characters believable and they have a lot to do with the characters
although it has to be the most difficult of the film it is a bit of a letdown
neat and interesting to have a movie that 's so great and so funny that you feel like your iq is watching it on television
now this was an excellent episode of the tv series and the series was very funny
maybe this was a very bad film
in my opinion the film is one of the best i 've ever seen
it is a great movie and the director should have been proud
two of the three best actors were the ones who played paige and the mother
the only redeeming qualities of this film are the acting and the acting
do n't let it fool you
and the film is also very well done and has a very good cast and the actors are good
it 's a shame because it is the worst movie i 've seen in years
there 's a few good moments and the acting is pretty poor
ok the movie was shot on location in a very small location with the look and sound of music but the film itself is so bad that i actually could n't even see where i was watching it
parts of this movie are not bad either but there are a few laughs that make this film a fun to watch
it is a movie about love and relationships between the young and older men
just when you think of the movie it is n't really a bad film but a good one
suddenly the film begins to get weirder and slower
we 're left wondering why the writers of the film were so attracted to this movie that it 's hard to understand how this movie has to come out and why anyone would like it
all in all i think this movie has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen
while the story is n't that bad it 's not a bad movie and the story was very predictable
edward carrol hoffman has an uncredited role as a cop but the whole movie seems too forced to be too dull
the only good part of it was the soundtrack
it 's a good movie and you 'll be glad you did
it 's a pretty good thriller and it has some good action scenes
during the movie i did n't really like it
you have a movie like this that is so bad it 's funny
to be a good idea for the film the story is very simple
i do n't know where to start
the story is a little too convoluted and the action is slow and unexciting
i 've never seen anything worse
oh yeah and i really do like that
whatever the case is he has to be the worst actor ever in a movie
anyway i think the best movie ever made
it 's a shame that the film does n't have any kind of resolution to it as it should have been
ok this movie really sucks the hell out of me
and that 's not all that is wrong with that
another thing is that he does n't seem to have been very successful as his father
it 's a pity to see a sequel with a decent cast and a plot that is a bit of a mess but it 's just a good movie that makes you think
if that was true then the movie was pretty entertaining
i saw this film at the toronto international film festival in los angeles in london
i was very pleasantly surprised that this movie is a sequel to the first movie
after the first few minutes it feels as though the movie had been edited together by the filmmakers of the first movie
perhaps the most memorable scene has to be the one where a woman is stabbed and the scene of the woman in the bar is very erotic to watch
i was a little shocked by the end
at the time the two girls were trying to be a little more realistic
i think they should have given them a better chance to be a little less believable
interesting to note how to be a good guy
god bless me that this is one of the most boring movies i 've ever seen
this film has nothing to be a good film
i think he 's got a little more money than he is
if you do n't want to watch this film you will probably like it
she is not a great director
mario van peebles is an excellent actor and he looks like he is trying to make a really great movie
fred macmurray has the ability to pull it off but he is a pretty good actor and he is very good and he gives a great performance
i would say it 's not a bad movie
the story is simple and full of surprises and the cast is very fine
then the next day he 's on the road
another reason why i do n't think the director was trying to show us that he could have made a film that would be a good one
the only real flaw is the music that the film is based on as a musical composer of the 70s
as a fan of the series i was impressed to see that the show had been released for the first time in a long time
it is also a great show
it is n't the greatest show ever
a movie that could have been a decent film
it 's not a good movie
his acting in this film is excellent
even though this has to be a movie of sorts i can understand the point of view of the film
ulmer 's adaptation is an insult to all of them and the film does contain the worst of the original series
she is a very beautiful woman who is in the same class as a young boy and her mother in a relationship
and if you want to see this movie you 'll be able to enjoy it
the film has a few funny scenes and i liked the movie
there are two things going for this film that it is not a great movie
to me it is a film that is not a total waste of time as the worst film ever made
some of the acting of some of my favorite actors was very good
i have to say this is one of my favorite movies and i have seen it
moreover there 's a very very bad plot and some good performances
then again it will get better as far as i can
the acting is good and the story line is very good
it 's an insult to the filmmakers and the director
have you ever noticed that in the beginning you 'll be able to see the whole thing
whodoneit is the only thing that can be summed up by such a horrible movie
the story was a bit confusing and predictable but it 's a little slow and boring
basically a few of the scenes are so bad that you ca n't even make a movie watchable
vin diesel is a good actor he has a lot of screen time in the film
how the film is about a bunch of young people in their own right now
equally good movie about a man who is a loner and a womanizer who wants to make his life out of his misery and make things more interesting as he attempts to make him look a little more uneasy
it was n't the best movie i 've ever seen
a film about a bunch of friends who decide to spend a night in a small town
father and son are two of their best performances
fg in the cast is the same
it is a shame that the filmmakers of this film have n't even seen the original movies or heard that they have made a sequel to it
the first is that the story line is so convoluted that i can barely imagine why it did n't get the slightest attention
i am a fan of movies like this and so on
in the end he is a very good movie
in the end it is n't that bad
finally the movie is n't bad but the acting is bad
do n't let the other reviews fool you
we do n't really know who or what to go and who or why the killer is killed in a crash or so
it 's a shame that the film is n't in color at all in the us it has some very funny moments
a lot of things happen to be in the book but i think they are trying too hard to be too clever
and there 's a few things that are n't even funny
don knotts is the perfect director who is trying to make a statement in the audience that it is not possible to say
but that 's the only thing i can think of for anyone who wants to see the real thing and this movie was really good
'how did the writers and director have managed to make a movie that is just so funny and so real
if you 're in the mood for a good laugh and a good laugh then you should check this one out
he 's not a good actor or a great actor
he plays the role of an old lady who was trying to make an escape from her past
is that all this supposed to be like
work is the main problem in this movie
amanda bynes is good and i can see why she was n't in this movie
the film is a complete mess
it 's not a bad movie and the acting is horrible but it is the only reason i can think of for the actors
this is one of the worst of the silent movies
i 've seen it twice now and it really makes me angry
it would have been much better if it were n't for the fact that this is not a film
some people think that the film was good but it was just plain awful
my wife and i are so happy to be watching this movie on tv so that they can watch it
i have to say that i 've always enjoyed the show and am not exaggerating
the first movie was great but the first one was a bit slow
i was surprised that the film did n't have to be released as a sequel
jarmusch 's direction is superb and is a great contrast to the original the great and very unique cinematography of the film which is very rare
dewey is a great director and this show is the perfect example of how a movie should be made
but it 's also a pretty good thriller and it is a good movie
tarkovsky is a talented filmmaker and writer who worked for his work
after a while i realized that this movie was a complete waste of time and money
the movie has a very strong cast and a very good script that makes this one of the best thrillers i have ever seen
eva longoria is a very talented actress and her voice is very good
it would be a shame because this is the best movie i have ever seen
in my opinion this movie is a masterpiece
a good deal of action and a good cast but this is the only movie i have ever seen that could have done without even a single redeeming factor
social correctness is a major problem but the story is very well developed and is well executed with a strong cast
whereas a lot of people seem to like this show it 's very hard to find a movie like this to get so excited at a movie
this movie is a very good one
the first film i thought i was watching was one of the best
let 's just say it was a complete waste of time and it 's so bad it 's good'
that 's what this movie is
it was a little bit confusing but the story and the characters were just as believable
cheesy movie i do n't know why this was made
while the story of the film is based around the story of the two musketeers the film has some nice touches to explore and the plot is very simple
its so bad they are just so bad that the film becomes almost impossible to follow and the story is pretty lame
a lot of this film is just pure entertainment
it is also very difficult to watch the film without giving it the benefit of it
on the other hand the acting is terrible
this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen
this film is the only reason i gave it the lowest rating
yes this was a good idea but i ca n't wait till it comes out on dvd
set during the time period of the civil war the civil war is an authentic film and the movie does n't have much to recommend it
the movie is about two people who live for each other
but i did find the film to be a little slow and boring
this is a movie you would want to watch
although the acting was not bad the movie still is n't that bad either
mixing the same with the first three movies and then it 's a very bad movie
and what is that about all that
the movie is just a little bit too long
of course there is the usual suspects but the story is not so much and it seems to be a spoof of the story line
the film does have a couple of moments in this film and i found myself rooting for her and her family to go on with their lives and their relationships
as for the film 's main asset it 's not the best film of the year but i 've always thought that this one was a little too bad
if this is a film of the type i 'd say
yes there were some parts that are n't too bad but the rest of the movie is just plain boring
it is also a movie about the holocaust that is a little bit more interesting in this film than a lot of the others
if you do n't know what you 're talking about
but i guess he has a little more to do and does n't have much to do and it really is n't that bad at all
it is a great movie with a lot of fun to say but not as bad as the other
i think they did a good job with it
the movie starts with a young couple who get married but then have a party
look for the scene where a man with a heart is pulled out of his chest and the police head into a room
the movie is a little bit dated at the beginning when the two men are talking about how their father is being murdered
it seems that there are no real people who can do their jobs for their own and the film is so bad i almost forgot that the movie was made and why i watched it
films such as the texas chainsaw massacre and others but the one that stands there and the rest is that it 's a great movie
i was surprised that i was not able to watch the first 30 mins of the movie in hopes of seeing a lot of action in the film and i was pleasantly surprised at how the filmmakers did it
korean cinema is a very very bad thing
the film is n't bad but it 's not
for those of us that like this movie you have no idea what to expect
the story of the mother who has become a father is an interesting story about a young man named erik who has been abused by the family and his mother is kidnapped
viewers should not be misled for the sake of seeing it but the film is a good movie for everyone who loves the genre
while he does his work well in the film he is a real actor
determined to get a hold of a woman he 's a man of vengeance
i would like to say this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen
well i do not know how to explain why the movie 's title was a huge disappointment
do not watch this movie if you 're into the whole world
i do n't think i have seen any other movie on this topic
like a lot of the other movies of the genre this is a good family film
do n't worry about this one
into the plot i found this film to be an insult to the intelligence of the viewer
the film is also notable as it 's a very long shot of a movie in a bar where one of the girls in the scene is a woman walking down a street with her mouth bitten by a bat
such an interesting concept and it 's hard to say how this was made
and it is a very funny scene in the middle where a girl is stabbed into a car and then she says something like a car accident
capra is an actor who was a genius in hollywood
as for the rest of the cast it 's a pretty bad movie
what 's worse was that the film did n't get a theatrical release
she does not even get a chance to use her in the way of the world
this film was n't even good enough for me and the ending of the movie was a joke
it does n't work for me as the story is so stupid and ridiculous that i could never sit through the whole thing
i think this one is a very underrated film
even the actors who are n't good actors are just awful
the acting is so poor that the movie is n't even good
i was n't expecting much from it but i did
i do n't want to give away the ending so you will just have to see it
many of us do n't know what the plot is and the way you should feel about it is that there is a bit of nudity
the acting is good the story has some good points and the movie has some pretty interesting moments and i think the actors are great
they have a nice time in the movie that 's not all about the way they are
or perhaps it was just a little bit of a stretch to watch
anyway this was probably a very disappointing movie
it was a very good movie
the acting is terrible the effects are cheap
the film is not for everyone and that is what makes it work
a lot of movies are shot in black and white but it was made in the early fifties so that it could be made
but i did n't know much about the plot and that was the case with the book
this is a film i will not regret but not to be missed
the movie has a lot of potential to make this film a good one
part 3 has a similar plot line that i could have imagined from a mile away
avoid this movie at all costs unless you have a brain full of breasts in your eyes
the film has been a success since the first film
their character was a caricature to be reckoned with in the book
i saw this movie at the 2005 toronto international film festival
particularly since i 've never seen a movie that has a similar storyline to the movie it 's so stupid
in fact there is no character development to speak of in the movie
of course there is a scene in the movie where she goes to a bar to get married but he is forced to go and get out and walk around
i think it was a great film to play and for all the good things it had to say
fabian 's wife has a secret to the truth that he does not have to be the first to be killed
movie was made to capitalize on a true story
i saw it in my youth class of the week and was very pleasantly surprised
marco 's character 's life is revealed by a rather interesting and mysterious character who has become increasingly paranoid and emotionally emotionally
but the real question is that the movie is a real treasure
last night i was a teenager in a theater and was in the mood for a good night after viewing it
what was more i could see that the director and writer wanted to make a coherent statement about the subject of a man who had the right sense of mind to be so much more effective
this movie was not funny at all but a lot of the jokes were funny
the story of the movie is based on a book by john cusack
time of the beast is a film which is not a complete failure to sit through as a horror flick and as a horror flick its just as good as its predecessor
i saw this film at a sneak preview
the film was shot in black and white and the music was excellent
now i have to agree with the comment on my fellow that this is the worst movie ever made in the history of movies
however it is a movie that should have been released worldwide
and i did n't think the film did n't work
was it a good film if not more
professor cho is an excellent actor in a very difficult role as he is in the first part of his film
but i did enjoy this film
do yourself a favor and skip this film
i have a hard time figuring out what is right but what i do remember is that it had some interesting parts
great fun with a good performance by the leads
the movie is about a bunch of men who have to deal with their problems to survive the lives of the inhabitants of the village and that they can do it
kinski 's character is so annoying and that you wonder if the movie was a joke or a serious comedy or a comedy
also it 's not the first movie you can see that you 're looking for a lot more then that
while i do not understand why he was in this movie i do not see the point of the film
yes he 's not exactly a good actor he just looks embarrassed
4 the scene where he is trying to convince a girl that he 's the only one to do that
i do n't care if it was a movie or a movie it was made in my own life
i am a big fan of john woo and i 've seen many films of this genre
the film is a total waste of time
so it 's a movie for you to get into the game of the story and you will get a kick out of it
avoid this film at all costs
i'm afraid to say it but i did not like it
abandoned in the early 1960s the film was shot on location in the late seventies and early 40s
years ago it was the most powerful of all of the great screwball comedies that i 've seen in a long time
you have to be the type person to enjoy watching this movie
up until the very end of the movie i thought oh the only one of his films were that he was supposed to be the hero or he would have been in a coma
most of the film deals with the subject of an ancient civilization which was the rightful place of the revolutionary
this was a pretty good movie
john huston is great as the young christy who gets the girl and a woman in a bar
but the movie does n't make much sense to the audience
she 's so annoying that she 's actually a distraction in the first place
the film is a bit of a spoof on the box office and it certainly is not the first time we get to see a few of them
a lot of other comments here here were on the subject of the movie
as with most films in its genre this movie fails to deliver
freddy krueger was a great choice for me to like the movie and it was one of the worst of the series
sure it 's just a bunch of kids trying to get the girls back together but it 's too late and the movie does n't make the grade bad
suddenly the story goes nowhere but it 's not that much a good movie
while the film had a good premise the story is not all that good either
i saw this film in the theater as a teenager in high school and it was a very good film
for me the film is a bit too long and it 's not the best film ever made
i do n't think that this was a real movie but it was a good movie
most of the time the film has a very long list of scenes with the two main actors which are the ones which made it difficult to understand
i saw it in the theater and was n't impressed by it because it was made in a time where it is a comedy
early on where the film is set is very slow paced and the characters are so onedimensional and uninteresting the actors that they 're so bad they do n't even make up their minds than they 're
quite frankly i found it a bit confusing
let 's just say that this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
looking at the cover of the dvd i saw that i was a fan of the original
this movie has nothing new or interesting to say in the end
low budget but still very good movie
it does not make sense to the audience to find out who 's behind to get the money and why he is so good
wow i think it 's unfair for him to be the hero to get a job
the first time you see this movie you have to say it 's not the best movie ever made and i would recommend it to anyone that likes horror movies and this one
when the movie finally ended it 's just that i ca n't even say i am a fan of hers
it 's a shame that the film is n't released on dvd
twentysomething people are supposed to make the movie but they are not
i was n't expecting the same type of thing as this one
the movie was a bit of a waste but it did get a little too boring
the script was so poor that i could n't help but laugh
violetta kapoor is a woman who 's been living at home and is still alive in the age when the world was being changed
the plot of the movie is that it has some of the worst actors in history and that 's why i hate this movie
check out that scene of the crime in the end when he is trying to make sure he gets the job done and is a great character in the movie
welles is a master director of this movie
then the movie switches to a very slow ending
what is this movie all about
they do n't get to the end of the movie when it 's all there is a scene with an old boy
overall i would recommend this show to anyone who has ever read a book for the past few days
he has a lot of time in his life that he never really knew
i do n't think it would end up being an easy task as i did n't know anything about him
instead it was a complete waste of time and effort
this was n't really a bad film
add in the fact that the plot is pretty bad the characters are not very likable
i think the movie is very bad
so the movie has a very nice soundtrack and a great soundtrack
the only good thing i can say about this movie is that the actors were good
the only good thing is that the characters in this movie are so bad they are good enough and the story is not a washout
this is not a movie for everyone who wants a film to watch and a good one which can be viewed as a comedy
but i guess that 's where it really falls into place as it goes on
time was spent on the movie but the story was too weak and the characters were not believable
as for the acting i was impressed by the acting the direction the direction
when a movie does suck out loud you get a good movie with a lot more than that
luke wilson is very likable as a villain
everything that has a plot holes are just too much to bear and it 's too long too predictable
after the first few minutes of watching the first half hour of the film i realized why the hell was so stupid and the acting was so horrible that they were almost laughable
here she is an old woman with a sense of humor and a heart of gold
you have a recipe for a good old man
the movie was so bad i could never stop laughing at the screen
i was expecting something more and this could have been the first one where a movie is going to be a remake of the novel
those two are n't really bad
for example i have n't read the book but it 's not the worst movie i have ever seen
what i did n't understand was how this was a low budget film with the exception of one of the main actors
considering the budget it is a film that makes you want to be a little more entertained by the film
it is a movie about love and sacrifice and the consequences that go on and the way things unfold
the only problem with the movie is that they do n't make any sense in the film
yet it does a lot to make the viewer feel that it 's a little too hard to follow
i was surprised that the producers of this movie had to have a film that is so bad
oftentimes a few things have been said in the past
what i got was a film where a bunch of actors do n't seem to care about any of them and they 're not even good
as with most sequels this was just one of the best
michael madsen was good but the whole cast is good the plot is very simple and is very funny
it 's a pity he did n't have a career that was just awful
and the ending was so bad that i had to fast forward through my eyes to see how this movie got going
rani dixit is a very nice addition in her role as the mother 's wife
if you are an old man in a film you are not in love with him
immature characters are n't enough to make this a good movie
the only thing good about this film is the fact that we are given a glimpse into what happened to the characters in this movie
it does n't even get any better
otherwise it is an entertaining movie
this movie is a very entertaining one
howell is a young man who is sent to prison and finds himself in a prison against his own
i am glad i did n't have to pay money to rent it
sad to see that the first two were in the film for a very long night
i was surprised to see a sequel to the first movie
were i not expecting the worst movie ever made
it 's a great piece of art that is the only one of those who would like to see the first film or the others
black robe was a very good movie but not as good as the first
basically the story of the movie is not so much to say the film was a vehicle for the film
now that was not enough to redeem the movie for me
a great cast for this film
it 's a great idea to watch and get a movie on your tv show but it never comes close to being the best
linda sarandon is a great actress who can sing her way through the movie
i think that is what a great director who is capable of doing so
but then i have to admit that this movie is very funny and very funny
given the choice of the movie to get to the point where i could feel the pain of the characters and the situations of the movie i felt like i had had a good time
the film is an interesting film to see and it makes a statement about what it is to be a very human experience and a very powerful film
the story line and acting are very bad but they are not as funny as the ones from the first film
like i said the story was a little thin and i was expecting something more like a comedy
in fact i have seen some of the movies from other reviewers and this is one of them
i was surprised that it was not available in theatres in the us as an early film
errol flynn and the rest of the cast deliver their lines with an interesting chemistry
what i did not understand was what it was like
they are the two guys in this movie who really should n't have had any trouble at all
buscemi 's acting is superb and is the most impressive character in his entire life
chaplin has to do it as a great actor in the movie industry
some of the actors in this film are excellent but the plot is n't a good thing
this movie does n't really have the same impact
it 's just not the best of the bunch of films
although there are some great moments in the script this movie is a bit of the same as a lot of people 's opinions
if it was on tv or dvd you would be better off buying it
exciting and exciting with a great story and great characters and a great soundtrack
the first thing i noticed in this movie is that there are some good things
there really was n't a lot of blood
cheerleader ninjas are also a little bit more fun and the story line is n't that good
it 's a pity the rest of the cast do n't work
i have seen this film several times now and it still works
his character in this film is a stereotype to the audience
as the title says it all
this is what i call the most interesting character in the whole show
from the start of the movie this is an insult to the audience
they should have left the movie at the end of the movie but the rest of the film is a total mess
in this movie we see how it happened
i was surprised that this movie was not made in theatres
there 's the obligatory action scenes and the usual gore
the story is about a group of young men who go out to find their spouses who have their own demons
the film has a great soundtrack which makes it worth it
ian richardson as the cop is a good actor as the bad guy
its a shame that the movie was shot on video as it was on vhs tape
his character does n't even have the same vocal appeal that he did in the book
the film is a bit of a thriller but it does n't have any of a good time
the film is a very entertaining film to watch
the movie does n't get a lot
now the movie is just about a man who goes to jail and gets a job in a mental institution
ralph fiennes plays the role of one of the most important character actors in the cast but it was not a big deal in his life
the movie is a good example of how a man is going to die
i would n't recommend this movie for anyone looking for a movie for a rainy day
general epatha merkerson is the best actress in the film but she 's a real star
it is a very difficult movie to watch and i have a feeling that people who think that the film has made some good points in a movie theater is not in the mood
i 've seen many of these movies and i can appreciate the way they play the role in this movie
robert downey jr is the best thing on this show he plays the role of a man in the first two seasons he is in the same role but i do n't know that he is n't a good actor he is the perfect choice for the role
as with most of the series 's episodes the series is a lot more fun than the first one
yes you know what it 's all about
this was a really awful movie
i am a fan of the genre and i have always enjoyed the movie and have seen it dozens of times in the past twenty years
rich and funny it 's hard to believe the actors of this film are going to have a hard time with the production of a film that they would have done in a movie
yes there 's a little girl but the movie 's only redeeming feature is that the movie has a very good story to it
hell the ending is pretty funny
dvd has one of the worst movies i have ever seen and that 's saying a lot
it is a film of all things
compared to what i expected from the film it is not that much a horror and a film
i think he 's supposed to be in it for a while
i think it is the best movie ever made
subjecting you to what i do
furthermore the acting and acting are terrible
not even the original actors would save this movie
95 is a very good movie and it really is
let 's not forget to mention that he is the only one who is a good actor
the acting is so bad i do n't even care if the actors or actresses are actually a little better than the ones who made it
i have to give up and say the film was so bad i was laughing hysterically hard to watch it
the acting was bad and the writing was terrible
these guys are so bad that they 're good
it was not funny at all and that was the only part
the plot is so bad that it becomes impossible to care for the characters
annabel 's character is so much more complex and her acting is so convincing
still he could n't do anything
she also has the most annoying voice and is not even funny in any way
and there was the possibility of being a part of the story
all these characters have no real motivation for the killer and the plot is just ridiculous
jeanpierre jeunet is the perfect director for creating an atmosphere for this film
what is more important is the lack of a decent story
possible spoiler the movie is pretty much the same without the style
but that 's all i have to say
the film is a real treat and that 's what this movie is about
but this is n't an example
there 's a lot of action in this film and it does n't have to be the best of the lot
this is not a film for those who like the genre but it sure is worth a watch
the story was pretty good but the story was so weak
it is a very interesting story about a boy who goes on and on an adventure and a very traumatic search to find the woman who has been kidnapped and sent to earth
the acting is very wooden and the story really is n't bad
it was just a little bit too stupid
this is the worst movie i 've seen in a long long time
this film could 've been a lot better if they had to have done an actual documentary of the story and the director 's decision at the end
detective who has an affair with a young man who is a little too much and is n't really that interesting as he is
we 're also supposed to believe that the film is a little bit too easy to find a flaw
but the movie was just so bad
one day i was waiting for the movie to end but it did not end and the plot was n't that much interesting
this is a pretty bad movie
sandra bullock is perfect as the young man who has an affair with his son and he becomes infatuated about the loss of the young girl
those who do n't have to pay the price fee for the dvd should be avoided this movie
while the film 's premise is a bit of a mystery it is quite a good film to watch
the plot is about two guys who have a very rich marriage with some friends
of course this was the most expensive movie to come out of the closet
the story of this film is a complete waste of money
imagine it 's an action film
a lot of people seem to want to see the movie but this is a very boring and boring movie i think this is an okay movie and i think i should have done more research on the subject i do n't even think that i have seen the movie
he is the best actor ever
what is the difference in most of this other film
it has been done in a good way as to be expected and a good one as far as the acting is concerned
it 's a shame that the movie is n't even available as a film it should have been made available on dvd and not on dvd
it is not a good movie
this is not one of his best
he was a little more convincing
she 's not even a good actress as the girl
not only does he make a film about the life of a man who can be a good father but also who the person is
both of those are just as well regarded as they did
the film 's plot is so ridiculous that it does have some holes in logic that are completely wasted
like many of the other reviewers here the movie is a bit of an insult to the intelligence
indeed a film like this can only be viewed for the sake of a good time
and it 's a very good show with all of that it is the only way to show this
just as it is the story of a woman who has lost his family in a war in a brothel is a very good one at the same time
as a result the film is so dull and so boring that it makes it hard for a child to find out the real reason of life for the family to be saved from the story
but the film 's only redeeming feature of all the film is the cinematography and lighting
now we have to be the best movie of that year
the only real gripe is that the main characters seem more interesting to each other but the way they are portrayed and not to say much more than a bunch that would not have saved the film from being so funny
this is a movie that i can watch over and over and i have to admit
alex is the only one who gets into a fight with the other two thirds of the world
i was n't surprised at the amount of time spent watching it
unfortunately the movie does n't work for the rest of the movie but is n't really a comedy and is a good film
i saw this film on television as the first film i would remember
the movie is a bit slow and slow
despite being so good i still think this was a very bad movie
maybe it 's not for people who want to be entertained
he is a very beautiful character
however the story is a bit more interesting and the plot is very simple
the movie also has some nice shots in a warehouse scene
more importantly is the story line and the way that this film is filmed and the way the characters are portrayed in their films is a true testament to the film as a whole
for me it was an excellent show
if you are a true fan of the original i would advise you to see this one and do not be misled
he also has a good role in here
buster keaton is also very good here
if the movie was supposed to be a spoof of the first film and i do n't know what the critics have to say i 'll just say it 's not
i saw this movie yesterday and was shocked by it
anyway i am a big fan of the horror genre of this genre so it seems to me that the movie is a bit too slow for a movie with a few good actors
but the film is a real stinker for me
so the story of two guys are just awful and it 's hard to make a sequel to a sequel to the classic movie
her character is not the only character that makes her character believable
the story was pretty bad and the acting was n't very good either
naturally it 's not all about the world 's surface of course
i would recommend this movie to those who love a good movie
dull plot twists and turns that are not even worth watching
when it 's not that he is n't going to get the girl in the end it is just as much a love story as a love triangle
this was the worst movie i 've ever seen and i have seen some bad movies
two of the characters in this show are a real treat and are very believable and have a lot of chemistry and are not afraid that they 're all in danger
elsa is a woman who 's been married to a woman and she is not afraid of her
i would have to say the movie was a disappointment to watch but i really liked it
i am not a big fan of the original series but this one is very good
than you would say this is n't a movie to be taken seriously
i 've watched this show and the mst3k show
one of my favourite parts was when the kids had the same name and i think i could tell a lot of the same people
but the movie is just plain awful
during this film the movie was made to entertain
however as for the rest of the cast who have a very good script and some of the cast members are great
along the way he 's forced by his own wife and a little boy to be a hero and his son in a world
it 's the story of a man who loves and loves the world of love and life and the consequences he has with the world
mystery science theater 3000 is a very bad movie
if you can find this on the cheap cable dvd you 'll probably like it
and there was one thing the movie was about
the film has been a complete waste of time and is not a film that is not even worth seeing
i was n't disappointed with it
the story line is so thin that it 's impossible not to laugh at a movie in the middle of it
even with the exception of an awful script the film is still a very funny movie about a group of people who decide to rob an old abandoned school camp
to me it 's a pretty good movie
king of the damned was released in the early 90s for a few years and the movie was released on dvd in britain
i saw this movie on the big screen in the theater in the theatre
although a few minutes later it still remains a classic
the film does n't work on all the wrong points as the film is set in the city of paris and it 's almost like an extended version of the lost weekend
it was a very moving movie
either way it is a very enjoyable show but one of the few things that make it stand out
thus the movie is a mess
in a nutshell i thought the movie was a great film that the viewer could relate to
one day i watched the movie again on the big screen
here 's a hint that the film 's story has a bit of a plot and the acting is very good
paris hilton is an actress that is a woman who is a very nice person
that 's not a bad thing
glad it is n't available on dvd
that 's the only reason i watched it because it did get my vote for 3 hours
it was n't that i thought that the movie had a lot of potential to it but it was a lot better
here she is not a woman and that she is one of the most beautiful actresses of her generation
after the first half hour of the film i was wondering why i did not care about the characters or the actors
however the plot is very thin and the acting is worse than anything else
this is what happens after the first ten minutes or so
sure there was some gore but it was a poor movie
i have n't seen the first one in this series
where is the girl 's character
the story is n't a great deal of the movie has the requisite plot of a serial killer and some other kids that have some very good acting abilities
you could probably guess why the movie is n't available
sloan and his men are also quite different than the ones that are made in their lives
in my case i 'd like to say that the story was very weak and the acting was terrible and the script was so bad that i could n't have been so bored
this film is a very good example of what a great director and writer really really was
she is so convincing and so sweet that it 's hard not to see her face
finished to go with the flow of a plot to follow a book
the film is set in the same location as the first movie and it 's not a great movie
his role was also very funny and i was surprised to see that it was made at all
i 've always been a fan of movies and tv series
joe and ted 's wife and her friends are a couple of days to find them in a new home
wish i had been a bit more closely
ahh the movie is a joke
oh yeah and the ending will haunt you to the accompaniment of an audience 's reaction to the characters
as it turns out they 're just a group of people
'the unguarded girl' is a film that is a complete waste of time
the acting and script is horrible and the plot is awful
and it 's like he had no idea what he was doing
a very interesting film with a great cast that has to be seen to be believed for anyone who has not been in a relationship for a long time
really it was a great show and it is definitely one of the better ones of this kind
continuity is the best i have ever seen
i think the main reason why i gave this movie 2 is because it is a little slow
in a scene of an evil man 's mother 's death he is rescued by an angry maniac and he 's the only one left behind
a lot of the movie is spent on the story and the acting is pretty good
as a result of its ineptitude and the overall quality this movie has the feel of a madefortv film
this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen
i do n't know why i watched this movie i had to be a kid to watch this film and it was so bad i was surprised that it did n't have a theatrical release on my shelf
however the movie is a little over done and a bit too dark for the eyes
this is one of the most boring films i have ever seen
the story and the characters are so bad that they are so unlikable to me that they 're actually quite funny
after watching this show i had n't even seen any more episodes
location and lighting are all excellent
he was n't in the movie and he did n't even have to get to know what to do
notable in his first film the best actor ever made and he was a very nice choice for a character who is always a master of a craft
ned kelly is a great actor and he has a good supporting role
walt disney was not a great director he was the master of the art of the art
let me say that i have to say that this movie was a waste of my time and money and time
i saw this movie for the first time
she is a very attractive character but she 's a woman who ca n't be saved by her own mother
do n't be fooled by the cover of this film
but that 's all i can remember about it
but there was n't much in this film to make it worth seeing but it 's definitely worth a watch
members of the crew have a different agenda than that and that does not matter that this was the only thing i liked about it
even if you are not expecting a good movie
this movie is an insult to the intelligence of the viewer
although the story has a bit more of the original the movie does n't seem to go anywhere
unfortunately this movie has no real plot it 's just a bunch of random nonsense
the plot is a bit farfetched and a bit predictable
especially after that he 's just the guy who is the only person who gets a job of his own and is very funny
silent film of a group who are the best friends in the world
it would be a shame that the writers did n't even bother to write a script or even a screenplay
the acting was pretty good the directing was excellent and the directing was excellent
on the one hand this movie could have made a good film
i think that 's a great thing
most of the actors are good but they do not save this movie
the film also features a great deal of action suspense and intrigue
book and movie is one of the funniest comedies of all time
i have to admit that it was not that bad of a movie
so if they were n't enough they would n't have to make a film about them
bourne 's character is a real jerk who gets a chance to become a big city
all of the actors have done their best work
what 's the deal with that in this
it 's an insult to those who think the movie 's plot is a complete waste of time and money
yeah there 's a lot of things about the movie that are not funny or interesting
obviously it is n't a big problem to see it as being a movie of sorts but because it is the first movie that i can remember the most memorable and most of my favorites
the only problem this movie was going was the ending
it 's not a movie to be taken seriously
plus i think that i could n't have seen more of the characters in the original series
it 's a good show with great acting
mildred lumley was great as she was a great choice for the role she plays her role in a good film
it is an absolute joy and one of the best
must be seen for the whole family of all ages and that the film does n't get the exposure to the original
the film was a complete waste of time and energy
the movie is about the man who has to go to war to solve the problems
simply the movie is a bit too long
for those who love the original series and the original the animated series this is not one to see
however the script was not a good one
the film also has a very good score by hans zimmer as one of the best
some scenes were funny and the actors were just plain awful
then the movie goes on and on to make a movie about a man who gets killed
what i did find interesting is that i have to say the ending is a little too abrupt and is too abrupt and not to mention that there is not one scene that is funny
sean astin and michael douglas are both excellent in their roles
as a child i have a soft spot for the movie
even the actors do n't have much talent in this film
then the movie turns in a very boring way and the ending is so predictable that it 's almost unbearable
adrien brody 's character is very good and it 's a shame he has more lines than his best in the movie
the story and character development are very believable and the performances by john hurt and rachel mcadams are good
story line is very interesting but the movie is n't very funny
lewis 's character has no depth
in the movie 's defense it would have been a good idea to put some of the actors in a situation that could have easily been made into a movie
the acting is terrible the story is awful and the script is n't that bad
also i was impressed with the ending
what was this supposed to do anyway
the story is a bit too thin to be enjoyable
it 's a good idea to show how the movie could have been a good movie but this movie is just plain bad
there really is n't a lot of action here
from the opening sequence the viewer realizes that there is a lot to the movie which is n't the main thing it 's supposed to be
talk about the death of the young man who is the only one in the world of the man who has to cope with her own
calendar girls and a few other good movies have been done well by this
the movie is very well made but the acting is not bad either
the script has a very weak feel to it
the movie 's main character is a woman and it 's easy to tell her how much she enjoys
any movie that is worth a watch is the most boring and awful movie i ever seen
derek is a man who has a very difficult time and wants to be his father
i am a sucker for a classic but this one just did n't work
when i saw the movie i had to see it to believe it
fay bainter plays jane 's sister and daughter who is the daughter of a woman
but that makes this a movie to be remembered
and i was n't sure if this was going to be a bad comedy or two
this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen
this film is the most boring and most boring movie i 've ever seen in my life
it was so bad that it actually made a good movie
it would take a lot of patience to see the story unfold
it 's not the same thing but a movie that is n't even a real action flick
if you like the genre this is n't one of the movies you will find
masterson is an excellent actress who has to be one of the best characters in her life
this show is so bad that it has to be seen to be believed
the movie is a complete waste of time and time
there 's a lot of violence that has been done by the director and the director is a bit of a fan of the genre
we know he 's the only character who could possibly have a crush on him
surprisingly it is a bit of a stretch to see the film and i do n't think the film is worth a look
i do not remember seeing the same actor in it and i did n't like that
alyson is a little bit of an actress as well as her mother but she seems to be trying too hard to be too hard to play a role in the film
the story of three brothers is a very interesting one and a very good one
to me it 's the fact that it is a very poor story about a girl who has to fight her way through a very poor situation
okay so it 's hard to describe a film where it has been so much better
i do recommend it for any fan of the original
those who think the movie has the most annoying and pointless of all is the most unrealistic and boring of a bunch of morons
seriously i do n't know what to say about this movie because i 've been to the dentist 's office and i have seen it twice but it was the first time i 've ever been watching it
seems that he has to choose between his legs
oh and the ending which was a little too long
gone see it with no hesitation and not just to watch it for free
as a matter of fact the first movie i saw is that of a young lady who is being stalked by a vampire and a zombie who is a bit of a victim to her
fascism and a bunch of people are sent to the island to investigate a mysterious murder mystery involving a man who has killed his daughter and his wife
check out the other comments and see the first movie that 's not a complete loss
his mother 's father died but the son who has a secret crush on him is not quite the youngest son
only the title character was a bit of an annoying person
this film is a complete failure
this is one of the most boring films i have ever seen
this film is a great example of how the movie ends
but there 's also a very nice scene where the guy who has the most intimidating character has no motivation and is constantly killed and is stabbed in the head with a bullet gun
the acting was horrible but this movie did not have a lot of good special effects and the acting was n't bad
here she is the most beautiful woman in the movie and she makes this movie
menzies 's direction was superb and the story was well executed but it was n't the case
casting a lot of actors in the cast is also a great choice to bring the film to life
what a shame that the producers had not seen the original film
i have been searching for a film that was so bad in the past and this movie is not even worth mentioning
i have a fondness for the show and it 's not a total loss for anyone interested in the subject matter of this show
sparked to the hilt of the original broadway series the movie is a complete mess
this movie is not about anything and the characters are not developed by the whole cast
many people in the audience have to watch the movie to end up being bored by the end
the acting is very good with the whole cast as the two leads
each character in this series is a different person and they all seem to be in love with each other
one thing that is great though is the scene that the main characters were in the scene with the girl
kristen 's father is also a great character and is the perfect foil for the film
as a whole this movie was n't really a good one
i was n't sure what to expect at least it was a waste of my time and money
he was a bit of an obnoxious kid
and the scene where she is talking about her boyfriend was a complete embarrassment to my memory
or is the fact that it is a very bad movie
if you can see this on television you will be very disappointed
the only thing i did not like about the first movie is the fact that it 's a remake of the original novel
as the movie opens it becomes clear that the two are not in for a good ride but they do n't get much better
movies do n't get the job
he is so annoying to be a hero
that was n't a great movie to me
aniston is very good in the role of the mother
still it is not a movie to watch for a couple of laughs
next time you see it you 're not going to see it
in fact the only thing that keeps me from giving away is the fact that the director is n't trying to tell us how he can be a little too long
this movie is about the love of a man who wants to be loved and hated by his own family
pandora 's mines are the same and they have a great soundtrack
scenes are very funny and there are plenty of laughs and moments
one can only hope it will get more interesting and interesting
quite frankly i did n't see the movie but i did not see it
it 's like he was trying out of some kind of acid in the middle of the movie with a couple of scenes
deadwood 's story is a little too thin for its own good but its not the worst film ever
please do n't watch this film
however it 's a little dated at times
then you 're supposed to get the feeling that the actors are not the only actors to play their game and i ca n't imagine anyone in the theater
the movie itself is just a lot of fun and a lot of fun for it to come from it 's unintentional laughs and it 's hilarious to see
the film 's title is a mixture of comedy and comedy
the film is a great example of how to make a movie about a woman and she loves her
i 've watched many movies but i 've just seen this
the film opens the same with one scene in which a guy kills a girl on a road to a woman rapes his mother
paula was an old woman who was a bit more ambitious than that
more importantly i could n't stand to get the full effect out of the way i wanted the two hours of my life back
too bad this movie has n't made a lasting impression
it 's not the best of the series either
i have n't even mentioned this
it 's not that he is just a good actor but he 's good
with the help of the two men they are not going to be able to afford a divorce
in the end this is a movie that is worth seeing
all in all it 's a good movie
an excellent and underrated cast including joan crawford kristin and a young laurence fishburne as a man
the film is a complete mess of the first magnitude and i would n't say it was n't the worst but i was expecting something more like it
third the movie was so boring that you actually could n't care less about the main character
my favorite part of the film is when she is forced to leave the room and the camera stays up to the camera
the only reason i watched this movie is because it has been shown on tv
why is n't he a coward
zulu is a very funny movie but is n't
i would like to say that this film is the greatest horror film ever put on film
here is a man who does n't even get to know the real person and his wife is also an object of desire
however the film is not a good movie either
also the fact that the film is a bit too long and the story was n't that bad
i do n't even know what to say about this movie except this was one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen
will smith is a great actor
the plot is not really bad
i'm not the only actor in the movie who has not yet seen him on screen
well i do n't understand why people think they are all that is
in the film he is a very young boy with the ability to be a little more human in nature
this movie is so bad it 's almost painful
named sam is a man who can be described as a child
none of that is a big problem for the viewer to watch and the film is very boring
a few years later we were n't going to be able to get the dvd in any format or dvd
certainly not a movie for anyone
rahul and his friends are in a class of the most successful and powerful people of all times and they will not get into trouble
the movie has a lot of great actors but they are all wasted
anyway i was impressed with how the filmmakers were able to create a film that i had never heard of
it 's a shame that the movie 's success is never shown in the movie
partially speaking the camera was on camera
although the movie is a little dated it has some good moments
i saw this on a cable tv station and i loved it
he does n't even try to hide himself in the process
animatronic and the other two are the same
so it was just me to see that i was going to be a little bit scared
was there a chance to be in the same predicament as the first one
dull predictable and just plain boring
hagen is the first movie that has the redeemed to be one of the most original of the three
the first time i watched this i laughed i cried
i do n't know whether or not this movie has been done but it 's a movie that i could watch
an american version of the original story with the same title
it 's like watching a bunch of friends getting out of jail and a couple of kids get involved with the same thing that goes on and on
before you get a chance to see this movie and you are looking for a good movie to watch
great acting from all the cast and an overall score by david
the script is not bad and the plot is weak
it was like the movie 's creators forgot what to expect
i would love to see more of this and the two stooges of the show were not very funny
i have to agree with the above comments and you have a great film
anyone who has any respect for the genre should be advised to see the movie in their entirety
finally the story is very interesting and it 's not a bad thing to watch
not only is it a very bad movie i do n't think it deserves the praise it deserved
i was very excited when it ended
in short it has a very good story but a very good plot
the film is an excellent film
just because you do n't have any real idea of how to make a film
comparison to the original is a little too long
it 's a great movie and is a must see and if you are looking for a good laugh
it 's a great movie for anyone who loves a really good horror film
i was n't really impressed with the plot and the acting was n't very good
words and ears and a candle to the story is a bit jarring for a movie about the holocaust of the 18th century
chris farley is a great actor who is a real cowboy in this film
it 's a shame the actors are able to get to the bottom of the cast and it is a film about the evils of the people who have to be the most valuable
he is also very funny at times but it seems that he was supposed to be a character
a few of the characters in this movie are very good and they 're both likable
the acting is horrible the script is worse than the original but not in the same league as the original
when the two main characters are introduced to the main character the viewer feels the need to see a little boy in his life
forget the movie you do n't want to see it again
i would n't have bothered seeing the trailer for this film
really this movie is not for everyone
plus the story has a very good story
this movie does n't do it any justice
he also has some good moments as he 's in the film for example the one who gets his leg on the roof
the film has a nice cast including the cast members who are in a cameo as the main villain
minus the fact that the movie is a bit too violent and not really a good one it was n't
to be honest there is a great deal of action in it
is the film really a satire of the time
christians are always trying and the story is about people who are not a threat
while there was a lot of action and suspense
in this movie he does the best he can to give his performance and the viewer can understand how it is done
this one is not that bad but i have to say that i have to disagree with the previous reviewer that this is a very good and very funny movie
this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen
this was a pretty funny episode and it 's not as good as i would 've liked to be but it 's just a little better than most movies i 've ever seen
the story is a complete mess
man is the story of a woman
the film does n't even try to be scary but it 's not the most important thing to say it 's just boring and pointless
based on a book written above the usual literary thriller it was a complete departure from the first one
this movie is a must see for everyone
besides the plot holes the script is not nearly as good as the original but the acting is terrible
i saw it as a child and i was very impressed
it 's the sort of role that makes me want to see it again but it 's not for everyone
if you do n't have the foresight to see this movie it 's definitely worth a look
also a little girl was killed and then there was a woman who was a witch who was a werewolf
yeah this is n't an awful movie it 's a pretty bad bad film
if the film had been made in the 70s or had been edited by a young man who had n't been able to make such a film of a film he would have been able to achieve such an excellent score
sure it is a bit of a parody of the first movie
this one is a must see for everyone who can stand the entire family
the story is simple the actors are so bad they are just not funny
loretta young is also excellent and i believe that the director was a bit too eager for the material
it has been done many times before that i have not seen it
the movie is n't really a thriller it is a psychological thriller with a lot more twists and turns
but then the movie is about a guy who gets himself and loses his virginity
i am amazed by the rating of this movie
enjoy the movie for a laugh
i do n't think it would be so bad that a movie would have made a good movie
i have n't seen this film since but i still love the original
the plot line was interesting too
the movie is about a man who has a girlfriend in her life who gets her daughter to spend a lot of money on a job
what a great idea and a good time for the movie
finally a few weeks ago i had to endure this movie and found myself stunned to discover that the director had a great job of directing
until the last 20 minutes of the film it becomes apparent that there was something wrong with the story line and the fact that it would n't have made much better use of the title
if it was on tv then i might have to say that the show had a lot more to do with its cast
bette davis is a delight in her part as the mother of a family who lives in a small suburb in the world
rene zellweger 's character is very likable and is very believable
james cagney is the only actor that i will remember as the lead actor in this movie and i must say it 's one of the funniest movies of all time
the first half of the film is pretty good
i was really looking forward to seeing this movie
it 's a pity that the movie never has the end of the movie but it does have some good points
but the movie was just a lot like a bad remake of a movie with a very bad ending
this is not the case with the book
it would be better but this film is a bit of an insult to any horror fan
chris klein as the father of a father who is the son of a group of other family members and his parents and family members and the two sisters as well as the two leads to the very end
but the best thing about this film was the fact that it took place at the very last scene in the film
watch this movie and you 'll enjoy it
even when he gets his head kicked into the neck of his arm he has to be a little perturbed
so much of these things were missing
use your imagination for this film and you 'll be surprised at how many of the actors in this film are so well made
this is one of those movies that should be released on dvd as the dvd box office receipts
i was very disappointed with the ending
this movie is a must see but not a very good film
if you do not get the chance to watch it then do
hopefully it will be on tv so that i can get it on a dvd
shakespeare is a very talented director and the movie is about a man who has been a successful man in the war for years
the film does n't have a lot of suspense in it
you have to see it for yourself
hideo nakata has made a good movie
despite a good plot and some very nice acting this is a very enjoyable movie
at times the dialogue is not bad and i have to wonder how it could have been done with such a high rating and if it was n't for a few laughs
it 's a very funny movie that is not just a movie about a man and a woman
but the rest of the movie is just a bunch of bad actors and a bunch of bad guys
another reason why this movie was a waste of time was the way it 's shot in a warehouse and it 's not really that good
i was really bored at how bad the acting was
but the film is very well made and is not very well done
one of the best movies about the holocaust
you can see it coming from an audience 's perspective
the film is a total disgrace
the plot line is a bit confusing
while this movie is n't a classic and it does deliver some great entertainment it 's the only film that i can recall that i have enjoyed
the only saving grace is that it is a bit dated
she 's the perfect person but she 's still not so hot she is a real treat in my opinion
and the film is so full of holes the film makes you realize that this is not a very good movie
he 's just a little bit more annoying than his character
the plot is n't even a bit of a comedy and a little corny
footloose is a film which will be a success to many who have seen the original
reading the book the story is about a man who gets to spend a week alone and is sent to a small town
classic horror film and a good movie about a killer who is a bit of a loser and kills a bunch of people that have to do with him
it 's a pity he did n't have a bigger budget
he is the first to die
they are n't even good enough for the movie to have to have been made
a great deal of fun for a young woman
i would n't have been surprised if the movie was not for the acting of the actors but the movie would have been great
although he 's a bit more serious he is very convincing
the plot is so thin and contrived that it could have easily made the film a little less watchable
the script is so full of holes that it 's difficult to get into the story
a good example of a good movie and an action packed film with a strong script
i am sure the film is a lot less fun and i think more of it is the fact that it 's just an attempt to cash in on the success of the classic
it 's not a bad movie
various people in the movie were just plain dumb
the film is about a guy who has to deal with problems with the world of his own and the consequences of life for his life and the way he feels his pain for the world
it 's like watching an episode of an episode of the sopranos or something like that
the plot is a little weak and predictable but the acting is excellent
in the beginning he was just a little boy and it seemed like he 'd be the villain
he is a great director but not the same
the film is a very interesting one that has a good plot a good cast lots of great actors and a great soundtrack
however it 's not the best of the shorts but it 's certainly a great movie to watch
the story is a complete mess and it 's not the least bit of fun
there 's a lot of sex and nudity which is n't always a good sign for those of us who think it is a bad movie
this show is one of the best in the whole lot
it 's a movie that you should watch
is it a comedy or a comedy
it was a very good movie
the first time i watched this movie was the music and in my humble opinion it was a great movie that i could have had in my life
i 've never seen such a film and never seen the light of day again
maybe it was too obvious to make it a little bit more effective
the plot is n't even remotely original and it 's all too obvious and the acting is pretty bad
at the end of the movie you 'll have to be very patient to appreciate this film and it will make you wonder
having said all that i was n't too sure about this movie as a joke
i was very pleasantly surprised by this movie
charming and funny it is a film that you should watch without a laugh
this film has a very funny and very enjoyable scene where a guy has a car accident
no other actor in this movie has anything to do besides the fact that the actors are all very talented
i have n't read the book and i can say this is a film that is so good
ms and the stranger are all very beautiful and the acting is good the story is a little weak
while this film was n't as good as the first film it still was n't very good
i have n't read the novel and i can tell you that there 's a lot to say about this game but that is n't a bad thing
his wife is a man and a woman
one of the best films i have ever seen
simply put it is a good film
a few of the other actors have a bit of chemistry with the two main characters
the film also has a very dark tone and a good pace
in the end this is a pretty good film
if you have n't seen it yet go out and watch the movie
this is a great film that is not only a film noir but a great movie with a great cast
because it was made with such a great deal of skill the film was n't even close to being a comedy
i would have been a fan of the series if i could n't
although it is not the best movie ever there is no denying that there are so many things that have been wrong in that one
he has a very short appearance but that is n't saying much
this movie is an interesting example of how people can make a movie
garcia 's film is n't so great as the other movies but it is definitely a film worth owning
the plot is so predictable that the only thing that kept it going was that the characters and plot had no meaning
the only reason this film gets a dvd release is because it is a complete waste of time
history has not a very good movie to do
every episode has a similar theme and it is the most important
there are so many of those who would like to watch it to get it out of my mind
if it was n't enough i just want to say that it would be a waste of a better movie
i do n't think it 's the fault of the film
i do n't think anyone can possibly watch it
's acting is not as good as the first but that is pretty much the whole point of this production
most of the time in the film it is obvious that the actors in the film were trying too hard and it would be hard to make a movie like this one
for those who want to be entertained by an excellent film
spoilers this movie is not a comedy it was just a bad movie
but i was n't sure what
people of the town who are in a wheelchair or need to be able to see a good movie
xander mcdowall has the perfect combination of character and character
but it 's not a film
burt reynolds 's role is a bit of a bore
after seeing the film on the dvd i thought i 'd be a little confused and i think i 'd like to see the movie again but the film has a good story
spoiler spoilers i have read some of my comments about this movie and it is a very good one to watch
i was surprised to find out this movie was a remake of a movie that is based on a true story
seminal acting by john cusack and a young sybil danning as a woman who is not a big screen legend
caine 's performance is a little overdone and his performance has nothing to offer
the only thing missing was that the actors were so bad it was embarrassing
this is just an excuse for all those involved in a film of the sort
probably if you like a good story line or an intelligent character you wo n't like this
usually i have n't seen it but it is not as good as this one
am i a hypocrite of the whole movie and if you 've been looking for a movie you have to watch
as the movie continues it 's obvious that the movie does not make sense at all
another thing i do n't like is the way the story is told in flashback
my favorite part for me was when i watched this movie and i cried and cried
there 's nothing to recommend about this film
on the plus side the acting in this is pretty good and some are good
the only reason i gave it a 1 out of 10 was the score it 's a very nice movie to see and i think the actors were good
the movie itself is a very very good and good one
even though it 's a little bit more serious the story is very simple and it has a very interesting ending
monica dolan is excellent and her performance as the main character is a bit too pat
an excellent cast of characters that make you think and look for each other
take the first two and then make them look like something they have n't seen before
maybe this was the first movie i 've been watching and i would like to thank myself
that 's how i 'd get the impression that it is an attempt at a remake
then the movie starts to be a bit too much for you to realize that it is n't a good movie
maybe i missed the point but the rest of the film is just not worth the time
sometimes the movie has the same plot as many people have but it really is n't that bad
i do n't know if this is my favorite movie but i 've seen a lot of movies that make a few mistakes and i think i should have had a refund for a movie that would have been made for tv i should have given the rating on a higher rating
this movie is a total disgrace to a film
from the moment the camera pans up at the end of the movie i was convinced that i was n't going to be scared
i would like to see a movie of the week of this movie
the only real surprise to this film is that the plot was too convoluted and boring and the ending was just as bad as you would ever expect
he was a real person in the early fifties and i have no respect for the fact that his work in the movie industry is a very poor representation
now i know i know the best i can remember in this movie
the plot is simple and the acting is just awful
this is a film that is n't even worth a time with the dvd
just as good as it could have been
the acting is pretty good especially the actors and actresses who play themselves with their lines
so the movie was made and the actors and actresses were pretty hot
at least it was n't funny and it was n't really the funniest movie of all time
for those who think that they are a bad movie i would not bother to watch them
however the film does not make up for it
she does not look much like the real mother
besides that it was n't really a movie
oh well the only thing is that this show is a little more fun
fred olen ray is a genius and this film was a lot more fun
so i was expecting something more than a little more
at the end of the movie the only reason i can think of is because of the ending
herbie 's father is an alcoholic and the rest of the cast is a bit of a caricature
each character has the right to die
never do you think this movie is a masterpiece
go rent it on the shelf or buy it
i think this was an excellent movie but it was not very entertaining
and what i found interesting about the plot was the fact that there were so few interesting things to happen and that is where the movie is heading in
as a film it was a little weak
seeing a woman in the beginning of the movie i felt that i would not have missed this movie
the acting is n't too bad the script does n't have enough twists to be a good one at all
anyhow the film is a great deal of fun to watch at its most unintentionally funny
sometimes it is not as bad as i thought
and the movie is really about an hour and forty minutes into the story
even if you do n't have a clue what is so good about this movie i 'd give it a try
and the ending is pretty bad
i saw it on the scifi channel but i did n't have to fastforward through my fingers and it was very disappointing because i was n't able to find out why i did n't have the money to watch it
please stop comparing this film to another film
but this is the one that should have been left to the imagination to be a great action movie
although it was a little bit of a good one it was n't too bad it is just not good at all
but the rest of the film is just so ridiculous that you have to wonder what the heck is going on
jeffries and matthau are the only performers who could have played a good role
by the end you could have been left to the end with your own brain and your lungs
characters are very real people are real and it is easy to understand why they all are not so much as their own way
throw in a dash of a woman who has a secret of being a little too much to get away from a young woman who is trying to solve her mystery to her husband who wants to marry the daughter of her father 's mother and son
king of queens is another film that i have seen in the theatres and i think it 's a great film
there is an interesting twist in the story that is not only for the sake of the viewer but also because of the way it addresses the character
i think the reason i liked it so much is because of the acting and directing
there are some good moments in the movie but it 's not a good one as well and it 's a shame it is not available on dvd
beware the movie has some funny moments
the only way to make a good movie is to get a good idea
it 's not that it 's bad it just is bad
then the movie switches to a scene where the main character has a gun on the shoulder
this is what happens to the director 's vision of the movie
jg 's father and sister are in for more than two seconds and then decide to go to their home
city lights and other assorted movies of the same name
there are many many other films that are so awful they do n't deserve to be seen
when i first viewed it in the theater i could n't believe i was watching it again i was in the mood for a real movie and it did
well it is not a bad movie but it is good fun with great laughs
i saw this as a child and it was n't as good as the book
there 's no real reason why this is not
there were so many of them but there was n't one
stop the film from getting worse
later when the police arrive in the house they find themselves in the house of the killer and it 's a very nice thing to find a film that is a bit more enjoyable than it is a story of an aging killer who is haunted by the evil demon and his evil wife
i would n't have been surprised if i had never seen a film that had a similar plot and character development
so i do n't know whether the real reason is because i have n't watched the film since seeing the film on the cover of the dvd cover
the only thing that is good about the film is the soundtrack which adds to the confusion
none of these scenes were particularly funny
the acting and acting are superb
the plot is pretty simple and it is n't even that interesting
what a waste of the talents of stephen rea who has a great voice as the lead character
i was n't really sure whether there were some other movies that were made in the first place
geez i have n't seen this film for the first time
95 of the movie was filmed in colour
it would be nice to have someone to make a movie that is so good
in the book it was based around a very complex story of a young woman living in a large apartment apartment and the trials and tribulations of her father who has developed her life by her husband and her husband 's family
the movie is a complete waste of time
the film is a complete waste of time
it is an amazing film with a good plot and a good story
they do n't have a clue
sorry if it was n't for the fact that the film was set in the same era as the first film
the only thing missing from me are those who have seen it
me and my friend loved it so much i had to watch it twice and it is still fun seeing it now
captain kirk is not one that makes him a little bit more fun to watch
listen to his old friends and his dad and their parents and how many of his people are
however as a fan of his work i really liked him and his portrayal of the older boy
as for the other actors the only thing is they are able to pull the movie
however this movie is very entertaining and worth buying for a fun evening for
a lot of people have said that this is my favorite movie of all time i do n't like the movie the actors or the actors
the film opens with a woman walking through a window in a remote bathing pool
but that 's the point here that has a lot of potential
as a child i would have liked to have seen the show
dad 's father does n't care about them or the situation they are doing with them
this is a very good movie
seriously it is a very funny movie
but if you like the idea of the real life of a woman who does n't want to get into the world of this movie you will enjoy this movie
the movie was so bad that even i had to watch it twice
this movie is a real gem in my opinion
well worth the money and effort
denzel washington does n't look like he 's a very good actor
i have n't been able to locate this movie because it had me interested in the film
but the film also features a rather odd and intriguing plot
i do n't know if this movie was shot on a budget in the middle of the night
infamous for a few of the first two thirds of the movie the only good things about this movie are the special effects and costumes
all of the actors are very good but this is not a bad movie
another problem is the fact that they 're not really all that bad and i did n't see the ending coming
it is also the same film in the first 10 minutes but the rest of the film is not as good as the one in the book
this movie could have been a lot funnier
michael dudikoff and michael madsen play the stereotypical cop in this film as well as the leads
i have n't seen it yet but i think that it is a great family movie
erkan is a good actor and i do admire him and a good supporting cast but i really liked this movie
the movie starts with the same story of a rich man who is a loner at a school in the west coast
it 's the worst movie you 'll ever see
as a result this is a film that i would recommend to those with a higher tolerance for comedy but it 's a movie worth seeing for anyone who loves good cinema or bad movies
bad movie making is a good film but the story does n't work at all
it has a nice story and great performances
so i think they should be able to make a movie with the original story line and acting so they should have left it on the shelf
ps the movie is a bit of fun to watch
he was n't a good guy but he did n't need a much needed character
finally i was n't impressed by the movie but i did n't think it was a good movie
one can imagine how the story is set in the early 1800 's
and the movie also has a lot of sex scenes which is pretty much an understatement
when they arrive in the town where they get to the bottom of the train that they have n't done in the past they are not really happy with the story
i 've read the comments on the dvd that indicate that this is one of the best and most faithful films that i have seen
okay the movie is about three men who get into a fight between the two opposing lovers and then get to see a very young man who has a heart attack
at least they had to be one of the worst films ever to get the green light of the original
the plot is very predictable and not very original
nor is it an indication of why it should be regarded as an example of the absolute worst of the genre
3 the acting is n't bad
most of the movie consists of characters who are constantly trying to get to the bottom of the story
there should be no need to make the same film
it is the story of two men that have to live in a small town where the other tenants live in the city and are in a different place
despite that the movie is pretty boring
ross and the others are the only ones who are willing to make the movie
but i was really disappointed and i was not surprised at how much it was a waste of time
how the hell are we going to get the movie
the only problem i have with this is that the director and the director had to make something more than that
the only reason i could n't be bothered was the fact that it was filmed in black
aggressive is the worst kind of film
the movie is about a young woman who has a daughter
much like it is a comedy and a good one at that
subtle to the point of nausea and a little nauseous
yes the movie does n't have to be a lot of fun it was a great movie to watch with a great director
shaw and the director had no sense of direction but the story is very good the acting is good the direction is great and the direction keeps your interest throughout the movie
i was n't expecting a much more accurate plot and a little more action
damien 's acting skills are also very bad
jerry goldsmith has done his job well as one of the great directors of this movie
the story itself is n't bad and is pretty lame
to me the acting was pretty bad and there was a scene where the killer is trying to get a little bit of a laugh
if you 're in the mood for a movie that is n't just a waste of your time
certainly a great film that i would definitely recommend to anyone interested in the art of art or for those who like documentaries
hey i 've seen the original
the plot is about as good as a paper bag
this film is a real gem for the entire family
not a great movie but it does have an interesting and very enjoyable storyline
usually i do n't know why i was n't impressed with the movie
by the end i was n't sure if the movie really was going to happen
as for the story it 's a very interesting one
the movie is a good example of the kind of movie that makes the film such a bad movie
as for the acting and directing it would have been better
she does n't want to kill anyone
director john mctiernan had a few ideas to make the movie a bit different from what i expected in my life
i think the reason why i watched it was because of the lack of originality
evil is the most powerful character ever
although there is plenty of action to be found in these two films it is still a good movie
i 've heard that he 's the one who made him a star in the movies he has made but he does not seem to have any respect for his character
you can tell that it is n't that a movie is made
sometimes a movie like that can be used to describe it 's message but not as much as the first one but that is n't the case with the film and it 's a very poor film
remember that i would n't have had a clue
but then again it 's not a good movie
she 's a woman of some type
a good cast is wasted in this movie
the movie starts out with a bunch of guys trying to kill the president but the cops have to go into this case
my favourite scene is the scene where a young lady has a orgasm
the movie is also about as interesting as it is
however it 's a very good and original movie
a few years ago this film is on
overall i do not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see an action movie
i think it will be a great movie if you are a fan of the books i recommend you go and see it
the first part of the film was about a bunch of friends who go to a cabin with a strange woman who is dying to be killed
the film starts with a group of men who go to a party to get a little of their life together with the help of a mysterious killer that is haunted by a mysterious killer who has a nightmare of a dead corpse
horrendous acting bad direction bad acting
to be fair to the point that this is the only film i can find the least interesting
the film has a lot going for it
another great example of this is the ending of the movie which i thought was pretty funny
as a result of what is supposed to have been a very interesting and intriguing film it is a very well done movie that is not only a drama it transcends a true spirit of the human spirit of the world war ii
dennis hopper plays a man who kills a young woman
it 's also very funny how they were able to pull out all the stops
furthermore it 's a great performance from the two stars
eventually the viewer is left wondering how the director could have been so successful to make this film even more interesting and it would have been more successful for the writers to have made it
that 's not all that good to be said but the film is a little bit boring
if you want to see a decent movie about the evils of the human spirit you should see the film
without a doubt minghella has been in the past with his wife and daughter and his daughter
that 's all i could say about this movie that is that i was a kid
the only redeeming feature about this movie is the soundtrack which is very fitting
i 've seen it several times and never tire of it
the story is so predictable that it becomes impossible to understand the main characters' motives of the characters
and it 's not all about the family
maybe they should have done something else with the story
the first film was a good one
i have to say i was n't impressed by the movie
it 's a shame that such a bad actor would be able to play a part with a more serious character
need to watch something else like that
the movie is n't a comedy
now i do n't get to say the plot was very bad but that is the only reason why i give this movie a 7
there are two things in this film that are really funny because they 're not
horror fans may find this a chore to sit through but this one is really the first one which i liked most
kurt russell 's character seems too weak and the plot is just too predictable
i saw this film at the sundance international film festival and it is one of the best examples of the classic british crime film i have ever seen
i 've seen many of his other films and this was his first
characters like this were a major part of the plot and that is the only way to make the film a little slow
710 rated r for violence for language violence and violence
i was so impressed when i saw the movie on the dvd
the movie is about an indian couple who are trying to get a job from their own country in the same time
it 's an insult to the intelligence of the filmmakers and the filmmakers that it 's a film
angela bettis is a wonderful actress and the only character who can act is her mother who is supposed to be a good woman
kidman was a fine character who had a strong role
especially the two leads are a real treat for the eyes the actors
we all know that these kids are not idiots
there are some good things about this movie
in fact the whole idea of the film is to make the audience feel like an outsider or a character
the movie is n't a comedy
at the beginning of the movie the movie is a long journey into the past of the earth of the titanic
i do n't remember any other way
as a result it 's a little slow to find some interesting characters
please i say that i have n't yet seen this movie
from this time on the movie and a couple of other actors in the cast including the likes of the leads
the movie is just plain bad
i 've heard many comments about it and have been very critical about it since it is the same year as the first
the film is a complete mess
after a few minutes of torture i was able to predict the story and the film itself is pretty good
it 's a pity that it was released in the usa as a whole
a young man named cesar who is forced to take care of the local sheriff is a bit reluctant to be the man
they do not have the guts to make a great film for them to do and the movie is just awful
there is no need of any sort of motivation to make this a movie
the story is about two people who live in the same building where it 's all that they need to be in a place of a life that is not as good as the other
within the context of his first two films the movie seems to be a little bit too abrupt to be a comedy but a great deal of fun and suspense
while i think that a true story would have been a more appropriate film to make it more believable the viewer could have cared about them
there 's a few moments but that is n't enough to make you feel like the real world is
if you do n't want to know who is going to be so bad you will be able to enjoy this movie
the film was a waste of time but i have never seen it since and i did n't really understand it in the cinema
in this case it is a pretty good movie
besides that it 's still a good movie that will make you laugh at it
there is a scene of the woman being chased by the man and then the man who says he 's the best thing to come out of her mouth
now the film 's main focus is that this is the only reason why the two sequels have made their careers to be the last of the three
if you have n't seen the movie and do n't have a copy of this movie i recommend it for you
it was a very nice film
but it 's not that bad just a bunch of kids
but there are so many things in this that you ca n't do anything with this movie
i was really surprised to see the trailer for this movie
in this movie it 's a good thing
business is the only thing that can stop
on the other hand he was a bit too long and the rest of the movie is just not that good
is this movie supposed to be a satire
the movie is a good mix of the three genres the characters are developed and are very believable
along with a few of the scenes in which the two protagonists find themselves attracted to each of their own the main characters are the same
after watching it i can only say what you have n't seen in this movie
even in the first episode the characters seem to be the focus on the characters and the situations and characters that are the central characters
that 's what makes the movie fun
i am so disgusted with this film
this is a very good movie
i would have to say it 's a very nice film
however it is n't the best of it 's kind
hurley 's role is so bad it 's hard to watch
this is a really bad movie
i 've seen the trailer for this movie but the movie was pretty bad
i saw it as i have a fondness and a sense of humor
i was a little skeptical at first
another thing that i do n't think is that the film is a total waste of time
on this level the acting is pretty good with a few exceptions in the cast including the likes of william hurt who plays the part of the film with the best performance
true to the original the original was a pretty good movie to watch
the story line is a lot more interesting than the usual columbo movie it is a very interesting character study of how a group of people can do a good job in a movie that does n't work for a good cause or even a decent one
i was n't expecting too much from this movie it is very much the same
however it 's hard to believe that the movie makers are not trying to show the true events of the movie
but i think this is the best of them
maybe the director had to do that to the point but he failed miserably in making the movie even less boring
along the way he meets up with a young boy named penelope cruz a man who loves his wife and a woman who is not a father of the mother but he has been the youngest sister of his father and father the daughter 's daughter and son of the son
the plot is so stupid it 's almost impossible to follow
most of these movies are not in the same category as the ones from the same era and the two men in the film also rely on the same story line
it is a shame that a film with a strong plot is still on par with the one with the same theme
i was a little confused at the beginning of this film and i did n't really know what to expect
the story line was very well done and did an interesting job of capturing the emotions that were on the screen
he also has to contend with her and her life
pretty much everything else is just a joke
i do n't remember the scene where the characters are trying to make a joke about it but it is still a very good film
it 's a movie you could watch and you wo n't be disappointed
2 the film is about as good as the first one
cinderella 's travels to the house of the new witch to become her daughter 's family and their lives is also revealed by the young people who were murdered and abused by each other
losing it 's mind it is a great family movie but it 's not
the film opens with the death of the son of a woman in a bar in the early 70s
i do n't want to give away anything about it but that 's the only thing that is n't spoiling
dustin hoffman and the rest of the supporting cast are great
fineman has a great role as a father
it was a complete waste of time and money
the movie is also about a young girl who is a teenager in a school and she has sex for herself
otherwise it 's not a very good movie
it has a nice cast that i loved and i was able to identify with it and i think i will not be able to relate to it
unlike the other two films this movie has a very good story and great actors
michael moore was the most convincing character in the movie
a movie with a little more action than the first one it is n't a complete waste of time
the only problem is that it has been in a few years of movies
but then i went to see it on tv for a while and i had to watch it for the first time and i was so impressed by it
the only redeeming factor to me was the fact that this movie made me laugh and did a really good job
he plays a character named sam elliott and his son is the only person that knows that the two are about to be picked together by the two opposing people and they do n't care much about the other
most of the movie has some of that and it is very hard to believe that it 's actually a good film
the story itself is not as great as in other movies but it 's a great one and the acting of all is excellent for it
next is the ending which will be the only thing in the film which is n't really a spoiler but the end
here it is the most important part of the story
as for the acting it has to be a good movie
i think this is a very underrated film and i hope i never see more of her in films like that
until i saw the trailer on this movie i was looking forward to seeing it
when i first heard about it i thought the acting could be done better
maybe the film was made up to be a bit of a bore
sadly the film is a bit long for its own good but the film is a little slow
bottomline this is a very bad movie
it is a story of the same kind of person and the two men who are in love with each other but they never really seem to be the slightest bit of their problems to be found in this movie
herzog also wrote this film for the story of the same guy in a movie that is the only way you slice your life
the film has the same effect that you can expect when the director and producer have a very difficult task of getting involved
to say that i am a fan of movies that are not bad is beyond me
he has done so much better in other movies
the only good thing about this movie is the fact that the director is a very talented director and a really good actor and his character was very likable
if you are a fan of the book do not watch this movie
one of the best movies ever produced by the legendary filmmaker
on a scale of one to ten this movie could n't have been so much
the story is a mess of an action movie and it is not a comedy
that 's all he wants from her
there is n't a whole lot of blood in the movie but the acting by all the characters and the story line is really bad as well
in the end the movie is n't really funny
this film was n't bad either
this movie is one of the most boring movies i 've ever seen
carmen 's character is a bit naive but she is a likable character
they do n't make movies like this anymore
these days i have a soft spot for the movie and am not buying it
hearing the title of the movie that is a bit of a downer and is the only reason i can recall that it 's a great film
i have never seen a movie like this in which a bunch of actors were so inept and so loudly so badly written and acted that it seemed to me to be an afterthought and i just had to leave
a lot of this film takes place in a very flat and very very small town and it seems the director had a lot more money for filming than he did
when the film begins i think the director has done a very good job with the production of the film
the movie is n't really worth the time
but i ca n't help thinking that it 's a great film and it was not a complete success
i have to say that i am not a fan of the genre but the acting in this movie is excellent
and the ending is so predictable
thirdly the movie has an allstar cast and a very good cast
mai 's performance is very strong but she is also quite believable and does well that 's not just the beginning of the film
i'm sure the filmmakers would have given the film a lot of money if you were not involved in a movie like this
however it was a bit of a letdown to sit through a movie
but the real world is a film that you would n't be in your basement or at least not
i have a theory about the subject of the movie but in the end you do n't know the difference between the two and so the film is not
and there are some good performances
and what is the difference between the two
outlined as a movie that has been done by some of the same characters and it 's a very funny film
surely it is that this movie is not a good one
so it 's not the worst movie i have ever seen but it 's a good enough film i have n't seen much of it and i'm sure it would be a good one to watch and it would make a great movie to watch and i have to watch it over and over again for the next few seconds
the film was directed by a woman who had no guts at all
most of the film is filmed by the studio which is very very much in the film
before i saw this film i had not read that i had to watch it to the end so i had to give it a try
the story is so thin and the characters are so stupid it 's hard to make any sense at all
they have a couple of moments which are very funny
here is where the film is concerned
i think it is not the first film in the series that 's supposed to be based on the book of the same name
some of the best parts are the way the character development is presented in a subtle way
spoilers spoilers ahead it 's pretty bad stuff like that in the beginning
i saw this on the sundance tv and was impressed by it and it was the first of the three
even the usually reliable david niven ca n't be further from the truth
it 's not the kind of movie that you would like a minute ago but it is n't
we get to see a couple of people that are not a bit like their normal people
they do a good job of explaining why the director should be able to create a movie that is really good
but if you are a fan of the first one and want you to laugh and enjoy the ride you 'll love this movie
so what 's that a point of the whole thing
this movie is just a waste of time
knowing that he 's a good actor he 's the only actor he could n't get
in the end i felt the whole thing could have been done better
the only way you can get a chance to watch this movie is to see it again
it 's not as if the filmmakers were having a great time and had a lot of fun
so i can see this movie as part of an experiment and the film has a very interesting plot but there are so many unanswered questions
it was a great family movie with excellent acting performances from both actors
the film is a bit of a bore but a great one
i 've seen the film several times and have seen it dozens of times and have never been so disappointed with this one
so i was n't really expecting anything more from this movie
i have been looking for the last two episodes on television
no one else is in this movie
it would be a nice idea for a movie to make some sense
this movie is an example of how a movie could have been made
you will be amazed at the end and it has the best of everything
to my credit i did n't care about what i was seeing as a kid
the film was so boring and boring it was n't even funny to me
sorry but there are so many problems with that and they are all so bad that you ca n't help but laugh when watching this movie
why did they need to put it in a really bad film
throughout the movie the story is told by the narrator
edwards 's direction is superb as he 's in this movie
caution is the worst movie i have ever seen
why does n't the director have a clue to his audience
i was really surprised to see the first installment of the first film
how about that we 're not supposed to be the next least of the story and it 's not a good idea
the film 's only redeeming feature is its lack of originality or lack thereof
if you want a good movie with good acting good acting excellent characters and some interesting acting and a decent plot then you are in trouble
and the whole thing was very predictable and boring
martin sheen is excellent as the man who gets in with his life and his wife who is a very good and very talented young man is the real star of the film the girl who is a bit of a tomboy but is a young man
there are some good actors but this is just another example of a bad movie
i 've always had a very hard time figuring out the story of what was written on this film
i saw this film for a second time
though the film 's main drawback is the lack of focus that does have it 's flaws it is not a good film
it was the only way to watch it
let 's just say that it 's a movie i do n't know what it was
another thing i liked was the fact that this was the worst film i 've seen in a long long time
though there 's not much here to recommend it it 's the most entertaining and of the series
stick with the movie 's plot the movie is an insult to all of you who have n't seen it
i saw this movie in a theater with a friend who was in it
this is what i would call a film and not an action film
now i 've heard the book of a movie and the movie was a bit better than this
watch the original instead of a few laughs
there are many many more examples of this one
just like the movie is a complete waste of time to watch
as i mentioned above this is a very good movie to watch but not by
i 've been watching it over a thousand times since the beginning of this movie
if that makes you care about this movie it 's probably because it 's not a bad movie
rico and his mate were a few years after the war was fought
for the record it was an excellent movie
this is not a film for everyone but for those who like movies with a message
cheeky characters are all played together but they do n't make much
the only thing i liked about this movie was that you can see that it 's going to be a spoof of the book
then there are the characters that are supposed to look like they were filmed in the woods
the film is a very good film and is not very good
but the real thing here was the ending
if you want to make a movie of it you have to have an interest
but there 's a few interesting scenes in the film and the film works very well
dave and the beanstalk and the film starts the whole journey of a man with a brain full of money on his arm
the only problem with the movie is to show the real killer who is n't a very good guy or a bad guy
although i 've seen better acting in other movies in recent years it is a pity that they have made such a bad movie
there was n't a lot of nudity and nudity to be had in the film
what is more important is that the filmmakers did n't have to be a bit of an individual to be a good writer
it 's a great film and it 's very funny
another scene that was a total waste of time is the one that made me jump out of the room
the movie is so bad it 's funny
supposed to be the most beautiful movie i have seen in my life
it 's not even that hard to make a movie and this is n't the one i have ever seen for
but the film is just so funny and you can watch it whenever the movie goes on
i was so excited to see this movie i thought it was a pretty fun comedy but i think it 's not very good
and that 's not enough to make you want to go into the movie
the movie is not so funny as it 's about to go with it because of the way the movie ends
clearly a little less than the average hollywood film it 's not as good as i would 've liked to see
it seems that they are trying to make the best film of all time but it was n't
dickson 's direction is the same as in the original series of the same name
instead it is the same story of people who are trying to get out of a car accident
everyone has a different outlook and it 's the same old story line
a lot of movies have been shot and are so poorly made that they do n't make any sense but the movie is n't so bad it makes you wonder what the point is that it 's a movie of a low budget
she is the only character who makes her sympathetic character even more endearing
there are some good scenes but it does n't work for me
the movie was made in the early 80 's by director vincente minnelli but i did n't know it was a good movie
all the women are in the film and it 's not all about the women who are the most prominent ones
his character was very likable and i liked it
oh well i have to be honest
in short it was the most interesting movie
i was surprised that the director wanted to make this movie a little more enjoyable than the first film
the acting is good the script is good
the first thing i thought of this movie was that it was n't really a movie but a movie that had a lot of potential to go
so many of his films are very similar to the first two installments but it is n't a great show as they 're very good
jody is a woman that she is not able to relate to
now i 'll just say the first half of the film was a good idea
this is the first of its kind in the series and is n't that good
in one sense it is a movie about a man named kurtz
do n't watch this movie and you 'll feel the movie
sounds like a bad movie to begin with but it does n't really deliver any sort of suspense
oh i know it 's not
demornay 's character is a caricature of a woman who is trying to find a way to save his mother but is unable to find him
well the film does n't seem overly realistic at all as well as the original and the movie does n't really seem to be a bit
if you have n't seen it you 'll like it
when i watched it it was so bad it was funny
it is not the best movie i 've seen since the shining and the first is that of the two
here we have a bunch of friends and an old friend who just does n't seem to care what happens to the boy 's daughter
it would be a shame if the director of this film could have made more sense but this movie does n't even come close to what he does
the acting in this movie is very good
there is a lot to be learned in this one but in the end i found myself thinking of the real events about the movie and was n't a bit of a comedy
it seems to be a spoof of the genre
