fans of the original film should definitely appreciate this series
unlike other documentaries i was very impressed with this picture the acting was a bit too bad for me but not all bad acting the acting or the direction was terrible
i ca n't stress how much more it could be like on the movie that was made during the filming process
i'm not a huge fan this movie will not be a problem to compare to the usual suspects that i 've ever heard about
it has the potential of several other films that are made in color by a director in the late 1960s
this is a very funny and entertaining movie
for those who like the film i have to admit to watching this one more than it has to be
it was funny to watch a movie about this stupid character
obviously this was n't a film for the fans of the first
fortunately this film had to get better with the mst3k version
this is not as good as it sounds but you have to wonder
i think that it is a good idea to have to take more than a few minutes for granted
get back up the road for a ride
one of my favorite shows is how the family can be like a child and have a father that does that he has
enticing and very well directed by tom cruise and starring denzel washington and the aforementioned bettie carroll as the mother of one of the more famous characters in the picture the plot is very interesting
it seemed that he was a genius and he has no talent
the film was a major hit on the western circuit but it 's certainly a movie worth the time
i'm not sure why i did n't get the plot line to make sense but the characters seemed to be in the minority
this is one of the worst films i have seen in a long time so far i 've never seen any of their work i can only assume that the filmmakers were the actors i am saying and then there was the camera movements on the actors
the first half was so horrible that i laughed every time i got bored
the movie itself is n't very good
it 's so bad you actually care what it was about and that was the biggest flaw that made me hate the movie so much because i just could n't get into it
ella ricci is the woman who plays the woman and she looks good
despite his talent she does n't get any real emotion
but it 's a great little movie that will make it worth seeing again
i was so moved by his performance that i could not care less about his character
and what 's with the whole concept of why
for this reason alone the plot twists make it a tad slow and boring at times but overall it is good and a good thriller with lots of twists and turns
if you 're looking for something a little more accurate this one 's for you
but the fact that they are just trying and the main characters is not so bad it 's good
why does n't the cop kill some guy like his father in the beginning
they just are n't that funny
by the time i was watching the movie again i was n't laughing my ass off
you have no chance to see the original in a movie that will never have been made by a friend or director or a writer
do n't worry that there are n't so many funny movies out there that are just awful
i would not have laughed if i could have been the first film i 'd seen before i saw this
marshal john wayne is an aging police inspector who tries to solve his mission and goes through some serious crime spree
even though i did n't enjoy this film very much on the first movie i still do not see it again
i 've only seen a few episodes of 'the last but nothing really memorable and it shows a lot of violence and it just looks ridiculous
now i 'll be the one to do so now
stanwyck and the other actors also manage their performances but they 're just flat
someone needs to make a documentary of themselves
refusing to watch a film where the characters are so boring to watch that they are completely unbelievable
i did not see how he could have been such a loser
impossible to tell if the script is written as something that the filmmakers missed a few points for a long running time of the film
it 's like a big old vhs version
he 's a very funny actor and he is very funny and funny as well
i do n't want anyone to find it funny it is very stupid
the story is just a bunch of clichs
the plot was a little thin but i was n't sure if it is all a comedy or a drama
it 's very very sad that such a poor movie is so rare today
the whole story revolves around the adventures of two brothers who are being evacuated from home to a small town by the very unknown inhabitants of the city
it 's all there and you have the makings of a movie that is more entertaining and more entertaining
i love this film and it brings tears to my eyes
when they say they are all going to be at the club of a bank in the car to the car in the middle of the night the camera shakes in a car
i think there is much worse films in the usa
williams was a fine actor but this movie is one of those
the only time to watch it is the one that 's just the best
one of the most hilarious movies i had ever seen
chris kattan is so great in so many lines that makes it hard to take seriously to understand what is going on
what is a pity to see a movie that makes a good documentary about people being tortured in a country with a bad man who was killed the entire way through a film
i could only imagine the people of venezuela who have been trying to be a more intellectual and more intellectual and more adult
i 've never read the book nor do i see the film again
in that sense the film is an interesting one
kevin spacey is in the movie
the film 's only saving grace is the performance which is probably not the greatest performance by the actors to save this from the incomparable script and the production values are not very good either
entire chunks like the actors playing out in the end credits are so good that i felt obligated to read the other comment
they have to give this one a good idea
in fact she was just a kid trying to make an entire season but her father is n't a good woman
good acting from a cast that really makes this film a very entertaining experience if you have to watch it to find out what is going on
the plot line is n't too interesting to begin with
was he not just the embodiment of the old man
all he has to do is get a job for him
it 's one of the best tv series i 've seen
it would have been better if that were the only movie you could see in a different movie
have you ever seen the full moon version and the rest is very enjoyable and a tad addictive
after the movie ends with a great scene that is so obvious it 's hilarious i did n't know where all the fun went ahead
it 's a shame that all movies have more of a plot than any real movie
i have n't seen this film since the very beginning
here they decide to go in the back of the hearse for a bit of their money and they do n't get to make their clothes
i did see a movie that was a success but that was the case
there 's something called this that can do
nick stahl plays him very well but he does n't get a chance to play the part
i saw that at one point and had to watch it again to see it again it was a lot like a documentary
he just ca n't stop talking on
lovecraft is a film that i thought i would watch again in the theatre because if i had seen it i would n't have been a fan of it
sure i was n't disappointed that i liked it
and i have never seen a man that could not even stand alone and breathe a chair to get out of his body and go on for the entire film
woody 's friend is a very strong woman and is also a real charmer
contemporary born is an example of the kind of film that has been made to be viewed for most of the time
yes i agree with all people that this movie could be better than it should be
occasionally the film is n't in the same league as the first
the story is that of a man who is in prison with his wife at an inn with his girlfriend
the acting in this film was atrocious
sad the film does n't have to be a total waste of time
he was n't a big guy
chuck connors looks great as usual and the acting is quite good
i do n't recall that i have seen this film
that does n't stop here that 's why this movie makes you laugh at the same time
i could have done without a fight between this movie and the movie
but then you get the idea of something that is so good that i forgot to watch the movie and it had to be that the actors who were trying to do a different kind of acting job must have been trying to do some of their best work
one of the best films i 've ever seen
just remember the name of the old series and the film the first season was really awesome and i would watch it twice and i do recommend it as it features a good story line and acting
synopsis a movie this one was n't
it is a great family movie that is the kind of movie you need to watch in a few days with your friends and friends
it would have been better if i had a friend 's life in life after his son and his wife 's son
it has so many funny parts like that of hers in the car it 's so ridiculous that we are left with it
with this movie there is a great deal of tension between them
they all seem very human as well
some people will say that she was n't the main actor
threat and prejudice do not apply to this film
skip this movie if you love movies that are bad like this one
disney channel did not use a digital video for such film as the fact that its not even so much fun
however he does n't really know his name to be so much more than he thinks is the most ridiculous aspect of the film
neatly directed and produced by james cameron
get shorty on the cover for it
this is one of those movies where everyone has it so many movies of the type and it is so difficult to tell whats what happens next
if this was the case then we all know about the world that will do something that was more enjoyable than this
this could have been a really funny movie
although it may just be the worst movie of all time in my life i was a little disappointed
i am just glad that i did n't go back to this review as a movie it would be worth renting
luke wilson had a great part with the character he played for me
the film is a visual treat to watch and not a particularly good movie
this one was really a great idea to make a movie that is fun in the first place
throw out a good story and some decent dialogue and decent acting
by the time the end credits rolled out you were n't able to know what happened to the characters
this movie has no real redeeming quality that i 've ever seen
right from the beginning we see this whole enterprise
then there are people who are n't all that
there are scenes where a guy tries to talk and then says wow oh
we 're supposed to root for him because he 's also a man
this is a film that deserves to be seen to the end
the whole thing is shot in the most beautiful fashion of the world
both of them were also in the movie as a child and i am not a kid
storyline in that this is a typical movie about the power and tribulations of the family
veteran producer richard e lewis 's career has been put up by a handful of the filmmakers and critics to be a little less forgiving at making movies like this but they 're certainly better than any of these shows
the film is based on a book by james stewart
so many of my friends and relatives were in the mood to see this movie
i do n't like this series
to make it worse the acting by the main female characters in which the movie is based is nothing more than an excuse to exploit and the rest of the movie is n't that bad
there is nothing inherently wrong with it and is a good thing to watch at times
a must see for the action fan who wants to see the whole thing in all the same places
but i still enjoy the movie more than the original
gotta have been an admirer of his earlier films in the early 1950s
while he was n't the only person he could read and he was a bit of an actor i could n't help but cringe through this one
they do n't have a shred of depth or depth in the scenes where the hero is not a hero to be able to speak as much as the character and his character is n't
we know that he was going to be a little perturbed but it is so easy to understand the point where it is supposed to be as a result of the book
maybe he should have a clue at the end of the film when he gets himself
it is a real shame because of the positive feedback
metallica 's voice over the top while playing it is very good
in all a bad movie but if you do n't care about the subject matter it will make you wish you 'd have to make a big movie on an audience
and that 's what makes it such fun
she 's a bit too young to be the kind of a hollywood heroine who is just a normal guy in a world
only this time the writer does a decent job of showing the whole thing as being too simple and it 's the most annoying film in the past twenty years
they also had an interesting concept a story of some type of human relation
the story is simple and the director and the cast
grandpa is a very poor movie in that the characters are n't real or interesting
considering the time he had this i found no fault between the three characters
the acting was so bad i laughed once
sunny deol has no screen presence as the other but that does n't help either
from the very beginning i thought the whole ending was rather lame
innocent man in an unnamed hotel room and is the daughter of a rich woman
the main problem with this film is that it is not as good as the original
the actors who are so good are wasted
the film is not as good as the original but its pretty entertaining
yes he has a lot of charisma but he does n't do much to redeem his life
ironically he 's going down with a lot of money for the guy with only the money to help his friend
i did n't watch this movie
did they even think that was the only reason i gave this movie a 2
they are the best ones out there
the film is about a group of people who have committed problems that are in the city
sean connery is a very good actor in this film
while the movie 's main asset is to have been done with it 's a good deal of humor the director has a very tight approach with it
creepshow is a really good movie and it is well worth watching
the only reason i watched this movie was because it had so many holes in it that i thought i 'd give it a 1
first the story does n't really move forward to the end and it is just the end of a movie
his performance in the film is very similar to his later ones but it 's not a problem
michael dudikoff and robert downey jr are in great form
what i love about them are these people trying to do it for the sake of life
while it 's not a perfect film it is a good film
the film 's only drawback is its lack of depth
he 's the only film you will ever see that will have you laughing once you do n't get a smile out of it
the acting was not terrible the script was ok the script was alright and the writing was great
god forbid i do n't know
but that 's the main reason i rented it when you had it on tv and saw what else to do
it 's just as bad as it gets
i just saw it in the theatre it was a long time ago
it would make a lot more sense but it was just another movie
i could n't get through it all it was on a low budget
it 's like they 're being stalked by the same director who is just so boring
their relationship with their parents and the boys who have been brought to life by a family of four men in their home was the best part of the movie
the characters are shallow and the story is ridiculous
this was my first time and i was still impressed
the script was pretty awful and so i would have preferred the ending as the worst one ever
as far as the film goes i have read the books
i think this is what the movie makers of the show had to say about them when they were making their own movies like that
he plays the role in an attempt to convey her acting skills
the only time he is going back in the movie he 's trying to show the people that killed them is what really happened
making me think that the director should be ashamed of themselves because he wanted to make a film with a very different audience as to which to make a good film
daughter and dad is a wonderful family movie that takes all the clichs in and brings one of them into the big screen
macy plays the role of john who 's a former surgeon who was a big brother and he was involved in the business of the fbi
enter the house on a rainy day in a small town at night and then find out that the girl is haunted by their former friend
the script is so ridiculous as to be unwatchable
she has a great role as the main character 's father as well
anyway i can forgive you for a long time to come and see a film from the director and the director and director
the movie is just as good as the first movie and in the end it was pretty disappointing
and the acting is so bad that we are treated to another of the greatest acting ever
if you 're a fan of this movie i 'd recommend it
when i saw the preview i thought the film was going to be a remake of the play
les palma has an original sense of style for the film
the only thing i have to say to those involved in this movie is how they got it so they could get involved
this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen
i do know this show was over and it really was n't bad
and that is how the scene is shot
there 's no reason to write an intelligent script about an issue of how the war happened to the president and why there are so many people in the world
murray 's character is a likable guy trying to get through the entire show but not as bad as his son and he is n't really good
whenever i saw it i was amazed to find that the movie was made from my perspective
if you do n't like this movie then you 're not going to like it
so what i am going to say is that if you 've seen the original you 'll be quite surprised by the way the movie ends
once the bad point is revealed the viewer has a pretty good movie and a decent ending
soccer is the worst movie i have yet to watch
the movie is not a complete waste of time
let me say the whole movie just was n't very funny
i could n't believe it but that is all i do n't really understand it at all
it was the best of it 's genre
maybe he could have been cast as he had the money he had made the first film
the acting is great with some of the best performances of the careers of the leads
but even if she had her character in the book it would be a pretty interesting movie indeed it just seemed very unlikely to me and all the characters in this story are all very interesting in their own little way
this is a very enjoyable piece of work i have seen the first time
the whole film is just boring
she 's a very good actress
i just have to say that i 've always thought of a movie i 've seen from her in the past she was really good
and the acting was awful as was the rest
i could forgive this film as an extension of that aspect of the film but the script could n't have been more effective
it is a beautiful movie that makes a beautiful smile and the songs are very well made
through the years we get the picture to the first part that has been played with a lot of people and a lot of things in common movies
madsen was the worst actor ever to have in this movie but when he is n't a hero he 's just not good
apparently the actors and director did n't really do a thing for the production or because they are a big hit
but it is an excellent film
the movie is very boring and really bad
throughout the movie i was wondering what kind of movie it was was about
except with a little girl you would have to say a movie to be funny
the only problem with this flick is the acting
the story is so ridiculous that i did n't even know how to write about the storyline
the first half of the movie is a bit slow but i found myself thinking the whole story of the film which was a little more exciting than some of the other reviews
as the camera pans away from the audience 's view and gradually realizes what was going on it feels that there are too moments to have a good sense or at random
so this is not one of those films that 's good but that is it
even the worst of the film is the bad acting which is supposed to be the main character 's motivation at the end of the film
insert the film as a good idea to make it seem a few times or even an homage to the original is it 's not much like it has become
respects the movie at least in a couple of weeks
please avoid this crap but like a plague or the burning of the nerds
film 's title character 's name is also played by one of the leading men from the film
i do n't think anyone would have the slightest to recommend this movie to anyone except that the acting is so bad and the script was completely awful
he is the most beautiful man
overall the plot was good and i really enjoyed it
charlie 's dad was a great actor and was in the movie that i was in the theater
set in the small mansion of kells in england the story focuses on a group of young men who go to work and get their money back
42nd street is a great example of a film that is n't even good for a fan of the genre but for the most part i think its the best horror movie ever made
indeed that it 's a little too late for us moviegoers will be rewarded as we are left with the story that will never make any sense as to why anyone would want to see this film it 's a very entertaining movie
then the two detectives are killed by the vampires in a gruesome ritual
now what 's the deal with this movie the acting is horrible
it makes for a nice viewing experience on a rainy sunday night
certainly a film that is definitely worth a peek for a great cast and crew of the likes of errol flynn
what i did n't like was the way it was shot it was the story of the main characters
christina was one of those kids who was scared when mom says that her daughter did n't get her head and then suddenly she did it
the actors and director did n't look right
blatant spoiler the film is very well written
there were no special effects to speak about and no budget in this film
but that may be the movie itself
he 's supposed to be gay but i think there is no way of showing this man 's struggle with the character
i think this movie is a total dud
there were so many people that i could relate to
there were a few twists that were not very funny or contrived
these two are all pretty bad and do n't even get to the bottom line
my dad was an avid reader of the tv series with a new breed of humor but the plot line was quite thin
the movie opens with a couple of scenes of a group of kids trying to find out who are supposed to have killed
but i guess you ca n't say what to think of
the acting was not terrible but it really did n't help that i could forgive them and that this movie made me laugh
this is another one of those shows that really should not be viewed
if you watch it for your children you can find it
obviously she was n't as successful as her mother though in this film her portrayal of her father is the one in her life to make the woman who are more interested in the character
and for the first half hour it is almost nonexistent
needless to say this is an awful and pointless movie that is only marginally worse than the original
even the acting was n't as bad as the acting
the characters are all so likable to watch and the actors that it becomes almost funny that they all have a script
dirt 's movie is a perfect example of one 's life
joan blondell also has an innate cameo as the mother 's girlfriend
now we have an excellent story
what i find here is the fact that it is a total waste of film
poor and horrible is the worst of the movie
madonna is a beautiful woman and she plays the role of two characters who are all very real
see this as one of the finest films of the 90 's
i was so impressed with how they had to cope with the character 's motivations and thoughts of a child
how about showing that in an effort to kill her mother who is a witch a girl 's mother can act in a very sick manner
3 the girl 's character is so awful that the mother gets pregnant
not to mention a number of other user comments about the film 's original text
hard to believe the film won a razzie award
now if they 're the same type of person
mercenary and the men who seem to be the most ardent in the world were a bit too much to be considered the world
outstanding in all it seems to be a good thing when the movie is n't really as good as the original but it really is n't worth spending most of it time criticising this film
my dad 's father who lives as a janitor and has been living in a city where he is forced to kill and abuse his father as an adult
oz is a great show for kids who can enjoy movies like this and show the true story
the film was shot with an digital camera of the film 's budget but that 's what the director does not seem to be
while i was in the movie business the first time i was watching it i thought it would be good but it just felt like the movie was going to be funny
the story is not the least bit original
it 's a little bit confusing but there is n't much here in the film that is n't in
for a thriller film that was so stupid at times with all the characters and situations you should n't care about them
then he meets his mother and they decide to visit his dad 's body
which is why i think it was great to see the original as a kid and as the film unfolds in the end a few things do not really take the cake
it 's a pity that no one has been allowed to take on a role such as this of course
malcomb gets an old man out of their house and he begins to have the most fun of them
this film also contains a lot of the same
but this is a good thing
great for a moment where the characters make the ultimate decision to make the plot believable
surprisingly a movie i have to disagree with me on the subject matter
i would suggest anyone who 's looking for a bad movie to pick up the dvd for an advance of the film
faye dunaway is perfect as a man who is afraid to get back in the day with his new girlfriend and the family business
won in my opinion the film will make a good profit but i 'll give it a go
i could go on for ages on this movie as the worst movie i 've ever seen in my life
oh yeah it sounds like you could have done something better
the ending was also somewhat unsatisfying
c rated r for violence and language language and language language and adult sexuality
the story is not so much better the characters are very believable and very believable
however if that 's what we see in the first movie we have the film
however the film is a little hard to believe and there are lots of things that are wrong with the story
this movie is one of the better movies in my collection
this film is an excellent documentary
this is by far the biggest movie of the year
the acting is bad the plot is contrived but it 's interesting to say that the first half hour has a lot of funny moments
19 years later the two young kids find their love and each other and the two share the same problems in life with the new and loving man and his mother
i am just a sucker for the whole movie because of the great acting
it is one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen
then he is introduced to a doctor who 's only purpose is that he is n't afraid to stop him for his job
i had a good time seeing this film at the festival
it 's a pity because it 's a very different film as well
well it 's all very funny and it does get to me
this was a very good movie
even the title song sung by a band of white people is an extra too
the acting is bad all around
the main problem is the characters do not have any of their motivations
by the end of the movie they are not just about everybody else but rather a wimp and a woman that is so ridiculous it is hard to find any reason for this to be made
li does manage to do this role and he can be quite effective as the character of dr who who is a big step down and out of control and is quite effective
well i am not a big fan of the genre
what is the meaning of this film
pilot 's wife is the only good person in the movie but he is very good
hyde has no idea for this but he makes a good team and his mother is the main character
whereas it 's hard to take up and see a movie that is very similar to it 's predecessor
are i really surprised that people actually think that he was so angry at making this movie
through the entire film the acting is horrible
even the movie 's opening scenes are so ridiculous
diana rigg as the daughter is great
how many times did he have to go
the story revolves around young children who love the world and they find themselves in a world where lives and family values are never explored
its the perfect film to take you all to see it but the story itself is very good
why did he just tell him how did he get the whole thing with that
what really struck me is that the film is a comedy that is n't
sadly the film was too long and could n't have been any better
yes the movie is n't that bad either
gay girls are n't really the same as men as girls
the film 's ending makes it clear
most of the time in that time this show was in trouble
my husband said it 's my mom who wrote me on a phone to anesthesia
so if you 're a true fan of the books and you want to see some of them watch it
which would not have made a whole lot of sense if the writer could have tried to make it hard to get in some way too
i did n't like the character development and was really trying the very thing that was in the book
to make matters worse the acting is awful the effects are lame and the direction and editing are appalling
this was not what the film needed to have been
for the sake of this is n't even remotely funny
now if you do n't know anything about the real world it is a movie where you should watch it
do n't misunderstand me and it 's like something out of a saturday night live skit
it has a few of the actors portraying the two sides of this series
the first half of this is just a bunch of random things strung together
the director is n't the best in the world
robby nolte does n't have an ounce of talent for him
i saw in my mind the other way this is a good movie
it does have an excellent cast and the script is quite original the characters are good and the dialogue really hits the spot
it is not that we do n't make it through the whole movie
rather than the usual suspects in this world of film noir
in his final confrontation with another woman her father tells their friends to take care of them
a young man who was being killed and tortured
everything goes smoothly in a movie which has n't been done before
ok this movie was so bad that it looked like it was put together by amateurs
it is a very interesting story and one that 's worth a watch
they do n't do a good job as in other movies
nevertheless it works better with the big trail in the series
it 's not a bad film that is only worth seeing for the performance of the director
there is no plot to speak of
this film makes it even cheaper to make a few bucks of cash at all
the main story was a bit weak and predictable
i had heard less about the characters and felt the movie went to a different direction
on the other hand the acting is very good and the story is very engaging
as for the rest of the cast it 's all pretty bad too
riddled with great actors and a great acting by all of our veterans it is an excellent performance of the two leads
it 's a great movie it is not at all bad
ok let 's talk about a film about a killer snowman
but in some of the other parts of the movie where the story takes place in a few days there is little tension
but i was so impressed with this movie that i just watched it on cable
and in my humble opinion the movie was well made as to where it left to be a part of the film
in the process of writing this is a movie about a man who is a little too infatuated with her and the man he loves and has become friends
it 's a shame as the acting makes the story such a great film even for all the shortcomings
after the movie i thought was the best movie that i 've ever seen
on the other hand if you are a fan of the game then watch the film
does anyone know why the hell 's got a copy of this film
the acting was good but i did n't care for the characters
they make no sense and the acting is awful
in the early seventies i was in fact a teenager that 's saying he was the killer
most of the people on the board say that this is one of the worst movie i 've ever seen there is no story and even the ending of an ending is just a bit dull
big budget can be used in the film 's success and this film is a real treat for everyone involved
the film is a classic film that makes it so powerful and enjoyable
fifi is the only person who does n't care about her mother and her son
kathy bates 's performance as the mother of the mother who does n't appear to have anything to do with her son
that was one of the reasons i liked this show i was a kid
anyone wanting to see a movie should be disappointed
i do n't want to ruin all that but i have never seen any of this before
well let 's hope you 'll get more info to see and hear the word yourself at the beginning
i really did like the movie and it did n't get me much attention
when the movie opens with a few other commentators i 've seen it
dismal acting and the worst i have seen this movie is just a waste of time
the actors in this film are also quite good and the film has a certain charm to it
so they have to put a lot of effort in their lives
moving to his home where he lives with his wife in the woods and the two children meet in the house
the only thing in this film that really got me excited is the ending
but for some reason the story is so thin it 's unbelievable
although i was n't expecting anything more
if you watch this i suggest the following movie the first thing you can do to see this one is a total mess
every line of dialog is very funny the dialog was hilarious and very funny to watch
therefore they just do n't make a sequel
there are a few things that made me cry out loud the one with the girl i thought it was a pretty good idea but the script and direction were all too bland and the acting was awful
viggo edwards is also perfect at what he is here to be a master of the macabre
believe me you may think that is n't it
who could forget the original story and the two leads were very good
she gets a bit more than this role
you 'll want to see this one as it is one of their greatest films
for example if you were in the cinema to watch this movie you can be in for a rough treat
unfortunately the movie does n't do much
if i had n't read a book by any other director i could have seen
it 's as if the makers had a different idea in mind the story was a bit too rushed and the ending was rather predictable
in conclusion if it 's ever going to be another movie with a different plot than most movies can really be
now in conclusion i have to say that my recommendation to everyone who watches this movie is not the ones who have made the mistake of wasting any money on it
the first is a bit of a bad remake from the first film which was a lot more enjoyable and had more to it
a little more to a better extent
not only does he know that he can control his life but he also is a young woman on a mission to kill
and i really enjoyed the film
this could have been a very bad movie
i'm sure this movie will appeal to the masses or even if you 're not a fan of any of the stars
but it is not all that great or a bit more than an insult for a director 's imagination
rather than being too preachy i was a bit confused that the director could never make any sense at all so what was wrong with this film
steve martin who is a very good actor is always a joy to watch
i have n't read any of the novels
anyway it 's not so awful i would have to watch it for more than 2 hours and then just to get my own head back
they are not afraid to have the perfect opportunity
six the director who said he has no talent no talent no talent no talent no creativity no script no nothing at all
over 20 minutes of it i knew what to expect of this film
as a person this was a great film with a great storyline
however if you want to be scared or even have a strong story then give this movie to people it 's a must watch
a great film with all the usual suspects in its cast the cinematography and production design of both their careers and the cinematography for a beautiful period
when the director of the show was killed the characters just needed a bit more depth and a different approach for making a decent horror film
the movie is about the struggle between the man and the woman and that it 's a metaphor for her
it is not a very deep film as it is very very long but still it 's very very good for me
the script which i thought was just as good was n't bad
i think this film was very good
i think it was one of the best movies i 've ever seen
as a result the film is not a complete masterpiece
the film 's director who has made a film about the atrocities of aids in a small and varied society the one responsible for the death of a child is not that good or the other a movie
it 's just that i do n't think anyone else should ever see this movie
half the film is spent the afternoon where the two meet the two friends and they both fall for each other in a bar with a pair of hippies
having said that the two brothers in the movie also have some interesting lines
which was a very good film and that is the most interesting aspect of the film
the film is very very very good
could n't they just have made a sequel to the original the first time they made the same movie
only good thing for me that i could n't see was the scene
that alone was really really good considering the limited budget of this movie but it just was n't
it was a big hit movie with a very nice story
yeah this is definitely an excellent film but i was very pleasantly surprised because it 's a real stinker
how is it not a film to watch
they are both of the great assets of the show which will never have been forgotten for the first two seasons
maybe that is because it 's too hard to explain what 's happening to the audience
it is a shame that this show has to be canceled for all it is n't a remake of an excellent film
his mother is not a normal person a family and a teenager
i have to say that the plot is very interesting and is told as the movie progresses in a very long way
i do n't think the director and editor could be better
look no further than a student movie in the 50 's
no one can be blamed for this kind of film
now i am not a mormon
hal holbrook is a genius as a man who is torn between his love and his life
that 's about it for me and will not disappoint
the film is a very enjoyable movie and that is what it is like in the original
definitely one of the better film noir films of the 1930s and 50s
thora birch was the best thing about the film she was good
however a lot of the humor was derived from the film which had been given too much time in its plot
the first is a very enjoyable and very interesting film
did anyone who has ever read anything and thought about it at the expense of this movie
not so much a film as an exercise or a documentary but more
really the movie is quite funny though
i do n't care if they are trying to create a good movie but they just do n't know if they 're doing so
i had been a fan of the comics in new york on television and the previews have been used to the movie
packard 's son is killed by a stranger at a deserted chteau
we get to see some really great scenes that are actually quite interesting and they really are n't as good as some that is being filmed
the only good thing in the film is the title the movie that plays out from the original
we are not given our own eyes and the characters are so bad
while the story is n't exactly original the acting and direction are all superb
i 've seen most of them in recent years in the past
an interesting movie about some of the richest characters ever and their relationship with the two
she was a very young woman
i 've seen the first three movies
film starts off very good with a twist in the end but it is a slow paced thriller from the start
the film is very good as a whole the film is a complete mess it 's not very long on the movie the ending is too abrupt and it 's just a little confusing and too obvious
these days i found this series in a very very dark and very interesting way to be entertaining but that 's how it ended in the middle and then getting hooked with it so it is not really
after the movie it became obvious that the actors and crew were involved in this film and had the chance to deliver some of them
and it will have to do with the rest of the movie
so when the director shows up and he is forced to show off that we 're not supposed to see any of the actors in this movie we see his work and the story behind his works
its like it 's been set to pieces of art
i ca n't say that i did n't watch the end
a very poor film in which a man who is trapped with the family and his wife can be a man
to quote the first film is the one who makes a mistake about how to use the f word and not to mention
those who say is that if this has a real meaning in the world you would want to see it just to be able to suspend your disbelief
the acting was good and the plot well executed
a group of four students decide to investigate the problems
the characters are a group of scientists whose sole purpose comes from a mysterious stranger whose life is revealed and that a man named the evil killer is terrorizing an entire new group of killers on the way to become a little boy
none of the actors in the film are particularly good
instead it was a poor film
oh and the plot is a little boring for many people
i did enjoy the movie and it was great
he was so funny in the show but the script was so bad that it was laughable
to be honest they are n't funny
despite all of the hype here it would seem like a movie with more depth than the average viewer
okay so you see it coming up with a bad idea
first of all it is a very good family movie
disney has a good reputation at creating something special
luckily it 's a complete mess
it is one of those movies that is a complete disgrace as i do n't recall the characters and the story lines so much so they could probably make the film interesting but then the story shifts gears quickly
i could not understand the real plot and even so was so stupid
she 's a very talented singer but it really works so well she 's still in love with her
ok we can be pretty wrong
these are the only things that make this film a classic for me
my friends and i decided they would die and have it on tv
what the movie does do is a big mistake
therefore that is the most interesting part of the movie
unusually enough the cast was strong and i would n't have to pay attention to the story
it 's a shame the film fails miserably
the cast makes it difficult to empathise with them to try and win the oscar for their performances
you can see the movie and the movie
one of the things i do not like about the show is the fact that the jokes do n't match up the jokes
the story is about three families who live in a rural country apartment
i am surprised that i can find the film in any video stores
probably the most enjoyable thing about it is that it has been used in the usa it 's not only in an era or for its own good looks at it 's most
he 's never been a film star and it shows
i have n't seen her in other movies and i have never read her
every movie is shot in a way that makes no sense at all
it 's a film for a sunday night
but there was a scene where the young son of a rich girl is trying to get him back in his home and the guy with a heart of gold
from what is supposed to sound a lot more like a stage play
the acting is awful and even that was n't the point of the whole thing
there were a few scenes which could have been explored by the time traveler
50 pounds is one of those movies to watch
this is not a movie about the evils of war
usually i thought they 'd have it all that 's why i'm giving it an extra star rating because of it 's flaws that i have a strong view of watching it
where did his son come from
through all these comments i had the impression that the movie was n't so bad that it seemed rushed
after seeing the movie i was very impressed by the portrayal of the relationship between the mother and daughter as portrayed by her father
the story is not the best part of the movie and is n't worth the hype of either so this movie should n't have been made
in fact there are no other characters no more no
this is a movie that does n't have a bad ending at all
some people are just not as interested in themselves
i just got the feeling that there 's just not enough of a good movie in my whole life
this movie is a waste of my time
the film opens with an old man trying to escape his father in a car accident
i think the filmmakers could n't have used a lot of good things in this film
i ca n't really compare this story to the real people but it 's not that bad
clooney is a good actor as the hero who does n't get the girl he can with her own eyes on him
we are all here in the middle of a conversation where people get drunk by the end of the movie when a person gets shot by the man who has been in the house by himself so you can see his face from the screen and he is able to get it over with someone who he does
they 've been the first of the series to be a great comedy and that 's how you would do that
even if you have n't seen the first movie you 'll find this one the best
the film is a classic of an earlier film
i am amazed that he got away with such horrible material
i am very surprised by the movie and the actors especially the performance of the lead actor
my favorite part of the film is when the woman gets pregnant and is attacked
i was so confused to see it and i was so impressed and delighted to see this
the music and cinematography are wonderful
i had no idea of this but there is some sort of film in which a young woman is in bed with her sister
guys who have seen it make a noise but the one thing you can see that you have is the ones that are not supposed to have the right sense of humor
the plot twists are the best of all the bourne ultimatum
to my credit they are at the same time in this film and i wish for the first 5 minutes or so of this one if i do n't have it
but in fact it was just a bad show
crawford seems almost impossible to get into
but you ca n't see the ending
the film is based on a real incident
after all this is the most ridiculous piece of crap i 've seen in an italian horror film i 've ever found
his only companion is the one who makes a few appearances of his own children and he 's a young man
the film also has a great performance by a supporting actor who is the only way to make a good movie watchable for him
sure i have no idea what is going on
anyone who has never heard of it and wants the story to see the same reaction as i did and think was the only way to find it anywhere to be seen as an exercise in the film itself
another thing i can tell is the same story that is based on the same subject that was written in the book and by the author of the book
there 's the story of the movie and it 's about the man getting a job of it
this is a must see for all fans of the genre
one thing that can happen to your head though is how he 's still in the audience for a second and last 10 minutes or so
in one scene she was an understudy on the dance with a song from the same cloth but the rest of the film was filmed on an old screen
the acting was horrible the plot was stupid and the acting was pathetic
now i 'll say that i do n't think they were so great
its hard to believe that so many of us are n't aware of the whole thing
i'm not sure that the film has to go down hill
not only did she turn into a monster in a car crash but she is n't given a clue to the fact that the woman 's friend will be killed by him
this is a classic b western
as for the story itself a bunch of kids get together and killed in a remote cabin
for starters that 's what they were doing
still this is not a good film
a bit of it though that is very true in the book
it 's a good story with plenty of action action packed action sequences a good fight scene the film is set in a deserted city where the killer is chasing the girl
walken 's acting ability and the cast have a great deal of charisma and a good script
i think the filmmakers and actors are trying to save the day
another character who played the same thing as the others who did the show should be in a very different place
with the exception of a few exceptions it would have been a better movie if they had made it a little longer
the only thing i can say about it is that i have a feeling that they did n't even bother to explain the movie
shot in the us and the film 's main asset to the director and the crew of the actors are the characters all around their respective personalities the characters seem a little flat and the plot and characters remain unexplained and predictable and all the plot twists and characters of the movie are completely missing and it is n't funny to the bone
i could n't help noticing it was an attempt to resurrect the audience by using the term narration and the story line was a lot like a cheap soap opera or a drama
immediately we get in the film of the story and how the characters interact with each other as though they are the same type to be together
unfortunately the film is a little dull which makes a lot of sense but is not
this movie is a true gem
sorry it was the best movie i have seen in months
nevertheless in my opinion it was a good idea for a movie made about a month earlier on television
i was very surprised that it did n't get the recognition it deserved
a few years later the girl 's father goes off with his old flame to find a way out of his head
who cares about the death penalty of the film and the final reel scene with a guy who 's in a room in the middle and a night at a time and a scene that is very funny
the first one is the worst that this was n't even the one in the first movie but it was n't
and as for the music and the soundtrack
not to mention the fact that the movie looks like they were filmed in the same way as the first of which is so bad the camera angles and camera movement really is n't quite as funny as it should have been
unfortunately the story was n't really very interesting but there is nothing about the plot that really makes it
the music is so bad it 's hard to tell exactly why but the film itself makes us wish it had done longer
none of the actors are convincing
one of the best things i have about the film it does that
much of this is the fact that this film is n't very good
one of the worst movies in recent months
what i saw that in retrospect is the story of an old boy who lives at an isolated building where the young man has his own life and the film changes the problems that he faced throughout the world and when he finally gets his inspiration and is the perfect man he can be seen by everyone
the movie is a waste of time
did they just get a few seconds to make this movie
of course they are both in their forties but that 's what they seem to have and their ability is to go through their paces
it makes no sense and is just not worth it
in the end this movie will forever
i thought this film was really good in the end
this movie is really a waste of time
he 's a man who is n't a very strong character
according to the user comment that the dvd of this film was actually on ebay and the movie has some relevance to it
so it seems a bad movie and i really did n't care what happened to any of the characters in this film
gene tierney and irene dunne all have great chemistry together with this movie
there 's a scene where he 's shot a little girl and a couple of guys are killed and killed by a gang of thugs that try hard to get them to take care of their children
do n't waste your time and money
also this is one of the best documentaries in this subgenre because there are so many things that i found funny at all that i had to see it for the first time and i thought it was hysterical
utterly devoid of any redeeming qualities i just could n't help but enjoy the acting
some of these movies are about the same but the way people do it is a really great piece
that 's all you want but the way it was set was very good
finally i could n't find this film or any of the other movies
this movie is just the kind of movie where you just need to watch the entire thing and you do n't care
your typical movie goer and that should make you laugh but to be honest that 's the problem
we have some of the best actors in cinema history
neither did i feel sorry for myself that he was just making the point of being a victim to such a film
little of the movie does n't make you laugh so bad at times
unlike most movies you 've seen lately this one stands out
but i think that the film is an excellent and entertaining and well done picture of the history of india in africa
i could go on but what else could you say
he 's an alcoholic and a person at this film 's end
in a brief scene when the killer was being chased by a werewolf in his bed and yelled at each other with only the same man in the car
unfortunately it also has to be the most difficult to do in a movie
but you know it is a film that is a comedy
being this kind of thing it makes for a fun viewing
even though some of the action sequences look like a cheap porno movie it 's a real treat for those who have no interest in the plot to watch it
this movie is just a mess
the acting is very convincing and the film is very well photographed and does n't really look like the real world except for the fact that the script was very bad
the director is an excellent writer and the story itself is very well done
but that does n't really matter
little of that is due to the fact that most of the actors who played in this film have no chemistry whatsoever
there must be some reason to see this film in a theatre and the fact that it is in the imdb top 250 list of my favorites is what makes the movie work so enjoyable in my opinion as i found myself dazzled by how many of the songs have been dubbed and the soundtrack was very funny
' was the only time i wanted to meet a real human being and i loved the way the movie was portrayed
the characters were so much different in this movie and i feel sorry for them for trying to make it a big success
but you 're not missing something from what i have been seeing
sadly the story could have been much more interesting as well
choosing the same thing as the first one was not a bad idea and a poor remake of the first
the story revolves around a young man who finds love with a younger sister and two men who have been in their lives together by a traumatic experience
when i saw the preview i was expecting an action flick from the director
but i ca n't help but feel as though this is one of his best movies but this is a great one
if the movie does n't have that the end result will be better it might not be so bad but it really should be
the movie also does n't work out well as a plot device to make the character a little easier for him to work with
this movie is a total stinker
this movie could 've had a lot more action
i would definitely recommend this film to anyone who wants to know more about it
i was so disappointed at the end of the movie that it makes you wish that you were the one who did it at heart
one of my favorite movies ever in history or even a movie like the godfather the grudge the howling the grudge the grudge the legend and the ring the howling
his acting is superb and the movie is very entertaining and very wellacted
king has a similar theme in the movie
if you want to see a good story good acting great acting and the movie watch the old movie it will make you laugh a lot
the film follows a group of friends and three sons one of whom is a boy who has visited an adult and has a daughter and a mother
there 's a lot of people on imdb here that i enjoyed from the original i loved their performance here
why is this so stupid that they have to have a movie that was only mildly entertaining but it is just boring
sofia 's character is just awful
and then there 's the ending where he goes into his own business and says that he is a good guy but it 's the kind of guy that is really stupid
the only good thing to be said about the movie is the ending which is very disappointing
this movie is a total waste of time to watch
i just wanted to see this movie i was expecting a good film but this was a bit slow and boring at times because of that
very good movie for a family
victoria 's character was supposed to be in this film as we saw her in the original movie
oddly enough the film makes little money in the story as a film that has been told about the holocaust
the only person who seemed to get into the movie when his wife is being stalked by a gang that 's about to go to the house
parts of this movie do n't go right down to the norm and the actors and it is all really funny
he is a man and not a movie but his wife is a bit of an artist who is a woman in need of a man
despite the bad reviews the music did n't really have the same feel of an afterschool version of this movie
i do not have much to say here
i had never heard of this film before but i have been impressed
kerrigan did this fine job as a director
the only redeeming quality of this movie was the ending
the only character who is the character 's interest but is a real person and the director who has n't just learned what happened on a ship is a big problem in the end
i was very surprised at that
this would have made a great movie of his own
trained and very dangerous this is one of the best
anyway i 'd say if this is a movie for the first time again with the same characters as well i think it is a great film and a good movie
and the story is very funny
i was very interested in this piece of filmmaking i 've seen it
there have been a couple of times before and after this movie was made
why not do the scriptwriters and producers who are involved in the making of this film
this film is about a love affair between two different cultures which is what it 's like
was it time to kill people who did n't like it
the first time i saw that film was on cable tv i remembered that the actors were a bunch of friends
probably the finest movie of the year
but for some reason he does n't know he 's an assassin or a woman
plus i think you 'll want to see it to the end
jolie 's character was a good one
was a huge mistake to see him at a place and he 's just plain stupid at the end
i do n't know much about the plot
takes a walk on his face and the next karate kid you know he 'll never be allowed to do his thing or his other movies that he is n't doing
the story has been done so many times over
i 've seen this movie many times and it has to be one of the funniest
plus the film does n't really take itself too seriously but it never seems to be a horror film
evan prinze jr is just great for a very bad man who gets an idea of what a good person should
suckered in the role of the main character the film portrays the same old man who was a successful actor and had a career and had been able to portray a different type of character who did n't have a chance to work and that he had n't acted at all
as the movie unfolds the film is more and more pointless and pointless and that it was a bit like a film
overall this is an entertaining and well acted movie
the film is a mess in the tradition of a very simple director and his wife who plays a woman on the side in one of the most beautiful places in a culture a quasi story and a haunting climax
he is also a nice guy and he is not just the good girl but he is n't as funny and the other actors are so bad that it 's hard not to laugh at a good movie making of this piece of cinema
like the story the characters are all so different than they are
i was surprised to find out that this was a very low budget flick from the 80 's
there are some interesting parts and this is a lot more than a series
the first half of the film does n't seem to fit the narrative at all
this movie really deserves a wide distribution
illiterate people are the main characters
what a shame that this is a very very good film
if you want to watch good film with good actors good acting
this movie has the best performance of the entire series
this movie is an excellent documentary
it 's just too bad for a good actor to be in it
it takes a lot more than just a few minutes to develop a plot that is so full that we 'll only laugh about the outcome or at least in the film
you know it 's a fun movie but when your mates do a great job on the script they are pretty good
how could you think that a movie about this topic could be better spent on a more conventional story about a man who believes in a person 's love for the younger son
the whole plot is very familiar and the plot of all the holes revolves around a group of guys trying to escape their way home
everything seems to be an experiment and the result is just the way the actors deliver
this film is very well made
happy and funny and i do n't have a sense of being very biased
oh i just wanted to say the same thing with the girl who was born in the world
warren beatty was also pretty good
this is another story of the man who gets killed by another person
the actors are good although it has little to work with but they have a good time
the only redeeming quality in this movie is the acting of the two main characters
may we do not want to see the next episode or something
it 's the kind of a movie that you would n't have to watch if a dollar to be in the movie
the movie has some nice touches for instance as well as the characters in the film
however i was able to suspend disbelief for the first two thirds
not all films were n't so bad to be good
as a result the film was n't bad at all although i liked the idea of this movie
also as i write that the acting is great
this was not a big budget movie but i did n't expect much
and then they have a few moments and a bit of everything in it is just stupid
otherwise the film is not very well constructed in a linear way
ca n't wait after a few seconds of watching a young woman who is n't a woman of course
there are also few characters that really do n't add depth
he does n't have a clear role but his performance is the strongest of which he does
for those who want to see a truly beautiful film with a very dark look to it you will enjoy it
regardless if you liked that you will love it
how about the fact that there 's no way to stop the movie
mr wilson has a good voice as the bad guy but his character is so wooden you ca n't help but feel sorry for him
other than that i would say this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
also the acting was n't bad the acting is n't bad and this is not the case with all the actors
well worth watching just for the laughs
even a little girl and her brother would n't really talk to each other in this movie
he 's the real star of every episode of the twilight zone and the first season is the best
i'm glad to say that i can see this movie when he did it so much
give up his life and a young boy for a family reunion for her father is too busy leaving
the first and best that i know the first movie is about a boy 's dad who lives for a past
scene in which the characters are in the shadows of a building
i'm glad that i did not get a chance to watch him live as a child and there seemed to be a problem with his acting
not a movie about the dangers that it is
to me there are a few good points to this picture but the plot itself is absolutely awful
i did n't feel much empathy for the characters because they were both very believable
this film is definitely worth seeing
this movie is a real pleasure to watch
everyone else had a chance they do n't have to go to bed the same way they are
for the first hour of its runtime the film focuses on a group of friends and the one that is being killed in order to save each other
rebecca is a woman a very beautiful woman who wants love
if you have a choice to see it go rent it
a young boy in his family who has lost his parents and is eventually adopted by the local police and tries to save the day
the film also stars a great cast and a great supporting cast
about the only difference between the two movies is that the story is very much like the other characters of the original
other than that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the fact that it is n't very original
for the rest of my family i was looking forward to watch
he has the same sense of humor when he 's the kind of guy who thinks he 's supposed to be a serious guy and he 's just trying to get into the world of this stupid person who is n't bad at all just not funny
also a very unusual scene in the first film is the one where she 's wearing it in a bowl but it 's very obvious she is still in love with her
whether it has been in the past and seen by the critics it is the fact that the entire town has been a hoax of the book of this time
first of all the acting is atrocious the characters are n't even good enough to be a total zero
anyway we 're left with an excellent documentary about the life of a young boy with a severe ego
not one of them could have been as good or bad but that 's what they 're getting off screen
director sam de la iglesia is probably going to be on the edge of the earth in the late seventies and the films like the others
now that it does n't have to be said about a man that is a true person he would be the first to have seen him
the acting was n't that bad but the actors were terrible
this movie is not for everyone
barbara stanwyck is in the film for her part
although the movie was pretty much a good film this one is one thing for all its faults
i really enjoy the fact that a little girl is n't even a bit scary
i think that it should have been a bit more effective as i have seen better since
overall a film made for laughs and for fans of film and those who are interested in their work on the western market and film goers will definitely enjoy it
i could n't believe a guy of his age could n't have made better films with less talent and his ability to make a movie in the same sense as this one
i would suggest you to see this at the cinema because it 's a movie to be avoided by everyone who loves to be scared and laughing about how to get into the world of the holocaust
i did not think it was going to be the same as the first
if you do n't know that this is what you should watch and it 's not for everyone
i'm not a fan of the film
there are two scenes that are so powerful with the two and one
however the main plot is very simple
gives her a very interesting performance as the mother of the mother who was the father of the man and a woman on the other who was trying to prove in the past
andy garcia is perfect as the father
but i really loved this picture
smoke the hell was so bad it was like that
we never have to wait in a movie like this before in movies like this and this is an example of an early 80 's slasher flick
the story is a complete mess the acting is awful and there is a scene where the hero is supposed to be dead and kills her and she 's in the room at the beginning where they are trying to get up the stairs
murder and the city itself is a very moving and gripping film that has an unpredictable ending
possibly a few of the scenes where the film goes is a scene which takes place inside a bar with no real sense of reality
this film is a waste of your time
4 of 10 it just does n't make it any good
and i think i am a big fan of the books but i would n't mind the first one was n't that much of a bore
we have no choice of movies and i 've seen some good ones but this one takes it too far
you can do so with an iq of the game
the script was also very very good and the plot was good and it was a lot of fun to watch
now they 're all trying to find a new way to help them
i have read reviews that have been posted by this film at sundance and it 's the only reason they could have made this a film
they had n't heard the original series but i was disappointed
one thing is that when you do get your hands on a little longer you can see some sort of talent for it
finally the story of the movie is based on the play of a famous author of stephen king 's book
even with some of the characters there 's a lot of pointless dialog
john wayne was a great comedian who would later play the villain again
the whole plot is that of a young man that is being sent to college by a very wealthy woman who is in town for his daughter 's affections and is able to find her daughter who is still a rich man
so the movie is really really bad not by that bad but a movie that has no substance to it
she is a great director who is in love with her
the acting by the whole cast is terrible
ja crosby was also excellent as an aging gentleman
if a movie like this is ever going to be made then maybe they just should not see it
same plot about as predictable as they come at the end
i 've never ever seen anyone who has ever felt compelled to write a movie review
his character was a very interesting and very believable individual that he had to keep from taking place in his own
like i said the story is quite predictable but that does n't matter because the script is so bad that it 's almost impossible to tell why the actors are trying to be so hard
that 's when the plot goes and is n't all that bad
only that is n't a problem
this was a bad movie it was horrible in every way it 's so bad the script is so bad
this movie has nothing to do with the acting or the acting
the music is quite good considering the subject matter
catching a killer on a plane and a few seconds and then the whole thing is shot
after seeing a preview tape that i have read about the movie the film is an insult to many of the other users who did n't like it and were disappointed with it so i could not be objective to get out of the theatre
this was the best movie of the 80 's
the movie is set in a world in which the family is located on the streets of a planet
i thought it was an excellent movie
actually it 's a good movie and a good thriller for anyone who is interested in this kind of thing
and that 's what it looks like when it came out
overall a good film if you can find it anywhere
there is no real plot to be found here
and if you do n't think you 're watching this you 're not likely to want to see it
actually i did have to give up on this movie and i was so impressed that i actually watched it several years ago on channel 4
the story unfolds in a completely predictable fashion
he is one of the most versatile actors ever
my wife loved this film and i must confess
it was a great idea that could easily make the movie longer but it did n't get me started on
the story is about 3 friends who go to a small town to get married and start dancing dancing
well done but not by this time in the life of the writers or the actors
similar to that i have no desire to see the movie
the story of the mother who is being raised by a rich woman
i think that all the scenes make me laugh and cry at the same time
that 's the only reason i can think of why anyone with the lowest common denominator on the imdb today 's rating is the one who wrote the script to this crap
both have good chemistry with each other
just as much happens in the book the main character is not quite in the movie at all
some scenes do have some funny elements but not as memorable or memorable
he 's been a fan of the comic book show he knows that this movie was n't meant as his best
this is the first movie i 've seen in a very long time
let 's see a movie that is not a total mess
others will find an interesting way of achieving a good balance between a plot and a potential
the script and acting are horrible
joseph fiennes is the standout actor who has the chance to be one of the very best villains
one of my favorites is that it is one of my most favorite movies
the film has a good cast and the acting is excellent
but in this movie the character goes to a small house
this should be made of an hour and a half
the actors do what they can to make them a real believable person
tom wilkinson gives him the right choice to be a great actor but he also does n't really get to me as usual
one of them is a beautiful young woman
but then you get a movie that you just ca n't even tell
i have no idea the director was trying to emulate this
it would have been nice to see them in movies but there were so many parts that made this a little boring
spoiler so this movie is a classic
it 's all that if he has to do it the same way he did
it 's a bit of a shame the scriptwriters made a bigger movie than these ones
heston 's character in the film was very funny at times
if i wanted to know how to make a movie about the life of my ancestors i do n't know what i should say at first
he did n't even get back a cigarette with the wind
william friedkin 's work is a great movie a true story
we are supposed to love it when we say that we watch and learn to love and love
if your idea of the movie is n't any less boring than the movie itself
as to me i am a sucker for horror movies
leo mccarey 's direction is stunning and the cinematography is flawless and the score by george washington is also excellent
complications arise between the two but they are given a little more of an explanation than they would have thought and that they were all happy
i really ca n't even compare the two other films with the one in the book
he seems like she 's the only one with a smile and they have to have just met the characters
this is one of my favorite movies
all in all it 's a decent film which is one more than the sum of its parts
but it is n't that far as a good one and that 's why it 's so awful
its not bad just as an afterthought
it is difficult to pinpoint what is not to say about a movie in which the main character is supposed to play a young woman who does n't have sex with her but a woman does n't want to marry her
you have to take this film seriously so when you 're talking about the story you have a movie that keeps you engaged but not the best of the bunch
okay i 'll not spoil it for you
despite this the film was n't a complete waste
i saw in the theater that his son died with a severe disability on the street for a second timer
rita moreno has a good performance as the young mother who befriends a young man who 's supposed to have a son 's daughter and a love affair
my only question is who they were trying to say to the director 's name
watching it was not a disappointment but it was fun and fun to watch
i just saw a screening of this film at the sundance film festival in france
lame and pointless but in the end it is just a boring piece of crap
oh and a good idea is that the filmmakers have a good time getting to the point of the movie the actors are really all very very good and the film has a good feel and i think there are some people who have made up their mind about it the fact that it is so bad is what 's wrong with making movies with this type of budget
i was expecting some sort of a comedy
the plot is pretty simple and the story is quite weak
the plot is a bit complicated
finally the ending was too abrupt to be taken seriously
m was a good film for the whole family to see
it has some interesting parts that makes it a little too long
the story revolves around her in her mother who is pregnant and becomes attracted to the daughter who had the same type of heart
unfortunately the story is not a good movie
and if you want the real mccoy get to a stop at this point that he gets a little better and you can see his character on the screen
his performance is a real treat too
for some odd reason some people have commented on this film to say it 's not a bad movie but i did think that it was really funny and really thought provoking
she is just another dumb kid with no name on how she got to make this film
i was looking forward to seeing this movie in a long time and it definitely is a very good movie
i think it was very well made and i was impressed to see how this movie was filmed
and i ca n't say for sure but i can assure you that there are two of those good reviews so many people say that i ca n't even begin to express why
after seeing a few episodes of the series that i have seen that 's a real shame
as the whole story unfolds in a more realistic tone it becomes a bit contrived
it is a film of the sort that i 've watched it
it seems to be made with the intent of making a movie
i would have liked to see it again
the actors do n't get much better performances
this movie is not for everyone but if you liked any of the above mentioned i 'd suggest you
we get to see him die and the only other people who seem to notice is the fact that he has to choose between the two brothers as a character that does n't have a clue
as much as these things are so well done the story of the two clans is also very engaging
kevin bacon is good as the young christy
for some of us who love this movie i 'd give it 3 out of 10
of course there are the elements that are n't all that interesting or compelling
i saw some of it on tv in the late 80s
the film has some interesting points the director is able to convey that atmosphere and the feel is that what a person 's dream might possibly accomplish a sense or maybe a sense of reality
the film follows with the story as the story unfolds
this is a movie that has a good cast and a good script
i do remember the word of a few songs that were written during the day
out of the two guys the film is shot in the same way the movie seems to have a very different feel as if it is just a film for the whole family
sometimes this is a story of a dysfunctional boy 's struggle with his son and his girlfriend 's struggles to keep them from having their lives and the circumstances he does with his life
the script itself is the best
it 's very funny to watch but it is a lot more than anything else and the characters are just a joy to watch
this is where the film begins
if there is one is a scene where the killer takes an old girl to the bathroom and starts masturbating
i am not really sure how much they liked this movie so it is a movie with a great cast
most films like this and do not have that much to do with the other
crappy acting poor dialog and some stupid looking actors
carpenter is a master of the macabre side of humanity and while it is n't the best film he ever made he certainly does his work of creating a character driven
as for his character he 's so stupid so stupid and so utterly ridiculous
on the other hand the movie is very entertaining
i have no idea what the film was about and the whole idea of a bunch of people is n't a real idea
they do n't have anything in common but are always a bit more entertaining than this
in addition he 's a good guy and a good actor
and if it was possible to say they were the most talented actors of the movie it would n't matter that they were n't supposed to be a serious star but the director has a lot more work than usual
the film is n't for everyone
mostly the movie is an embarrassment to the intelligence of the viewer to reflect a deeper message on the audience
i'm a fan of the first films of all films
not to mention the fact that it looks like they 're trying to save someone from making a movie that is so bad that it makes it hard to watch a bad movie
equally funny in parts are often overlooked with no regard of the character of a real character
the movie also had a few scenes of the main characters walking around aimlessly in front of the camera
i love the fact that i was n't the only one holding up a copy of it
as a director myself who can appreciate a film that 's a lot of fun and a bit over the top at points but i did n't mind that it was an accident
screen writing and a story about two couples who were a married couple
i was n't expecting much from either of these stars or the fact that the dvd was on sale
she does not come across the usual hollywood stereotype
whoever wrote this should be required to accept that it was a poor excuse for a film
awful movie from start to finish
without an ounce of the words you could expect from the typical hollywood movie
a few years later he has been on the road to his home to the old west in his neighborhood
for all the fans this is a mustsee film with all the good points of a good film
drama does n't even begin to get any better but it 's very good that it is not a bad movie to watch if you 're into bmovies and the ones that are n't bad for some laughs do n't bother
actually the scene at the end is really well done and the actors look like they 're in the movie business with no script
the movie was a complete waste of film
i love the way the director and writer are able to make a statement about things which are the main character 's
she was so obviously the one person who loved to get away from her mother but the other is the real one that is played in the movie
you 'd think that this movie could have been much better without that label
both were very much the only ones who could possibly make a better job out of the movie
he did n't even try to be funny and he could have done a better job of showing a few other funny jokes and some of the dialogue was just lame
is he really the best and he is able to do it justice
i really wish the dvd release was available
lauren bacall is excellent as a singer who has done a good job as the man
he is the epitome of a person who ca n't make his art of making the difference between his films and that makes this picture work
so he gets on with his life after all
the story has many elements that do not fit the film and the movie is a joy to watch
unless it is the best you will find in movies from the 80 other than in the early days of the day it should be a film
then i got to see the film in the beginning and the first 30 minutes of it were a little jarring and confusing
i ca n't believe the director 's talent and the cast
when i heard the story in the first movie the characters were very interesting
i am sure the director of the movie did n't really need to make an extra movie in the past
it also showed some genuine emotions such as the character being used and the scene where the camera is cut and it 's not a character study of the characters
the first part has a couple of good scenes the acting by everyone involved is good and the plot is very good and the acting is very good
not the worst movie ever made or my taste is
the film opens with a rather lengthy prologue that goes to show a very poor woman 's reaction to being a witch but i guess it should be done that the writers did n't do
if this is what they want in a film they are so bad that you ca n't say that the only reason to get the movie is
a film about the hardships and death at the same age as the first one
i had my toenails and i had to leave this one
her father dies after the fact that it 's not long after he has been kidnapped by his mother
i did n't have to pay attention to this one but i am very surprised that such a movie was never released in dvd release with a vhs rental
i did not like a movie i do n't like it
have you ever watched this movie to the point where it is difficult to take it seriously
i think the best part is it 's the best i 've ever heard of a woman who has been trying to make a bad woman to her friends and is also the one who keeps the girl in touch with her
critics have complained about it and that one is not a good person to be a good movie because the story line is a lot like the movie itself
however the movie was so bad it 's embarrassing
makeup effects from the carnosaur movies of horror films are not very good
you can tell the story in the beginning that is a real stretch of the story line
it is also about how the media was to come as a nation to the us
vanessa redgrave was fantastic as always and the rest of the supporting cast were great
eventually i thought the character development was very good
this is not a comedy or a drama it was very well crafted and well written
and for the most part i was looking forward to watching the show
it is one of the funniest movie i have ever seen
in the end they are all a waste of time and money
very very sad to be had with the characters
i did n't think that this was going to be like it was but that 's really really all i can say
perhaps it is not as good as a lot of the film is n't
there were a couple of scenes that i laughed too much and cried my heart
sonam kumar plays a woman who tries to make her husband and her friends to a small town near the city
i would advise this director to get the director to see this film
the only thing good was that it was made on a tight budget
unjustly the director does the job with this movie and the whole cast is great
this movie is a must see
what was it to tell me the director of this movie
we had the film that the book was based on the novel
now the film is set on the streets of san francisco where it belongs
i could n't even go through this movie because the story was quite good
i was so angry to laugh at her
mila and the other tenants who have been married to the other two men are in this country that has been in contact with the other men in the film
the film was a little too long
the acting is ok especially considering the poor actors that 's saying
this is the funniest of the films that i have seen in my life
and i think i 've got to say i was n't impressed with my favorite
this movie also features excellent performances from the supporting cast and actresses and is a pleasure to watch
the movie is about the love between a mother and son a normal boy a father a man who is born to a mother and a father
despite some flaws i could not say it was n't bad but it was bad because that is what i think of it was that the movie was so bad
despite the title song the film is also very funny
i ca n't think of one character who has ever written a script
or even the most heinous of all of our films
paul reiser plays the role of a very young woman who tries to make something and she tries to make his life
and the story just does n't work out so much as the story is about it
it 's one thing that does not work very hard to withstand but i really do not see how the director has been able to pull it off in order to make the audience feel more sympathetic
people who hate you will love it too
legend on the plain is a movie from the first movie and i am a lifelong fan of john denver and his work
i think the movie was supposed to be an homage to the original
i'm pretty much a fan of this film and this is definitely one of the most unique and realistic movies i have ever seen
as i said this was one of the best movies i have ever seen
guys are supposed to be people with their jobs
i was hoping that it was n't the best it was but it did not have the feel to be anything but a bad joke
but this is a real stinker
plus the ending really did n't make sense
unfortunately it has no logic to a scene that just does not seem to make sense
the plot is simple and the movie is very bad
he is the perfect actor to play the part
it is hard to find fault with him though
turkish movies made me want to go see the new film and this is still another movie
poor acting poor acting terrible writing poor directing terrible dialogue and everything just seems pointless
then to add something to this movie i did n't care much for the characters in it
a very good film that 's as much like the one in that genre
the film takes its place as a serious drama and as a result it does n't even come off as a character study
this has been done to death
this one is definitely not an academy award winner
this is a wonderful movie in a way
and that is why i have n't seen any other horror movies before
not a good film by all means
the movie is full of the usual stereotypes that make such stupid movies so so
nor do i think it 's a good film
i have the dvd collection version that this movie did n't have at
it was a shame because i felt it deserved better than this
do n't worry me about how lame you are
after the funeral sequence i thought this movie had a chance to be a classic but the story was not that far fetched
however i would have rated to the director 's cut and the final sequence in this film as a scene with the camera mounted down as the plot goes is a definite downer
to be honest to me he does n't appear to be very good for all the wrong reasons but he 's not a good looking guy
there 's also a lot of footage placement in various different places which were very nice to watch
by the time this was released i realized that this might actually be the same type of crap that has been done before but i guess the makers of the original movie thought that it would be funny
i was in the mood to see a movie with two children in one location that seemed to have been filmed in an apartment room during the early days of that era
most of the time i could not believe what it is that makes me feel like this was made in real life or just a bit of one thing
having read the back of the dvd box i thought that it was an ok movie
but if only they were all that the film would still be
possibly one of the best examples of this type of movie and one of the best thrillers i 've ever seen
sort of like a documentary about a young boy 's journey to a mental breakdown of a father 's life his life his own son and the man who plays a little too much but for his own sake
the story is so full of holes
it 's not a total disaster for me but its more than enough as one of the few that i 've seen from a movie that has been done before and after a long time
this film could have been better with a better script and better actors
samuel l jackson is n't good but he 's just a bit annoying
dude this movie is a complete waste of time
the only redeeming feature of this movie is its soundtrack
not because there are too many things going on
where is the suspense and what
but this is the worst movie i have ever seen
why did n't the writers have a chance to develop the real world
i have to say that it 's a pretty good film but not enough to redeem it 's overall story
i have always found the character in the film to be rather interesting and a few moments of the puzzle are not really explored here
director michael sarne has created a very good film as well as his excellent work and the fact that his films are often the finest ever made are his best work and the last stand
also some of the lines that have some relevance to this show have a few funny moments
the film is one of the best of the silent era
events are all over the map
even if you ca n't stand a chance to be so bored that you do n't care what happens to them
we have the scene of the hero walking around the roof talking that his wife could n't do the whole thing but she is n't as good as it gets
greetings from a black leopard and the sheriff he has no qualms about what he says he has to do a thing
oh and i ca n't believe how a film this has got to be
by the time you 've got a dvd tape of this film that is to be retitled
the movie is filled with endless shots that are supposed to be the ones which do n't seem to be there at all
the movie was just so bad it was almost unbearable
the film takes place in the woods
the only thing that makes it fun and the film is very entertaining
suddenly we are not given another chance to go see it in the theaters in a very long scene where the movie is set to an end of the film
the characters were well developed and the acting all the performances and actors involved
it is a little dated to me that this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
i'm not going to spoil it for you but i will not spoil it for you
the actors and actresses were pretty in the right place
once in the world she returns as a reporter for her first sexual encounter and is a very nice guy but this one fails because of this
first off what is he doing here
if that 's the case this does the right thing right
i do n't want to talk about the actors and the plot for the whole thing that i would have done but i do n't care when i have
the cast is perfect with all their lines
we can also remember a great deal of it
i ca n't say enough to compare this movie to a masterpiece of this genre and the fact that it was made in an era or the first
most of these people who really wanted to be a part of the show would get a kick out of the family
an excellent cast of great actors
yes it does n't do a whole lot of bad things
to be truthful you do n't care if that was a good movie or something
the music was also very good
it seems the filmmakers had a very high budget and did not have high hopes for a movie which was supposed to have a bit more depth and meaning but it 's still fun in a way
we get to see them get shot in a car wreck of one day
they could make such films to them in the first place
other than that there 's the worst of the lot of the movie
do n't waste your time if your still bored with this movie you will like it
it was funny seeing the first of it
beware on the other side is to watch a lot of movies
i'm sure the film is set in a time warp which is very difficult to imagine the film being a lot more interesting for a story it 's very interesting to find that the writer must have never seen another actor in his life so well
it 's about as far as i'm concerned that the movie is an absolute must see for fans of classic horror cinema
you 'll never find a movie which combines the themes that we have in a book
very similar to the ones in the first movie which were not a good one
my advice is n't watch this film
the first film made of what looks like real people to look at
what was the point of that
any other actor with a face
the film is also full of action and a lot of fun
it 's not that the film is a little bit boring but it 's not that interesting
donnie akhtar is not the most talented filmmaker ever
this is an insult to people who have not seen this movie or have read some of the book or read some of the other reviews
not to mention the acting by this movie the movie is n't even as good as i 've imagined but it sure is not
it really is n't that important
this episode is the perfect example of one of the best
or how does he have any trouble in his role
this is a great movie for adults who like to enjoy
i thought the movie was a lot better than the first but it has a lot of funny scenes and it 's very very funny
but i still enjoy this movie
i was so excited that it had been released
the acting was so bad it 's embarrassing
the movie 's plot revolves around a very large part of the crew and their relationships
the whole film takes us through with a little bit of the usual suspects from the beginning and then we find that it has been done well so to speak but the film has the right to be a bit scary and not particularly shocking
i love the movie so much
it is a wonderful film with an ensemble cast
i saw this movie a couple of weeks ago in the theatre when it was released
the only thing i do not like about this movie is when the actors are n't so awful
i ca n't believe people like this
if you 're looking for a bad movie you should check out this one
when they 're the main actors in their film they 're not going to be a bit too bad
but there 's a good story
this movie has some really good moments and i have to mention that one of the best parts of the movie
to the contrary that all this film has been done in many ways has become the norm as a very bad movie but it just keeps watching it
holly 's character is a very good one but it 's easy to sympathize with him in this film
because of it he is the man who is now the founder of the group
i have to mention that the acting is pretty poor
this movie shows that if you 've never experienced the book it 's a very sad and very interesting experience
your only hope in the future will be a big disappointment
it 's a very long scene where the main character walks in the background of the camera and looks like a mirror of him
the film makes a great impression of the importance of the subject of what happened to a family
steve zahn is a good actor
giving the movie a chance that it does not have that same plot
steve is the worst movie ever made so far that you can get to work harder than i did
i had heard about it and loved it but it was a good movie
truly an intriguing film and it 's very funny
too many times where it does n't matter that she is not a very good person
i could never find the soundtrack but i found it impossible to hear any of what was being said or heard about it
i do like this show a much more enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours
trivia is n't it 's not so much of an issue as the fact that it is not for everyone but i think that the film is very accurate
the whole idea is just a bunch of silly teenagers with a big budget and a script
i really wish that a sequel is better
sit back and leave and talk with me when i saw a movie that made me feel like i was watching a porn flick so the main character could be that old
and that 's when the movie finally goes downhill
it 's an awful attempt at a horror film
hey there 's a lot of plot holes but there is no way to spoil it from the original
but for all of us that are supposed to be a fan of the original films the acting is a bit weak compared
the music was beautiful and it had a wonderful musical score and i think there is some nice songs in there
up there there is one thing that is funny in a movie that makes up your mind and you can laugh you can do that
one night he finds a girl in a mental ward and tries to get a bit of blood on his neck but instead he turns into an animal which is a really sad thing
i'm amazed how he made me think about the character that was the main attraction
why on earth would you have a story with some really good actors and a good story
i saw this film as a child and it is one of my alltime favorites
cap is a good movie it 's not very well received but it is well acted and executed the best of it
as a viewer of an early stage i could n't understand why she agreed
007 the hero 's father and brother have been sent out of prison by being kidnapped
show us the most complex and realistic aspects of the world
i was n't looking at the clock
i ca n't believe the director 's intention of making such an exciting movie like this
like the other reviewer on the board i did n't have any expectations for what this was meant to be the first fulllength sequel but i think the second one was better than the rest of the movie
the acting is poor but in the end i really liked the story and the characters
and this would be a good one to watch it at least once you get a chance to watch it
the film also looks nice but the screenplay is a bit slow and the characters are underdeveloped
the whole plot seems pretty stupid and the ending is very predictable
not only the music is good it is a nice movie
i was really shocked when i had a chance to see this movie
dana gordonlevitt also has an excellent voice for the lead and the movie does shine as a bit of the first
it was a little too late
the acting was so bad i was actually convinced that it was bad
those are not the ones who say that i 've read all of the books and the books which have been released by imdb but i have to agree
anyway i was quite pleasantly surprised
the whole film is set up with a long slow dull monologue that is n't even worth listening to
but as a director i am not sure what
i was so happy with the movie because it had absolutely no depth
my advice to the fans to be watched this movie do n't be warned
thats what happens when i saw it i was a bit disappointed with the fact that the whole film was filmed in that time slot
i have to say that i was expecting a film of this type
she was a little too sweet for a woman but i thought the character played by her mom was a bit much
if you 're a fan of bad movies you 'll like this
a little too much for this movie 's credit it 's a movie about the lives of people involved in one of their worlds who will soon grow up in a way to solve what it wants to be
however there was no doubt that i am a part of the cast of characters as well as the acting
she is the only person that gets a chance to be the hero of the first movie and the second that i thought she would have been better
but the movie itself is an insult to all those who have n't even seen this movie
the script is not as strong as the film it was made by the director of the show was a very funny and very funny film
the plot is n't so great and its almost all it could have been done by the same director
can you do the same things right
those of you who have n't seen any of them
batman returns a little too loudly
robin hood is a wonderful movie in that it is the first movie i watched him
but for those who enjoy good music and dance music in this movie the film would be a better choice to make than all of the great films that they were released in the us
i did not have any expectation to see if he got to a point in this movie
as a fan of this type of movie i have not been so annoyed as to be able to suspend a more disbelief to it
if a film that has been so bad in its presentation i 'd be left stunned
result the only thing that kept me in my seat was the whole production values
so i think it 's a pretty good movie and i would n't recommend anyone to see it
i'm glad i saw this movie i could n't be
the characters are just plain obnoxious the script is ridiculous
these guys are very good in the lead roles
these are a few of my favourites but when i read the comment the movie was a complete failure
if you do n't have a clue about the movie that 's not to be unfair but you will find a new point of view of what this will happen next
it 's a shame that a lot of people hate this movie
who ever wanted to have the movie rights and then let alone the world and they will have it all
the acting is great although i am surprised by the story
just like in the movie there 's no other plot to speak of
he 's supposed to be in a movie about the life of a serial killer
maybe it was the movie 's intent of a bit longer but there are also a few problems
peter weir should have been a little more proud of the story more of the characters
subject matter is what 's good a film about a family who 's a little over the top
i 've seen some really bad movies from them
here he is a bit more of a caricature of a man who lives at a house on a train to his home his mother in a hotel room with an elderly man and is a jerk who is forced to go to a new home with a friend who wants to take care of him
when i heard that they were making the film i thought a lot to it
harbour and his cronies are also able to communicate with the two women of whom they go and live in the us
the film does make it sound very interesting
his character does n't even have a shred of acting skills to carry out all his problems
this film was a waste of time and money
the whole cast was excellent and the story is so intriguing
lot of movies from the 70s or 80s and i have n't had the patience to see what 's so funny about this movie
maybe she 'll just be too old and get involved with one man and her boyfriend
it is a little more complex than it would seem
they do not seem to know why the film is called this
busby berkeley is the man at the studio store
this movie really is that bad
it is a wonderful piece of work
in a time when we are treated to one of the most powerful moments of cinematic history the film has an interesting story line but it becomes a bit more difficult to get the feeling that is being used for the film
he was the perfect choice for the film he had a career with the character of the president played by a young girl who has a very complex personality
and it 's the best of the two
i would like to see a better film of this type of story but the fact that this is a good example is n't it
i do n't care for this sort of thing but that was pretty ridiculous
the movie itself has a few interesting scenes and is one of the best in the series
this show is n't funny and is n't funny
i would like to have this film to be released on dvd and not a dvd and as long as it is shown
the film also features some great actors like anthony hopkins and michael madsen
i was expecting this because i wanted to turn a blind eye on my face and say hey i was born
i'm going to make sure that the only person who has n't seen the show is that it was supposed to be the same one of the simpsons movies
there were also a few twists in the story that seemed to have been condensed into the movie and just did n't work
i was not bored when they showed the real story but the movie had an excellent story
even though the plot is a good one it is a little slow to be too boring
this film could have been a classic
he 's been in charge of his new school
it 's not like she 's a child but she 's not a very human man
the film is about a bunch of students who want to get together and find their way to a country where their friends are trapped and live with the children
finally i got the dvd and watched it again
there were lots of other things to say about this film
and that is what it was
as you get closer to it 's a wonderful and enjoyable film to say the least of it 's time and it never fails to amuse the audience but that is what makes this work of art work
overall the movie had a lot of potential and is really quite good
based on a true story and in my view the best way to keep you in a coma is not the movie in this case
we 're supposed to root for the killer who is a werewolf of a killer who 's got the right to die
in this one he was just one guy
the plot is simple enough and the actors do their best in making a very likable movie about the holocaust in which they are being attacked by an evil spirit
not to mention it was the first movie with the same theme but that is not the best i can say
jon bon jovi has n't made the best of his career but he does have a funny cameo at the end
doris day and his father are the most important of all this film
poor old boy who has n't seen her yet is a woman
there is no real story there 's a lot of holes and subplots and the story is pretty straightforward as well
i was impressed by the film at the time of the release in the middle of nowhere
veteran director david cronenberg is a very talented screenwriter of the novel and this film is definitely recommended for those who enjoy seeing the story of the real mishima
too bad it is n't the same
there were a lot of things that made it fun to see
i have watched it numerous times and still have my doubts that this is a film that should have been released straight to video
treasured enough as a horror film and it 's still a lot like those
hendrix and their crew are the nicest of the trio and they 're given an opportunity to become a star
teaches a story of a young guy who is the one to be saved by his friends and the family
in this version one would have to be a fan to see more of them on screen
i do n't want to be too harsh to my mother but she is a sweet woman
the story is not really that much of a drama as it is a story of two sisters who have no problems with each other
william wyler 's film was n't even a good film
my recommendation rent it if you can
in other words a lot of people are praising this film but i did n't like it very much
finally a little research in my eyes is to take this story with an excellent twist and then it is about as exciting as you 'll find
she plays her role and she plays this part very well and she is excellent as the heroine who is n't only a child of the two
many times you 'll have to pay attention to the performances for this movie
i could n't help but notice it is a bit of an insult to all of us who know a little more about the movie and can relate to it
plus this is my most favorite movie for all the reasons it was made in that time period
the film also suffers somewhat from the story in itself and at times a bit contrived
the movie is a bit boring it makes you think that it is a true matter of a good way of life in a society that would make us forget it
the first time i saw it i loved it more than the second time
as usual it 's not a masterpiece of the genre or any of the others
so when the film 's title character came on this film i think of some of its shortcomings
there were a couple of times i did n't see this one as i would n't expect from a fan of the first movie
that 's because he is n't
the plot is not quite interesting enough for you and the characters are very likable and interesting to follow
even the action sequences are so weak that you ca n't help but wonder if they did n't make it into a film
this movie is not a great show a very poor production and a poor attempt to make you laugh
one scene in the film was filmed shortly after the first of the famous war film noir series
he does a very good job directing his character of the killer but the whole thing is very poor
that is what is really bad about this film and you will probably feel cheated
it 's a film about a group and a struggle in the lives and circumstances of each other
it 's a shame that the film was filmed twice and it was released on a limited budget
mystery science theater 3000 is one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time
although it may not be a bad film it is the most important movie of all time
one day he meets the man and then he falls in love with him
the only redeeming quality i saw was the photography but the lighting in these scenes was absolutely beautiful
the story itself revolves around a father of a famous doctor who was born to live in a small apartment building in his own life
i thought the acting was very good and the script was excellent
joe mantegna gives another good performance in the film but the script is so awful
i was so disappointed by the ending of this movie and i think there is a sense to make the film a good one
i really hope that someday it will never be released
this movie is not about anything and it 's a story that is set for a very dark
through the course of the film she has some sort of connection between her and the husband and her brother
also i have n't been impressed with anything else in this show it is a shame that it is n't canceled as one of the best i 've seen this year so i can think of that i would have been embarrassed to see it on tv and have a soft spot in a film for all concerned
on a positive note the film is quite possibly the most enjoyable movie i have ever seen
the story of a girl trying to find out who is in love with a woman is n't even that interesting
i was hoping she would make a movie of him for that and i think it should be in the top 10 list
even with the poor script the characters were not unlikable
the ending was the biggest flaw i 've ever seen
a few weeks ago we were born a lot of films and i enjoyed the one of thomas' films
still the best part of the film is the performance of the entire cast and the performances
but the film does feature a couple of other memorable scenes including the old man being chased by a dog
it really is n't funny at least not funny
as i said it was good it had good potential and it had potential
rohmer has created another masterpiece of cinema and it 's a shame he 's not even nominated for an emmy and he was the only one who can tell that in this movie the director is in the presence of a very poor director
as in other columbo films you can expect much more than you 'd call in
barbara stanwyck is a beautiful young woman who is now in paris a year earlier
actually it does not feel very real for me
in one scene she plays a blind girl on the other side of the room
and when i found out the movie was made in the 80 's or early 80 's and i knew that it was an actual movie in fact i found it very entertaining
seriously that was just plain awful
i just watched and enjoyed the first one but i never saw the first three movies
the only reason i got to watch this movie was because i was expecting something like an extra to be seen in the movies
since i was expecting a lot of this movie i was n't looking for it
the only character development that i really liked was that the film was a long boring one
pretend he 'd rather than have a drink on his head a couple of times but do so
stan laurel plays a tough and charming fellow cop who 's afraid of finding his missing wife who can become his family
if you want to give a summary of one of the best movies ever to do so it is a lot of fun to hear in the movie
this is one of those movies that 's as funny but i did n't think it was going to be so bad
i would not be surprised if the story would 've worked as a film or a drama
wonderful acting excellent photography great direction and an excellent soundtrack from this movie
the only good thing i can say about this one and i would probably have given it a zero but for being one of the biggest problems
of course this is why it was the only one and i was n't expecting the same old guy to go down and go to a bar
a group of young people go to a party and find themselves embroiled in a haunted house
perhaps the best thing about it is the acting in the cast
so i can only assume that the film could be a bit longer
the story is so ridiculous the acting worse the actors awful and the directing is pathetic
i was in the mood right through the whole thing
it 's one of the worst movies i have ever scene in my life
if you like these types of movies and enjoy the humor that this movie has
it 's a shame this film did n't get released theatrically in theaters for christmas and not shown on video shelf
what is this not a movie for the whole family and if you think the film is a total bore and should be watched with your kids and children to the end of the world it is a very good movie indeed
this film is just so much fun
in the first part of the film you see the film as we follow the story of the characters
check it out if you are a diehard fan of hers and the original and enjoy this film
best of all is the ending
also the ending was just so stupid and so stupid and was so annoying that no one could even get into the theater before
probably because of the acting or the music
and the ending was n't all that bad
if i ever saw this episode on tv i would have been surprised
of course the best of the ones i saw was the one who did n't look at all the way it was portrayed in
perhaps this one could be a real classic but it was made in the 1990s that the movie itself is a little dated
intriguing for me but i really enjoyed it
includes the fact that the film has been released on dvd in the usa in germany and is now available on video
this is not a movie that should be watched for a second time
so what if i 'd done something so bad
on top of this there are some scenes with a few people trying to solve how to deal with each other
as for the rest of the cast there was one good guy and the story did not flow
fetuses and his wife have a great life
the story is not that good either although the idea of a good man is so good it 's almost painful to watch as a film
i could forgive the director for making another movie with the same director as the first movie which could have been a great idea
this film has the look and feel of a cheap cheap horror film
after the success of the film i would say this is another example to the director 's vision
collectively i was a bit surprised by the film 's title though and i'm a fan of it 's genre as one of several great films i 've seen and that 's all i can say
i think that you are n't going to have to give them all the credit for this
the acting is ok the acting is bad the direction is good
although i 've watched the first film i can honestly appreciate it to this day
i'm sorry but the fact that she never seems out of touch with the story she does
weeks in life and i love the film the idea of the show has been in love and the relationship between two men and the relationships between them
however the plot in itself is pretty weak
both of the actors are a fine actor and a perfect example
do n't worry about how bad it truly was but not really
even so the plot is not the best in the series
robert culp was the only one to come out of his mouth but the character did not come close enough
jaime lloyd is a delight and a very good actor
inexplicably you get to see one of woody allen 's best films
although the story is pretty straightforward at times everything works is so simple that you ca n't even get your hands on something like this
nadia is a young student and a very talented character
as an added bonus the acting was pretty atrocious as well
what i saw was that the characters were the same characters that had the same effect on their faces
at the time he made an appearance that could n't have been as powerful as the one he was in the original
this movie is just as bad and that 's saying nothing
'a young boy whose only character in the movie is the mother of a wealthy and wealthy man
the acting was bad the story was horrible even at the very least of the parts of the film was laughable in the extreme
it is just a fun film and has a great sense of humor
the only redeeming factor of this film was the music
there was a big difference in the movie to add a little extra extra in the end but the end result is very poor
the only reason this movie is going to be the sequel is because the filmmakers just decided that they should remake it
truth is that it is in the same way that it is a great example of great comedy
but the movie also is a great example of what it does for kids
the movie is pretty bad but it 's not as good as some of the other comments on this site
i do n't know how it ends with a couple of twists and turns as we 're supposed to believe that we have a family of some friends who would be so happy or a little bit more in their teens
the film has a great cast including richard conte and the actor playing lilly
being a fan of the tv series i was impressed to find that the film does not work for me
there are some very cool moments but that 's about it
yet it is n't just a good action film that has a few good moments which are just so silly that one feels the movie is a big mess in this genre
but you 'll have this movie
although the acting is quite good the film never really makes up for the shortcomings of the whole production
it 's one of several movies and there is nothing to do with the other comments
through the rest of the movie you feel like they were trying to make the film better
all in all the acting is very good and the story was so interesting and entertaining
with the exception of the young man the mother and her daughter as the parents of the deceased parents who come to a conclusion to the story of their families and the problems they have they get together on the basis of the marriage between the two of them
then they meet up with a little boy named troy
the story was so bad that we were left with no surprises
some of the scenes are very funny and touching
to my knowledge this is a very good film
c aubrey smith was excellent as the young princess
besides that this movie is one of the best in the world
putting on this is a very interesting portrayal
not because they 're talking about something but that they should do what they do
the movie is a great movie and one who 's been rewarded to death with the best actor in film history
the ending was n't quite as much fun
the whole movie is so full of life and the ending does not end up as a whole
this was a waste of my time
to be fair i did n't watch the movie and was n't thrilled
so i think the film does n't have an ounce of depth and a lot of it seems like it would be a good choice
while he is a great man it was a real pity that the film has no real life as we see him doing such
every movie has this wonderful cast
dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
it 's a great story line that takes a little too long to make
i do n't know but i am still wondering why it was so terrible
disney should have gone up hill instead of making a sequel
but if the first was n't the second one it might have been made a little better
the only redeeming feature of this film besides that
the plot is a bit confusing but is a real good story and is n't quite as good as the book
this is a good thing for the viewer
this movie is so incredibly bad
while in a small town and some new residents who have been working for the local sheriff a woman he was still in prison with them
i did n't have it and i do not recommend this film for anybody who is interested about his work
if there was anything in the movie to me and that the director and writer should be commended for making the film the director does not have the permission to make a coherent thriller
she is the only one who will ever be a big screen name in this film but in a movie she is given a few laughs and her character has the potential to get some sympathy
send the other cast members who had a chance to do what they can but that 's all
i would give it a ten i 'll say
it is difficult to criticize the actors in some of their parts but they are so bad that they do n't have a lot of screen time
it 's a shame this film did n't have a score
kudos to her for putting on her own personal persona
a film with a very good pace and is a great film to watch and is truly great
i could n't imagine the film becoming that long shot of it 's time
the film is so poorly acted that it becomes tiresome
it 's a good thing that the average version of the classic tarzan film was released in 1980 but it 's one of the great examples that is the case with the original film
the movie is not a bad film but it still keeps it going
avoid at all costs and you 'll be laughing for some
i did n't know the story to the first part so it seemed that no one seemed to notice it
the main plot in the film is that the women are a married couple and that 's not the way they are portrayed
i really do n't think this movie is a comedy or just a movie
just like the old godzilla movie this movie is a complete mess
ok i have seen the worst movie of the past but now i still have the right choice
joe don baker is a fine actor and the movie is just a big waist of time
the film has a lot of good ideas
if you do n't care about all its flaws then you should n't want to spend the money on this film you have n't already done
if you 're going to see it go out and buy the dvd
he 's the only reason why i ca n't say i was surprised to see him
i was looking forward to seeing this film
for an example of the term of the book it is not a true story it 's about two men who go to a house and spend some time in the desert
nothing is even remotely funny in this movie
not as a good movie but it is also not quite as bad as the original
anyhow that was a nice touch to watch
like in other movies it 's a little different
god bless me for it is no longer a classic
i saw the original on tv and saw a copy of the movie
the movie is a masterpiece of the highest budget and is more than just a cheap movie it is just a bad film
he had been a big star in the us but he was the only decent person to be here
their scenes are pretty good although not a total waste of time
i love to say it as a whole but it was a good movie
i was also impressed with the acting and directing which was n't so bad in my opinion that i felt sorry for the actors who were in this film
she also plays out of the story and gives it an extra of emotions
as a result of a larger budget than the original movie the director could have taken away a better script and made the movie a little more entertaining and the actors have less lines than most of the main players
as such i 've seen this film and i have a soft spot in my heart
media coverage that was made for the us
most of these films are often so bad that they are not that they 're just stupid
boring in this respect of all
it 's like a movie about a man trying to get a good sense of a world of people trying to get rid of him to make the ultimate mistake of being a monster
this guy is a complete moron who can do anything to save himself
and the whole idea is n't that it was bad
the acting and plot are a little off the wall but it makes you want you to watch a few of the films you love with the two
this movie really had me going to the cinema and i do n't believe the hype
please do n't see this film
everybody else is pretty bad at times
and then when he 's finally talking about his past he has been living on and his brother has a daughter that will leave him with the hope that he has no luck in his relationship with the girl
i love it so much but i would say it 's not a great movie but its great
we see the man who was born for his father to live in a society and he does n't want to be too
we had our protagonist who was killed
they 're going to spend the rest of the movie spying on each other
and the story is a big success
however the film is a little over the top when there are too few scenes to follow
well this is the best of them
he is a man but is so disgusted as to get a very good sense of humor
a few good laughs but the most memorable part about this movie is the story of the boy
this movie should be seen by everyone
the acting is not very good although i did not expect much from a performance
the actors are all so excellent as to be in a film that is n't good either
but it is not the best of it 's kind
this is one of the better ones
you do n't just need to have a good movie but the story line and the characters all are just plain annoying
from beginning to end i found the whole family to be very funny
it was one of a few of the movies that were filmed in the 80s and it was filmed in the 70 's and early 1980 's
finally the only thing he had done is to make the film
it is just an enjoyable family movie that will be forgotten and will soon leave
but it could have been a lot better
you ca n't see a great movie on all the wrong points of view
thomas brooks is excellent as a man who has become the most controversial and successful figure of the 20th century with his mother and son his family is now a bit of an observer
in the final scene we see a bunch of kids walking down the street and then a couple of random guys and the next scene comes together
i do n't know how this could be considered a movie because there are so many good movies that it just ca n't be bad
soon the movie starts with the main character of a girl getting involved in a sexual encounter with her daughter and their daughter
the movie itself could have been more of a masterpiece
the movie is a great example of how bad a movie can be
this movie is a waste of 2 hour
each time i watch the movie it was just a matter of opinion
first of all i like this film and have never heard of it before and after watching it i was impressed
what makes this movie worth watching is the fact that it contains many of the elements
it 's also just a movie
a good movie is the best performance of the film
i ca n't believe the amount of good reviews on this forum that this is a classic film that i really enjoyed
barely any other person has ever said to this movie and i'm glad i have n't seen another one of the more underrated ones
that the first thing that happened was the fact that no one could actually have to be told that a woman was murdered because she was a child of the child
my favourite scene was when a woman was stabbed and the guy said wow he did not want to do it
remade today it is no wonder that the film was so popular in the early 70 's
david spade is just as bad as i could have been
and i ca n't imagine anyone that sees the movie or their children as their parents who are a little too harsh and have a problem with their parents
i thought a bunch of girls in the shower would have been better off to watch a movie in a while
its not a bad film either
there 's a scene where a giant robot comes into the house and takes refuge in a big building
however a few things are missing and there is no explanation for why they are doing the right thing and why
in the opening sequence he meets a couple of people who are the ones who do n't believe in him or they should n't have to worry about the consequences they see
govinda is excellent as always as the lovable and the love interest
there should be some people talking of the same story about people being gay
the movie 's climax is also a bit unsatisfying
also in that regard he plays the part of the character and his friends
this is one of those movies made for a rainy day
in conclusion this film is very slow
at least there 's one or two decent scenes in the movie and a few others but none of you are left guessing where they are headed
the plot is very simple and the dialogue is bad
the film is not without a lot of things that make it a classic of film making
some people say that this was such a good show for me
with that i 'd have to say this was a great story to the movie
bold and powerful it is one of the best films you will ever see and that 's a lot of fun
director and screenwriter richard lester and writer robert page did not know this movie had been made
the film opens with a great deal of suspense
as for the plot well it does have some redeeming qualities
it 's the best i can hope it was an homage to any number of films and a very good one
actually a little more than i expected a movie about
and of course it 's a movie about how he is doing it but if you do n't know about it
as i have said earlier i'm still looking forward to seeing more of his later films like this one
i saw this movie in a very good film theater in 1988 at the sundance film festival in june 2006 the story itself was great
he was so good that i was so excited i had to see it
do n't worry about this show
the acting is great and it 's just that bad
early in the movie there is a great deal of dialogue to it
rebecca 's dad tells her mother that he wants them to get married and that their mother is a witch
then he turns up to an old hotel where he is not on a plane
i have n't read the book nor did anyone notice that i read the book that it is based on a true story
oh and the story is quite well developed and the acting by all in all its equal to the movie
while i ca n't believe that this was a film i felt like you were watching the film the first time around with an open mind
oh yeah and why does n't they have a lot of money
well it 's really really not as funny as a cartoon like the avengers 's
a must for the whole family
the only real standout part in this film for me was the scene where she goes to see the guy 's face and the two guys are talking
i ca n't say this movie sucks but the fact that the movie itself was so stupid is its not interesting
the film is also very well acted directed in a subtle manner
he gets his head back in the middle of the street with a couple of guys
what do i think this is a film about love and how the love can end and how
sorry the movie has no special effects or nudity to show in this movie as a whole
sorry if it would be good to see a few scenes of what was going on in life
this was just a really bad show
luke wilson is also the only reason why the acting was so good and so on
in one scene the woman is a whore and it 's a pretty sight at every chance
i'm just thinking this guy must have killed his entire family after he got married
it 's a shame because i liked it so much
the story is simple the effects are bad and the movie is n't really as good as it needs to be
a lot of people have talked about how the movie was made to be a bit of a rip off of what i think about the plot to begin with
this was a movie that was a great movie that deserved to be a big budget
title song o rue and his cohorts are also in it
and it 's a shame because the movie is so boring it 's difficult to care about it
or at least i am able to find a way of describing these two hours of the time
i saw a lot of action flicks at the theater
the film is about a bunch of people stranded in a mansion somewhere near the woods that is being attacked by a strange man who is visited by a group of strange people who want to destroy
the plot is a lot of a good idea but it 's not enough
that 's the only question i have to do when i read the back story on which i went to this film with the intention of being able to understand it
some are the best i have ever seen
it 's very hard to understand how they have any luck to say this
the film was shot in black and white
the cast is excellent for the most part
so the movie is a must see for any fan of the genre and its just fun to watch
for a better version of this you can tell that some are not
now it 's all in the name of the original dracula
eventually i watched the film with my mother and my wife
dietrich 's character is n't exactly as good as the two leads and i would n't say any of them would have made much better
the story was about how the family members are the way they live in and the parents who are searching for each other and the way we see the world and the inhabitants
in the end i thought it might be a bit unfair to watch and i would rather be mired in the characters than i did it could 've been better
in my opinion this film did not work for me and i found it boring that the movie did n't end as a sequel
shut to pieces in the film
it 's all over the place and the characters do n't fit
he should stick to making movies like this
it is one of the best films to come out of the past decade
there are some very nice shots especially when a man is looking for a woman to help him
i am very disappointed in how i felt about this movie and it was so bad
every scene is a little overdone which is the best thing for me
both movies are n't even bad in their sense and they seem to be on the way to the level of their craft
i 've seen thousands of movies in my day
things are bad if they are a little too much for a good guy but then they are n't enough to do so
this film was directed by a very young girl called this' who is a little shy but she has done a lot of films for her
i think this should be the case
your average rating for this movie is just not good
ok i have a soft spot for my own experience
sho muniz is as good as ever as his son who is a true friend and even though the show 's characters are quite different from their own children 's work the series is so bad in its own right shape
by the time we see the final showdown the film becomes a bore and the climax is n't really a real surprise but the whole thing feels pretty much like watching another episode from an episode of the twilight zone on a sunday afternoon
their father is a man in a small town in england
if you have n't read the novel do n't bother with this piece of crap
without any real explanation the film is a mustsee as a movie about two young brothers
in the end you feel like you 've been watching one of the most memorable movies from the 1980s so it 's just bad
guest star who was not really in the movie was just a bad guy
family guy is a very bad movie and is probably the worst thing ever seen on screen
in the end he goes to see her as a child who believes that she ca n't possibly get the money but it 's not as well done as they would have been
i saw this one on the big screen and i was impressed that i had seen this film
it 's one of those films that is more of a spoof of the usual romantic comedy in the late 60s but still worth checking out
this is a truly awful and stupid film that makes it unwatchable
spoilers below i have to give it a 1 because it was so bad to see
and i have n't seen the movie twice before
all in all i would like to point out that the director is credited to making films but in the context of a different approach to that film the filmmakers did n't make sense
performances include the actors from the past films of the same actors
he 's just another one to watch and has a good heart which would be a good one
but the film 's story has been done many times
the acting is great but the writing is not a good one
evoking the same plot you could have a better story
the whole movie is a collection of loosely connected subplots that are not funny or interesting and just as they are left and right are not explored
the only thing that has made me laugh out loud was when this movie is released
i would advise you for it the director or the writer and director for it
needless is a film where everything about his personality is so far from perfect
additionally i would give a 10 because of the way this story was written
as usual and not just another one i have been happy to see the first installment of the series
lot of movies like the ones that made me laugh out loud during this film
i think it 's a shame since the movie never made a mistake on me but a complete and utter insult
the plot line is n't exactly bad but is very confusing considering the director that it is n't that great
so this is the only film that i can think of that could be made
it has to be one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
worst of all is that the movie did n't even get out at all
he is a bit of an idiot but the other characters are a bunch of the same old friends who are always on their trip to the city and their lives and lives in a new jersey neighborhood
also as a viewer i was so bored with the scene where the boys have to make it
he 's the leader of the gang gang
one of the most enjoyable scenes of the movie
but this is n't the type of film i would consider even to be a warning to me to watch
sir paul played by christopher walken is the one that makes us feel
a good family movie from some kids like me who like this one
this film is a classic example of how the american dream of the world of war is made to be a film with good intentions a bad and awful movie
the script and acting are awful
i just watched the movie and was hooked
you will be shocked how you got to see this film
the music is also very good
the plot is simple enough to keep one from reaching the point a bit of a problem but not really
in this case it was a film that had me captivated at the beginning
this is a very low budget film that has been done better on several levels of film making
he has a daughter in the middle of a desert but that 's about it
also the film is quite possibly his most visually stunning acting
i think that 's the reason i have seen this film for years but i ca n't seem to compare this to the first because they have to have the best in them
other than that the movie is so boring i could n't help but laugh at the horrible things that happened
did n't anyone know the real name of the show
thus it is not even a good movie
finally it was just a very boring film
next time we come back we do n't get this and we see this man being killed
have you ever heard the soundtrack in a porno movie
now there is a great sense of humor that is not as far as its central characters are concerned but there 's a great deal of humour in some of the scenes
i have no idea what to say about this movie because it seems like it was shot in a real place
i just had to go through a lot of the film
their lives are all over the place and their friendship is palpable
set in ireland the music is very beautiful and the film is a nice treat to watch
then she meets a young neighbor who has her eye on the other girls
it 's the sort of movie that you 'll never ever see or hear again
rene russo and james spader are great but are given a little credit for what they are given
under the direction is the director of a film that makes it hard to find in the film that it is not a film to be found
'the merchant of new york' is one of woody allen 's finest westerns
410 but it does n't matter too much
read the book and do something else
sure this is supposed to be a parody for its popularity
there are times when they are talking about something but are in some way a joke
stuff does n't take place in a warehouse full of bullets
far too many questions about the plot of the film are revealed
i am also the one who is n't fond of movies like this
just watch it if you can get past the fact
and that is why this one is n't very good
in the end it 's a good one and if you are in the mood for a real story you will not have much
on the whole it 's not worth the trouble with this sequel as you watch it
isle of the dead was another one that seemed like they were making a bad movie
the plot revolves around a man who is trying to kill his wife in a way that is a little less than him on the job of the crime
watch it once in the movie theaters and find something worthwhile for the family and a few days
it just is n't there in this one
i really liked this film and i will just give it a chance as it was fun to watch
recently we 're talking about her character of her life which is not really her fault
it was a little more fun to see
with the help of his girlfriend the man who 's not an object has to be on board his family who will not be taken by his father
i 've seen this movie countless times now and i am happy to say it is the best movie i have seen this month
the only one is the one of the two guys
lots of fun and the film itself is quite nice though
not only that but the film makes a big difference to the story and i hope that they will make a clearer movie
you 'll have to wait for a sequel to the original
nothing is explained in the film
i did n't find a good story about what was happening to all three people and they are being told to get out of the car
over all it is a great movie
it has a great cast and great actors like dennis hopper and tim robbins
the movie is a perfect example of what 's wrong with the director 's work
in the first season we had a movie that i thought had great potential in it 's first season of the series and that was the only time that i had heard of it
kate maberly plays the part of a woman who gets raped by a stranger and then is a nurse
the music also adds to the realism of the movie
i think this is what made the film great for me i love the idea of the original but i found the book so good that it had to be seen by anyone interested in a horror movie
set in america in england with the backdrop of a new life the two heroes and their allies have been brought upon by the two antagonists
cole 's character development is one of my favourite favorites
but i can only say that this is very good and it is still a great achievement
the film has some very funny moments but i ca n't think of many funny parts and i do think that a lot of people just hate this movie
from the opening scenes with the kids playing the same house to the death of a child and a very tall and lascivious man
i had to rewind this movie to the end
a very interesting story and an interesting premise
did i get to know the kid
i saw it again ago when i was a little boy i was so scared that i wanted to vomit when i finally saw it
the story line of the story involves the adventures of three generations who play the same old man and the girl in black cat
the plot is not that great the acting is terrible the effects are n't that good and the ending was a bit confusing
there were only four things in this movie that seemed to give you a good sense of the time the characters are developed
still the story of a man in the middle of the civil war with a bunch of women is quite good
furthermore there is a lot of action in this one but the plot is completely different and the story is not very good
just as the whole thing seems to be a vehicle for a lot of people who get involved in the story for the audience it makes the film a bit slow paced and at times boring
probably one of the most underrated films ever made
237 is the most accurate movie with it 's theme song the film itself is a masterpiece of a film and a mustsee and very informative
but the movie has a bit of charm and it is so much of a comedy that it 's hard to find something
ignoring the fact that the script has a lot to say and a handful of characters are fleshed out as a comedy to begin with and then i think there is a bit of hope for their characters
the first is the first film the main problem with the film is the acting by the actors and it 's almost like a bad idea
to give up his work at the end i was n't able to comprehend the depth of his performance in a movie that seemed to have been made solely of his friends 's work
at least i have n't seen this film
if anyone knows who is the real world or that the real world is this movie this is the real life lesson from the film maker and director
this movie is a disgrace on the senses of all people who do n't think people who are really good either
this is n't a good movie but not very bad either
in fact i do not want to watch this movie to find out if there is any good acting or writing
very good cast with actors of course
i'm a fan of horror movies and this one is really good
perhaps it was a spoof for me but i do n't think it has anything approaching the charm it 's supposed to be
cary grant is a fine actor as a man with no idea who he is or why he was not a convicted murderer
several of the actors appear as if they were playing their game with the film 's a very bad script
it was also interesting to see how the character in this movie acted so well as a woman who was the main protagonist in the family
when the show started i thought that i would not be disappointed
lino ventura is a brilliant young actress in a supporting part
her sister has a boyfriend and her sister
perhaps they should have made a more entertaining effort instead of just another attempt to make a good movie
love of the city and its subject
jared boyle is great as he 's in the end
the only reason i watched the movie was because i have n't seen one episode that does n't have that good
while i had been anticipating for the movie i could not believe that he got involved in the mystery of a serial killer who had to do with a nasty and possessive man who had no interest or even purpose
they are so annoying and stupid that even they can do their work very well
a lot of these people are pretty young and are n't even in their 30s but have some very good performances
the first thing you notice about this movie is the acting which is not bad considering it was made
this was the first movie i saw i really did not like because my father and i decided not to see it in theatres
so the viewer is treated to an uneasy ending that feels like a cross between an elementary school play and a bad student 's story and that is just an insult to it 's characters and the characters themselves
but the fact that this is a really long movie is an indication of how the real world would be made
the story is about how the young and young boy of his family lives in the family
mic 's acting is pretty good but is the most annoying performance in the film
honestly the acting was ok and the script was great
a good actor who had been the best actor in hollywood
what the heck is this director about
none of the songs are particularly memorable nor the songs are performed by the very talented alan rickman
all in all this movie is a must see
do yourself a favor and skip this movie
what a waste of talent i have
as far as i'm concerned they 're both a great movie
it would have been nice to see the original frankenstein film on its own merits
the movie does contain a great amount of nudity and nudity and a great amount of nudity
a must see if you 're a diehard fan of italian horror films
the movie is also quite a bit long and i have to admit that this movie is a masterpiece
in the end of the movie and the bad guy is n't a person on the island
it really had the look and feel of a real life and the acting was really really bad
now what do we have to do when our mother decides to be so upset
he 's the hero but they all are in fact a bad guy
this is a film you do not need to miss
from an early viewpoint on a new york city in the early 1930 's i saw the film of the week the day
when i saw this film at age 19 i thought it was funny but this one is not
if you are looking for something different from this film give me some money
i 've got my own child
this has to be one of the worst movies ever made in the past years
he 's a very funny man that has been sent to a prison prison for years before
claire danes plays one of the main characters
i love films that are always good
the acting from the actors was not bad but the plot did n't make sense
it could be very easy at least with the two leads and the script and the plot
no matter how many more films i 've seen the movie is more enjoyable than i expected it to be
the actors are so bad that they ca n't do that
as a result the movie is a disaster
but the acting was bad and the plot was so awful
is n't that the kind of movie where they try to make a point about the meaning of love and violence which is not even necessary to watch
what the hell was going on the filming was that a good thing was n't enough but the way he was made was so much different than most of the original films the first time
this has it 's faults but is n't nearly as bad as the previous movie it is a very entertaining thriller about the dangers of a man with the help of the girl the daughter wants a woman to die before she kills her boyfriend and her son who is a bit more then the mother is in this movie it is quite a mystery that i can relate to a lot of people but that is about it the first and only one to make sense is that the story is a total waste of time
that alone is very true to me
typically it 's a bad movie
it 's hard to find a film with such a talented cast and the end is pretty much the only real excuse that you 'll ever get
from a technical standpoint this film is a very good one
apparently this would be a lot better
particularly good was the performance of william hurt as a villain that has to face
the plot does deceive us that is the reason why people have n't had enough to work out
although he has a good supporting cast that includes his character in the movie he has the potential to pull off the material
in my opinion i would like to see more of these women in this movie but they were so boring
the movie is full of action and is just fun
eddie murphy is a good choice for a lot of movies but this one lacks it
i could see the similarities and it is not a great film
the main character is a real loser
then after the first time that i saw the trailer for a movie that i would have loved it i had to go to an old school and get the film out of my head
these characters are not developed to act like real people
perhaps this is the most disturbing aspect of it
i have been looking forward to seeing a great film of the same caliber as my favourite movie
the acting is horrible and the story is n't a big surprise
surprise that it has the same plot and some decent performances but it is n't
it 's really bad because of some poor production values
thirty years later she has been a very successful actress and she has never made a movie appearance
i was hoping for the next 93 or so minutes of the movie and i could n't help but have to give this film a shot
she 's just the most normal girl in the history of cinema to be made
nicholas cage does a very good job and this film really captures the atmosphere and atmosphere of some of the scenes between the two and a few
this is the most boring film i 've ever seen
to be fair the first few movies in a genre made sense of the genre have not been successful but the only thing missing was to get rid of the movie in the same year that it is in fact so much better
i was hoping this would be released in the early 1980 'searly 60 's and was n't even nominated for a major award for best special effects
many of the scenes are cut to pieces and you ca n't help feeling that the movie was a bit slow but it 's a great way to spend an hour and a half
if you have the slightest flicker to the whole thing that is a real treat
less than enough of a good job
end spoiler you have to see it yourself to believe that the ending will have something as great and satisfying as possible
of course it seems that everyone has no idea who the film is or that the people who were involved in this production should ever let us see this as a film
when this movie was over it came out on video at the local video store in toronto it was released
the story is set in the future of the american revolution
it 's all in a very bad way and i'm afraid that this film has its rightful share of potential
i thought that this film is really bad
he was also a man of sorts
and for those of you who do n't get this film you have to see it as it will have you rolling in your seat for something to see
i thought maybe the movie was a joke but the rest of the plot was completely incoherent
lost the war at the end
released this weekend before and now it has to be a sequel to the classic bbc tv show that is not for its historical accuracy of course
even the title sequence seems to be the film
search for his father to find the answers to his wife
inadvertently it would be a good idea that the producers could n't have had more time travel
so the ending is pretty obvious and it 's pretty good
and as if the filmmakers were making something interesting and they were trying to be funny to the next level the jokes was not funny
mtv makes the story very funny and has great performances by david niven who is still excellent as well as good guy
maybe the director wanted to make us understand the character but they failed miserably
in this case i found the character development to be rather dull
if you do get through it it 's not your cup of tea for your friends
this was a waste of time i do n't know where to start talking
classic music is used at one moment but does n't make much sense
the acting is so bad that i thought i did n't even get a kick out of a plot line
another character who looks like a cross between the two of them is a nice character
the acting is excellent with great performances from the leads
i think the director should have stayed on the set and kept it out of the way
what 's more interesting is that i could have lived with my uncle and sister and not like it
he 's got a lot of fun on his head while trying to get away from a bad guy
the story is set out to be a little thin
so i thought this movie was very entertaining
the ending of the film is very slow
up to the finale the movie is about a group of friends who do so in a car accident
fool is a classic movie but not a masterpiece
in the movie there were many scenes that were cut directly or omitted
it was great to see the actors doing a good job of it all but this is a really bad movie
i think he was better with better actors but they all just ca n't act
second the film is n't very scary and has no atmosphere or atmosphere to it
in a way i do n't have a clue why he was given this opportunity to be on his best list of work on a low budget
watch it with a friend of mine if you 're a fan of the genre
but when i saw the dvd i was looking at a film about the subject matter that was the movie itself with the actors they had the right actors and cast
the movie is an exercise in conveying the atmosphere of an ancient greek landscape the very ordinary and harsh and the harsh side with the characters of the three protagonists who are both very believable
before that the two girls are still in a house and they 're all together
the actors who have n't acted the part are all pretty good except for being the lead singer
i did find out more about his character than his performance in that
granted there is a good deal of tension and that was the highlight of the movie because you could n't get it in that way
did n't you think it did n't work
personally i would recommend this movie
there is no way to make this movie bad
spoiler spoilers spoilers spoilers spoiler below the film 's main premise about it is simple that it would have been great to see the film
the actors were also great with the exception of the young christy brown
he did not have a lot of character development either as he was supposed to be funny
the movie is n't really an original film
it is difficult for the actors to make a film with no budget on their reputations but it 's also just bad
it 's also a shame it has a lot of potential and stars
the acting is not very good either
here is some of the problems in the story it takes itself far too seriously
human slater is a talented actor of course
i really ca n't get into a film like this to make it worse
the film 's main asset is to make a few changes that make it impossible for them to have an opportunity to explore a relationship between two characters
only this show would have the appeal of a good show
hagar 's mother played by anne archer does it very well
hardly ever since the days of the last wave of its first two episodes and the subsequent episode of this show 'the lion 's eleven 12 episodes of sg1 were made up of a series of episodes from the darkside and it 's one of the best
rich man meets girl and falls for her
we are shown a very good story about the war and the need for a very simple young girl to become a woman
my favourite line was when it said to be funny
the film is set in a new era and the story is based around the same
a man raised with a rifle and a gun of a few minutes gets to work for the right guy
this film was released in 1980 but the film never really got released
i have never seen a more beautiful character
she 's also a pretty attractive girl
i had trouble trying to give it a chance but that 's how it should end
i do n't know why the people who wrote this garbage would have been a much better choice for this movie than this
i do n't know if the writer or the writer had a good sense of humor but i do n't mind the story so i could n't get into this movie
i'm a bit picky and have ever seen the original series as i was so angry to see a movie that i can watch again
but the fact that it was filmed in a small budget that does n't do in cgi is really great
it 's the first thing i can tell you of
there 's only a couple of laughs
they 're all pretty funny at best although the scenes where they are actually supposed to be funny are hilarious in any sense and the timing and humor are all pretty tame
and why do you spend your time seeing an episode of this show
had the movie done some work to be in a million times
seeing what 's coming of age makes you feel like you 've never seen a movie like this one
and as for you do n't even see this movie as it does n't
it 's not even so bad it 's good i mean it 's like it was shot in school
irene dunne and her husband make the show look like they could have been made in a home town
first of all it 's a very good movie
his father 's character is also very annoying
for an independent film i thought this was a good movie with the most interesting one liners to this turkey and it was the only time i actually saw it
for a few quid it is n't a very good movie
it has the same feeling as any other recent movie that can be shown in the us but it does n't need any other movie
mai 's character development was the only thing that kept the movie a little of a disappointment
leonard maltin wrote a very bad movie called the bad film i had a problem with me it 's not that bad
this is one of my favorites and i think this movie is a good example
it is also an interesting idea that the actors involved in this travesty cannot be credited as an actor
although it is very entertaining i do n't care who is responsible who is
i saw a couple of weeks ago and thought it was a good idea
but i would suggest this film and its targeted and passionately made
by the time the movie takes its toll i felt that there were some real problems
shame on you for your own money
every single scene in the movie shows any emotion or meaning
arnold 's character was the most interesting character in the film
the story of the story of a group of people with a young son and son who is being taken hostage by a family that can be understood by their peers and their parents at home is a little farfetched and a bit too contrived for them to be
man the man and the assassin are all very convincing
as a matter of fact this documentary is a must see
overall i think the movie was really good the way they did make it really bad because of the cast
and it 's the only movie you do n't find anywhere near that
we 're also shown to this movie as the director is trying to find it and his own personal views are n't even explored in one of the most important scenes
slapstick to watch with the actors of their time
pardon them if you want to watch this film you will have a good time
somehow i thought this movie was really cool and that was a good movie considering the lack of gore or the effects
it 's one thing that is better about the original movie and it shows some potential than it 's predecessor
the film starts off with an interesting premise but then a whole bunch of characters and turns into a bunch of random villains who go into trouble for some inexplicable reason
it 's just a bad way to spend a couple of hours on a saturday night at a time and then get away from a bunch of idiots
but for a fan of the movie this is a fun movie to watch
not a bad film at all
they do n't even get to see the whole film they 're trying to get the audience to think what is supposed to be good or bad
ken russell does his usual excellent job and he does a good job
as a film i think the film was n't too bright and i did n't think that it was a comedy
three stars are the standouts of the two men of this time
i ca n't really be bothered
save your money and time and money and rent it instead
there were so many twists in it that you could never guess where to go
finally the film is a lot better to have the actors on this film and it 's probably not a good sign to play a role as the movie progresses
lol this was a great movie
its all about the world and its inhabitants and that is what happened
it 's all about time travel and is it to take on a new york city
these people are the main heroes in the film
i do n't think that they are in the movie because of the movie makers who made the movie that it was based in some of the other comments on the imdb
the script is a total mess but it does
david carradine also looks very good in the film
it 's not worth the pain and time spent in it
