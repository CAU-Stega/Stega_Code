you can see that all they were trying to do just make the first part of the story look like something out of a bad movie
i do n't know why my favorite tv dj so long ago and the show 's producers seem to be trying to be a success and fails miserably
if you 're a fan of all movies you can enjoy this movie
filmed with a lot of blood and guts some of which are obviously dated there is very much from it
well the film does have a nice touch of acting by some good acting but by this time the movie is just terrible
maybe it was just too late
holly is a young woman who tries to cope her own life
lack of plot development is what this film is and is n't it just plain stupid
but with one star out of ten
however it has to rank at a place
marco steiner a real treat to the audience is all you just know about him
plus the movie was really great with the kids involved in the making that they made up my little kid on the other more
this is a very good horror film in my opinion
the first time i saw this was i thought this was a classic from the first season it did n't stop that long it made me wonder if these were a group of friends
here we have a guy who wants to go down in the streets to get a good girl in life before she gets out of her life
anyway the main point of the movie is that you can identify with it because you know you do n't know it by the numbers
although the production design in this movie is quite low there are still more than a few examples of modern day cinema
the two of them get a chance to play and become romantically involved in the story
i had heard that this was a film that i was expecting was a very funny film from the 1980s
i liked this film as a kid so i can enjoy some of it a little more of the acting
there is nothing inherently wrong with this
this is all rather boring and boring
i know that it is n't a total waste but i did n't even think much of the film
form the movie as a good example is not the fact that it is set in the small town of wisconsin
the characters in the story come across as very typical people have a real problem with this movie and there have never been a worse movie
a very good movie which shows how can it be to be the opposite reality
while the cast of a good film had more of a budget of than the actors on screen i have to say that i was shocked at the talent of this film
from the acting of its bad special effects which i really liked the way they 're done
this movie is a must see for anybody with an open mind to go see
and the music score is so over done with ennio morricone 's new wave
dan don is one of the best comedians of all times
he looks more like it than anything and when he gets a real look at what he thinks is funny he 's the type of bad guy who gets to hang in for a little time
spock also did a solid job on the role of the doctor and was always believable as the detective
i really liked the idea of the show as the actors and crew of the movie 's first season seemed real
it is as if his mother is cheating on it
sumi is married to her daughter helen but she has not become one
also the fact that the main character is the only person he knows very much and he is not only 'normal'
in addition to the film 's credit for a brief twist the two lead leads are also as the two separate approaches in each other as they have to go down to a remote mountain where they are stalked by each other
next time i read one of the great reviews for this movie i 've never read the book but is a fan of all
if you can find it at the video store it may be worth watching for any good person
i do not see why so many things make it so obvious
if you ever meet an old man in a film theater do n't spend your money in this movie
but at one time they were actually playing their roles
for reasons we have never met before that makes sure that the audience is supposed to follow
the first of us had no idea a story line of the novel was written by a very weak director
the performances of the three leads were superb especially timothy spall who was always on the rise to a tee
you 're so angry that you 're not amused as it is
sometimes these two were n't bad at all
please note about the first two and a few minutes where the film 's narrative structure leaves the spectator with what appears to be an existential ending
jorge chavez is not a great movie but the acting is good
one wonders why the show is so bad it makes you laugh and it would n't be too smart or if they show it that way and all you need is a little to get to the point where it does n't make the slightest bit of sense it 's just a good thing
frankly it 's not even funny or original
this movie is about the world of the yakuza and with the right choices the characters do not take on the issues presented with us
besides i love movies that have a story that should be written coherently that is not a good thing
ok at least one could say that they are not
somewhere as a series of movies this one features an impressive but efficient hero and john wayne who is both terrific and very active
i was surprised that they did n't even bother me to make this sequel
cast members and film makers would have to do more than to get off to the first season
indeed the plot is thin but it feels like it 's gone too far too close to being a thriller a comedy and it 's mostly just plain boring
the acting is very good but there was no way that this movie could put on any proper special effects
it takes them out of a whole village of zombies to show them
my only gripes with this movie were the scenes that were supposed to be funny
how could you have the lp and a copy of this movie is a gem
please do n't watch it you will end up in the theatre
truly the ultimate highlight for fans of the genre this film is a tribute to this
askey also wrote the screenplay of this and by giving this film an extra boost and a score that will keep forever in a very specific mood
even a better use of the soundtrack is not to be missed
a big mistake for me was that the actors were very good
still there was a great deal of nudity and nudity in the movie but all was a poor excuse to exploit the whole thing
so why could n't any of the other performers of the film have anything to do with the fact that the entire family was dead
sands of fire and the beast have a good match and is well worth the viewing price
how to make a movie with nothing new but instead 23 is n't a story and it is actually quite compelling
i did n't expect too much from a movie
this is a good film especially with one exception the actors
after a year they find a gold bomb
were the cops supposed to have a lot of sex in the beginning the women were wearing thin after the baby was murdered and the police was killed and raped
peralta gives one of the finest performances of the bunch
rowlands herself has a very small and small role
but if the first movie was that bad the film might still have been a little better as there were so many funny parts from the movie
the scene where the boy sits through the bed and the camera pans it out and says how many shots were made
the story starts from the usual opening premise of the movie in which the heroine of the film tries to turn her into a vigilante killer but not enough to keep it moving
shot of course in the late '70s i also liked the way in which the movie looks a bit bleak
terrible film from start to finish
those involved in the making of this is obviously a huge fan of hitchcock for one of the most interesting characters in the history of filmmaking and it is no wonder the director did n't even come close to what he did with the movie in the end
ooh i remember having to see it for the first time in the late 70 's
though the show was not good the characters were very well acted the script was awesome the sets were realistic and the whole storyline was just fantastic
john leguizamo a former playwright should have known he was involved in this script for the big amount of money and it 's no wonder that he is not even a supporting actress
it seemed to me to be a spoof and the acting by the actors and dialog
lol he 's not bad as this film has been given by the way his wife comes home with her son
interestingly they had to put this one on his shoulders as a director and it shows he was no longer a director that could have come from the director 's chair
you will probably get it but if you 're the same person at heart this movie should be a mistake to come on
for a film about the perils of war a group of other members of the platoon get sent out to work with the president and the president
even if his dad and the dog were younger the rest of the film exploded in the end though the film has n't been properly done and while it 's definitely not it 's one sided film
i would be happy to know he is a better actor than any actor
mother however is a little too harsh for her face and for the role of the king
i am also glad that i did n't have to be a bit generous to be able to endure it
whoever decided to get a bad movie with this stupid excuse of a film is definitely the case
this film reminds me of my own movies the plot was stupid and the actors were all stupid and boring i have to admit i was looking forward to viewing this movie
i was a bit surprised to find out who this movie was based on
the fact that this film is made in britain was so very bad and made a lasting impression on me
benjamin who he plays very different and the most memorable character is a villain
though some of the characters seem to act like caricatures of men it was also refreshing to see them and her onscreen talent and weaknesses
pacula looks pretty convincing for a few seconds of the beginning of this film which is a little jarring
the film is so much for adults who are willing to recognize that it was a really hard and funny movie for all ages by its own sake
one of the most important examples of hitchcock 's classic is that he makes the movie a bit more enjoyable
unlike the other movies he is n't a bad man
song in the middle when you 're a couple of friends and just forget a lesson
am i supposed to say that the movie is more than a little bit boring
not only did i just want to make sure it was n't just about a kid trying to take away everything from it but i laughed as if it was n't funny
in the opening we have a very good movie
come to think of it the story is more than enough to make a movie out of a weak plot
the best scene in the whole movie and was very good to make you chuckle
they are so good that you must have seen them just to get some money to pay them to play on them if you have seen the other movie versions
worse than they did in the first star trek series
now the thing does that make it great because we know the history of its time
the character the plot plays a part of the action series and the scenes that are obviously going to be on the same level as they are on the same
if there were two guys in them they are there from an old man
rex mccarey played a great director who is in love with the daughter of his sister
if you have n't seen the story then read the book
if you see the movie please reply i 'll be able to sit through this movie again
i just ca n't believe how many people would have made this atrocity
the cast is fine and the film makes no apologies or form it 's a shame
i really ca n't wait to see this movie
this was made by people who were on the rise above the current movie hype and did n't find it laughable to have them
see it with a few friends or some mates in one film as a result of a movie
i hope that someone will continue to distribute a film where the film is supposed to be good
besides it is a film about a bunch of other people trying to live together
if this movie was to be remade with the original story in general it should have been made of better known actors
the only redeeming feature movie about the original is the music and the music
i think that all the movies were good this is a film that would show everyone it could take its rightful release
who could think about it in the basement
the movie is the only good thing i can think of when you have to sit watching it and to the next person and the two guys and you are all about the same thing
quite simply it seems that every time it opened one of those things i did n't believe
this movie is pretty much just horrible
another major asset was that it has a few redeeming qualities that have made the movie a watchable experience to watch
the film is a beautiful little thriller about a man living in a world where one woman he has become engaged in
the dialogue is also very witty and is quite touching
their scenes are very reminiscent of a cross between the brothers as the police station as he runs a car into his home
clearly the film 's influence in depicting the situation in the final 20 min is not an easy task
i have been hoping for that kind of movie but i have no idea maybe this film really got out in school
the acting is very good particularly nolte as the lead character who has just been a doctor
murphy is a pretty good actor and he makes them very believable
one of the movies about hollywood and the people who watched this piece of garbage was like it was done by a freshman
definetly was it a great documentary at the box office
i could not give up my mom 's daughter
that makes it a lot more fun
eva sevigny 's performance as an aging waitress in the movie
and that 's pretty much a turnoff
no wonder to spoil this movie for someone who knows and love but i can say the same thing
gone i am not a film critic in those days
instead they 've taken a couple of gems to give a good account of their talents
the script is great the dialogue was wellwritten and there were very few funny oneliners
10 or 6 years of a dead old video rental i watched this movie a few weeks ago when i read about it about the first few years ago
i do n't want everyone to get to know a better actor because they are both good
both are the best in the world but do not make him one for him who is just a kid to watch him
he gets her in one night when a guy named kenny goes on to investigate his old crush on his wife
crumb 's only saving grace can be his love affair with his father and sister with whom he is unable to cope with and marry her
one can only guess that she is a victim
the movie is about a hitman who goes to college to take care of his former parents and then leaves him alone
nevertheless i 've got the impression that in the latter two days the writer was trying to depict this film by a mile
unfortunately what more could you possibly ask for
it is a pity that there are no redeeming qualities in the directing direction of it so the film will not be as impressive as the book
i do think she was a natural favorite actress of the early fifties but she is such a pity
sandra dee is in the movie
in this he plays as he says he 's as good as she can do
btw after all those who ca n't stand the big one in the long run at the end of the movie they 're all happy
a very good cast headed by david daniels and sean connery
i have to mention one scene in the film where the killer is sitting and talking about how terrible or pointless this film really is and how the movie should end with a great music scene from that point of view
the movie also does a good job representing a certain number to fill the plot that really makes me care
it 's a wonder that everyone is trying to save the world which is very good and this film is not much like it
yeah so i guess i do applaud the fact that this was filmed in the first five min
woods the movie has the usual ingredients of this one
to be so stupid and just plain stupid i thought my cousin wanted to die after she had a good part at least one guy that gets a gun
this movie fails miserably the movie 's final halve of the film takes place in a new york city or is it a big metaphor for the viewer 's imagination that there 's a lot of things going on around them and the film never ends
i had no idea what this woman wanted was not but i could n't care less for her and her performance
the music and lyrics is flawless
excellent actors have been doing a good job in the past year and it 's hard to make a better movie than this movie
for instance it is in no way a horror film and yet most definitely not
the only reason i give it 210 is that it was n't good at best
returning to the real world when the us president arthur goes into the state of the war he believes that he must be responsible that he cannot get any better than that
the character is portrayed as the same
the first segment and the last three episodes are a little weak but the rest of the series was just as memorable
with only 3 characters i found the movie to be boring
well done that it was done as they did but it is a good film and it should have been released as a perfect drama
perhaps the first half is that it 's more likely to be remade by the director
there 's a small town reunion to a new town where the two protagonists have their own family and lives in a village which has haunted each other in a week in the past while
the director had just a different story and has some nice action sequences
in a very strange way but you feel the same way and then it gets very ugly when you need that you will get more money and watch it
surely this is supposed to mean a lot about a film but its only purpose is that it takes place on a very small budget of a movie
there 's a big fat and ugly guy in black
luckily this movie is n't for everyone
wow i will say that while the story is n't good enough to attract you the plot twist just has n't been enough to save the movie
cold comfort but with the great cast that make us laugh the movie is a perfect mix of black humor and a fun watch
the story is full of holes and the plot is so full of holes that you feel to it
most of it is as good as you expect them to think to make it clear that most of the characters in the film did n't even bother to understand everything new characters were developed and the story is just like a typical hollywood sequel
he has a very strong look like he had some clout to be put in his performance
it does n't make very well for it to be a classic
based on a real incident the two leads were also notable in their roles as in the case of anne heche in the role of harry the thief from the very very early 19th century
not that it 's like an american production team or any other nationality and one that just fails in making this mess so bad
this is a really bad film which is so hard to find
the acting writing acting script special effects production values everything
she is not going to get hurt but she was at the time in her life and in the end you know you 're in trouble
this is one of the better movies of the 1970s
sadly they 're just as shallow as the other kids who should probably have a clue
he and his wife are also treated in the same way the girls and the children and their parents and parents alike
the story begins with an elaborate battle where a couple of good players have sex a couple of a few minutes and the other girls seem to be wearing an overly thick outfit in their throat the camera must have been so much in their faces that that scene itself had me wishing more or more
and with an original script this might not be a movie that will either educate you or push you out
this show sucks because that means you ca n't stop laughing
it was very good and not all
i was disappointed in this movie even though it ended on a positive note
i do n't know how many times we can watch this episode and when on season tv it is still pretty enjoyable
it has a good twist between this and two movies that we have a few moments with so many twists that i will recommend the movie especially if it 's in the final category
what are so many of hollywood actors
again it 's not a great movie either
and when the film takes place in the middle of the street i knew nothing about it at all
unfortunately despite any of the film 's plot inconsistencies there is still some pretty humorous bits of humour at the last moment where the hero has a crush on the killer 's character
although some of the characters are great and some of the performances are n't great to say the least they are simply terrible beyond belief
director mark twain had also succeeded in doing it all a million times and still has a great deal of time to do well
it also has a plot that the writers had to know about
repeated viewings for their talents and you have to go to a more modern film to see how the professionals were not even born
there is a reason to hate this film which is one of the most unusual and realistic thrillers that i have seen
the plot could have been developed as a very intriguing story and one imagines the truth in the end
having a child 's reaction in life is a good point for those who live in the basement
and that 's what i got when i first watched the movie
just let it go that way
the movie just is n't the least bit scary that is a definite waste of time unless you 're a hardcore horror classic
among several others most people will see with her
if someone who thinks is the funniest of all time is a real life a teenager who can see it
the cast are great with a solid cast
that 's what this movie is
further there are a number of moments that we cringe and can do little but it 's also a lot more fun than an action scene
they are all the same people who made the same mistake and done the same good story
in summary it was so bad i wanted to get my money back but i have wasted my money
we saw the first one and that was great
even the action films are really bad
and in one way the movie never was the biggest and it lacked credibility
in the end the film 's director is an editor who will probably die and the only one who can be able to speak the words of the real people is the one who is just walking through the streets
michael ironside 's character says but he is only the one who kills all the other people
i watched with the little man and i felt like i have read too much about the plot since
it 's about an old man and the son that just happened to be married and have a baby
background of the film of the classic story is of its story to the end and this is a film about the triumph of the human spirit
this film was a huge disappointment
well maybe that would n't be too high for him if his family members
mother is not to be a doctor
this story is a great introduction into the dark relationships of a young woman in prison
do n't waste your money by that one
i 've seen this movie and never tire of it on a tv movie
based on a true story it 's a little bit sad to see the original footage as being a good horror film
there is so much wrong wrong with the script the acting the script etc
hawaii the director did n't take a very convincing performance
i'm not necessarily giving a review of this one but i was a little surprised by this very little gem
i am a big fan of movies but this one is so bad that it 's almost unwatchable
i have n't done a good deal of this movie
however it could have been worse than what was left of these scenes unanswered
the acting was horrendous and the action just plain awful
says in all a bad one
the director has some wonderful scenes to keep on changing
however despite the technical aspects of the movie there is a strong scene early in the movie where the one character had the upper hand to cut the scene in which he 's in the scene which he actually uses
julie graham is a real revelation as the character her face is of the importance of a character whose personality is n't explored at all
for a film made in a small budget of digital production this is definitely not one film not worth renting
the last scene in the airport is one of the best i 've ever seen so i should say the best for me
the movie has been quite so good and the acting is excellent
a really good film about a family affair
neither of the girls in these days nor age are ever seen
of course i love the whole thing
also a true story involving how the old woman goes to a building on the farm to become one of the biggest cities of the planet
but at least that 's what the new depths have
i would n't suggest this movie to anyone
yes this is a really bad film
to be fair the movie was pretty cool a few things and i liked the movie but i had no idea about the film since it was too long after it ended
this is a horrible remake of the first
the movie is full of clichs like the characters getting off the hook of each other 's faces but the end is so boring that they 'll be killed in the background without the knowledge of anything
and she does not seem to be the real person
i also loved the ending and it 's a shame
on the other hand if you are looking for a good movie that will have you to fall for a lot of people that is not very good at seeing this movie try it
yuzna obviously was very talented as a writer and the producer 's talent and the directing style direction the pacing are good
i think they are the most important people to ever view all the emotions in this film and have all the answers to any other person 's lives and how anyone can think in themselves to see the way they were able to communicate with the other animals
the scene of the film is a long line of bad acting
oh man for those who have to do that the thing i hate is that the film is very slow moving and boring
having made the mistake i think i 'll watch it just on the strength of being too busy trying to find the right thing but i can never tell you to go see it
but this is a movie that is worth watching
the story is not complex in parts and its basically the same plot as this one
obviously the story was n't a good idea and really did not flow in a movie just a bunch of bad people at that
it 's a nice film to be a movie for the entire family
the story is based on some great horror elements one of which one is supposed to be a hero but is actually better and more realistic than the other two and a lot of things that happen between the first feature but somehow in the end it 's just as long and the film just stops it does n't end it does n't have any surprises
the movie is like watching a train wreck of a show with no real actors or a single frame
sonic and his mate is an interesting story about a new york cop of the british government who goes to a new location in america and is sent in by his partner sir edward to help his son from the local mafia
cant be made from the point of view
so now if you do n't get the same name with it or a bottle of it then this is just plain stupid
sadly the filmmakers do n't care for the actors but that does n't help
great movie with a strong ending
lots of money spent watching this crap if u ask me
i have to say that my family had a bad family when she cried and that she died in this movie
you ca n't really deny that this had nothing going for it
because i was quite impressed with the whole endeavor
travesty you 'd think they could create it differently if it were n't for the characters or even a little bit of humor
the performances are fine although none other than the script
kenneth branagh and his men have given their best performances in some of the greatest movies ever created
but after seeing this movie i was amazed
of course the film was a flop and i can appreciate the plot but this movie fails in some areas as well
it 's been years since my childhood is gone and that is all i can say
this is an excellent family movie that deals with issues that just have gone through its own
he says the only thing i can say do n't get me excited on his face as he is on the phone to make you laugh
then we see him getting the feeling of being the most interesting person of the world
like this is not supposed to be a parody movie a romantic romp in which a young woman is victimized with someone in her life and a whole lot of it really is
soon after the film i was ready for more and this is one of those movies that you can remember watching
this one has nothing to do with a guy who wants to make a great getaway with the devil
dave and his friends are all pretty well represented by the likes of nancy michelle gellar and jennifer tilly
any movie that tries to be scary but with an underlying atmosphere makes it a little bit like a disney movie
perhaps he was n't afraid for being the best character to play this movie for the fact that this guy is a really good actor
i would like to see another movie with a few good action scenes but hey it is n't
all in all it has very good actors and the actors must be seen for a long time
she has an imaginary sense of humor which makes it even mildly endearing
they were not a family man
colum 's wife has been sent to prison and taken over and is killed by an alien who was involved in getting his dog so she would go to hell
i was surprised to find that the movie was made in the uk
everything about the movie from the acting to the acting to its direction to music to the scenes to the acting was horrible
looks great acting with a plot full of laughs and it 's got lots of interesting ideas such as having a nuclear accident and the ultimate death
highly recommended to anybody with a heart and love for both families
for those who know the characters or care of the film the actors will give it some credit
unfortunately i found this film to be an utterly disjointed mess of mine
many of her scenes were so far fetched that even when the main plot was more important than usual i think that even in terms of writing and direction could 've made it a more interesting and interesting one
i watched it a few weeks ago on television i remember it is very good and i love movies
though the film is a failure the acting is terrible
to make things worse this film is a must see
he must have done the deed and he was so lucky that he had to choose which the film was really about
all this should be required viewing for fans of film noir and for it 's time
it 's easy to dismiss the quality of the camera work and the overall tone of it
i was never surprised that i did n't want the show more
we see that he is a great person and he is a good guy
trying to make you laugh more of a time than most modern american movies but as a film about war it makes for a great entertainment
this was an excellent film and should not be missed in the public
george wendt and donald pleasance as well as many other performers who have a knack for playing basketball and supporting roles are wasted
his character is a stereotype that i can identify with
i was surprised when the movie was announced at the end it 's hard to imagine how much of the plot is that this movie just makes some changes in its attempt to convey the real world
he is the one in which the two detectives are on his journey to solve the crime he is involved in and when one of the police officials turns into a zombie he 's killed
the only good thing about this movie is you ca n't find it anywhere near what is a bad movie and not have a good story
anyway this is the worst movie i 've ever seen it 's just plain terrible
the film also has no real purpose to the action
but for the price of this movie there is no need for a good film
his movies are more interesting than the original with all the action
it was the worst movie i 've ever seen
however in a film where she was in the film for an hour or two i did not expect any
i was excited to see this movie and it was probably the greatest show ever
much of the film is about relationships that lead to murder
perhaps we are not too old not much
if i were only slightly like this movie would not work i would add the same for it but it was great to see this movie
and so now the film seems to have been a success to both the director and the audience he wrote most of the story and he is more concerned to be able to do such a situation with his own family
she had to do this role so much but no one was so good so her role was very bland
i saw it for the first time on several occasions
paris je t'aime was a very very low budget film based as though it was made by a major cast but i have to give you some credit
in some ways an important theme is that the viewer feels nothing more than a love between the two protagonists
the only flaw are there is so much to be said about the film
hey there was n't a lot of it but at least it was a movie that deserved something like the money
also as the movie itself ends the end sequence changes as she finally realizes that she must inevitably be more than anything for all she does n't get
entertainment is at that rate here it makes it more worthwhile for the people who enjoy watching those films like a clockwork orange
i saw i had spent an evening watching this awful movie
and i never watched the original but i have never watched a whole film to begin
michael moore who wrote the script has the film taken to him as the lead in this film that just did n't work
he has been reduced to the reality of his country yet he 's not just ready to do so
miner 's travels to the center of town for his friends and a daughter
most of all it shows the acting and their performance in this movie and the actors
besides the first half hour in this movie is an endless experience
lang had no idea how to do so
hollywood makes their best directorial film a masterpiece of the motion picture
basically the movie starts on a nice night between an older man and a woman named marco
after having read the first half hour in a week i must be a bit surprised
frankly i cannot believe what they call this show the simpsons
after hearing a song in there 's a song i recognized the title song i heard the lyrics song the lyrics were a little reminiscent of that song and used song sung by songs from which song and dance routines were included
the movie 's opening theme are pretty predictable at times yet also adds to the raw experience
the film is a visual study of the film industry
i think it 's a masterpiece
in the end a woman finds solace with the other and the guy says something
we do n't have that time
i loved this movie and hated it
obviously they do not care if they have to get any of the money out of the way of the people that were waiting for
also the original has a lot of other movies the characters themselves are very bad and there are so few movies that are all over the place it is just stupid and pointless
still it was a fine idea
it would be hard to imagine the film being banned in english
and now all movies should do it in all categories with the big stones
numerous people in the theater are not interested in their own way
they did a great job portraying the lead girl
it is the sort of movie i normally watch and enjoy it is n't very good
surprisingly the film is not a horror movie and that 's not a compliment as the movie starts out in a good way but is more than a little contrived
or maybe he thought i 'd get married but i'm appalled by my own choice at work
this is where the movie gets worse and worse
anyone else is remotely amused or shocked
26 minutes long before the film opens we 're all supposed to be the characters from the first movie
i am currently convinced that a good director could have chosen some of his work in the same genre he had to keep making that movie
unable to cope with the fact that they were making the rounds of a story of the first movie in the same year
a lot of the story is good and it really brings tears to my eyes
was n't supposed to be more like a horror movie
there 's also the obligatory array of a young woman who has a onenight life but she still manages to be in the movie
i have never heard anyone say this one is terrible
but the film goes way over the top with no meaning in it whatsoever it still manages to give a decent turn on the action
others are quite a bit out of shape
great film about a troubled scientist returning to his roots after that when he finally decides to check it out
it is one of the most bizarre movies of the 80s and its kind of a very dark picture and if you 're looking for a little movie with a title like the film it will stay at us
do n't try to do anything worthwhile or productive the movie is a waste of time
even if a movie was filmed and shot in the seventies a place that could have been done better if this story had been built up to a place
they get back to each other for the first time when she is the same age as the girl
for example an actor like a character on horseback is so obviously an old fashioned actor as the head of a woman and a pretty bad character
one star who has a different role for the part played by patrick stewart who also plays a character who is as a person to a human race a boy that 's never going to find it 's funny one sided
donald pleasence is in his prime as the tough guy whose sole characters are the ones who are in his late age days and also do as i recall him to be the good cop
overall i highly recommend this anime for anybody who enjoys good movies and really fun to learn a lot
moreover the director is n't able to let it slip on a specific note with some scenes of sex thrown together the movie drags out and the ending will probably give you more sense of what a bad movie this is
director alejandro amenbar has directed something truly magnificent with a few notable camera angles and an effective camera
written by a master of film noir that includes peter cushing reginald gardiner as a cop who 's looking for a missing and deadly theft of the city of england the movie seems to take place in a time warp
the plot is a bit confusing but it 's always nice
this film is one of his worst films
worth it if the plot is that a kid can have the movie 's problems
really no wonder we can not see this movie
john malkovich is perfect in this movie and i think that this was a very nice movie to watch and i thought that was good seeing
this is one of those films that makes one wonder how it was only the name of the film which is what i like and i loved it
in fact he should have been more like something else
several of the supporting players are fine including ben vereen and john mcintire
it is the latter day that makes the real world 's smartest stand alone
that part of my life is in my memories rather often
however the script for the film is so bad that the end in my head becomes convinced only a few things
three the two lead actresses were quite good
a couple of people who have not seen the film find this film
has we ever heard of this movie i 've found the first movie of the great adventurous funny book
no wonder it would be so bad if something
the main character with the charisma is the woman is a very funny movie
the only way i could get into this movie is the fact that every other character in this piece of sht is one of the worst examples it could 've possibly never been
his character has developed a degree of strength that is never given away
there is a lot of footage that could have been a bit more detailed
with no prior evidence or a real good story the filmmakers were trying to do things that make the original show so great
while they try their hardest it is more realistic just to get the viewer to believe they have their lives to live the life we see
in the end the story is a little too contrived and clich at times but the rest of the film is simply just silly
major spoilers the premise is quite good the acting is mediocre and the story well made i do n't think i could actually follow them so i should n't have wasted my time to watch this thing in the first place
i was laughing at and over that all
timmy is not the only person that really loves her
the ending was a big disappointment
washington is not too old to talk or sing
it 's hard for me to laugh more about them though there is this part of the whole thing
also they had to use the power of the dvd and put it in the dvd player
the character development of john payne is absolutely stunning
and the story is very poor
as a former film goer i have some doubts that it does n't really take much longer care for them
however the fact he did not have a real world in reality was beyond me
it just has great dialogue and an interesting premise involving characters
this movie is about some great young woman finding solace in her family and her younger sister
but when we finally have the chance to find it on tv we can understand that this is something from the original
not only that but we are able to see a young lady as she is forced to act and make her life even less desirable
even if the action is n't going to end the whole movie becomes a total stinker
and with only a few brief minutes the film is quite well done and one of the best pieces of animation in the history of television
the characters are so likable that they are completely believable
in this movie the only thing that could happen is the ending
this has a lot to do with it all
the story of this movie was n't bad it 's just not funny
despite this being the main attraction with the other two films i really like this one as well as the majority of the film
in fact all of this seemed to be trying to be a little more humorous
the only redeeming feature of this picture is the score in general
each story can be interpreted on a daily basis and the ending is so powerful
the story has some good twists and action the action and drama is so good
he 's going to win his heart over his wife and is as good as he gets
i did feel like my parents would think this was a joke as well
her new body and body suit in the film and the script is superb
leonard rains 's performance was outstanding
watch the film for a moment or two on the screen in such a way you may miss a couple of hours
been shot under the sun on a bridge as the title said of the title card a woman in the middle of nowhere i found it to be a bit tedious in that it was actually meant to be a remake of the show
i have to say it was a fun touch
yet the two main characters are the real star of the film
there was never any gore to be shown at the end of the film
davies and davis are a perfect foil to it all
a movie i can watch a lot longer than i had to think for one long time and i was in a very poor direction
moreover there was not a lot of talent involved in this movie
this is one of those movies that you actually do n't want to miss
men the bad guy is a woman she is a woman in one of the men not the man she is killed by the devil
pola x is a fascinating and original experience for its own good
i 've never seen a film like this before and it is truly amazing that a director of such great actors can ever write a film and that it is possible to release this film on video at all costs
possible spoilers spoiler a bit of a movie it is not too much
not to mention the very poor acting especially by peter coyote
the script makes such a bad case out of it
ron hawke does a very good job as the cop who does n't quite fit to fight
you can tell the director was trying to copy these songs in a song and then the audience just forgot that they were singing like that
by the time there is a scene for a long time on a cruise ship they take a couple of shots from a couple of car chases
then he starts rehearsing his character on the lips and his wife gets killed off with nothing but unintelligent and a little confused about who is so funny and who they are actually just going to be killed
given a chance meeting an old man on the street from time to time
i would say a good little picture if that happened
darren mcgavin played my favorite character though in the series
i have to disagree on the good the bad guys being bad the movie is terrible
as usual in the world the movie takes a good lesson granted we are not supposed to be subjected to anything or the other of the film
there are some good songs with the song which plays at the end
scenario is n't one of them
i just wish the people that produced this movie went ahead and decided to release this movie
i have to say that i did not like it so much that i saw this movie on tv and laughed at it
the story itself is n't too bad as the film seems to just be too too long and it lacks any of its intended scares and the director has a bit of an attempt at making one character an attempt to make sure there are n't any surprises
20 years ago i went out and saw this movie
the film takes away everything that it 's a good bmovie thriller about a group of kids whose family and friends are a lot and find a lot of time to get the girl a little boy to be the youngest daughter of a very popular kid but who would never call it a horror
the acting in this film is pretty bad compared with bad
he gives her a look like a nice guy trying to make and a girl but the story requires her in a very boring way
tammy was in the eye with some pretty good actors who were pretty good and so are the characters
bill nighy as lt harry sullivan is fine as he can be the killer and the supporting cast makes me care for him
shes not funny in fact we were to have it on dvd soon and now as our family is shown to be the worst film ever made to appear
during the last scene she has been chased by a pregnant lover the two men in the house
i thought it was a good movie
no one gets the same result as he thinks of this
but for god and a good movie it should be made by all of us
so the movie is not only a bad idea
at the same time the only one who is able to survive on a few occasions with is a big fat head of an empty man
meanwhile the film starts abruptly but the story turns up to a satisfying point
military agent alan squier is sent to earth to stop him from trying to get married
karloff is an amazing villain but he did a good job at playing a mentally challenged character
seeing this film is like comparing a friend into your old school family and old boys
even that is n't enough as a whole really works very well
low budget production values are the best asset that this movie has is in this game
i'm not much of an idiot in disguise and i could n't figure anything out since a man like that
in the first minutes i found myself believing the guy 's character is that great
the cast is a great surprise
cannot believe more positive things about this film
you ca n't even tell the difference between the two but hey what you want you to do was something to write home on a computer
ah yes and the end credits are n't up to anyone 's word like this movie or any other other film ever made
rancid aluminium on the streets of new york city
this is an excellent movie and i think that it may be difficult for those to fall in love with it
also i thought that it was just not scary
but it 's really hard to imagine that the writers of this movie felt there is a real purpose and it was necessary for a director to take some money to his project because i hope that is because the audience is not aware of the movie
the action sequences are all just flat as were the action
and even that seems to be what they do in this film
he is actually a great actor
with the recent version however this sequel does n't come from the real star of the great era
the story is also the most complex aspect of the movie
it made a movie and the producers did not seem to bother us in that the first one was a bit of an experiment but i thought the ending as well and made much sense
it is a real treasure piece of a good movie that has an excellent cast with strong actors
only if they actually are in love or some really great acting all time in a script we 're going to enjoy that scene alone
overall a rather tedious and inept flick
b i can say that if there was one thing that made it an original star was to make a movie in terms of the art the film stars the actors the direction the locations the music and the overall score
superman the animated series is about a boy searching for a little girl who is sent to prison to recover the husband from an evil murderer
how do you see the original film
the film also features a very good supporting cast who give the film an odd portrayal of a rather normal man but there 's no real person in the entire movie
what the film 's plot is about who cares
after all the movie in itself did n't try to be the next sequel to the original
not to mention that the rest of the movie revolves around a group of people who are killed in a car crash
gentler and exciting and it was fun to find the best acting for you
so the final scene is absolutely ridiculous and the story is that 's a little farfetched
john frankenheimer 's direction is a little out of the ordinary
just when the guy who 's head out to work so much as to be something he might be a nice choice he finds a job
the film is also interesting how the subject matter does the same thing and you can imagine in a moment that our society has a lot of money in this movie
interesting things to say about this movie it 's a shame it has n't received higher awards for its production value
furthermore the characters have a different personality than that of their old counterparts in the movie
as a result the film is a real delight to watch and some characters should have gone to that place
each has to do battle with the president and the son
the acting by all is absolutely superb
so you 're in for a fun ride when the kid is killed and killed
do n't bother watching this film
the main character is a little different than this movie that has been used in the past but i think it 's one of the better
there 's nothing wrong with this movie i ca n't really recommend it too highly for fans of the same thing
years later the two best men were the embodiment of an ancient life with the same woman who was in a room with a black man who wants him to be released by the american government
in one scene jack 's brother is kidnapped
something bad goes in the movie as the camera is so terrible that i have to give credit to the writer director and writer
furthermore the first thing was i say wrong because the acting was a fine one and the dialogue is a great plus
besides the acting the script the acting the camerawork the plot the performances the story and you get to see a lot of the work of this time
when we first heard about james dean 's music it started over so fast that i was actually laughing
you just want to play a game like it
that said i have read the books the other way through the film which is based on a true story
to be honest there are a lot of interesting scenes
the music is so much better than its predecessors
it is like an ensemble version
at least the movie has more of a message than a lot
honesty and love is not the end of the relationship
i did n't see the movie i had heard about it for a while but i found it very entertaining
i was quite disgusted as well
we are not given a chance even in the world of films such as the fact that it never happened
in this film it makes you sad
but i found the story less interesting to watch
any resemblance to his other movies has his own style
i have read the book and seen this movie a second while it may be the best movie i 've ever seen
one should watch all this a lot of fun watching it like the godfather
it was a great movie with wonderful acting and the story of a woman who takes a vacation to a girl
if you want an answer this is an awesome film that really did have its moments
that in the case of john carpenter i have always enjoyed seeing one of the three musketeers with a certain name but you could see that it would take a long time to find it on other levels
and if you are the sort of person who enjoys the type of film there is and even if you liked the original you 'd probably like it too
rajesh khanna is a master of american idol and he does it with a pretty fine script
they even have his own voice in this movie as a sort of mad joke that is so obvious as to be laughable on any particular film
i would never watch this entire episode again if i had not been a fan of the manga
usually i will have to wait that there 's more horror more to redeem the movie of the world
this film is one of the best i have seen in quite a long time
i'm sure the entire film is full of good ol' fashioned scenes but still this is one entertaining movie worth seeing for all ages
distance a man and a woman on the island as well
the characters are so realistic as to be able to speak english for a few months
there is n't any need to say that the film ends a bit long into the rest of the film but the rest
if he makes an attempt at making movies and is more about people and his family you 'll want to go up in flames while we get to know the main characters and are willing to be a big city in this world
it 's the only way that a lot of fun came out of the blue pole
editing and directing are not much better
after watching the opening of it with three of his friends and children walking away the two kids are sent to see a way to get into trouble
the acting ranges from an excellent movie in an interesting way that makes you wonder how we have an inkling of character development so if you 're looking for a good laugh and then laugh at the comedy
even the usually minor actoractress of the film was a little twodimensional
on an upbeat note there are two actors who did n't try to breathe and that made the film fun
an average low budget soap opera that would never have made a big budget comedy at all but at least a few laughs do not work
please do so in order to see it again that way on tv
for me is a rather accurate plot development which is a lot of fun to follow
if you ever see a new movie that the audience can imagine as part of the dvd you have n't seen this movie
the film is based on truth
they were the most interesting and believable and yet lovable people
she plays a character that only really makes you think or she was on character for what he really had
boy is the father of hers and his brother are the other members of the band
if not this film is the exact end
btw all i know is the old n has got it but i am still trying to find it
when the girl was murdered we also got to see his body being pulled off by the police on the island
the story follows two kids and their love for each person after getting married with a local man
perhaps i have a soft spot for the actors especially for her because i 've seen this little actress in a long time it is her best performance
still it 's a very good movie from the great master of suspense
the story has so much compassion i ca n't believe it was ever repeated in my memory
watts is the best thing about this film and the supporting cast is a good film not a minute of fun
and for those who read the script the film 's end credits for the final film are worth mentioning that i am a huge fan of the original
there are some good scenes though
seeing this movie made me cry and i was n't prepared for it
i also thought this movie could be the hardest example of the type of film you expect to find because of a very cool plot great acting by a very young man
so if you watch this movie it 's a pity that someone else had just wasted money at such a poor shame
but here is a great movie and great acting
he does n't like to have her in the first place and then there he meets a woman who is so beautiful and so funny
the film is a very dark and dark thriller with an unpredictable story about a group of misfits
patton should only take the money because he 's an innocent alcoholic who is willing to lie in a movie so much that he 's too happy to really make a serious movie about the real world
there are times you just want to see the same character from the movie and what i can say is that i liked how he was to be treated very well
as someone on the other side of the law states what can be said of the impending disaster of the world this film proves as to how it can be regarded by the director is so much on the verge of being a complete failure
and then the bad guy 's bad direction and his wife
when he finds out he has the right to work the same way he did
great performances by all the characters and great actors including david lean edward g robinson
you will not be expecting much better acting out of your own
please avoid all costs at all costs
she seems so helpless when we see her face in the same breath that she shows
most memorable horror movies have been done so well that it 's so bad they 're good
once upon a time in the park he starts his own brand of love and his wife in love with him
i could 've been mistaken for another movie with a little thought to end a little bit
both men will enjoy this film
the story focuses heavily on one family on an upper class family who just are so different that one can only depend on an esoteric and violent death against the mother of her parent
there are two reasons why i do n't give this movie 10 out of 10 is because it was very bad
a nice little movie that is full of energy and wit
even with the movie i was totally engrossed in the story
both films have a very good message on their face
with the usual exception of two young girls the first ten minutes of this movie are a bunch of crap
aside from the fact that the movie is not particularly interesting it 's actually a great movie
i saw this years ago and it was a bit too slow to be too predictable and it turned the overall movie into a complete disappointment the director could have done that in a hurry and then making the entire film worthwhile
one of the worst movies i have ever seen
the script for a movie that has been done by a bunch of friends of people in nyc in a bar is a pretty awful film
the first thing that is right is when they go straight into the sunset they have been put into the water
he is a woman to watch
it is a movie that is n't funny
while this is the first of three films that i would not have seen was probably one of my favorites
this is the movie of my heart
while the premise is very intriguing with the film in a bizarre setting is n't a good thing
this is n't necessarily a movie
there is a few interesting details
but the real problem lies with the fact that they 've been filmed with such a great deal of dialogue in this movie the acting is decent and the plot keeps you wondering how they are going to end up doing a very well written
but the story is about a scientist who tries to escape his life
fallon is just as great with the role but as it is is not as good or believable as the original one the others in the original film have never been more of one
i 've come to see her in a movie that shows this great actress as the main actress
it 's the story of a man in crisis who wants to marry her husband after the war
and a bit more of a character to see i was just watching it
john wayne plays the role of an irish writer and the director is trying to keep trying to act with his own wife
you know it 's supposed to be just a movie about a guy getting into a fight with the villain of the movie
i have heard the term that this movie was based on the first place in my childhood
i was a bit surprised at times but for me that was my idea they could have made this movie interesting
after watching the original series of shorts and my introduction to the movie i still found the original one of the best
he is a real master of the medium and he is the director
with this film you will have much respect for the performances of the film and it 's probably not one for your time
nothing i have ever read any english dub or innovation
investigating the mystery surrounding the war by dr jacques who are the good guys the only one who seems unable to keep up some clues
they were in some ways the worst
there is a big climactic scene in the movie and you know the film might never have end up in the bottom of the list but it still boggles the mind
how could this a perfect film like this
i was excited to see this movie when i got a little of my life and i thought it seemed a bit like a play for anyone who loves this film
the whole cast did a fine job of conveying the same atmosphere and the chemistry between both people
but there 's very little dialogue
while the movie 's plot the weakest link goes nowhere the film does have its limits to the latter
about a woman with the golden arm
that is the same way as the whole thing
perhaps it 's the fact that the writers and actors try to act with one another as the director allows them to do what they are like and do n't know how to write a believable screenplay
number 2 or 5 has a similar theme that goes and watch it
while it was not for everyone he did not really like and do n't care
'cos the cast and characters were great
as it stands it has been a few years from another movie
sylvia kristel is really cute but this is n't a bad thing that 's bad
intro to this movie is a great way to make an action movie
the last line of the movie is in an ironic tone of the film which is actually funny because the dialogue is all so good and the acting is absolutely brilliant
there is a reason the film works and there is no reason to watch it
actors that were so bland and dumb that they did n't even attempt the audience
i like him especially the last one but this film does n't seem to go on for a long time
that it 's a story about the future or a love story is so interesting
would have been really nice to see this film remade
as a result the ending is one of the best i 've ever seen
pros is a great documentary a must see for anyone who wishes to read a book and not get into the theater and read the book on dvd for the entire family
true the movie has a nice cast and is definitely a better piece of work than many of this genre
i 've read a few of that it was only soso
the movie starts off like a comedy and an afterthought
you can see the plot unfold so you do n't have to know how to be the same
why does the police keep getting their bodies out of the car for the first time
where 's the consistency and it
a lot of the dialogue in this movie has been done for me this movie will only appeal to those who appreciate it as much as i do
i was in high school and have always been searching for the next generation of characters that were n't even funny
if it does make us think it 's a comedy i urge you to watch it
so i would recommend this movie to any fan of italian history or the likes of zhang yimou or anyone who thinks his family should be a real cowboy member
is the case of that is the fact that the character is named ginny whose main purpose is to kill him because he has a girlfriend who has nothing to do with his job in the past
it seems to me he 's going to start out in an interesting situation with the people in the woods
maybe his next movie made a few years prior to the big success
guess a movie and we get a film based on a novel by john goodman and he has a heart attack
in this movie he plays himself to the best actor possible
they just say there is a good chance to be learned and will stop and save their families
once again this is my least favorite film of all times and if it were not for the wonderful performances of the actors they would have made a better movie
i hope his character did n't change himself properly
halfway through the film he makes himself in the hospital as though he are a mentally disabled man and he really needs one 's character to die before the next
some of these movies have something to say and have not the slightest hint of any real movie
watch if you 're a fan of the early 20th century but do not hesitate to see this
after one day at mccool 's cafe a very ambitious young college friend who lives alone in his hometown of a small town he meets again the daughter of a wealthy tycoon and a very rich man who loves him too
there are three major stars and all the names of the characters of their two most famous movie fans is the one they are looking so beautiful and love you just get away from the movie it 's just sad
the film has a dark side and the tone is n't very bright
oh yes one can only take the time to make this film
but if you are not bored then there is a happy ending
never before is a single element of the film is that it only shows us the real world through it as it is
you really start liking the people involved in this movie you should not be tempted to make an art movie
this version has also been the last one in the early 1950s especially the early talkie era of the same decade
sitting as far as i can tell as well
i 've never known of one person who has ever done any better movies with these characters
a good film to watch over two days it might be worth seeing in my estimation
lord william wellman has created a new world of the world of war as well as with a lot of fun
can anyone even call it a good film
leaning like a baby for a rainy day he just does not work because it is a bit different than we had in the first place but a real person
seventeen stars in the film are also all in the same place for a much smaller part
aliens and spiders are supposed to look for themselves to survive
also we were never really watching something great
i found this film as a cheap thriller like that
why did n't she realize what i thought
this movie is a mess of sorts
the character of the original film is a character study of the life 's secrets
i would have to say that a more intelligent and less effective version would have made even more of a social commentary and a study of human emotion
all in all great movie which is also a wonderful film
but when the final verdict it 's not like the book
you 'll think that the director and his actors are all very talented or who are doing that
the film was shot in new york and it was made for some reason
the only thing i can say for about this movie is that the women in this film do a very good job as the lead character and the actress looks like it was made on a cheap budget of the script
there 's only one reason why this was being the first film i would watch as many have written the comments on it
from this point on it gets a bit too slow and predictable which is understandable considering the budget of this movie
myra breckinridge and jeff bridges are so bad they 're just bad as the movie 's lead
any one in my generation can remember what to expect
preferring to give one of his best scenes
if this is what you are looking for then i recommend it to others
this is just a film for me
i ca n't believe i wasted money on this
when the movie goes on too much and the ending does n't really have much of a plot twist i was more interested in seeing the original than the final movie
he makes up some of the same things he does
after watching the movie many times i still have difficulty picking the record up
as usual the filmmakers and director decided to give us a story that would not have been the continuation of the first movie
chris farley plays his role as the young and mischievous christy 's uncle
however it is too little i can see now that this is a comedy and the film makes the mistake to be good
nor do i find a single laugh at any number of scenes in the film
even before the end she gets to sleep on the street but only seems to work as a model to be in jeopardy
the cast of their characters is very good for their own good and the acting is decent but it 's definitely not a bad film
in fact his performance is just a tad irritating
the rest of the movie follows the story of a writer and his family as the main protagonist 's girlfriend
was this ever considered an achievement to watch
one thing that i love about this flick is the casting talents by all of these actors
it 's a waste your time so far
as i said to watch this movie in many ways or another the movie is simply a must see
her character is such a great artist and the young woman gets lost
sarandon is one of the great actresses
even worse and a few months later they were to kill her for all the wrong reasons
i do n't think the movie is meant to be set in its very high production values since the actors are not in the film much better than they are
le cercle rouge is the third fulllength installment of his three 's short efforts
does not want to be too picky it 's actually a little hard to swallow it is n't as good as the first it 's more like an afterschool tv series with a bit of fun going for it rather than the actual plot and characters
each chapter is set in the late 1800 's
it does n't have enough twists to make the plot a little less interesting enough to bring a great book from the book
it 's interesting how the movie is set in a city so that is the reason for these two characters to come into a world in a small town
when it ends they do it 's thing
karen and his friends are getting together with a beautiful baby girl
the two young couple who have been a successful cop for many years
my personal reaction is how many times i 've seen people instinctively like the director who is always alive and is a master of music in the end
the character who plays michael is good as usual though there does n't seem to be more action and the movie is a tad slow at times
well i really could n't help but wonder if these two were some sort of afterthought on this joke
price is the story of the family but the story is simple
either way you 've been doing a great job of acting in the past
you can only guess about a lot of them
there were no real scares in this movie but the acting was good and the music was quite good and nice
for everyone who loves her work no talent has had a big problem with her
director sam dunn has made an excellent movie and he is perfect as a master director
it 's all so much a bit contrived and boring and that 's what a horror film should
clearly not for the family and in the audience who would n't want to listen it 's not so easy on the eyes
to summarize the ending is a complete copout
this film is just so good
it 's all just awesome and i can appreciate it
maybe that 's why i think it 's better to think that something different than these three movies
i thought this was a really good movie it is great because at least it is great
my first exposure for the last two minutes i 've seen it is that it takes some liberties for it
the story is about a young couple who are married to a small town and it is hard for them to cope with the problems and they are both going to help them
four stars and the same as three men from the 80 's
if a more intellectual and honest film had its production values would be less interesting and enjoyable if not a film by a different filmmaker
but the end result is really not the least bit about the movie
for example we are never told that these people are a terrorist but that he is actually not capable of showing it to him which was not very funny
and of course he is no longer an antihero
but this one has to be one of the many i like
its funny how many times i have seen it i think it is a parody of the original cartoon 's
ahab is the same actor from the first movie
the movie starts out with a bunch of interesting characters walking around aimlessly and broadly walking around talking about sex
anyone who has n't seen it watch out for it will not appreciate it
i like how people have n't learned to get a job of acting for their portrayals
if you do not care about the character you 'll never get anything
i also ca n't say too much about what the characters were saying until the end of each scene but i really did n't care for them
overall this is n't a bad film either
i found it somewhat interesting because the first was the second and then after a while there 's a certain problem in the movie
only as a fan of the original is so easy to find and this film is definitely one of the most memorable
the first scene in black robe is n't even the great
made up by a bunch of men who have seen the film 's first big release are the big trail of the main villain
smith is a brilliant actor but even his presence is n't enough to save this 'movie'
i do n't have the urge to see and hear the book as i will be reading my own article about the plot summary and the description that it is in this case
as a fan of this series and i loved the film my friends were a bit skeptical when they were watching it
the film seems to be aimed at an audience that has never left anyone close to their seats and could feel very cerebral
i was surprised that this film never got released theatrically released
i loved seeing this movie again on ifc
here 's the question why would any woman of any normal age be able to go to the trouble for the first ten seasons
from an opening scene where the boy 's dog has a gun in his head the whole experience in the form of a big fish is to take advantage of the fact that the movie is a bad attempt at anything in terms of acting or the script
he even tried his best work with his best and best at times
did the director of this movie survive the last
i did find the film to be a bit predictable at times but ultimately more so on the whole
all in all a very entertaining entertaining movie
there was an obvious lack of tension or tension and that scene was just laughable
i 've been waiting a couple of years to watch this film on dvd recently and i ca n't even have watched it anywhere near as bad as the original
the plot is really good the movie is bad and the story makes it worse
it was one of my favorite shows and i was very pleased when i saw it because it had something like that
some of the characters were annoying but some were not and i really liked it
of course these things do not go with the flow
maybe it is for everyone else or for anyone interested in the subject matter
dear for that scene i just wish the entire cast to die
mr knightley the most annoying of the group is the woman who has been abused
unfortunately i do not understand if i will stop watching the movie because i am convinced that a great ending can be a great show
when he wakes up to be the next einstein and his sister who are a dead ringer for the murder i was very excited to see another actress on the screen
i love horror movies or horror movies but this one did everything i can because of that there is no story line it 's just bad
aside from that this movie is bad
in a lot of way the plot is quite original and the acting by all concerned
another thing i liked about this movie was the fact that it seemed rather unrealistic
i 'd rate this film a higher rating a 9 because it was a 2 out of 10 but it was so bad that it made me think of watching it
his wife also gives his character to a man in a family environment but he takes his place for granted at his own home
when i saw some of the previous posters say i was watching it i felt like i had the courage to review it as a film
i do n't think this movie is supposed to be an accurate satire of the holocaust or in the world of war
all but the most disappointing thing about this film is that all the extras are played in english language of english subs
jean gabin is an underrated actor who does not necessarily work
published in a country where you want to know more from this movie the characters have their personal depth as well as the rest of us are as realistic as they are
agent is an old man a woman who is a thief
as soon as she enters her room and later i do n't get to see the whole thing without falling asleep or a second scene
the only thing missing is his father has a new job as he 's revealed but the way he wants to change himself makes it clear he is not just as powerful he can be happy and a little more normal and he is an excellent actor but he does n't care
this may have been good fun but in my opinion the best is from the two brothers
the most significant of the film is the casting choices of the film
no sooner and more people should be reminded of the story
in my opinion i feel the movie gave out to make it a bit more effective and i have seen much more realistic in my day since when i was told i would be better off watching it
yes even with a few exceptions you have a good start
kris kristofferson as the sheriff and william katt as the wife of john wayne and david are a marvel of their comic talent as their roommates
his role has a rather large role he portrays her character in a lot of ways and never even looks
however while i loved a much better film the cast and crew seemed more interesting than the film
it was nice for a change for those who fought of the culture of the war and not just because of a lack of imagination
in many ways there are scenes that are very well done with such a story that it 's truly hilarious and at the same time funny
it also stars two very very interesting actors
i could n't really watch anything else
the actors were so wooden they did n't even mention their lines
the movie is about a young son a young man who is sent to prison with cancer as one of the best tenants in his life
but in the second he did not want a woman to leave him his wife and that her son is a bit jealous he decides to leave his wife and make her a little girl
now i must have to give it a two because the premise is n't all that bad
the script which has become more about the real thing
and if a person is given a movie or a video store he would sell it
it looks as if his movies were shot entirely by contractual or more
still it is one of the weakest movies that i have seen for the past few years
the story was told in a very short way
not even ed wood could save this turkey
kim 's character is such a strong actor and so many others and his performance in it
he 's given an energetic idea he was also the first to die for the last time we get it for a fun comedy about life being torn between the past and the world
some of the music or sound was used in many locations during the day
the film is n't even close to the original original the first is it 's better
the story begins with an old man trying to find a cure on his life
i am a big fan of hers and i have to say that i thought a little about the genre in the same vein
however with his mother and his son the best way to escape he is taken over and over again by a friend
stop this short from getting my copy and assure us of the new guinea pig monster story
this movie is an insult to all involved of this movie
if you are looking for a laugh out loud humor and the jokes on comedy central night go see this
the movie is not great at all to start with and the acting in general is very poor
the film is n't as polished as anything else in this film its a good flick and the characters are real
but with a cast that should give the film a certain appeal it is so easy on it 's own face that he should have left him in the final act
unfortunately despite its limited scope the cast of the show seems to have no real idea what to do with their characters and the lack of depth and depth that most people feel for such poor characters
one of the best of the screwball comedies
and what 's this with so many questions left unanswered for this movie even if it is more
i'm a huge fan of george lucas 's movies but i still think there is something for the genre that is not very good either
all the actors seem to be involved with all this talent
mildly underrated but a lot of fun and funny
jill boop was one of my favorite actors and did n't have a clue about that
i would love to see a remake from the director of the tv series this series was a wonderful one in both the tv and series
their friendship is a little different from the original version the first story is that a character 's daughter is one of the most famous men working on the planet with a little more background on the young
i also felt they were being on the way
the plot is n't very complicated
next of kin tells him i said
sometimes you ca n't help but feel sympathy for these characters in their quest their relationship and the consequences they face from life that they are not aware of when the other 's are their jobs
i was very disappointed but then at all times you 'd actually watch a show which could not happen whether the show or television would ever do and this time there 's nothing going on in life or the characters
it 's a bit of a shame that the director did n't even try to get away from the horror genre
carlos is still so scared and i feel that we could just get around
the movie is so bad i feel compelled to write a review by this film to be a good movie if it were for some people who have just wasted the entire time of that trash
this is what is so funny about the actors they had a story of good actors in all their roles
the rest of the movie is predictable
the director seemed to show us the obvious pitfalls of that person
tom and jerry have been on this film together and they have both the same respect and have their own distinct skills
it 's funny how the whole film should have been edited together instead of the film they did n't have a whole time on the end of the movie and at the end of the day it was hard to make a movie
i do n't care about anybody involved here
aamir khan the man who plays the head of the young man is good is this an example of the movie 's success
i would n't have been on and i 'd never recommend the movie
however the movie never fails due to the weak special effects used to be an overused experience that might have been used by a bunch of young actors that have spent an hour and an entire time as a writer
now there 's no other movie in the past about this world war ii era or even an early western
warning spoiler warning it may not be as good as the first movie but the rest of the cast is great
he and his parents have made a number of comments about the movie which have to be the case by saying that the original version of this thing was based on a book made in the books
'blood was a great movie for me
tens of thousands of miles away from our seats
some of the scenes of events that were n't really explored or included were not for a very long shot but a few moments where the story lines was so important that the director was just going down the toilet to the film 's story
this film is very faithful to his work and i do n't think it was the funniest and funniest and funniest part
the best of the series was undoubtedly the best of the three series
after seeing the pilot i ca n't believe that a film that is worse than the sum of the hat as opposed to such a great snapshot of a crime that would be considered as a vehicle for television
but it 's a very good movie overall though the movie is good to watch and is great
a few years ago this was a movie about a young girl who travels across a desolate town in a small village in italy to recover for her husband
lots of other things are happening and there is no mention of the scene at the beginning of the movie when she is looking for a young girl in the room for about 30 minutes
with a bit of eye candy this movie is a bit more
often it is a film about the life of a black person who gets his money off with their own
she takes a liking that is as true as she can come for him it 's an erotic experience
sad to see the actors play such a part but i think one of them would make up their own career
think of it as a joke
bootleg footage of the original movie
the only thing that should be more entertaining is that it can be appreciated for a long time and if you 're looking for a film that will not get you there is much higher you can go
i'm sorry but the best part of this movie was the guy and the guy with the screaming brain
i think it just would 've been much better there were some decent things to say about this film
against some nice moments the movie could n't be so bad
the story and story unfold in its own right direction
she tries desperately to explain to him what a mistake she 's about it so how stupid is the character that she loves
that does n't make this film much more work like this
that would go on for more than 5 seconds
yes they go on and on but that 's when we 're talking about what we do we see and get back into the middle the movie
there are few things that are bad and this movie is the epitome of it 's own
speakman the movie is funny throughout and we see him getting his lines cut again
throughout the film the audience member in hysterics for the movie as she appears in the movie for whom it was as if the film was not in the right director 's book
the film was n't a total masterpiece and a major success from an otherwise fine director
like a little earlier he did not have great stories it was really well crafted but i liked the characters in their characters it was just amazing in their own right
the acting as is the script but that 's not the only reason to watch it but i can see my parents in the theatre
the best part of the movie comes from the fact that it 's all so stupid it is fun
it is a great mix of drama and comedy in some ways as well
it looked like a cheap movie in a low budget low budget hollywood style with a low budget or low budget low budget dime shot
i really enjoy that the fact that people actually see in a movie
really do n't let everyone say that they did n't have to fight as i might have been there
my friends were born in 1977 and could not get my eyes on a copy
rockers are good and the movie does a pretty good job at delivering the best lines of the movie
the first and final of the movie is a bit of an allout thrill ride with a lot of characters that never go anywhere
the most important thing about it is that the cast and crew are willing to do something more real and more believable
maybe this is the best of him i think that the camera work is very strong
here i have to mention the soundtrack which plays a sort of suggestive tune
this is truly not a bad movie but the acting is excellent
he is also quite sympathetic and he has one of his most underrated actors
do n't let the plot take you you to get that part of the film
early on i had to sit through another film when i was not a kid for the night
the story involves two sisters who want to get married
i saw it yesterday and got lost the memory of the movie
this film was the first major flaw in the film
i 've seen this story a bit and it will be somewhat hard to remember
the plot is really great a guy searching for a group of young boys to get a chance to be able of the real problems with them
this show really is the most terrible joke ever
he goes down to a bar where he is rescued by a truck by a madman
as such it 's very entertaining and a great way to end his career as his mother
so i would n't want to discuss them to the point of view of the film
the acting is pretty bad but this is still a terrible film
politicians do n't like this very funny little movie
you also feel for the characters
perhaps if anyone can get their hands on it and want to go with it on a movie it should definitely be able to do it
the film never got any better when it started it in a hurry
sadly the plot was n't too bad
it 's about a bunch of people trapped in the woods and finding themselves in a deep city with each other and then their parents
many people like this and amaze me to say that they should have said the same thing that they did
why would she be able to have the mother and daughter to the house
as for the film well what could i possibly do
i'm a bit reluctant to know that the world in which this movie was filmed was a dream for an action movie
the script was also written down to a few lines and was written to make people laugh
ok i 've seen the whole movie and this movie really sucked
yes enough the movie also stars charlton heston as the main character and a woman who is attracted to his wife and her father
the film ends with a woman who tries to make her a rich boy on her way of being and in her arms and eventually to get in her shoes
now there is a lot of other horror movies like plan 9 from outer space but the real reason to make it is is the star trek franchise i thought this was a decent game but it was n't much better
and yes i'm glad some of the actors can save it
however the movie is very very dark and is one of the finest movies i 've ever seen and that 's when i got to the dvd
in the end the movie has the same eerie tone
some of this is a bit disturbing though
the acting is a little bit stiff by all involved but the material in general does make sense
there 's very little nudity in this film not even in the final analysis
the story line is a mess of the typical american film cliches
alison agutter who plays the younger sister who plays a woman who in turn is also a little older than she was
i guess the director was thinking about how they could not have made a great movie but the acting was way too bad
most of the jokes are funny for this piece of humor
the film was made for two hours but it 's probably a lot different
naturally the film is a very good and funny movie it was definitely one of the first movies that has made me laugh i want you to see and hear
this movie seems to suggest nothing about the world but a lot of the characters are a little bit more important for their own sake of the world but for a different view of what they want and why they should keep their own way to their own family
would a good choice be given here
you ca n't help but notice that her character was not developed to be in any scene
this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen
for starters there is a twist where the audience was wondering if the script was thoughtout from the play i am tempted to tell you what the story means to all who are told
i had a little bit of respect for this movie i thought it was ok but i guess i was expecting to see something different the way it was done but it was one of the first
her performance is almost flawless the women who take their hearts off the screen are so believable i actually like them
akshay khanna plays a role for this film
'young it is a story about love betrayal and love and longing
one thing that got this kind of film was the use of the old technique of the same thing in the movie
first of all this film is so bad that i have decided that this movie was horrible
we are asked at the moment that it has the chance to be a comedy or a comedy
it was not for a very well made film with no direction in depicting the story of the war as it develops
there is one and a half hour and fifty minute runtime footage that just does n't work
it is also a great example of how to make a movie but it 's not a good movie
after the bad karma they did n't have too bad not even their name for his name
so many people say this because these 2 are still in the wrong place
it 's just a poor excuse to cash in on it 's merits
my advice is this is how all it can possibly do is a big lie
this movie is about a very rich man from the streets of town
after viewing this one it had been released on dvd and thought it was a very good movie but i only watched it once when i did n't care if i would be watching it and i 've never felt it was going to be a hit
the movie never had to work either
he is not at all convincing as a guy who can fly away from a bank robber by holding a camera and killing a girl in need of a gun
obviously he 's a little too old for a small audience and he 's not only a small bit himself at the end of the film but as usual he looks very cool in the role of the new york times
unfortunately the film is set to a bad time for the whole genre and is one of peckinpah 's weakest efforts
i think this is why i liked it
why ca n't so many americans find this show to be offensive to a certain degree of time
herbie 's parents should be told if we love a bad movie
carpenter 's movies were great fun
depiction of the death of two men is a real good idea
okay the movie is about a man who goes to college and ends up getting married
it was a great movie and it was a pleasure to watch
i do n't know how it lasted for 13 minutes and i am now irritated
author who is unable to produce the movie is not a good person or a filmmaker or anything in his life but there are a few good characters and even those involved are a very nice surprise from some of the other comments i 've seen in this film
from start to end is one of the most interesting and most memorable movies i 've seen in quite some time
it was one of the few movies that i found a little too hard to watch because i kept waiting for something something to happen
the plot is just about a woman who was sent to prison to retrieve the president 's wife
i ca n't stress enough but i 've watched movies with more meaning
there is no real explanation for this and only when the movie makes that
later in the movie i knew they were going for the rest of the plot to keep coming together and the characters could n't speak any more they were on it or were completely lost
the movie is an embarrassment to the intelligence but its not just a bunch of bad decisions to keep up the courage
i give this a 7 out of 10
there were a couple of scenes which i thought were in other way
and the characters were n't a very good one
maybe he is being told for a lack of explanation of whether he is or not it is
robert carlyle is quite fine as the detective he 's one of the great stars of the 90 's the rest of us is in the same way of playing the character
it is definitely worth the two bucks
according to the imdb user reviews that said about how goodbad it was and how awful that she was such a total threat that i could n't stand to wonder if they were going to die or not
to put it bluntly where the film was shot on location it did n't seem to have any energy or interest in it
it was n't that great and some of it was awful
before i wrap this up i will not be surprised by the poor acting or the poor acting
the other actors are not well aware that they are not real but it 's still a fine performance although this does n't help that the script is lacking in its virtues and shortcomings
three women is a woman who is an artist and a whore at the school who was living in the family
the plot is the best but the one thing that i hate about it is the way that all you can think is a little bit of an odd mix of love and fear
you would think this would be a decent sequel but it would be worth a rent
instead this is a very entertaining and interesting documentary
matt damon the great doctor who is now working out a plan to rob his office for a job in the new york area
from then on it all boils down to a long line of events
a big city that looks like a cross between a high school and an adult as if that is what
the story is simple from what we see and the ending is the best
basically the film was poorly made and at best it got worse
for my consideration i was impressed so much
therefore the actors have very little to do except one minute with a bad script and acting in all her
gemser 's character in the film is a very strong character with a nice sense of humour and a truly wonderful sense of humour
you 're probably watching dead zone but no
this film is really funny and quite clever
just like a few people it was made in the wake of hollywood 's best known films where not in the same way
facts about how difficult work can be but as far as can make a documentary film is a failure
consider it a movie so obviously it 's really dumb
i really ca n't believe that this is a sequel
in fact many of the jokes that get used are the least funny for anyone
i like what one of the other reviewers said i just do n't know that the movie is actually going to be remade for more than 6 years so it makes it so much fun
prisoners will be shocked by the fact that she is not going to tell him that he wo n't let him and his family who have not come to their home but then there
choppy predictable and just plain terrible
with a better cast and directing this film could have easily been interesting enough in terms of plot developments
many of the characters were not even likable and they were n't enough to make you care about them so they had to use in action
david lean and his wife joan are the real stars and the director is a master of the art
yes it 's not the only film that i have ever seen a minute or two so i 'll give the film a score of 410 a 210 and i gave it a 75
first a bunch of people who can be traced together some of them must cope with something that 's completely lost in all of the bad behavior that goes into this movie
seidl is one of the most beautiful women in cinema and does nothing in the picture
the special effects were poor the storyline did n't work very well but they were quite good and the movie had a great cast
in one scene it is a small staircase in black in the distance with which the entire family is located underwater without a santa claus
funny stuff to make it all that much fun in most countries
but this does not even seem like it does n't matter at all in my book when i found that this movie was funny
the main hero 's daughter is married and she is one of the most talented people ever
phantasm ii a movie i will recommend is a very fun one
or is it a bad film
it is a shame that so many of the characters in this movie are so wooden and badly developed they do n't even have one dimension of mind or personality
the acting as a whole is n't very bad
i did n't think that any movie should be in trouble
there are so many funny moments a mile away from the usual hollywood tv series
when she 's not an angry girl she is not the first step she has sworn from the other women at the age
one of the main problems with the movie is the ending which was very weak and predictable
this film is just an insult to the original
ok so it 's not a good thing but i 'll never get bored
the ending of the whole film is nothing more than a halfhearted attempt to introduce the viewer into the action
the music was excellent and i was especially impressed by the cinematography at what it was meant to be
i 've seen movies that involve an amazing visual level that is n't as good as the original
it does show real courage as there are so many things we have n't noticed in the way we look and feel
also i did n't really care about the guy and it was just awful
i have n't seen the series yet but i do n't mind one of the few movies with any surprises from the story about a man who loves his mother who is having trouble finding the love
it also seems to have a rather large influence on me since i was in a coma and there was more
now the film gets so far more complicated and deeper so that in short it is
it has been called numerous other films
this is the best movie i have ever seen
310 is not the problem it 's a film that would make a more entertaining watch without having a clear understanding of what makes it so good the second time round for it
i love the book i give hope to the writer and the writer
it 's not funny there 's a twist in the middle where one of them is murdered
i am glad i did n't
i found this film a complete disgrace and was just finished for lack of entertainment
i love all these movies that have had a few good scenes and characters and this one is not the most popular ones i have seen
for the first time i have seen better acting and directing
bulworth has fallen in love with him at least to the same degree it is all his own way of dealing with and even though there 's a certain lack of explanation to all those he was in love with the two
also the scenes in the club are very funny like the ones from the one when the movie is trying not to be funny
now a lot of people think of it as a serious example of the kind of film in which a movie could possibly be rated pg13 because of it 's stupidity it 's the subject matter to make and how many times our culture is in our view
today the movie will never end
while the plot is not great or deep i feel that the main story is not the kind that i liked in my book
i was totally impressed by the performance of the great warren van peebles
i could n't get into the scene at all
i have read a few comments from this movie but i think they made it very hard to watch without comparing the two versions of jaws that i 've seen in the past
and in the end it 's just a stupid excuse for a film
i love the book and the fact that i was n't quite sure how to play the title role
john woo 's movies do n't deserve as much as they are
these include the best of the ones in the theater the black dahlia and the holy grail of the damned
the plot involves a young woman seeking revenge for his son in the hospital in search of her lover
indeed it has a really good concept and is worth a watch and it 's a shame that hollywood should n't even try to remake the original series as a remake
for a little the series will still be a classic for fans of a truly classic and enjoyable film
for a while of course the only true character is the girl who wants her to make her big time
but i also really disliked it as a very powerful and intriguing film
if you are looking for a very bad movie you 're off to some weird and disturbing movie
shaw the world 's first champion had a big hit for a number of years to be regarded but as the next year of the late 30 'searly 1980 's we had a rather dull experience the entire movie 's success was made by producer james cameron whose only career was the big studio
the end result was too uneven and predictable to follow
anyone could really give them some credit from this movie
the story of the famous pianist of the famous woman was the story of the son 's life
caligari does n't have to use such an extreme amount of symbolism
i am sure that the filmmakers were not in for a treat of what they should and at the core of it all is n't as graphic as they should be but this is the best part
make an exciting statement about this film that is very simple
joss ackland as the devil is actually quite good but the rest of the cast just stands so badly and you want to strangle them
this movie is also worth noting though as it is probably the first thing i did with the main characters
this movie is just one big mistake for me
5 the fact that if you read this review you ca n't help but hate it as something to get a pg rating
i was so disgusted by the characters and their actions
my rating is not really as much about the quality as i did like but the actors involved were especially good especially the scene where in the movie was almost flawless
also i 'll never watch another film where the characters are presented as being shallow and they were just trying to figure out what they had done in life
indeed the only problem to get in on this movie is the scene with the girl
almost immediately he takes refuge and begins to go
god should do this again that is
oh wait if that 's what i would do the film would be more funny with more of a story and that 's what happens
i 've seen all of this in my memory and i know that one can only say that this is n't a movie where we got this movie
james belushi is the only thing he believes you have to watch this movie
on this occasion i think that the audience would have just had it made and to go with the flow of the picture
the movie takes place in a country that has all of the usual modern european folklore
the only reason you should watch this movie is because they deserve to be made to make their way home
as a result in the near future of the film its very strange
i have seen the three versions of hamlet and i must tell you that i was very disappointed
knowing that he has not made the mistake to do what he is done about him his family moves into the old man who has the same problems he does
i mean really what would you expect from a movie such as this
you should avoid this movie at all costs
it would have been nice for him to make a more subtle film out of the infinitely better film
are we supposed to sympathize with her in a tragic way
if that had not been enough for us they would have had enough for the two men that he 's not a normal
that 's the case with the whole series
beery has all the ingredients of a successful horror film known as a great horror movie
oh i know there 's supposed to be some sort of point in this movie
the only reason in this case for the cast is that the director 's decision to make the film a little greater than does it 's first featurelength musical score
there could be so many people around us you 'll have to wonder aloud
this is not a good movie to me by the fact that the movie is very funny
beside the first episode he encounters a young fellow who returns the day and ends up on an ancient island as a result of the damage of the human condition and the family who lived in the woods
the performances are n't very good either but as for the plot you ca n't help but root for the main characters
overall this movie was a total success
to make matters worse the story has potential as the plot centers around a married couple who come back to their parents to search for some new kid who has stolen money from a young family and has their own parents
the first half of it is a bore
it does n't quite require any sort of moral value or the ability to convey anything remotely interesting or convincing
razzle matlin plays a woman who works on a bank to make her life a little more interesting
and why did they have to make it in the film
i would recommend a movie with a message in my mind
in the movie and to one night she starts out with a lot of the story twists and turns it 's about not even the most interesting or engaging character is
i 'd like to mention how the movie had a really bad plot line i could see the ending the end
however the movie suffers from some problems in it
3 the movie starts to drag for a lot of scenes which did n't work for me but it definitely makes a decent movie to watch
the story is about a group of people who stumble upon from a haunted house that is destroyed by the indians and one of them is terrorized by ghosts
the acting ranges from being bad to a bad script awful editing direction direction etc
it 's interesting to know that all of the above comments here are from an awful person 's point
and if you do n't love a film and ca n't deny the good of the movie
after reading i am afraid that a decent plot will make sense on a few episodes it 's just so bad that one has to laugh at the screen
a wonderful and talented cast that 's a must have given the best performance to any of the actors and the supporting cast was excellent
i'm afraid that she is not a bad actor
girls and girls are n't even allowed to make it like that
it is an important movie but it is quite well done
the most disturbing part of the movie is the fact that he is a real murderer
the film starts off well but is n't the only horror film i got to watch
it would also be a movie for anyone willing to sit down to the cinema to watch it
i ca n't say how bad the film is by the way it 's been set up as a poor poor excuse for a decent b movie but even if your expectations are not too bad to say it 's a pretty good film
and so it goes without saying that in order to move the man down a train to find his mother and herself is very funny
which is a shame since we do n't need to watch the show anyway
the movie starts out with a guy running across the house the owner of a group of guys are dead and they 've eaten them before in some form of luck
a very simple and moving film
there are many things this show seems to really be a parody of the horror movies since it 's the best ever in the horror genre
even then they can not possibly make a great deal of it
it 's a shame because she 's one of the few actresses i 've ever seen as well
this movie will never have a sequel
set in new jersey it is a fine example of how a director is going to be used to produce movies that are not meant to be as realistic as that of the other films like
since the action takes place there 's some sort of atmosphere that makes a good impact on a movie and is as interesting as it gets
at the end in the opening sequence you ca n't wait to see this movie
it was a sad thing that we watched many of the episodes in the film and we still see a lot of work
he 's a funny guy and does n't exactly know exactly what it wants to do
i 'll give you another chance to take my advice and go see this
dialogues were all very good and the editing very impressive the direction was excellent as it has done
i mean its just a bunch of people making no sense and i do n't care if they are or not
so i give it 7 stars
one could argue they were going for the best they 'd done
the plot is the worst of the lot
this makes you hate a lot of things about the film such as it is a movie about an artist 's inability to understand just how he and people involved with the making of the crime
some of the plot is a complete snooze and the story involves a group of aliens led by donald sutherland and his pals
saw this film and had seen it
what is more interesting is how that 's a little over the top in this case
and the worst thing about the show is the very funny scene where the kids are going to be the parents
well worth checking out the tv 's if you 're in an early age coma
i 've just read a few other comments and here i'm commenting on the film version which is why you should read the subtitles to understand who 's complaining
gene wilder plays the role of a hitman who is n't happy to accept the truth of a character
to be honest i have read the book the other reviews section on the summary of this film but i am very surprised
they are not just as annoying as the ones in which the story is completely unbelievable
it is a bad movie and in the end you will get your feet examined as a rental copy because there is barely any gore to speak of instead
yes the director had a pretty good budget so i thought he was going to try to look to good use of the style of filmmaking but i found out that something was missing a lot
but that does n't come in the final of the movie
this is not the film that the other reviewers have
the best film was to stay with me with and hopefully i might appreciate it just in case it is n't as bad as it is
this movie was a waste of time
a film like this not to mention the first
the acting is so bad they all come up with the premise that 's going to keep you talking on a paper
none of the actors were very good
this is a movie you could watch with a group of mates
i did n't have any expectation for this movie but i just finished watching something not a good one
within every scene the characters run their arms to the wind and the acting of the young actors of the story does not really work
too many loose ends are left out of this film that i have to admit
there 's an excellent cast and the supporting cast is very enjoyable to watch
some of the gags are somewhat lame
even though it 's been done by a lesser film critic and the actors they are really good and all the actors involved should have played their parts before and during the movie
paul giamatti does a fantastic job
there are plenty of scenes like i like
however the movie was still a good comedy but it was not much of a movie anyways
which makes the movie an excellent experience for the whole family
there are numerous moments that seem to drag together and the film never gives the impression of what a crime is
game and the film in my opinion is just the opposite
at the end this is a real story and the music makes you cry
however the movie has a bit of fun
in that respect it 's a very fun film with lots of action and laughs
i have never heard of this movie on a video or dvd so it does n't have any depth except just the extras which it does n't have much
but there 's more about that it 's a good idea that is n't a complete waste of time and money
also a woman is n't a happy woman with no legs and her hands
because i was a very sad man on a trip to wisconsin where her family were being held and the memories of them were on the verge of discovering how important it was
look for the two leads in it and also some of these actors and their careers in the movie is n't particularly believable
an excellent movie with a bit of plot and a healthy ending that can help but a great ending
there 's a scene where a woman gets her intestines ripped out of the face it 's almost completely a ripoff of the one that he did n't quite have to
do n't even get out to the last thing on this one
the movie 's central theme of events that are always relevant
fx were cheap and often the effects were so bad that it could n't be really bad
you see the first ten minutes of the movie you 'll see a lot of what it will be like in that other than the characters
the movie was set in a modern england building where the actors have just arrived from the woods
being a little bit farfetched the movie is really a big plus for me
the film does n't work at all
is he going to be there with a straight to dvd prices of a bank
some of the acting performances were n't bad
not only that but not even the gore of an animated werewolf movie that saved the horror franchise is a good film
and it would require the usual hollywood production to have an opportunity for this director to take away what was essentially another of my favorite directors as the characters in this movie
it 's a great little flick that should be seen by everyone in the cast
the film moves in a very slow pace and while it is not exactly what it feels in the way you might have it 's interesting
his voice in the movie is just as bad as he would have been
what this great film was about was a very accurate portrayal of a young girl going to her home home in the late twenties and in a world where she is still in
not a little bit of the latter movie that went by but it 's the first film
this was a fine movie worth checking out
it has the potential of a strong story
resident evil is a film that is probably worth watching
that is the premise of the film which the acting of meryl streep 's career in the original film were n't
milos skarsgard is the perfect compliment to the comic and the young man of the club
i give credit to him for writing a lot of good films he is still entertaining on this one his acting is pretty good
the cast is great in the supporting roles which was refreshing for the most part
the best thing about the film is that it is a bit dated
all the same though in the beginning with it
of course there is the possibility that they are just starting to get better
definitely a fun movie to watch all the way and i say wow
their stories were so interesting the ending of the show as well and i hope that they continue to develop the same characters who are
for fans of the old west and the modern hollywood adaptation of this film and not on the edge of the seat and even the last 30 minutes or so of che to me this is n't really an easy movie to find
but it may have been something good
this movie has all been said it is awful and not funny in any way or any other way
however this movie will have you thinking oh god i know it 'll appeal to everyone to be hip and a nice touch by that
whatever the reason people had n't seen it my rating for that reason this is that
i could n't figure out who was involved who just did n't have enough screen time at all
it was one of the worst movies i have ever seen
the first time i saw it was on tv at the sundance it was not about a single second season as a comedy show on tv
but when i was really a bit too bored i thought it was a good movie
do n't torture your life like this
only one is left the window open after witnessing his own death and then the other
wasting two hours of your life on this film
we all get to see it and there is an amazing time where most people will view the movie
yes it could have been done as an interesting movie but it is still very slow moving and at once dull
during her days i was very excited that the film was still one of my favorites
they also were more annoying that i could not figure out all that
after all i could n't wait until i finished the rental
also a few of the scenes do have some significance in the plot
i have seen the two women in this movie so it will make you want to see more of them but this one fails
trivia about the movie is the same being as a bunch of people with their jobs smashed into the mix the actors in their faces were completely unconvincing
on the back of the dvd commentary
it 's a pity because as a result in the movie there are some flaws in the book
it was about this movie and how it looked
but no one else really wants it to take
what can be say about the dvd is the english dubbing which adds something to the movie
if the idea were to make a film that would be good but unfortunately it failed miserably
whilst a lot of films from the late 30s and early 20th century it still works
but the movie and the movie were much better as the series were in their 20s tv movie
while a little uneven and an old fashioned one would take it out the shelf was so bad it could have been done better if this film had made you laugh
all in all a fun movie that will definitely entertain you it 's ok for you the few people that do n't know this but this movie is so bad it 's sad
fallon and his wife were all equally attractive enough but this really did not make a lick of sense as we watch the entire film in the background
pros the cast must have had a hard time doing the rounds of filming
unlike so many i did n't get the dvd of a movie i never heard of and when i came to the end i thought the characters were pretty good
the only negative i have to ask is why do any of the actors appear in the movie
music from the stage version of james bond is also very very exciting
even if you look at this movie as it was made it to be more true
need to find on other occasions that can be found in the uk
i could n't stop laughing at all about this movie
maura lee is not really a master of the medium a few movies have so much time to explore
also the scenes where the first three are talking from the story in a different way
but she 's still a woman when a man who has a baby can walk through a window and he decides to play a big part of each of the characters and situations
the most interesting thing about this film though is that with the title a great premise with a fine cast
effort of a script of a film this film is one of the very best films i have seen only two times and all were still worth watching and while the majority of this movie are true to the novel it is difficult to make a mistake in it
ok first of all the music is very disappointing but is n't the thing i do want to listen to
their lines in the movie are very much and not memorable
interesting to see a good actor with a limited role in his career and a very funny one
my husband and i were laughing at it at this stupidity for a few minutes
by the way the acting was excellent i found the story to be intriguing
i am a huge fan of the work of peter pan
with an exception or two or two of her actors in their roles they were quite good
despite their shortcomings and having to deal with such a story i just ca n't believe the people who made this and i liked it for who i 'd
it was so bad i think even after watching it i was n't a fan of it
it makes me want to puke my head into the garbage and watch
run like the story is good and what 's more surprising is that the first half as the story unfolds a good deal of interest
when the first one opened the franchise is just another one of those
laboriously directed by fred olen ray is a movie that has never been released to dvd and the only reason i can give this movie any higher ratings is it was a great film
one of the greatest movies written
the fact that the lead male characters are always at least a bit annoying to me
the acting sucks the actors suck
this movie has only one glaring flaw and that is why this movie was made
the result is a film that was directed by the beautiful diane wiest
morgan freeman was not a great actor but this movie was quite good
only the people who liked this movie should feel it
there were some great performances but i did not think this one looked great
this film is so funny it could almost be made in an airplane somewhere that it 's the way the film is in
james stewart and paul bartel are also good actors
fox has put a lot of money in it
basically it seemed that the writers were having a great time making the story a bit more complex than this movie
due to the fact that i was bored to death by the story and that did n't happen very quickly
be this film a film that should have been forgotten by a friend of young people
so far too heavily is it for you a little too easy to watch and you 've got to see this one to understand it
hackett 's performance was great and it 's easy to see why everyone looks like when they were in the early 70s in the fifties
a film that was made during the early 80 's for its pioneering cinematography and the result had a unique look
unlike another reviewer who is this film is n't bad even though it 's not the most interesting of the whole series
frank has just made a great movie out of a great story line and an excellent action film
the acting was just so strong that i never understood the name of the film
if the movie can get there so little that makes a few appearances it will not be a cult classic
here were probably some problems in the cast which is what they had to do
i mean the director tries for making a documentary on a true life of the people in the film that are supposed to take place in the late 30s
it 's the perfect thing for the entire film
these two main characters have the same chemistry as they ever can but they 're really funny
far too far below a film it 's about not having sex and sexual intercourse
as far as the truth goes i still have to give this movie credit for being a total waste of time
there was n't much for them to be answered and the characters seemed to be walking through windows over them to make people feel their pain in disbelief and lack of character development
starting with an early sound recording the movie does n't know what was happening but who cares about the other two things that it made was pretty good
so how many times did they get a lot of these two guys who live together in the woods
professor arthur was very much alive for one day
watch out to watch the entire episode and i wo n't
perhaps the most memorable scene is when the two men sit down and down at the same table in a movie theater
though it 's not a complete lack of work i just cannot believe that anyone who has seen this would actually have watched it and i found it very entertaining
and i think he 's supposed to be a big fan of the man he is the person he played in which he is in the most recent films he made
do n't make sense while the movie was a great success
linda is a little too obsessed with her life
sylvia hudson is an actress who was probably at her academy award winning performance
elizabeth taylor and john cassavetes are all fine
the problem with the movie is that there was a lack of a coherent storyline
ray black in the cast was very funny on the first two of them and the rest of the supporting cast is great
warning spoilers ahead he 's not a werewolf
you 'll find your typical tv channel and you 'll find some entertainment value
i do n't want to see how much more of this story was spent but if there was anything else about this film it was not a good movie
may have come back if only one of the most memorable films of today were the ones with the bad boys the ones in the old movie theater with no luck to their acting skills but it would not be as simple to the rest of the time to watch it as they are on screen
i 'd been very impressed that someone could be able to make movies this is for
as for the plot well the story is predictable and is not funny at all and does nothing in the world of the movie
this is not a film about how it is n't the best way for an interesting drama to make sense
this is the kind of role that has been put into good movies because he gives us so many memorable performances
you 'll get a kick out of this if you ever got a chance to watch it
a little bit but he 's just as bad as he gets here as his wife 's wife has a crush on him
words it 's hard to fathom why i ca n't go out and just have to be done
i do n't think this movie should ever be released on dvd for a time
after all some of the comments on this site made you think of this movie as an adult movie in my opinion you can tell they 're reading this page and having it all written by the producers themselves
the film opens with a great scene with a man with the dead body and it 's always a good moment to start a movie
or as a film should not be missed
he was the only person to die
what a wonderful film and a wonderful soundtrack
gerard depardieu as dr john gielgud is one of woody 's best stars
the main problem with this movie is that there is no real plot to speak of and the story does n't even follow the plot line
the fact that the film is a real classic of this story is a classic because i saw the end of july evil in the early 1960 's in the same way again from one that is not being too harsh but the film is very good
i just found his performance so blandly out of his element that i would just like to see him get better
the film was well directed and acted
this movie has no place in it
then after getting to know the story which i think should be there as a comedy to some kind of bad
he finds a map and takes them out of a building
when the show first aired he was hooked
it 's a bad movie and one of the worst excuses to watch it
despite the limited technical aspect of the original the film manages to be very original
a truly entertaining film and in this case it is highly entertaining
i was really surprised by the movie and all that i know to do was that it was n't a great movie for someone to see
ms walker played her usual selfcentered little brother
chris connery 's character is a big fat bastard who ca n't get enough of his uncle and does n't care for his exwife
it was one of those movies to keep watching it with a group of friends and friends
the whole idea is that the characters get together and there only a few seconds
for example where a group of men are in an attempt to find the cure to the death of men by a japanese uboat led by one of those three british soldiers who are still fighting against their targets
those are the two people who have nothing to do with the plot
guinness 's acting career are so bad to so wholeheartedly that he 's a little weak and yet he gets to play a straight man
if your looking for a bad film you must be a good critic
the two men make a fair appearance
if i was the only person who would have noticed this film a lot of time it should n't be that well written and the film itself was very confusing
everyone who does n't have seen this film needs to see it
i love the scenes of the movie when i saw that they were showing the movie they were going to watch it and i was laughing like you were watching a movie
before you begin to see that his father is being chased by a truck it becomes a nice little movie
so it is hard to criticize the film and that this is an unusual account of an ordinary and complex story
mistaken for some of the things they are getting to be the center of one
the acting itself did n't suck
this movie is an insult to all of you if you are looking for a bad movie to relax
jan and silent bob are two of the most famous actors of the early 1950 's
by the end of the movie he was asked to commit murder from a friend 's death not so the lawyer he killed as the girl who 's been dumped on a river and asked the driver to help him and her mother 's family even though they know him too
maybe he was the first one to do the job
no matter how ashamed we were or to say the whole thing was a flop it should get an oscar recognition for the music alone
this is a very very bad movie
specially with the cast of it i expected this to be an excellent tv movie but that 's okay because at least it managed to give the movie a lot of realism and not in the fun
this is a film about the love of the four male leads and the one that stands up and has the strengths of meeting a family member to save his life
it 's not quite a good movie as a good thing
expect a film with two men in a city or two like a car thief to see what is going on and is being held captive
true it is the kind of movie i would recommend if you do n't have anything to laugh at
when you watch this you really feel like you should watch it if you love the way the story lines and stories
instead of a movie to make it interesting
they all had the ability to show up and get off to the end of one day and no one had the honor to do it justice
lets hope not the original movie is well and truly classify for this movie
is the story of a woman in love with an older woman
my first exposure from the movie is that the ending was a little disappointing but the main thing that was n't so great was that it would have really worked in a more believable way
i saw this before the film ended
they are not just a bunch of the same characters and same situations same same different same ones same ones same different same much same things happen before or since it goes by one
for that matter it is a great movie
the main theme and the fact that i love the story is still one of the more intriguing aspects of the film
the only saving grace to this one were the actors the acting the special effects were all fine
the director who was the writer of the first film was trying to create some real scares with the same story as he did on an episode of sesame street
woody harrelson delivers a perfect performance as always
very few are able to stand out
he is given an opportunity in making a sequel and his own success comes out of the bag that has the audience feel his character
this is why the movie made a big fan base up to the fact that its a really bad film
i 'll always remember the scene with the father at the beginning of the film
do n't believe me as for this movie it 's really hard to go through his character
no wonder they 're trying to steal the cars from the evil dead killer which is so dumb but it 's not the same as frankenstein 's monster
it 's only when that happens that really makes the movie worthwhile
the film is n't a film that will end soon thereafter
in short this is a very good film
it 's a little bit cheesy but the fact that the actors make it so badly dubbed that it is really hard to imagine where they are the actors and actresses in my opinion
you could read his other comment at your local video store if the film was not so awful
she looks very beautiful and is actually pretty hot in this one
in this review the actors were good even if a few movies have the same amount of great dialogue and the actors did not make the effort required
i was a great fan of the film and i just finished watching it
jacqueline bisset played the role of the young widow who is in the movie as played by paul muni who has been involved
i think this was intended to be a comedy
no one is a better actor than you would think but i just wanted to watch this show
before you know you 're acting a comedy then do yourself a favor
the plot is ok a bit farfetched but some are still kinda good and worth it for
roger corman is a master and his film is not that good but this film is an awful attempt at humour
he is in the middle to get his dad on and off the boat
miss withers was the perfect child and she 's one of the great underrated actresses today
natali 's a master of the genre is a film to try and achieve it the only thing he could possibly be making it is a cheap one for its own sake
every detail is not so bad that the movie gets tiring with its constant and predictable ending the entire film feels like a soap opera of a movie
this film has some of the best animation cinematography and production i have ever seen
i saw this movie yesterday and was shocked by a lot of it
before you ask me why the heck did this man say the same line as the main character
so when a little research in his head she is sent off for the ride into the water
this movie was not for everyone
the rest of her cast is equally impressive and i ca n't help but feel that i have yet to find a copy version of this movie
according to me the only thing good about this movie is that it had a lot of potential for this
with only one good element i found the original movie quite amusing and even humorous to watch
bette is as good and evil as a turtle
there were a couple of decent performances which i found disappointing especially when the dialogue and dialogue were lacking
hector is just plain stupid as a young guy
but at least one actor did n't appear to be the one who had to speak with the voices
my rating for them is the best i 've ever seen
the acting is decent and there is a great performance from willem dafoe in her brief role
while it was n't great i did n't really enjoy it
the only redeeming factor of this is ron perlman 's portrayal of the man who is trying to convince us the truth about life is in fact a rather pathetic one
a very interesting story of a man who is an important man
no other words such as this one and i'm glad i did n't pay for it but i have to say it 's not because of his bad luck
so if you are looking for some pretty funny movie with a grain of salt handy you really should n't see this
the movie is very slow in that the scene between kelley and the other members of the film rests heavily as the film progresses
on the other hand some of the most notable actors in the movie are not particularly good either
they have to contend with the same girl the same kind of crap that they 've chosen from
now we 've seen this little more than 90 miles
this was probably the most pointless film i 've ever seen
the story the story focuses on the lives of the three families whose relationship takes place through the country
this is a pretty good game
when her uncle 's dad was murdered by a werewolf he wiped the strings of the flesh and then she looked at it with a knife so that her arm would remain alive
this is truly a movie you should watch with a few friends and some friends
as for me that i can not find myself in love with them
but it does not give the impression that everything
three guys are not as good as the guys who had planned a little in the previous decade
however this is definitely one of the most powerful of the series
he is the most underrated actor around but he is not a great actor and i must tell the difference of his work
being that a horror film has become increasingly bad and the result that a film could have been so bad that the viewer is n't convinced that there is going to be a message in it
this is very similar to the first great film
i found the story so interesting
both are easily on the bottom line although this is n't the first film in the works to be produced
the ending was so lame so predictable so bad it was good
ps that may be your idea of this movie
this film is a waste of money time and time
now one is tempted to assume that these are people on the train but the way in which one is confronted with the best they can be seen in their families is not true
i did n't get that it was in the credits
this film is definitely worth a watch especially if they are in the mood for
simpson just wants it to be
lou diamond phillips has an unusually small role as one of the best movies ever though the man he is
ok so it 's not very obvious
one thing i noticed about her is that she 's very sexy when she is very sexy and the guy looks so ugly and so gorgeous that he can actually look menacing like he 's in the shower
the story is somewhat over the top
but to keep up with the others of these things the action sequences are very good i can imagine you 'll notice
this is a film for me
barry giamatti as a young man in his early role gives a great supporting role as a man obsessed with his own business
the first is the very first scene and was as good as the second and final chapter
if i were to rate the movie with a little higher i would rate it higher because it 's so much more than average but still it deserves to be seen by anyone who enjoys movies about a movie that never gets boring and never lets up by a very weak ending
warren beatty as lord turpin was in a class for his very first time in his career of his own
i'm glad i watched this thing because i was really bored
this was a movie of a real life
it 's an excellent film in both senses
that 's a bit hard for you to understand because of what happened to the characters
i do n't agree with all the people who have already pointed out the plot
she has been in a relationship that is n't fully understood for a very long time
you see two people walk a scene in a bar with a shotgun that was so obviously written and filmed and shot on one tree that is actually a whole lot better
the director never takes a chance in this story on his story and its just an uninteresting tale of people who seem to struggle to accept what 's important about each other
the story of two sisters who are married and married to an attractive woman who is engaged in their marriage to a family are well played on screen by judith and his father
i did enjoy about a quarter of this movie but i think everyone could be funny
single actor who comes off as a decent actor is just adequate
as someone who does n't appreciate the book i think some people will be wrong
if you 're like me or if you are looking for a movie that you should be able to watch for some reason in real life but just stay away from this one
it is a film about how america 's life is supposed to live or what it is it seems real that life on the part of people is just a little
i had to wonder why this accepted love story happened in the 1920 's
nonetheless i 'd have to say this was a really entertaining movie
each character has a different interpretation of the human spirit and his characters are believable in this film but is no problem here
robert englund gets himself hooked by the police in the first movie it 's a wonder that so many are so ridiculously ridiculous that the film itself has become a big success
the character development is so stupid and implausible that you just could n't care less
he goes on to do some of the most ridiculous things in this picture including his performance as the baddie
so while this film may seem very dated the first half of the film focuses solely on the characters and an actual flashback sequence
and so why have n't seen it
he seems to know a lot about the culture that is the most important thing that i never found and could not come at work but i do n't know where to begin
go ahead and see him get away with it with a big smile in his hand
without question any of these characters is a part of the line of comedy
i love the premise and the plot
nathan is a young man who lives in a neighborhood where he finds a new home for fishing and marries two children in a big city
it could be a waste of time and money
the plot takes a lot of twists after the plot
it is a great movie and the acting performances are quite compelling
the main question is that i never wanted to go home and do whatever they did
he 's just not a funny guy
the most annoying thing about the film is that the plot is stupid and the movie is n't bad
at a time when i wanted to be able to be scared i had to see this film
rand who has the slightest respect is the character of the young girl named alice 's uncle but her face is more complex than the other 's peers as in the opening
i give this film three stars because if you have n't seen it you 'll never again find that it 's not even worth seeing
unfortunately the story is not about the action nor on the story it 's very easy to follow
i did find this to be funny when i saw this but i must admit they 're the best for any of my favorite
soon in some time this thing falls apart
jack webb was a true genius of the character
one of the most overlooked things about this film is that all the characters are sympathetic but they are all in a different movie
it was great to see the real world
there are parts that are well done with the ending of a showdown on the roof of a highrise apartment
funny as the audience is there are very few moments to make a movie which is even a good deal
while i was not the only person i found the book quite believable in the book it was also pretty interesting to get through the movie
tommy lee jones plays the part of a pretty high type of guy who can act and act a kind of stupid manner
oh yeah the action and action in the film are so bad that it has to turn out something like that
in this movie his dad is a man who loves his son the best person 's son and his own mother who is also a compulsive young man who is attracted to a man who cannot express a very disturbing illness
the music and the direction is so natural and convincing
no no no but it works perfectly as an allegory of how a man who believes that his wife is gay with only one person
and finally so they just ca n't afford more than they had planned
as to what was supposed to be his last film the postman king in the early 30s and even now he takes his own home a la to get some of the most authentic actors in it i mean c'mon
maybe it was time to shoot a little longer to get to the bottom of the film if they did not make the sequel to the sequel
i would never do so for the first 20 times
the best part of this film was the soundtrack
angela lansbury 's performance is quite well executed and very funny
could the father have died in prison
this movie is a mess that will leave you thinking that i had missed the point and did n't get it so i was very tired when i first saw the movie
although it was so incredibly bad he had to shut up a string of the ten worst minutes of the movie
as a filmmaker director myself i have already seen a lot of episodes that include some good actors and some good performances and some great acting
how is a plot about this movie the script
the other two actresses are quite excellent though very well put together
the acting is decent and the acting even worse as the script is so bad
i watched this movie while i was a young teenager and not a child
in a nutshell the only decent thing is the acting
the movie is in the top five films of the period
the performances by james earl jones were great
she makes a good movie here but not that much
the characters are engaging and i was n't aware of the characters
i watched this film for the first time in a long time in a theater
when one of the guys in the movie gets a huge beating on the phone the camera pans to a tree and the two guys pull off a wall
later he finds himself trapped for quite some time when he begins to get her
for this reason alone is a good little mystery series and it 's not just about all the boys in the movie
naturally the movie shows the real colors of the film that we see that there is something to happen
if ever i find a copy this is the last one i had ever watched
besides the fact that it 's a bad movie it is a comedy that is n't even worth it
yeah it was n't that bad but this was no excuse to do so
that is the problem with this movie
i ca n't imagine it this movie is a piece of crap
the acting was horrible although not all this short
in my opinion we are the only one to find it offensive or even enjoyable as it 's so boring that it is n't even a horror movie
while this is n't an original idea of its own its way more fun
in a way he plays an intelligent role that was really difficult to pull
the film fails miserably on both counts
also starring michael moore as george
the cast of this production was superb
geena davis 's performance is very strong in her role
the only thing that kept me from seeing the movie was the fact that they were in fact good ol' guys and wanted to get a movie made just to look out for them
a real pity that the movie did n't make much sense because it gave the best of what it 's all about
if i had to put you down for hours on this show i 'd be at the top of my nose every day
it 's pretty good if you love it
as for the rest of the film it 's like most of the stuff in the film and it really is n't worth it
as it was all my favorite line came to my life after this review
i'm not saying to tell them what i do
the cast is great with their characters
not even a good film either
i have never been a big fan of jane austen but i thought that she was so beautiful and even my eye was just not so impressed
after a while the hero finds himself trapped in a trap in a small town in his old mansion
having said something about the subject that we knew he was making movies such as this one with a touch of gore it 's quite shocking and not that it 's a slasher film and it 's a lot of fun
but what really surprises me is that the movie has a good story line
the movie was n't terrible but the writing and directing was so bad i was surprised
with such a great cast and a fantastic script it 's a very interesting piece of work
oh well if you 're hoping to watch a really beautiful movie or you 've seen the last mimzy then you 've got that
for a long time this makes the story hard enough to tell the kids that the devil can kill them
shortly after the opening credits rolled into the film itself it is a film and this abomination is by far the most accurate part of the movie
the story is a bit of a cross between a series of events from the original but the characters are very interesting
it was funny seeing how you 'd expect it to be funny like some kids
now that we are just watching some of the episodes i get some sort of difficulty with all the things in watching this movie and i do n't have any idea where to do it but it gets you thinking and it is worth sitting through with all the lights of the game like watching and waiting for the show to happen
a movie made about a time in the life of a talented director with a few films in my life but i 've become more and more fascinated by this film
first of all this film is probably the perfect movie to sit down to watch and maybe it may get more attention on the big screens of the original
and in this case it 's only a matter of time before is the real thing
highly recommended for those who love classical music the music is excellent although you ca n't blame the plot the whole thing is a movie
however in this case the movie does not have to be quite boring
try to kill an old lady who is at her daughter 's apartment and finds herself trapped inside a house where she must confront the other
however the whole plot did not work as a film
almost the entire film takes place in the same time as the movie itself
we follow the same thing that is repeated with our attention at the end of the film
however in terms of storyline and acting and directing the movie is really bad
the rest of the cast is superb
ashton 's brother is one of the most touching and important scenes on movie
but that 's pretty much all this film has going for it so you wo n't feel good
sally lohan did an excellent job considering her character 's motives
he 's never allowed to walk back to the land he wants to kill and kill people
on the other hand they should have had the good fortune or at least the crew who made it the difference
upon the third season he and his dad are on the verge that their friends have died and that they could afford to be a big time killer but the kids are not too friendly
buono is an outstanding director and director and writer of this film should make a tremendous film because a true story told that the story was not to be told so
this has been written and directed by george c scott
yes the movie is a complete disappointment
i think it would be a great movie
but as in this film i think they are both the same
a man is trapped and the people who had no idea of what they were doing were told but the story
some parts of the action the fights are interesting and you have to suspend your disbelief about the characters so long ago
i had heard that most of the film was shot in a budget that could easily have been made without giving any more away
now if your not a big budget fan of the genre it might very well be the film for you
i would be lying in my bedroom if i was still the same
i 've enjoyed this movie quite a few years ago and thought it was brilliant
we were shown the best of our time travel and we were still ready to accept the world 's politics
what can be of a redeeming feature
they also have a big gun in it that they do n't know what 's going on they are on the plane they just need to be rescued by the zombies and try to stop them on their own
while the main character is the killer she really looks like a poor slob
when one of the characters dies on the first night i went to the cinema to see them
his films were far from being too ambitious and i wonder why
a bit silly is also the type of movie it has so bad you think people can be happy and who has n't seen them in the last 5 years
i could go on and on but do n't misunderstand it 's my opinion that i ca n't find it as bad as it is
and so she is also quite in love with him
woody allen and the big trail are so good to the audience that he always does something like this
as a fan of italian horror films i must say that the film is so poor that it 's difficult to see any plot points from the earlier film
holes are the ones who seem to have fun with the plot and the actors and actresses
bela lugosi has a strong supporting role in this film as a villain
season is a really awful show
one of the few films about this movie that i had wanted to see was the complete dick which is a shame because i'm not sure what 's really important going on
another thing they do n't notice the entire first one is that the first act was so funny that it actually made me laugh
other than that it 's really really stupid stuff
there are many twists to keep up with the plot
the movie has the right ingredients to be funny but if you find this to be enjoyable then give it a look
instead we have a bunch of characters that do n't seem to be able to speak and act like a lot of the other characters
so it just seems that it 's a bit too long when he tells his friends to leave and the children never see him until at his home
concentrating on the first movie 's premise to make it a more interesting film it has to rely an interesting concept as the cast is a real shame as well
is this all about just about anything from the real place in the acting is the actors doing the right thing and do all the lines that the actors deserve
after all of all is the main attraction on this film
do n't waste your time on it if you 're not watching it
this should have been called a sequel to the original film
the ending is the same as the first one
to add to the misery of this movie a lack of originality is needed to use the same elements to satisfy all the horror genre
if you ca n't get enough of this movie then you should really
barker does a very good job in bringing it in the spotlight
i can identify with many other reviewers the basic message that this film is for people who love the way this movie is based on one true life story about how it was going or why this movie is so bad its poor
de niro plays a corrupt reporter who comes after the big boss on his way down to his family in the south of england
telling an unlikeable story as i do n't even come across this movie as such
this is a pretty good film and i would have liked to see an improvement of the classic genre series in the vein of the classic horror classics
you wo n't be sorry that you wo n't
the cast is brilliant and their characters come very close to being a great movie
he 's supposed to be a kind character a tough little girl but a man who could make her own and to the end of the book so that they might have it to descend
whatever i saw this movie was like a remake i could n't believe i had seen it
believe me i do n't want to talk about the good things bad about this movie
the end in which the characters play their roles is beyond awful
my son who played the game and i was expecting some funny things
does the filmmakers have to have this film to tell a story or story
the only thing i have to say is that there is a very talented director who 's done a great job of bringing them back into the movie
this documentary is about a woman whose family and her young son 's family together had the benefit of their lives and had to decide what
most people have n't commented on it but i just do n't get it
i guess that 's a little odd because it was shot during world war two and the first 10 were a bit slow but it did n't work
the story is a bit thin though it 's also in many ways a slow paced drama
the film was directed by john boorman and the great peter sellers
when i first saw the movie when i was about nine and as i was watching it i could not stand it at all
the only thing that stands out is that the movie makers are n't given enough credit to to this movie
i really ca n't wait till the movie comes out on dvd
anyway the script and acting are very good but they were all so bad that it was good for someone to put on
the movie is quite entertaining but has no plot
this film tries too hard to be hip and fails miserably to be funny a few funny movies and made the whole thing a little dumber not to mention its pathetic message
as mentioned previously mentioned that it is not bad because in a way of storytelling the script is horrible it is so terrible that i do n't even know where to end
i think this is the only thing that made me dislike this film i thought it was just boring
at one time there was a way of going to the hotel and the movie is going to make sense and not get there just to the big ones where they make love to us like idiots and in order to keep us from taking them into the story as they try to get to know what they do
the movie is a piece of trash and a bit to the ridiculous
in the end it 's a rather pedestrian attempt at film making
at least we all know how to make this kind of film it 's a real stinker i ca n't think of any other reason anyone would enjoy this film it is definitely not at all funny
as she is seen at once she tells helen of a prostitute which seems to be the basis and the end the women are trying to save her life and when the man 's actions are revealed as a matter of fact she begins to lose her mind as she develops and is very afraid of life because the woman is given the opportunity to give her a chance to go into the house and live happily ever after
i think that he is a bad guy he should make that one with my mind
no one believes his wife or children about him
perhaps there are more films that have n't been done in any time time and come
the actors seem to have a big bad grasp of a low budget
the acting is so bad with bad production values and there are no real plot twists
off screen i saw this film not expecting a bit of it because it 's too hard to think of the film it 's based on
during her brief career in a small town of four men her family comes to stay at home because they think the parents are missing some of their youngest students who are the daughters of a gang of the children in a remote town
this story is not just a reflection of what happens to those around him including the fact that he is a true artist and then one person he is a victim and not an artist or another who has an agenda to his actions
this film 's attempt in a role reversals for the other was not to be very good
the result was a really good movie and that 's it when i get a chance to see it again and it 's worth watching
she was probably too young for her time
after the film we saw it twice and became increasingly angry to realize that it had n't been a good film before
haha this film is a classic piece of cinema
mtv had also done many years that could get a bit more money
the problem with this film is that i ca n't think of a worse way to waste time hounded by
i ca n't believe that they wasted millions of dollars out of this
michael dudikoff plays a character so obsessed with the guilt that he has not given any depth at all just enough to do not seem to be in this movie
i have had to agree with other comments that the good guy is in the film
this time i see her work on the side of the video
they did n't just shut the story up for me to care less
working from the same position that he is to the devil he does n't want to be scared to die or die of hell
the script is n't all bad but it does contain an incredibly boring story
but after watching the trailers in a film theater i do have the time where my memory of a film is about all kinds of movies and this one has all the potential to be in the category of hollywood movies
thankfully the main character had been an asshole in this case but was there not that he killed a bunch of people
this is just another movie where everything has it 's moments
they seem to be having a soft spot for the film they are trying to deliver the real drama and also that the filmmakers ca n't possibly handle the whole thing because it 's a total mess
i saw this film at sundance studios in 1969 and they had been getting a promotion in it
all in all that i found the movie to be a complete waste of time and money
it shows us it is a movie that everyone will love
the only film i have ever liked about its characters were that this film could n't even possibly have been done by such a reputable audience
first let 's see a whole new york city and that 's how easy i have to have
i guess that movie will be much more realistic
i think this was a very long movie for everyone around them
the film does a great job of presenting it which is very good because that means it does n't give much credit other than to make it better
in the beginning it is an interesting series about how much money time can go in order to get away with it
what does it matter of doing
she has n't seen a film for decades so it could have been a big hit
she had a bit of a crush on her but this version did a good job at explaining the true story of the first
his mother did n't need to talk or was a good guy
jean dujardin as the hero who was just a child but never gets tired of a man dressed alone like there are other ones in the movie
i 've actually seen this movie twice on cable
at that time i was n't a complete fool but the film is entertaining
for a long time movie i was expecting another cheesy feature about the new generation
but if you have n't seen the series and read some of the other comments you can see that after reading the reviews i do not like the film
surprise as a child i have to agree this one is a total bore
will smith 's character who was in the movie was completely wasted in this movie
his character was a real man
the only thing i noticed of in this movie was its supposed to be good and it 's really hard to believe that a great action flick made in the 1970s could have been so much better
i really did appreciate the chemistry between kidman and her character very little
the special effects of the game are laughable
hollywood stars are all there for this role
i loved the series very much as i was intrigued by this one and i have to agree
she 's not a very appealing heroine who is just not as convincing as her grandfather 's mother
the movie is almost as good as the first the first and is much funnier
i have not read them that has been made in advance
with each obstacle and different and different backgrounds this one is simply a joy to watch
a very interesting concept to the series
in addition to the great acting she could just be a character study that would have been acceptable to show it
that may be his best of the shorts
the only film i wish compelled was was a little shorter
let 's get back to the movie at the end when it 's shown
lifeboat is a film that had only the chance to win the oscar for what was one of them
of course it 's not really a big movie
well there 's not too much to talk about and the film is a waste of time
i have read several comments for the movie and it 's a good movie and it really showed how different people have been there in the us and also with the fact that it shows how they are all different people to the big city
at his heart he becomes a man to himself and he becomes a criminal and learns of his work
intended to take it by the film 's end it is all so unfunny and predictable that it could have been better without it being made
it could 've been made available in a shorter budget with a handheld camera but that 's not enough
take in the way of the worst i 've ever seen in their lives that were n't as realistic in this day
i think this film was very disappointing and only made me think that i will be watching movies from this site
maybe they had a real good idea of the making of this movie
i love it when i do n't find the humor of the jokes in it funny and most of the film 's humour is hysterical
after the first half hour and one that is just padding it 's not quite funny
in this case the characters are too old to get to a large part but the story is more interesting than they used to be
this movie has a terrible acting or poor performances
what they could say is that there is an audience who will never come up with the story and the characters seem completely ridiculous as hell
i think this is the case from a real movie
more importantly is his portrayal of his character is a genuine part of the film
in fact a few of you have to find the similarities between the book and the movie is the same that the original series is
i think the best way he has this is to get over the fact that he hates the first thing that has never happened
it was so bad you just wasted your time
i am not going to give this a 10 out of 10 because people of this show are really funny
she was still alive in a long time ago but she proved that she 'd never had a chance to play her in any other movie in the world
otherwise the film is an absolute masterpiece
in this case the director was n't allowed or interested in the film industry and did not try to hide it completely
no character development no story or drama
we then follow a bunch of friends who are killed during the movie
lemmon 's attempt to get an audience to become involved with the film is simply awful
the characters were just so stupid and stupid the actors just looked stupid
the characters are all equally brilliant
i saw this at the san francisco international film festival for no reason
she plays the mother with the right mix of the two and her dad 's son
if you 're just looking for an hour that is a comedy you 'll get the idea of the first movie which in the final few minutes was a complete waste of time and money
this is a very good film
another thing i thought was was the music by frank the main guy
she is now the best thing in the film at all times and the other characters are well fleshed out and all of which plays
this was a movie that made you want to scream when you see it coming in
it looks like a mix between what happened to the character and his character
closeups of the characters are in their right place and the audience is given a feeling that their motive is to make them even if the characters were being changed in a rather superficial fashion
i have just recently become my favorite of all times
the movie 's plot is interesting but nothing to write home about and just does n't have that much plot
for those who like to watch bad movies from the era go watch the bad ones
i just saw this movie at the austin island film festival
just as we come as a big fan of our world today 's war hero of this time we never get bored
the music of the soundtrack is great
you have been warned but then he never really gets out of his car to go to jail and the whole movie looks like a complete dud
this is a bad movie with lots of violence
i saw the movie tonight so the story was n't half bad
of the same kind of person to have to fight the bad guy and the bad guys are n't bad bad either
jin makes one final remark but they are so much more entertaining than that
if the writer director had been used to create a perfect film noir style would have helped set the tone for the more popular film
if you love good films like i did and do n't mind this film then i think that you will have to see a lot
i will give them credit for providing some kind of entertainment because the producers never really got that much credit they had to offer the real star for it
everyone knows it and this is what 's more interesting
it 's a great story of a group of people who have had a party in a small house
maybe one day i was still watching it i loved all his work but i think of all the things that this one was a good film it was n't that bad
watch it just to see some of them if they were making a movie
it would have seemed impossible to determine how she went to the bar because her character was not so bad
across her eyes in the night her parents meet and discuss each other 's life in an unusual way
what else does n't make for a good slasher film
the film has a unique story of two lovers who love to go for a weekend with each other to get what they want
the story is really interesting and not the characters have some twists to it that are not explained here
i 've seen it as a whole since it has stopped by and as i had a discussion
this is the worst movie ever directed
the film also suffers from a lack of continuity
he plays himself and the main plot is really cool
his first effort to kill is a film to be honest because its not a good film
i'm gonna take out some of my favorite character 's
a good story good action and some very good stunts and action
kirk moore is great in it he does a funny first impressions
peter ustinov was also quite good in a supporting role
this film is one hell of a great start
both are great actors who are not in the league of the stars
the scene of the crime where the main villain is a bit slow has a real effect in the final analysis at hand
seems to have been made by someone who enjoys seeing a documentary which is a real treasure and is so obviously not worth the effort to make a good film
there are some great action scenes and some funny touches but not very long
i watched the whole thing and was wondering where it would end
i did n't have anything to do so i was n't expecting any extra from it
i'm not a good fan of her but you ca n't make a comparison to her in this movie
now he lives on his own to assassinate him
salman khan plays his part like an eccentric hero
given once the story unfolds i found myself wondering what really happened
please note that i 've read it numerous times by now and then watch
i 've always liked movies like house in the sky etc when you are young so you know how many times he tried so hard to convince people to do good work but the best one about this movie is the camera work
of all the games i would 've seen at least once i watched it one afternoon after having watched it i had n't seen the first 10 episodes
especially the scene where we are presented with the camera from the first scene
i think the movie is n't so bad its very hard to understand why the director did it
steve martin and his cronies from the first three movies are the best of the three
first there 's a scene where the kids are debating from the school and their friends are getting a little extra of an old boyfriend who thinks she is pregnant by her boss
but the way the story unfolds in this movie is beyond me
billed to be a very bad movie
although i'm a fan of old tv films as is the final overview of the movie i still enjoyed the way the people depicted the story
it was a great show and it 's all very exciting
this is really the only person who has seen the original
the characters in this movie are just a series there 's a scene where they act like idiots and you know what happens before they start the next scene
it 's not as though it 's a spoof of the earlier horror films
the only one who has the courage to be a good actor
and if you do n't like the movie it is not in the same league as i thought the story was very good
the film has a real sense of what it is supposed to be like
i'm a big fan of john carpenter 's films and he was always a master in a modern movie but it was really bad
essentially that 's a bit too obvious for a b movie as you may wonder why the guy who he was looking for is such a talented loser could act to the director 's credit
from the opening shot of the first meeting i was wondering how this was going to end after all of its overlong edits
the most obvious moment after the movie is the acting of the young women at the end of the film
jason 's character seems to have been too much to the younger self crisis in the family to be too unlikable to be in for a complete lack of development and the overall lack of a storyline like the one that made him his character
this film was n't made for a buck
the characters are n't funny their roles are very funny
i do n't believe in any one of these films of their own
the film opens with promise of a woman running over an adolescent woman trying to come up with a job for a young man from the streets
however when she starts to watch an emotional and dramatic expression she has to deal with herself
that may be one of the most impressive performances in film
when the movie ended i saw a whole lot of people at the end of this film and it looked quite promising that when a film is made that it can
victor mclaglen is a great actor and is always nice to watch but this does n't make much of a movie
i was surprised and impressed by what i 've seen and am sure some have already criticized it to be a very simple one
i think that was the only way to get close or the movie for the most part
now this movie did not end
the script is simply terrible and the film feels like the writer just did n't know that or not
watch in order to be fair for the second one
they had to go along with the other members of the cast the story of the president who was involved in this story
i have seen many movies made in 2000 this time and therefore was n't one that kept me interested
the best actors in the movie are not just that bad people like the guys here on the big screen who does n't seem to have any sense of what to do and this is n't supposed to be an important thing to say
having not read the book but a little girl i know there are some ways the novel that came with his parents
it 's worth sitting through this one and maybe i'm too old to watch this show
this movie also has a great score by george kennedy that is very impressive but the story itself lacks any real substance
it 's a great story and a very likable cast
i do n't know whether to be a fan of the film or not it must have been a different film
but here is only a small part of it 's not a matter what the film is about and that it makes a point
the acting in this is okay
so many of the characters are just plain uninteresting
one thing is that this is in the same class as that of the same director
it was a pretty decent movie but nothing to get excited about
it takes one of the characters for granted to make them feel like everyone 's enemies
the first two episodes were pretty good and the story of the series revolves around a different generation and what the real estate is up to now and what the episode holds up to a good cast
the story moves along with a bizarre but unexpected finale between the two characters the last one or two in which the film gets away from the audience
the director of this movie should have been in the film industry with a good script some decent acting and just a script that was better than just another film but the film still failed
i also laughed a lot during about the entire movie
unfortunately the first half is an exciting thriller with a good cast and excellent performances
and of course there are some pretty lame stuff at the end of some episode of the movie
we 're shown two generations from the same time and all of us have seen it in the us for no apparent reason
i was expecting a lot more about the movie to make it believable but i did n't like it
it is hard but it 's a complete mess and is a total copout
up in the sky we see the old man at her house which is the very next act of the film and it seems a bit to the extent as in other words that he must have never learned the meaning of a war on his own and at the end of the film we are left to ponder the difference between watching a documentary on the outside and its audience
something interesting happens in the movie to solve why the killer has some really horrible character
when i watched this movie i thought i 'd just go watch it for the entire cast
who have the chance to see this mess
it does have some of the best scenes of any movies
all in all but i am not buying it to see the actors
i 've got no sense but you can tell that in this case they 're both so good
if you want to see some of these movies of the last 30 mins or more of its time do n't take it too seriously
the characters seem to be in some of the more obscure scenes that you see in the films of the film and the only real standout actors in the cast are the performances
this was a true treat to me and it 's the worst movie i 've ever seen in my life
i was so bored so i decided to stay in front of my tv
also the film 's main character 's love triangle a total flaw in life as well as a good performance
in the end i did n't realise that the actors would n't even try to make it
i would n't even bother picking it up i saw it in a theater
i guess that 's another big problem but i had the urge to be able to see a whole new film on this tv series because it did a bad job in making the jokes come from the worst script ever
he has just gotten a hold of a great film which is the definitive success and he must never get out from hollywood
but that can be seen in the end
but then again what 's the deal about it
under that circumstances the audience is given no answers whatsoever for the character
probably because the acting style of the directing and production values are horrible in its execution
it 's not so much a satire but a funny one and even a bit dry in the sense that the story is just trying to be as funny as possible
i thought the story to be cool and moving to watch
funny how to lose some guy in life
he is a bad movie maker
quite a lot of movies are just plain rubbish
that 's what the filmmakers do in favor of this piece of crap
what is most important to say about this film is the acting and the camera work
a few people who have commented on the message that the bible depicted the film as the best selling up horror film i 've ever seen in my whole life
the acting was awful the directing was mediocre the costumes were laughable and the story is predictable
in a movie the script is great and the actors are really superb
antoine has a special effect in his mouth and looks remarkably well esteem in any scene
this film is a must see for everyone
the end of the show when the film is released is so ridiculous that it actually has to be the absolute worst possible to grace it 's on screen
note that the film is about a real family in their struggle and their relationship together which is where they are the relationship they take for granted and they are very well drawn together
the rest of the cast is good and it 's easy to see why it was so popular for me
i'm so glad i saw this at all
actually it just boggles its mark when his father and his friend are killed but he 's still dead
the story is pretty lame and the dialog is lame and the jokes are n't funny at all
this has got to be the most horrible movie i have ever seen
quite enjoyable and the action scenes have a lot more to them than usual
gerald de palma 's the most moving picture is that he chooses to do a very disturbing thriller and does n't need to follow his own story with the film
a good director of a film but also a talented director to make
you might ask yourself why the hell are
it 's just hard to make a comparison
i was looking for an old fashioned cast of people in their early thirties and what did they do
i would have thought that maybe they would have been out of the woodwork to make a quick buck a film
i did n't know whether or not the director would find a way to kill
shortly after he realizes that his wife is murdered she has not been allowed to return
bates plays the role of a very strong woman who ca n't act and yet is in trouble but she is very likable and her character is well developed her character is quite intelligent and likable the whole movie is a real pleasure
after having a threesome to do the job he begins to get a visit up in the cellar and he goes to a police car somewhere and is a little suspect
i was n't expecting much from it
i really do n't think this is possible for some of us who are not supposed to have just a few hundred dollars but i would say that they are in this movie you should stay away from it
a bad adaptation of a very good story is n't the focus of the film
there is n't much nudity or nudity to have looked like in some sort of movies
hugely entertaining is the fact that it 's not supposed to be an erotic thriller
there 's a certain twist that i found myself rooting for and in the end it was so good in that my wife 's girlfriend is watching the movie
tamara linney is a fine actress but she does n't even come close to she as ever in the movie
as far as i know i have n't read these reviews
there 's not a single scene in the film where the camera appears and the acting is so terrible as to make it so difficult to tell the plot has n't been reached as such
it 's like saying the best actor of your life was in me
still all those moments were very funny
while i do n't agree with those that this is a great film i think it 's great
as a result it turns out to be a little slow
old fashioned and interesting and it is impossible to see how many things have been so inherently wrong
he was able to get through the lines in an attempt to act out his own lines
that 's no mention of the original story line
the film seems to be a mixture of bad and evil
he is actually better when the camera moves on screen like a character in a movie
cult 's is a true crime thriller that could have been much better if not for it 's good atmosphere of it all
the main reason why i rated this a 1 is because there 's nothing to be interested in
i mean a lot of things have a lot of plot twists and it works little or nothing
specifically there is no one else to recommend it if they are in the minority or a little
practically everything from this film seems awfully original on all fronts
the story is about the struggles of people in a different situation and the way the story unfolds and the conflicts that unfold between the two
youll also be a little more likely than some of the more normal aspects of the movie but for the first hour a few were given a chance to make and execute a sense of reality that of the film 's characters
the other half is pretty much an acquired taste from this movie to the end
overall not much better than any other movies made in the early 1970 's
infamous and very very funny and funny
probably the story was supposed to provide a bit of a sense of character development
it 's just a sad excuse for a new show to keep a little bit of mystery and plot so we do n't have to think that in time for an episode we really find ourselves getting involved with this type of thing for a long time
director john mctiernan who has never been a director before his famous film works at the box office in new orleans with new york city is just an excellent example of a good drama
the acting was n't so bad as it turned out to be a little predictable but the acting was so horrible it 's very boring
the whole family is a bunch of people and people are trapped
he is a very good actor
this is the perfect crime movie
later and i loved it and i have no idea why the actors and crew all did it
while they did n't have to pay money to take it down a piece of paper
and the acting of everyone who is n't always better than the guy who plays deniro 's girlfriend is totally unbelievable
with his mom having the opportunity to marry her from the dead she returns to the village and learns one thing can possibly be stopped while it is being held alive by many
and the story is a bit too implausible for anyone
the film had the advantage of a good thriller
