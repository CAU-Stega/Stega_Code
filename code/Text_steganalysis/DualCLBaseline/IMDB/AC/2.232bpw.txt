it 's like it 's a tv movie
saw this movie on a whim
the story is a bit slow and the ending does n't really have a happy ending
believe me this is one film i would not recommend to any people that have seen the whole movie
this is one of the better films i 've ever seen
the movie is also very interesting
the plot of the film is simple but it is n't that much different
i saw this movie for a little while i was a teenager and i loved every minute of it
i 've been a big fan of a long time for tv and i have seen that show but it is so obvious as to be an insult that the show would have had the potential in the uk
it was a very funny movie and it shows
in fact it 's so bad that you ca n't really get away from it
i have seen this movie several times in a long time and it is one of my favorite movies of all time
max von sydow is the most underrated director and writer of this genre
for all the technical flaws i have seen and the whole story is that it is an exercise in logic
despite the fact that the story is not the greatest of the bunch it is still a good movie with some very funny lines
sir humphrey bogart 's film is a great example of the genre 's genre that it can be seen by all means
i think he was just another one who was n't a big star in the film
this movie is one of my favorites
the film is about a woman whose mother is murdered by her husband and his wife
this movie is about a bunch of men who go to an underground school where they meet and find themselves in a small town with a strange old boy
that would be true but the story is a little too shallow for words
it 's a pity that he has n't done his homework since the first film he is in
it was an interesting idea and it 's easy to see the ending of the film as it 's the one that gets away with the story
the acting is pretty good and the script is a good one
i was really surprised by what the movie would have looked like
elizabeth shue as the young actress who plays a woman is a delight
she is a very beautiful woman who has a very difficult marriage
but if you 're in the mood for a comedy you should watch this one
ritter is a man with a heart and soul and the rest of the cast seems like he is trying to be a little better
if you have a choice for the genre you can probably see the film
in my opinion this is a very good movie
tim burton is also a good actor and the supporting cast is great
when you watch a film like this it is not for you
i was surprised by the acting
on the way home he discovers that his family has taken their family home and he has to deal with his life
that is the only way i can think of this movie
anyone who has a chance to see this movie will agree with me
dean cain does a good job as a reporter of the movie 's biggest strength as well as the other actors
if it is not for a little bit of a stretch of the film it 's also a good example of the type of humor you would expect to see in this movie
only in the first scene the main character of the movie is a little too nerdy to take the girl away from his job
once again this movie is not for the faint of heart
a few scenes are just downright funny and it 's fun to hear them all
he 's a little too young too old and too young
i do n't think it would have made a movie a great movie but it was not
although the movie was made by a young man he was n't quite good as it was made
and what was up with that
i am amazed to see such people who have seen this film
the story is a joke and the actors are so bad they 're actually fun for their roles
this one is not for everyone
nancy 's performance as the mother who had been the most popular in the world has been in a very strict state of consciousness
so why does the film have to be one of the worst movies ever made
one thing that i did like about this movie was that it was n't a movie that it was a little bit of a letdown
and it is not as if he has been trying to make a movie of his own
the story is about a group of friends who are stranded in a small town
then there 's the fact that this is not one of those films which has been made in many ways and is n't funny
now i do n't get the idea that the filmmakers are trying to get away from the story and they just do n't get it
we 're talking about the world that we live in and it 's not even a dream of life in america
if it were n't for the fact that it was n't that great i 'd have to say it 's the funniest i have seen on the last ten years
oh and the fact is that there are so many ways to make a movie like this
shortly afterwards i was surprised how i 'd never seen this movie in a theater
we are shown to believe that the only person who is able to find a good person is the man he loves
he has a lot going on but he 's not really in love with the main character
that 's the only positive point of this movie
even the actors are good enough and the story is very well executed
obviously the film was a success of the book which it was based on in the book
like all of us you are a very conservative and humble person
strangler is n't an original film but it is definitely not as much fun
well this movie was made for television but not the worst of the year
director michael j fox has a very low budget but it is not that bad
for the first half of the movie they are trying to find the killer but that is n't enough
that is the only thing i can say on this film
and it 's just too long
it is a shame that this one was n't even nominated
great movie and a good movie
angry and disgusted with the idea of the film is the fact that it is a little bit too dark at times or a very good ending
the acting is very good although it was n't as good as some of the other films
for the rest of the movie kronk is a good actor
i'm still trying to make it out of my own
in my humble opinion the film is a complete failure in my book
wish it had been more widely distributed
also the film does have an upbeat look for a good cast
really the movie is a total waste of time
they do n't even seem to make any sense
well you can get a lot of fun out of it but you 're not going to be able to get the idea of it
and if the movie was supposed to be a comedy and an attempt to make the most of it to be serious i would n't be surprised to see it
while i do n't know what the appeal of the movie is i just could n't believe it
it 's a shame the film fails
the movie is a very funny show about a young man who moves in and out of his family
most of the movie 's characters are onedimensional and the story is not a total washout
ann sheridan was perfect as the woman who 's been given an opportunity to do what she wants to do
writerdirector john mctiernan has a good sense of humor which makes this film a real treat
the movie is so bad its almost like an extended version of the shining
we all get the feeling that it is a bit too long but the acting is so bad i ca n't think of another movie that 's even worse
you could n't have had enough to have this movie
this is a film about the struggle between the three brothers and the consequences of the marriage between two men and their mutual relationship
most people have been warned about this
although he was n't the best in the movie it was not even the case that he was given to
how did the film manage to attract the audience in the way this entire film was
perhaps it 's the fact that there are people that have to be a lot of people to see them
overall it was n't that bad
even the usually talented kristin smith and michael caine in the title role
i do n't know why people who have n't voted this piece of crap but have a good sense of humor
i'm a huge fan of the first one and i really enjoyed the movie and i have seen it so many times
the story of the girl who is married to her daughter who has a heart attack
this movie is a real gem
frankly i think it was just a bad movie
but i guess it was made for television
if you have read this review on the imdb boards you can see a very large portion in which they are made up from the script
i have n't seen any of the movies and i do not think that the first one is so bad it makes it hard to suspend disbelief for this one
if you can get past it and you 're going to have a laugh about it then you 'll love this
although this is not a film for everyone it is definitely worth watching
riding around the countryside as they walk through the forest in the dark
the film is set to an end where a little more suspense is revealed and the viewer can relate to the characters but the story is a little too shallow
but it 's a good film and one thing is that it 's a shame that the actors are so obviously unable to make a film
john cusak is also very good as well
there 's also a few other scenes where the movie is set and the music sounds like they were reading in a school production class that were supposed to be the norm of the movie
you have the impression that there is a lot of people to be afraid of
within the first 10 minutes of this movie i was thinking of the movie as i was watching the trailer for it in the theatre
the film starts with a bang on the wall
you know this is n't the only one in the cast but you can see that
as it is that it does n't work at all the acting is terrible the story is awful and the direction is worse and worst of all the acting
the movie also shows the real problems with the human race and also it 's a very human story
simon pegg is great as his brother
zulu is a great movie for you
i am a sucker for the film and i do n't have a clue about it but i was n't surprised that the film had been a long way in the us so i figured i could get a little bit of an issue with this film
this movie was one big hit and one to avoid
but the story is a little confusing and the characters are just not funny enough for the story
and the story line is a joke to me
it 's all about the family and the relationships
the movie also has a couple of very funny jokes
the film is a bit slow but there 's a bit of the story that makes the movie a little bit of a disappointment
the only thing that really got me was this a bit of the film 's story the music and the soundtrack
this is a movie that you could watch over and over again
my friend rented a lot of the video box for sale
all three of them go into the woods and it 's just another one
this movie is one of my favorites for me
when they arrive and the first two members of the gang are plunged into the ground the two lovers decide that they 're in for some rough revenge
merging it with a bunch of young adults
my only complaint was that this was a very poor movie
the script of the film follows the exploits of two men who are in prison and are forced to go undercover and try to find their way
the script was horrible the acting was bad the plot was boring
after the film 's initial revelation it 's a shame because it 's a total mess
but then we learn that she is not a virgin
secondly if you 're looking for an entertaining movie about a mysterious man that is n't really good it 's a bad thing
obsessed with a group of kids who have been searching for their mother 's parents to find out what their mother is and why they have to go to the family 's house in the woods
the movie has its moments but it just does n't work at all
were they just kidding me and they were n't going to do that
also there are two things that make the movie interesting
i have to admit that i have seen it over 20 times and i still enjoy it and it 's the best thing on a movie i have seen and even more of a classic
my wife and i were on the couch laughing at the movie but it was just a movie
its not so bad it 's good but the movie is not really bad
still i think the movie could have ended in a better way and if the story had been more interesting the acting was not so bad
he 's a good man but he is a little over the top but the fact that he 's in such a bad film makes it hard for me to imagine him trying to get a little
you 're not a fan of the genre but for those who do n't have to be a fan of the genre you 'll probably like this movie
in this respect it 's a great movie
kane is a man that loves to use his own words to get a hold of the world
and i do n't understand where the heck is the plot
i have n't read the book but i have seen the movie
he 's a great writer but the director and writer chose to show up on the big screen
did i have to be a kid to get my money back
the acting is superb as is the acting
brotherhood was the best way to show us that there will be a sequel
after the first few minutes of the film you see that the film has been a long long long long time
when you have seen it you can feel a bit of pain and hate for everyone involved
over all there is n't a single person who is so funny to look at
the story line is so weak and the plot just makes it worse
now that 's not all i 'd say about this movie
ninety minutes of the running time i just wanted to see the end of it and it just was n't there
hes not the only thing that 's going on
hollywood has been a fan of many other films and this is one of her best
telly savalas was also excellent as the evil villain
character development and character development are nonexistent
the film was made in the seventies and early eighties
it was a complete waste of time
why do they need to use the name of the credits to tell the story of how a movie can be so bad
and the ending is the best
if you 're looking for a great adventure movie then this is n't
catchphrases like it should go to the cinema of this film for me
at this point we are left with the feeling that the director had never met a director with such a sense of humor
seldom do you want to see the same thing
dominic monaghan plays the character of the young son of a famous pianist and is played by the wonderful and talented kristin scott thomas
coming from the very beginning of the movie this movie is not the worst
all three characters are likable and they have the perfect combination of characters that are not just as funny as the ones who seem to be a little twodimensional and lovable and are n't funny
just as the movie itself is set in the early 1900 's it was n't so bad that it had so much potential
like most reviewers i 've seen the movie a bit of an improvement but it is a very entertaining film that is a pleasure to watch
the only way to describe this film is that it is a complete waste of film time
i am surprised at the number of people i 've seen on this board
it 's a pretty good idea
why is n't it a good thing that a movie like this could not possibly afford to be made
the story is so predictable and so lame
like the first movie i did not expect to see a movie about him in that way that was good
i have to say i 've always liked the movie
virginia mayo plays a beautiful woman but she 's a woman who is a real woman
he has a very short appearance which is very hard to understand
those who think they are too old are the ones who do so
these people are not even close and have a real connection
their chemistry is palpable and believable
owen wilson is a real talent as the villain who is the only character i 've seen him in
a lot more of a lot
the film is also a very moving piece of cinema that makes it hard to follow
oddly enough the movie ends with a twist
if you are looking for a good film to watch at least give it an oscar
catherine deneuve plays the role of a young man who is a teenager with a very young woman who has her own problems with the world and her life
here 's another example of how to use a camera
this movie is a total bore fest
were they really trying to be a little too hard to pull out the movie
secondly the film is not about the evils of love and the consequences for the viewer to be able to accept the film
i was n't sure who the murderer was but he was in his element and the film was just a bit more enjoyable
but i ca n't imagine the real intention behind it
this is a great show that should be seen as a very realistic one
if you can get a few laughs from the film the only way this movie could be is that the cast and crew are in this film
memento is a film about a man whose wife who is so different is married but is married
even the actors are n't all that bad either
in fact the film is a bit too dull for its own good and not a particularly good movie
sam peckinpah 's film is a perfect film with the same theme
it 's not just a movie
it 's an interesting idea that a lot of the action was done in a different manner but there was n't enough of it
she has a beautiful face and he does not need a proper voice
despite the fact that this film is a masterpiece and not a remake of the original it 's a great movie
irina palm has a good cast and it was fun to see a film that made me want to watch more than once that i was a bit surprised
i would recommend this film to any fan of the genre as well as the likes of ichi bill vol i 'll admit that i am a sucker to watch a movie that was made in my hometown with the same cast as the ones in my collection
i was expecting the story to unfold and then we went to the cinema where it would end
this time it is a film where the audience is given the task to see this film in a very different light than it should have been
i saw this movie when it was released and i still remember my mom
another thing i did n't notice was that it was made by a bunch of kids who did n't have a good time and it had nothing to do with the plot and they were both annoying
instead of the usual stereotypes the director does n't even know what to do with a group of people and the film is just trying too hard to be scary and scary
it 's an awful movie that i ca n't understand the point of view and the acting is poor
at least the first time it 's shown in the movie it is so bad that you 'll probably even cry at the television
the film 's story is so simple that you have to wonder whether the director was trying to cram the viewer into the story or make it all the more interesting to me
in the end i felt cheated from the moment the film started to drag me to tears
and i do n't like this movie
i think it is the best performance in the movie and it 's the kind of movie that makes people cry at the tv
where are the actors who are in this film
all i can say is this movie is the worst movie i 've ever seen
the movie is a little slow at times but it is so much more
but the movie is just awful
if you 're looking for an accurate story of the dangers of a young man and of the world of the 20th century and the life of jesus and the cuban people you might like this film
do n't let me tell you this movie is bad
its the only movie that i have ever seen that i 've seen so bad that i do n't have to watch any movie to get my hands on it
thus it 's a little bit too long
i do recommend this movie for everyone who is a fan of the original
the story of two friends and their relationship in an apartment complex are a bit off kilter but as i 've read in a few episodes this one is still a great experience to watch
watching this one has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen
she was a very very talented actress
the acting and the acting is very good
wayne 's performance was the only redeeming feature to this film
no one else could have made this film a much better movie
michael keaton has a lot of fun making his role to date
some people may not like it but i do n't think that the film is so realistic
and i did n't think that the director would really like a good film
he does n't have the usual suspects in his life and is a bit confused by the way he portrays his wife
the script is not very original
after watching the movie i felt that i would have been a little more entertained
the movie was shot in black and white and the story is not that great and the acting is terrible
it is not a bad movie it is n't that bad but there are some good things about it
to make matters worse the story is so weak and so poorly constructed so badly acted that i was hoping that the writers would put it all together
it has some nice twists and a few moments that are funny to watch
listen to the title song the song is sung by the same composer
and there is a great scene where she is in a mental state and the camera pans down and the camera pans down and the camera pans into a camera frame
i do have a lot of fun watching it but it is definitely one of my favorites
for the first ten minutes or so i was bored
a very entertaining movie that makes it worth a watch
this movie does not have to be that bad
so it would n't matter if this was the worst movie i 've ever seen
but it 's still very well worth it
colossus 's greatest enemy was a huge one
what is more important to note that the film 's plot revolves around the lives of several people in the same time
if it were n't for the acting i would have been surprised at the actors to see the first 30
a lot of things happen to the viewer
it is also the story of a young man who is sent to prison for his family in a foreign family to assassinate them from the war
we know that the two are the only ones to get their hands on the ground to find out if their father is dead or is he
the story is a little weak and it 's all about the characters and their motivations in each episode
i do n't know how it got any worse
near the end the movie becomes boring
i have been searching for some of the best movies to come out of hollywood
albums and other oddities were used in the trailer
a film of a movie that i can not understand what was being said
and there is no real reason to make a movie like this
the plot is n't a bad idea either
this was the last great show that was canceled
not only that but the script does n't do much to relieve the film 's impact but the story is a little too long for the film to get any more than a solid plot
i have seen some good movies that have always been made during that period
this movie has to be the worst of any kind to date
although the movie was a little long and the story was a bit too predictable i could n't help but think the movie was trying to be a little bit of a comedy
thus there is a lot of action and a lot of action
he was so good he was able to play the role very much but i thought he was a great actor and he 's very good
joao 's character was the only person who seemed to have to deal with his father 's problems
chevy chase was a very funny and very funny guy but he just does n't seem to get it
lastly if you can get past the fact that you do not have enough time to develop the film then you can do better
while the original was somewhat original and the acting was very poor it was not a bad movie
my wife is a fan of hers i love the movie
my favorite parts of the movie were the scene where she was a baby at the end
too little is going on and the characters are n't even remotely interesting or likable
this movie was a great disappointment for me
the acting is good the plot is a bit of a mess the action sequences are laughable but there 's a few moments of suspense and tension to it
the first time i saw it i thought it was going to be a great movie but the acting was worse and the characters were boring
almost every line is spoken and delivered by a bunch of guys
this is n't a movie for those who want to be entertained by their own personal beliefs
yeah i know that i know what to say about it but i did n't care for it
in fact this movie is a total bore
seldom do you get a feel good story of a family man in a mental institution
for some reason it is a movie of sorts and is a great film
who could be the target for this film
he 's a very funny character
as a matter of fact it is still a good film to watch
following the first half hour or so of the movie i was left wondering what happened to the actors
although the movie is set in the us the characters are very interesting
sam jaffe is a great actor and his performance is perfect
the only thing i can say is that i have no idea why the makers of this movie have n't been able to write a script like this
that 's a shame because the film is not so bad it 's good
and it 's also a shame
mehmet is not only one of his best
they should have left the room and the crew was a bit of a joke
from the opening credits sequence with the girl on top of her car is the funniest scene that i have ever seen in a film
soon he is given the task of being a serial killer and he is a little reluctant to be the killer
save your money and rent rent this movie you will never be able to find a copy
the first half of the film focuses on the story of a young man who is sent in to find the body of one of those two men
spongebob is a film with an interesting concept and it has to be a little too long and the plot is n't very interesting at all
watch it if you want to see something more than just a movie
i was expecting the worst movie to get my hands on
see the first episode and you 'll be very surprised
i 've never read the book but i did not like the book
they are both in the same vein
the story of two friends who are in a different place and are n't as strong as they are about each other
against the first two hours the film is a little boring and is n't worth a look
i do n't know why i was n't so disappointed in this film because i am a fan of the original series
to say this is not a movie about a man is not to say it 's a bad movie just for the fact that it is a comedy that the entire family is n't laughing at
and the acting is n't bad
i have n't been impressed with a movie by the director and i have to say that i have n't seen the other two
it 's a shame that the film does not have a wider audience and it 's not a complete lack of originality and the script
this movie has a lot of flaws in it that are supposed to be taken seriously and some really really good acting
it 's an excellent film but one that should have stayed away from the film
it 's a great movie and it is the first time i ever saw the movie
i do think it was a good movie but it just does n't work
the film has a few good moments but there 's not enough action
but it is also very funny that the characters are n't developed as a comedy
after all the hype of what is being said is not one of the best films ever made
just when the movie is finished at least it is so bad that they do n't even try to be funny and they are not funny or funny
great story lines and a wonderful plot line
it 's an insult to the viewer
this is an excellent movie that is definitely recommended for everyone who is interested in cinema and history
if you 're a diehard fan of the original and do n't know why the movie is not so bad it does n't have it
if you 're a fan of his work you 'll love the film
although it is n't as much a drama as it 's an examination of the human condition it 's just not that good
that is how many people are so disgusted by this film
even in the final analysis we see him as a man who is trying to get a little more money to go to his own life
i have never seen such a bad film on my life
the acting was good but not all is wasted
the movie was made to look like a bad film and there 's no actual reason for that
even the most ardent fans of the film will probably appreciate the film and the story and the characters
never have i been more uneasy
many of the songs are so lame that i was not expecting a movie to make any sense
martin scorsese was also very good and this movie is a mustsee for all people
on the plus side the acting is very good the plot is a little bit complicated but that 's not enough to overcome this film
it is a movie that is not even worth watching
garfield plays an important role in his supporting role but this is a very weak film
it 's a good thing and a good deal of fun to watch is not a good film but it does n't take itself too seriously
do n't waste your time to see this one if you want a good movie do n't waste your time
the film is set in a small town with the backdrop of a new york city where the city is located in the middle of nowhere in a city where the town is being owned by an elderly man
from the first scene where the movie opens with a bang
what i do n't like is when a movie is made to look like a documentary it fails miserably
by the end of the movie you will not know what it 's all about
show how bad a movie was when you have to see this movie in the first place
welcome to a film that is more or less a parody of the original
despite the fact that the plot was a little weak i was n't expecting anything more from this one
there was a bit of a plot but it could have been much more interesting
the acting was ok and the characters all were likable
it does n't really seem like a movie in which the characters are developed and they just have nothing to work with
he is not only an actor he does not deserve
this movie has the best of the worst
looking forward to seeing it again
kenneth branagh 's acting is a bit stiff
sue and her daughter arrive in a house
though the film was a bit slow at first i did feel that i was not watching the movie
this was a very good movie
i do n't know what to say about this movie and it is very good
it has the feel of a tv episode of the twilight zone episode which shows the characters with their lives
trying to get out of a car wreck is to make a noise of his own
the movie has no atmosphere and is just a cheap cheap mess about the evils of war and how they are not to be seen
it does n't have the potential to be funny and the acting is so awful
bizarrely a very bad movie and one of the best i 've seen
3 of the movie was shot in a small location and a little girl in the middle looked a bit like a student 's home video
so why did they just do so little and the story line
and it is not that the director has done so much
some of the scenes are quite well done and you will not have to wait until the final 15 minutes
listening to the radio news and you will see this movie
just as you can do n't see the movie
totally unbelievable for this kind of film
snoop kulkarni is a great character and the character of a great actor and a good actor who is n't just a bad guy is n't bad
did n't i think it was a great idea to show up
doug nolte plays a young detective who gets to know a little about his character
a few of the characters in this film are a bit too much for me
it 's not a good movie but it is not that bad
it was a little hard to swallow that the story of the first movie was based on a play by the writer
i think the reason i gave up on this film was because i wanted to get my hands on some of the other reviews
whereas he does n't even know he 's a good guy he does n't know that he has his wife and his wife who are a little more interested in finding out who he was
as the title suggests the film takes itself too serious and turns into a mess of a movie
the plot was very weak and the characters were annoying to say the least
while it is not that i do n't want to be a part of the film
louis leung as the young son of the family who plays the role is just as strong as the one he played
still the movie is a very good and very entertaining one
a few years later he 's a bit older and the movie seems less like a series of vignettes and a very predictable ending
this film is so bad you 're not likely to waste your time with it
normally i do n't know what to do
it is one of those films that makes you think so bad it 's bad
played by michael caine is a very bad movie about a bunch of people who want to make a living
the story is a bit too long but in the end the story is very simple and is a very satisfying one
a few days later the film has been cut down
donna is a very nice actress but it was n't her fault that i found this show to be so annoying it was n't funny or scary
they do n't get to the police
other than that the movie does n't have any of the same problems with the first one
rambo and a lot of the others have been killed
what is the difference between the two
um the first time i saw it i laughed so hard i cried
i would n't go into this film expecting much more than i had
it is a very good movie and should be viewed by everyone involved
the movie has a very strong feel
this is not a film that will leave you with a feeling of sadness for the person involved
no matter how many times you 've heard you 're a little girl the film will probably appeal to you to avoid
the only thing to watch was the scene where she tells the goosebumps of the woman
making a movie of the same sort of movie as the others
then i found the whole story of this movie to be a little bit farfetched but the film did have a good cast
most of the cast were excellent
it 's a shame the writers did n't have enough money to produce this film and that is n't the case with the director
horrified at the lack of a coherent ending and a good ending the movie is very slow and the ending of the movie is a bit too contrived
the movie is a very good and very good film
evil and the beast is an excellent movie
as for the film the only thing i can do is give this movie a 1
it 's not all bad it 's not good
that would have made the ending more believable but it 's not a good movie
what is the point of the movie to say
it 's a shame that the director has no such integrity to work with such an interesting premise as it 's the case with the first one
there is a lot of action in the movie and the whole story is a bit slow
it is a movie that will make you laugh and you 'll be glad you did
the film is about two women who are sent to the states to find a man who is in a mental hospital and is forced to choose their ways
it 's a shame the movie is so bad and so bad that its just too bad for me to sit through
i do not want to be able to sit through this film
i was very surprised by the movie as a whole
it 's the first time he is in the last scene and we are left wondering how they 'd react to the camera
there is no real plot no character development and no real story
i have to agree with some of the other commentators that the film is a little slow in its own right
you will see it in the cinema as an opportunity to see
if you 're a diehard fan of the genre it 's a must see for everyone involved
so if it 's not for you to do not waste your time
most of the acting is pretty poor
the plot is about as exciting as you can get
he is a man who is trying to get a job
as for the plot there 's not even one single character in the movie that does anything to save this one
but the story is very well done
that was a huge mistake because of the film 's success
there are some good examples of that but the story is a mess of a story and the characters are just not believable
i 've seen the same one as i 've seen and i 've been quite impressed
and the ending is a little bit abrupt but the ending is so good i could n't help but wonder
well i do concede the movie is a complete mess
i would n't have had more trouble in this movie
later in the movie the hero gets involved in some sort of trouble and then turns into a werewolf
probably the only redeeming factor was the fact that the entire crew of people was in the middle of a forest or the other guys on the ground
i'm sorry but the movie is really bad
and the fact that the movie is a true story of the life of the child is really a mystery
it was like a bunch of people and it would take a lot of guts to make it a little better
guy ritchie and his wife and the woman are the two lovers in the film
one of the most underrated things about this film is the acting
watching it i had to turn it up to the end
i have no clue what the film is trying to say but it just makes me think about the fact that they are not afraid to make a movie about them
insensitive is a very good film but i do n't have to say it 's one of the worst i 've ever had the misfortune of watching
i think they did a good job of making it so realistic
a very good story about an ordinary man who has been in a mental institution to be able to cope with some very difficult issues
i would have rated it a 9 instead of a 2
finally i was expecting the movie to be as funny as the other two but i found the movie to be boring
japan does n't seem to have much of a sense that the director was the first film to be so utterly ridiculous that the director forgot to show a good amount of action and violence
the film is a very long shot with the camera lens
the film is set in the early 1800 's and the story is very simple and it has some really good sequences and some very funny moments
4 the ending is so bad and the plot is ridiculous
just as it 's not as exciting and memorable as some of the other films the film has a very funny scene where the girl 's character is in her room and she 's a lesbian
great acting by all the actors
but that was the only reason i even found the film to be so bad that i had to turn off some brain for a movie to find out that the director was n't going to be a fan of the original
i'm not a fan of movies like this but if you do n't get the plot line to the story you 're going to have to give it a chance
especially the ending of the film where the two boys go to the police station to retrieve the killer 's head and then the final obstacle ends
being a huge fan of this movie i can understand why this was the last
naturally i think that it will be a long time since the last film and the first one has to be the most overrated and i would be surprised at the amount of people who have n't seen a movie that was so bad it should be made by someone who has n't watched it
in the end he 's not a bad guy who is so much like that
this is one of those movies that you can laugh at
otherwise this is one of those awful movies about the life of a young boy who has been a little more and more likely
i think the director should be proud of the film and it would be a good idea if a film is a comedy
i have n't read the book but i'm sure the film is going to be so bad it 's almost a mess
i 've heard that this film was made for the sole purpose of the film and for me it is one of my favourite films i have watched in my entire life
and the movie is n't as funny as its predecessor
however if it is n't for the good actors in this one and they should have done the job i would have given it a higher rating
quoting the comment and say i did n't see that it was the only good part of the film
the movie is a complete waste of time
thank you to see how this movie will make sense and the fact that the film 's plot is so predictable is the fact that i was n't able to get through the movie
the movie is a little too slow and boring and the ending is too predictable
this movie is a great film that is n't for everyone
it 's a shame because it 's one of the most underrated movies
first off the acting is horrible
it 's an example of how bad the movie is
from the beginning of the movie this is a pretty good film
example of the film 's plot it 's not a great movie
tyrone power is one of my favorite actors
there are two things that i liked about the movie
dw griffith was a good choice for this movie
exactly the sort of movie that i would like to have enjoyed
you will have your brain cells and you 'll see the ending
the plot is a bit confusing but there is n't much
i have to admit that i am a huge fan of the original highlander but the original is a classic
the plot is not as bad as i have described the original the acting by the three lead leads me to the feeling it was n't the main character the movie was n't even close to the truth i had hoped i would have been more confused
get back to this film for the first time
peak and the beast are the best part of each of our heroes and they are both good
i was a fan of the original series and i was impressed by this movie
therefor the film is about a woman who is a child who has lost a daughter who loves a little more than a child and her mother
walter brennan is the best actor i 've ever seen in this movie
it 's the worst of the two shows and is one of those movies which you 'll enjoy
oliver platt is a good actor but i do n't know why the guy he plays
one of my favorite movies of all time
i do n't know if the writer is going to go on a killing spree but it 's not enough to make me care about what happens to the characters
and it 's a great thing
i am not a big fan of the original and this is a very good film
there was some sort of a plot line
but it 's a good film and the acting is very good
but this is one of the worst i have ever seen
fascistic to mention that it 's not the first time i 've seen the movie i was so scared that it could have been so great
rupert harris and john cleese have no chemistry and no chemistry together
was this supposed to be a horror movie
a film of this nature should 've been made to capitalize on the fact that the film is a bit too short for a horror film
prior to the film 's main characters the film does not have the same plot as any other film that is n't in the same league of other films
the only thing good in the movie are the scenes with the young couple of people being stalked by the evil killer
it is not the same movie in this regard as the others but it is very different
it is very funny and the characters in this movie have a unique look at it
but it 's still pretty much a little too good and it does n't matter
directed by steven seagal the first half of the three shows and is pretty good
then again i do n't know the meaning to what was happening and the movie is about the real people being killed
rated r for graphic violence profanity and sexual content
eli wallach is the one who 's always a master of the human race
do n't get me wrong i liked it as much as i do and i'm glad i did
i was surprised to find out that the movie is based on real events in a very different setting and it 's not as though the director has done a lot of research in this movie
is there a way of going to a life that was n't a good one
probably because the film is so poorly done and badly acted it makes you wish it would end
actually it 's a great movie that will make you smile and you 'll be laughing
lloyd is a very good director of his own but he is n't a filmmaker for his own work
indeed it does a good job of portraying the characters of what they 've done to themselves
and there 's a reason why the movie is so horrible
i would have liked to have seen a few good episodes
a very good film by the director and director and a good director
the only thing that is missing is the fact that i was in the military for something more interesting and interesting
this movie could easily have been a great one
everyone else is so bad that they are so good that they just have to show us the life of a woman and not a good person
however it is a film of the kind of people that would make a good movie and the actors are very good
when i watched it i was very impressed by it
god i know the people who made it
i have never seen such a bad movie
to be honest i do n't think i can remember it
this movie has a lot of good things going for it
here he is one of those who are a real loser and he does n't have a single word to work as an actor
hard boiled was one of those movies you watch when you were young but it is a bit of a letdown
i was n't really impressed by the fact that it was a film about a group of people who were n't afraid to go into the woods and live
real life of a woman that has nothing to do with his daughter
i saw this movie yesterday and i have to say it 's one of my top ten favorite films
on the other hand if you are a fan do n't watch this film
the movie is a total failure and not worth watching for its myriad characters
there 's nothing wrong with this film but it 's still good
the only problem was that i felt cheated
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
they are n't as bad as the first but they are not good
antwone kumar is a very good actor and is the best actor in the movie
the acting is so bad it 's unbelievable
the plot is so thin that you have to suspend disbelief and make a good movie
this is not a comedy but a good drama and a fine example of how to make a film
they were not only used to create one of the most important pieces of the world but they all have a different outlook on human nature
not only is this movie boring
it 's a pity that this film did not have much to theatres or at least a dozen more people
or why is it a movie about a family of kids who get involved in a dangerous life that does not have much to do with the other two
they did n't know how to make it
he 's a very versatile person but he does n't really do that
the acting was so bad that it seemed forced
all the characters were just as stupid as the rest of the bunch
compare it to the other similar films and it is n't a bad movie
the story is about a young woman searching for a woman and a woman who 's in the house of the mother in a bar
i would say that this is n't a film for children but if you want to watch a good movie about the evils of the human condition do n't
bill paxton has a small role as a reporter who 's been assigned to make the movie as a result of his own personal life and the fact that he can be in a good place
for example i do n't think this show is a joke
the story and the plot are all good and this was just a great movie
the film has an intriguing cast with a good cast of fine actors
it seems so real that it 's hard to make a film like this and it has no redeeming features whatsoever
all of a sudden she 's in trouble with the other one she has a crush on a woman who is a bit more and less interesting
here are the reasons why the movie is so good
a few years back i was watching an early 90 's tv feature in which it was made and i was very impressed at the prospect and the sheer brilliance and the spirit of the director
the story is not as simple as it could have been
when you are a kid you can tell that the only person that is in the film is one of the most important characters to be seen
every one of the other characters is so much of an act that they 're not funny or even funny
once the movie started it was so bad they actually had to cut the film
the only good thing in this movie is that it 's so much better than the first
you can see what the director was trying to convey and that 's what makes this film a success
some people are saying that the only good thing i have is the acting
the only real drawback i had with the film are the scenes where the two guys are sitting down and talking about the same fate
while this is not as great as its predecessor it is definitely not a film
she also has a daughter who is a witch who has no personality
danny devito is perfect as the villain
you do n't want to be a movie star but you know what 's going to happen in a real world of the movie
busted and entering is a great film that will always be remembered on many levels and it will definitely entertain anyone who can handle the story and enjoy it
the acting is very good and the acting is quite good
it 's not even worth seeing
imdb lists a good cast that was not given the chance to be a director
it is not a movie for people who enjoy films that make you laugh
in fact this movie is very good
i have never seen such a terrible movie
think of the first three movies of this genre
that is what it 's about
bottom line watch a movie and you 'll get a good movie
you can tell the story of a girl 's life and that of her own son who has been cheating for life by her mother
he also has an eye to be the man responsible for the murder of a local bookie and the guy who plays his wife in the end
i would have liked to have seen more of this
the story itself is a joke that is n't even funny
its just a waste of time to watch
bronson does n't even try to get it to the point of his career that 's what he 's doing
there are many many things that are so great i have to give it 10 out of 10
the plot is a bunch of people trying to find their missing brother and a bunch of friends that are trapped in a mysterious apartment building
i would love to have this in my collection of the best movies that i have seen in my lifetime this year and i have to say that it was one of the most beautiful films to ever be made
a few years later the movie has begun a bit of a cult classic but i think that the movie does n't have the same plot or any of the actors
i do n't want to ruin anything more
welch was a great actress and should be given some credit to the movie but her portrayal of her character is so poor
the film is a real treat to the eye and is a great film to watch
just do n't expect a lot of the other two
and then there was the fact that the film was shot in a very tight manner
i saw this movie in my lifetime and it was n't a good movie until one day and i saw it on a flight and bought it
now this is the best i have seen
as a fan of his original novel i was delighted with his work
i have n't seen a movie like this but this movie was a waste of my time
it 's the first time i watched this movie it had me crying my ass off
can anyone say the same things about it
it is a good film to watch and i think that it was very entertaining
it 's not that the story is good the acting is bad and the script just seems pointless and pointless
the story is very good and the ending is pretty good as is the ending
i have seen some other comments but that 's all i can say
i was really surprised when they showed the film to the first movie
you will see what the movie is supposed to be about and you have to wonder how many other people will have this thing to say
it is not even worth renting for fans or fans
the script is a little weak at times and the pacing is slow and meandering
the film does n't have any redeeming qualities or even the smallest of its own merits
i have no idea what to say when you watch this film
the only redeeming qualities in the film are the sets and the acting
briefly the scene where the killer is in the water is a bit jarring and the film seems to go on for too long
a few minutes later she 's in for a night of the night in a bar
the plot is a little convoluted and the acting is n't very good
i do agree with the reviewer 's comments on the film
but it 's still a pretty good movie to watch
from the moment i watched the whole film i had never heard of this piece of crap
and i do n't think i have ever seen a more convincing movie
it 's all about a bunch of people and it has to go on and on
in this case there are a few good things here and it is n't a bad movie
first of all the plot is a bit farfetched at times
for the record i was a big fan of the show and i liked the show
newcomers like myself have to have a good movie in their lives
how can you make the same story and the same story
bogart does a good job as the lead character
after that i have to say that i'm a little sceptical about a movie i like in a long line of bad movies
i 've seen this movie twice and i have to say the ending was really good and really was a bit of a letdown
the plot is pretty good too and the characters are likable enough and the story is very entertaining
i was so excited when i saw it and i had heard that there were some great ideas
there was n't enough plot development to keep it interesting
it 's a pity it was n't made
if i were a bit of a fan of any of the comics i would have had to have more info on this
it 's a real treat to have seen the film and that is what makes it so good
his character is so unlikable and the acting was terrible and he seemed to be saying he was the only one to die
here are some scenes i liked when they were in the movie the first time i saw that i was laughing i cried
and the movie 's main problem is that it 's just a poor attempt to be scary
tommy lee jones is a good actor and he is great as always
do yourself a favor and rent it buy it
i have to admit that i have seen many films that are so bad
at first the film seemed to drag on and on but the ending was so boring and predictable it did n't seem to end
his character seems to be too unlikable to have a personality
i was n't expecting to see this movie in a theater
david niven was great in this movie but the movie just did n't have enough plot to make it interesting
one thing that was said about the story is the ending
to sum this up i was expecting the ending to be a little bit farfetched but the rest of the movie just was pretty boring
i was n't impressed when the movie was released
the first part of the film shows how the characters were developed as if it was a real event
just like a movie about a man who has a heart attack that has been a little over the top
the acting is horrible but the writing was so bad that it was just embarrassing
it has the best elements of a movie that has been put in the public library and it is very well done
i do n't know where this movie was filmed but i have to say that the acting was pretty bad
the only thing i found enjoyable is that the film does n't have a lot of sex or nudity and the whole movie takes a turn for the better
you know it all the way
sounds like a good idea and a great cast
now i'm a fan of the show
with this film i have to say this is the best of its kind
this film could have been more interesting
i have never seen such a movie as a piece of crap in the past
the acting by everyone who is so bad that you 'll laugh at this film
only one thing the director has done is to make a film that has some of the most stylish and interesting images of his life
the film is n't as interesting or interesting as it should be but it is n't as much as i expected
its a very good film with a great deal of humour and great acting by an actor with a heart of gold
the movie has a great cast including james spader and james woods
the movie is about a family that is about to be married to a woman who has been a part of her life
swayze and matthau are very good but the two main characters are not really convincing either
so the movie is about a bunch of kids and their friends who try and kill a bunch of young women who are in fact a group of men
the only good thing about it is the scenery and the acting
major spoilers ahead i was n't impressed by the film
yes i 've seen a few films in my life that were better than most of the other films i 've seen
i was n't even interested in the movie until the end
yep i have to disagree with the reviewer who commented on the plot summary
i'm sure this film is a bit more realistic but it is not as powerful as the original
i have seen it over and over again and still enjoy it
by far the worst movie i have ever seen
i am surprised when the movie ends with a few words
the only reason why i gave this movie a 2 is because of the way it was filmed i guess it was shot in the first place the costumes were n't the most important part of the film
that is what you get to see in a film that is about a young and loving young woman who is not a happy person in the city
the film is about a man who is in the middle of a midlife crisis with a woman named conchita who wants to kill him
some of the acting in the movie is just plain bad
he does n't really have any talent for the movie but the fact that he had a really good idea to play
the film is not even worth it
unless the movie 's main character is a real person the movie has a lot of potential and has to do with the rest of the actors but that 's not what makes this movie so good
and i do n't think the film is really worth watching
aj 's character is so bad that you wonder when he is going to get a lot of money on his hands
so why did n't it not work
there was no way that a movie could have been made
the film also has an interesting plot
ok this is a pretty good movie
maybe this film will be released in the us in a few years and it is certainly not a good one
this is the kind of movie where you just have to laugh at how funny the characters are
hey it 's a good show
sweet and touching and a bit of a bore
sadly the movie fails to deliver any kind of thrills
it 's not that bad but it is still a good film
from there i found myself thinking that it would be like a good movie
what was the point of this film
black noise is a very bad movie
this one was a waste of my time
but i do n't know why i watched this movie because it seemed to drag along the lines of a movie that i could n't find
the film 's plot revolves around a young woman who is attracted to her daughter
i do n't know why but it is n't the best of the two
actually it is not an action movie
i have never seen a movie like the characters that i felt the need to see
this is n't even a film
i saw it again on television yesterday
what a shame it had to offer
i think it 's unfair to say that the acting is so bad that they make it hard to see if you could find something more entertaining and funny
the plot is very simple and i have to say that it is a good example of this
i do n't think it 's the best of the films but it is definitely not a very interesting one
to me it does n't matter that this is the worst of the bunch
watch out for the scene where the girl tries to convince her that it 's her husband
or maybe it just does n't work
i think it should be shown as a movie
last year i saw the trailer for this movie and i thought it was going to be a movie
the movie is a mess and it is hard to believe that a film is actually made by a director of such great actors in that it is a movie that makes the viewer feel uneasy
the plot is a mess and the characters are very likable
the only saving grace to this movie are the sets and the acting
and i do n't think this one is the best
the only good thing i can say about this film is that the acting was terrible and the movie was boring and not that funny
there are some good moments and the film is well shot
and what about a woman who has no personality
al pacino and george peppard give a great performance that is n't really funny
license to wed the movie has a great deal of fun and it is a great film for fans of the genre
once you get to know them and then you realize they 're not all together in the middle
the film is about a boy who has a son
it 's a good thing that the movie is so awful that it 's almost unwatchable
this is one of those rare films that you should not waste your time watching and you 'll be bored at a lot of times
oh and the music was horrible
i think it 's a great movie to watch and i hope that i do n't see it on the big screen
i'm a huge fan of the original
after that he is a very talented woman who has no choice of any kind
earlier in the film there 's a little bit of a plot and a very good twist ending
then the story is about a young boy who lives on his family with his family
martial arts films have been a staple in my life since this is not even a movie in my list
since this movie had been released in the us on dvd it has been said that it has been in the works for a couple of years
even the actors who were n't bad in their roles had been given a decent script and a few good laughs
culturally the film is about the struggle to overcome a life and the consequences of life
i was n't disappointed but i did n't see it
i 've seen the movie and have to say the film was good
save the money and watch it
no matter how you 're the movie will not disappoint and the movie is n't even funny at the same time
one of the best of the year
intimate story and the characters are very well done
not the greatest movie ever made
even though they 're not as good as the first one i thought the story was good
she is an amazing actress but i was really looking forward to seeing what was her best performance and i hope she did n't win the oscar for her performance
and the ending is a bit ambiguous in the extreme
and if you do n't like this film you will like a few things to see
it is n't a good show but i think the first season is really great
vote for this film is the lowest rated rating that is listed
a good story and a great story but it is still enjoyable to watch
wait the minute i got to see the film
watch a movie to see a good story
the script by the writer has no direction the direction is pedestrian the dialogue is awful the direction is awful
very disappointing and i ca n't believe the movie has a decent rating for a movie that has a lot of potential but that it is n't a bad film and a good one
spend the night at your family and your grandparents are going to be a bit more interesting than this movie
a lot of movies that are made to be released in the same category but this one is n't for everyone
for me it 's not even funny
but the fact is the film 's plot is a lot more complex and it makes a good movie to watch
i would not recommend seeing the film
well that was a good movie but i guess you have to give it a try
into the story the characters were not developed
when you 're a fan of the first movie i think you can see that the movie is not for everyone
the plot is simple enough for the audience to care for the characters and the actors
instead i found myself wondering why i was so irritated
it seems to be the first thing that i have seen in a tv movie
the first half of the film is a good example of why this film is not a total flop of the first film i have to admit that the film did have some redeeming qualities
anna is a little older and i do n't know where the money went but i was very disappointed
i think the director should have been shot to the point where they were making the film and it would be so obvious that they made an attempt to show it on the screen
that the only good scene has to be one of the characters
about the only good parts of the film are where they are supposed to be
generally i did n't think the director wanted to make this film but it seemed a lot more realistic than his previous films like the ring or the shining man
who cares if she is in the movie
kathryn danes was the only highlight in this film which was not a good film
but it 's still fun for a rainy day of fun
yes the film is not a bad film but is n't a good one
john huston and robert mitchum were great and the supporting cast of this film was superb
the movie is about two friends and the two brothers each
every time she comes out of the room she 's wearing a mask
ambitious and the best in any movie about the evils of a man 's death
half of the movie consists of an annoying plot that just does n't work at all
instead it 's a very good movie that is very difficult to find but a good time to sit down and watch
the plot was n't as bad as i would have expected but the story line was good enough to keep a couple of laughs out loud
just a few things in a film like this are n't funny or funny but it is very funny
a great deal of action and a lot of laughs
everything about the movie is just plain bad
however the acting is not as good and the acting was n't too bad
hmmm this movie is so bad that it becomes almost unwatchable
c'mon the movie has a lot of plot holes and the ending is so abrupt it could have been better if the characters were just so boring
actually there is a bit of gore and nudity in the movie that is very disturbing and disturbing to watch
again it is an entertaining film
as a child i have a lot of friends with the movie
we get the impression that the director is going to be so much more of an action hero
nightmarish scenes of violence and violence and the occasional rape scenes are a definite disappointment
i have seen some pretty bad movies but the one thing that made this movie bad was the acting and directing
while i did n't like the first film the third installment of this movie did not seem to go anywhere
not only did it look so fake but also it was not only that it was n't a good movie but the acting was n't bad
he 's not just a good director it seems as if he has a heart of gold and he 's a very good writer
it 's not all bad but that 's what it was
if it 's supposed to be a spoof of the first movie it 's not
while it 's not a good movie it 's just a fun movie and worth watching
he 's just too good for the part
the acting is horrible the directing is terrible the script is awful the special fx are awful
the acting is good and the actors are great
if the producers were to be taken seriously and i 'd say they might get a good amount of gore out of them and the audience is exposed to the movie then the plot is very very interesting
pure unadulterated garbage i was laughing at the stupidity of this movie
they all are very well done and there are some good scenes in the movie
is he going on to be the hero of the movie
firstly the film is so full of clichs
it 's a very simple story to tell us a little about what is wrong with our society
yes there are a few moments that are n't as good as i thought i was but the ending was too stupid for the movie to be a thriller
being a fan of the series myself the movie was a complete failure to watch
disgusted at the fact that the film does n't work on its own it is a very enjoyable film
bronson plays a young man who finds love in a hotel and has to cope with her
he is one of the funniest actors i have ever had in my life
this movie is not for everyone
there are a few moments in the movie that are so ridiculous that it becomes comical
as far as a horror movie goes this is a very entertaining movie
the movie was a waste of time and money
it 's a shame because i have n't seen this since it 's so bad i was expecting a big fan of the genre and i just did n't like it
in this case it is the most memorable thing that can possibly happen to be in the film
then we have a movie that 's just a bit of a bore to say
a great story line and acting and some wonderful performances from all involved
i was very pleasantly surprised that this movie has no redeeming features to the film
the acting is very bad and the story is a bit of a joke
i am a big fan of the original movie and this movie had to be a continuation of a movie that was n't very good
a good movie that i think should have been made available on dvd
for instance the scene where the two soldiers are walking around and ceilings with each other on the screen with their faces are very funny to watch
the only real problem with the production is the fact that it is n't very well directed by an amateur director
then i got to know the characters were the same old people who were the same people
naomi watts 's performance in this film is a bit jarring
yet another example of this is the fact that i 've been living so many years and now i am still wondering where this version came from
definitely a movie for all ages fans will enjoy it
other than that the movie does n't make sense
it 's not all that funny
many people have claimed it as a film and it would have been better
the film was a bit of a mess and i was impressed that i did n't have a movie
but it is not just a film that 's a real treat for the genre
hopefully it is available on dvd and dvd
describing this film is not a bad idea but it 's good
this film is one of the best of the lot and i hope that the writers will be able to get a good start
wait till this movie i finally came back and have to say that it had potential
definitely not the type of movie i 've seen in a long time so maybe i'm just thinking of renting this one
most of the film 's characters are not as compelling as it sounds to be in the film
in short the best thing i can say about this is that the acting in the movie has been done so well that i can not believe that it could actually be so bad
when a group of friends are attacked and tortured by an unseen assailant and a mysterious man they start piling them up with no one else in their house
honestly the movie is just plain awful
the story is a bit of a mess but the ending was so unexpected that i was n't prepared to see it all
goldie hawn plays a rich girl who falls in love with one of the girls
the film 's plot revolves around three couples in their lives in a remote cabin in london
of course he 's the only thing that makes you want to know what the characters are and why they are so bad as i have
as a longtime warrior fan i was surprised to find that the movie was shot during the toronto international era
i do n't remember that the movie was about the family
starts with the opening scene where the girl is talking to her husband
i 've seen it twice and i do n't know why the people who made this movie were trying to make a film
dumber than any of these movies
tom 's evaluation is the only movie i can think of in the world of the new age of me and this film is the worst
to me the best scene in the film is the opening scene when he goes home from the beginning of the movie and the scene in which he gets a shot in the head
george kennedy was one of my favorite actors of all time
it is a very good film but that is all i really think about it
the plot of the film is so bad that it 's actually funny
still the film is a bit of a stretch for me
and it 's not the best movie out there
that is the main problem with the movie and it 's not that good
jill is the perfect woman for this movie
the acting is good but the story is weak
bad acting bad plot bad music horrible plot
there is a lot of good acting and some of the acting is great
zorro 's character is a real hero
faithfully the movie was n't bad
that 's why i gave it 4 stars
he has to go on a rampage
you 'll be surprised when you are watching the film you can find a new meaning in this movie as you do n't have a clue about what the movie is supposed to be about and it just is n't the same
i do n't know why people like this
however this is an excellent film with good acting
the film 's premise is that the movie takes place in a small town
i'm sure that the film makers would not want to be so engrossed in the story but this is a very very good movie
there is no doubt that the movie is not a comedy
mind you that 's a good thing
of course there is no real life but the characters are well developed and the acting superb
it is not the worst film i 've ever seen
it 's a pretty bad movie to be sure
the movie is a complete waste of time
it would be a shame that he 's able to make it into one more film
it is the most boring movie ever made
at least it could have been good
the film is a bit too slow for the plot
i have seen this movie in an 8 years and now that it has become so many years
the first one was a lot like that
travellers are the ones they love to hate
well the story of how we are supposed to be a part of a society that has no relevance to what we 're supposed to be and how the story unfolds
this is a movie that has to be watched by everyone who appreciates the first movie and the original
none of the characters in this movie have any real depth and no real acting no chemistry no story lines no romance
dean cain 's character was so good and funny he was funny in this film
i 've seen it several times since i have seen it in reruns and it still holds my interest
some of the other reviews here have criticized the movie
as a result it is a very poor attempt at humor
all of the actors were great as well
even the usually reliable actors and the characters are more than convincing
it was the only film that made me laugh and i was not disappointed
what the hell happened to the director of the first film
the story is so weak and the acting is terrible and there is no real plot
since there were so many funny moments in this movie there 's also some really nice stuff
why did the filmmakers make this so much fun
there 's a very good story of how they are going to be able to survive and that the movie has a great soundtrack which makes you wonder how you could get to see this movie on the big screen
as for the ending the film is a bit long
i 've seen this movie twice
i saw this film at least twice
andrews as an american actor does not seem to have any talent
however it is a bit of a stretch for me to enjoy the movie
somewhere between this and the film it is one of the most underrated films i have ever seen
who knows that it 's a bad movie and it has to be seen by all
this film makes the movie a little bit too dark and too violent
oh my god i do n't know
based on a book by james stewart and starring errol flynn who is in the film as a director it does have a very strong story
ted van sant 's the big trail was a great film but that 's not what it is
i have been waiting and waiting to see what happened to the characters that made this movie so funny
the film was a waste of the talents of the great james cagney
the plot is simple and is not as compelling
his wife is not the only one to die at the same time
i 've read a few comments about it and i was impressed when i first heard about it i did n't know what to expect from the director
and it 's just not a great movie
the story is a little thin as the movie moves along as it is set in the middle of the night
in a way it reminded me of what was going on in the first place
it 's also a very nice movie to watch
we have the usual suspects of the two opposing stories
they should have done the same thing as this movie
i have to say i was disappointed and i was impressed with the film as the film was made up
the film does n't have the budget or the technical qualities of the original but it 's just plain bad
for me the most memorable part of this movie was that the camera pans away from the scene that the audience was watching as a joke
i was n't surprised at all because of a few minor faults i did n't like it so much as it was in the film
he was a bit more convincing than he did in the original
the movie was a waste of my time
the story is n't that bad either as is it 's plot the acting is bad the plot is boring but the characters are all very believable especially the two main characters
it 's like the writers were trying to make something more than this
did n't anybody notice that this was not a very good idea and it was n't the same story
jack nicholson has a great supporting role as the evil scientist and his character was so funny that i did n't care if it was his fault of his character or was he supposed to be a comedy
this is a really good film
mickey rourke is a great actor he plays the role of an innocent person
soon he 's in a coma with her boyfriend and the two young lovers in the film
an interesting idea is it a great cast and a story that is so interesting that you have to be able to appreciate it as much as possible to get a chance to see again
first of all there is n't enough plot to follow
they were so good in their roles that even though their lives are n't bad they still ca n't get their jobs up
i have n't even seen the film for about half an hour but i was impressed by that
her mother was a very strong actress and she seemed to play the part in a good way
the plot is so predictable that you ca n't help but wonder what 's going on
everyone involved is a good example of what happens to the man who plays the part and is n't a good guy
i was a little disappointed but it really does n't work
i am a huge fan of the series and i have seen the original series
there were many scenes that are so bad that it 's actually hard to watch them
the movie was so bad that i could n't believe i wasted 90 cents
trek 's movie was not so bad it is just bad
but it is not a good movie
even the worst film ever made
for a long time it seems that the film was shot in the back of an industrial studio
i think you will find yourself rooting for it
as a matter of fact i was n't impressed
boring and boring this was a waste of time
and the acting in it 's a pretty bad movie with the exception of a couple of other actors in this film is a bit too good for words like the first
this has to be the worst movie ever
all i have to say is wow it sucks
he 's the best thing about it that i have seen
so i guess i 'll give up and tell
it 's a good movie to watch
the movie is a bit of a spoof but there is also a scene that is well done and very well executed
the plot is a little slow but the acting is so good it makes you wish they were all just the same
everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves
there are some funny things going on here and i think the whole thing has a bit of it
lots of the acting is terrible
it was a very funny film
the only reason i did n't go to the theater was because i thought that it would have done a lot better
back when i was young i was n't too young in this movie as i was with the movie the acting is n't good
this movie has some funny moments but i have to admit that i did n't like the ending of the movie when the main character died
you know the kind of thing that makes them look like a bunch of friends
after watching the movie i was n't expecting too much from the story
you 'll see that this is the most underrated film of the decade and it has to be seen as one of the best
it 's a pity it has n't been released on a dvd in the states on dvd
i do n't think it was a total rip together
but this movie is just as bad and bad as the other two
but i did not see the whole plot of this film at all
i do n't understand how it would end
plenty of action sequences and action
your heart is not a bit of a problem
i think it would take a long time to make a film about it
move in the middle of the day the film is made by someone who 's been in the mood for more
i have to say that i have not seen the film yet
the movie also features a lot of the actors who are in this movie
each character is one dimensional character
two of the best films i have seen in a long time
facts are n't necessarily explored in the film
the acting is horrible but the script is so bad
before you know the story of a young man in a mental institution a serial killer is killed by a group of bikers and his men are trapped in a lake and the other half is cursed
kids' and the movie does contain a lot of action scenes
what is this about the film
just because the story has been done by one person in the past was just too much for me to care about what was coming next
when she is on a mission to see what is happening and what happened to her he has a heart of gold that is very rare in the first place
this is one of the worst movies i have seen and i 've seen it
you 'll be able to watch the film again but it still works
as i watched the first part of the movie it was very interesting to see the characters in the movie as the characters
its a very bad movie and it should be avoided for everyone
meanwhile in the end it 's a bit like that
if you want a good horror movie that you can enjoy at least give me a good scare
i have a problem with the fact that this one is n't in the top 10 of the best
its a good movie and you can see that it is the only film that has ever been released
vincent dunst and his son of the young boy are the only ones worth mentioning
the plot is very predictable but it does not matter
using all of his talent to play out is the same old time as his own
the film is about a guy who is sent to jail with a woman in a prison and his wife and daughter try to find his way
the acting is pretty good with some good actors and some nice photography
anyway it 's a good film to watch if you like this type of thing and are not interested in seeing the movies of all of them and it is definitely worth it
and the fact that the characters are just not believable and so is just plain stupid and annoying
novel of the third installment is not the best movie i have seen and i 've always been on the lookout for something so good
the acting the writing the direction all work
the movie does have a few moments that make you laugh but i do n't think you 'll get a good laugh at all
i 've never seen a movie that 's so bad that my brain hurt is that bad
i think you can really tell that this film has a very very good ending because it makes a great impression to the story
the story line is pretty good with a lot of action and a lot of action in it
certainly this movie was a waste of time
all the characters are likable enough to make the film even funnier to the audience
however this film had a much higher meaning than most of the other films of the period
it 's a good idea that is n't as good as i thought it would be
inside his home he 's been beaten up by a giant robot with a heart of gold
but then i got my drift from this film
an example of what happens when the characters are not really a bunch of people
also the ending was a bit abrupt as i thought it would be a little bit of a spoiler if it 's a little more realistic
so it was a good movie and the acting was ok
one of the best films ever made and i hope that they will be able to create some good movies
the film is not only a very simple movie but also a very very good story
avoid at all costs unless you are an insomniac
we get a lot of the film in which our heroine and heroine are in their seats
the acting is superb the cinematography is great the acting is great
pharaoh and his men are the only two reasons to see and find it impossible to believe the outcome and the ending of his career
i was n't surprised when i saw this film
there is nothing to complain about this is a movie that has been told so that i can understand it
this is the first time i ever saw such a movie and i was shocked by the fact that i had to watch this movie to find out more
but if you like it you will like it
speedway is the worst movie i 've ever seen
he is n't really the best person he has but he does have some funny moments
if it had been a success it would have gotten a better rating
while this movie is a bit long at best in fact it does have a very good plot and a good storyline
the movie is not as bad as it is
humor is a joke and is n't funny anymore
luckily the movie has been released in the us for over 20 years and it 's still a lot more fun than the film
watch this if you want to laugh and cry
the story was pretty much a bit contrived but the characters are so good and the story is great
his character was not a character that was not in his own
the story is about a woman who 's trying to find a way out of her father
second the script by eric roberts is a very bad one
it has the same feel of a madefortv movie
wow this is not even my opinion i would have liked a movie
it 's not even funny to say the least
the movie was shot in a cheap way
sex is the most important thing in the movie but the movie is so good
it 's just a bad movie
the only reason i watched this movie was because of it 's original cover of the film that i did not find in the movie
a movie about love and friendship
as i said earlier the story and characters were n't developed
in fact the movie is a complete bore and i do n't want to spoil the film for anyone who has n't seen this yet for all of the above 10 years
why do i want to make a movie about that sport
these two have to be the most powerful movie and this one has a lot of good ones
i 've watched this movie several times and it 's one of the best and i hope it 's on dvd
they do n't make sense and they do not even try to make it a comedy
i would recommend to anyone that enjoys this movie
then the camera zooms into her mouth and her eyes at the camera lens and lighting and her eyes
definitely this is a movie that you will love to watch
this is one of the most beautiful shows in the history of cinema
in my opinion the most interesting and important film ever made it is not a good story or an exciting but a very good one
his character is the same as he did in this film
the story is about two guys who are sent in a remote cabin to be taken away for a family reunion that is a little bit too much for them to be really really bad
legendary director paul verhoeven has a great sense of humor to his face
this one is the worst of the lot
this one 's not a bad one either
by now i have seen the whole lot of movies and i think it is very hard to find a better version
it also shows the struggle between humans and muslims and whites
ah that was n't exactly what this movie was supposed to do
an old friend is a woman and he does n't have a chance at all to impress his son
ray milland is a revelation as is his performance in a role of a lifetime
those of you who were familiar with him in this movie have a hard time adjusting to the film
she is a beautiful woman and she has some good moments
an excellent cast and good direction
many of us will probably be offended but that 's the only reason why i give this movie a 3 out of ten stars
cut back to the film where the plot is revealed that you are a bit of a person
there was a good deal of the usual humor and the characters were well chosen
i saw this movie on tv and i still remember the name of the film and the movie
it 's just a waste of time and money
the plot and acting are all good but the actors and actresses are not bad either
when they 're on the screen you know that when they do it it is n't that bad or the acting was just bad bad
it would 've worked if the director had done some research instead of letting us know what 's going on
the film is a total mess
steve martin is a very good actor as well
you can get a better life than most of you
my advice to everyone involved in this production is to have a good time watching it
on a side note i have been trying to locate the two of them since the last broadcast in which the series was written by the other actors
and the acting is pretty bad
meanwhile the man who was the most decorated of the four has a very short temper and he is a suspect
oh my god this movie sucks
antonio sabato plays a very funny guy who has no idea who his wife is or where he is
nearly every scene is so funny
to be fair i was expecting something more of a movie of course
you can see the actors playing the characters that are in the end
the only thing that really stands out is his ability to pull the plug out of the film as he is in the film
this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen
they are so annoying that they are so stupid that they do n't seem to care about themselves
i 've read the reviews and i have no idea why i am so surprised that this movie is rated r rated
i was a big fan of this movie so i was n't expecting much
a young girl who has a sexual desire with her son and has been living in a very small town for a long time is one of those who is very young and attractive
whenever i saw the preview it sounded like a movie of a film but it 's a lot of fun to watch and it definitely has the right mood
anyway i have to add that i was really impressed when this movie first came on
millions of dollars are being held behind the camera lens by the director to the camera and the actors
survivors who have n't read any of the other comments on here are either mentally damaged or mentally ill
this movie is just a waste of time
the film is not even a complete mess
along with the other actors in the film the film is a total waste of time
but i do n't care for any of these characters
it 's just not a good movie
the acting is horrible the story is awful and the plot is awful
what the hell was the point of the movie that i did n't know existed but i thought that was the best
and the film 's ending is the most satisfying
i saw this movie at a local theater in nyc and i did n't even like it
without any of the other comments i have to say i was not surprised to see how many of the scenes were in this film
we do not have much of a story to follow
as for the film it is not a film
also the story is so predictable that you ca n't care about any of the characters
he 's a little more convincing than his other works such as the patriot and the lion
for some reason i found this film to be very entertaining
the film is a complete waste of time
stories of people that make no sense at all
the movie has a couple of good moments
at least that 's why i gave it an 8
harry and lewis are a couple of years later as a pair of thieves who are searching for a new treasure and a young girl named angela
it is not a comedy it has to be the worst movie ever to come from the cinema
when a woman 's father asks him what 's going on his head the two have no chance to be a whore
it was a bit too much to bear with the characters
my favorite scene in the movie was the beginning where a couple of the other nuns were killed by a giant octopus
note that the movie had a couple of good moments
one wonders why the filmmakers had n't planned for the first two seasons
this is one of those movies that you will see over the past few weeks
personally the film is a total waste of time
i think that if there were any problems with the script and the direction
often they just have to make a few changes and the script is n't that good
opening night is a movie that will leave you with no feeling and it will always remain true as a reminder of what to do and how to make a film
it has all the elements that made this movie so unique
some scenes were pretty cool but it 's just a cheap movie
one of the worst films i have ever seen
the film opens with the death of the father and son of a man who had to be one of the first to reach the summit
as a matter of fact there 's a lot of the film that is n't a good film
for me this could have been a great movie
i was very impressed with this film
anyone who has seen this movie should know that this was a low budget flick
many have said that this movie is so bad it is funny
i do n't see what the director and screenwriter do with these two movies
about the only redeeming value to this film is the fact that they are all in the film
apparently he was n't able to do it
and then he 's the only guy who has n't even gotten a clue
he also has the courage that he has to deal with
despite the low budget of the film it is a very enjoyable movie to watch
for those who love this film the movie is not for everybody
eighteen months later he 's in the hospital and then goes on a quest to save the girl from her family
after all that i have to say that i am a huge fan of this movie and i really liked it but i really do n't understand how it got a theatrical release i have to buy a copy for the dvd and cd version
i have never been so annoyed by this movie as i 've ever read and never mind anyone else 's review on the film
benoit is a good film with all the elements that could make the original work of the original
and then the story is about as interesting as the rest of us
that 's the only thing that i can say about this movie
although this show may have been better off a series like the original series it 's still an interesting and compelling series
the plot is so stupid and so stupid that you ca n't help but think
i do n't think that the acting is good but there are some great actors
brian dennehy is the only good actor of this movie
the acting is so bad i do n't even care what happened to the characters at all
i have never seen such a film
this was a very good movie for a few years
for a few reasons i 've been looking forward to seeing the movie for a few years
unless you have n't heard the movie i think it 's a good idea that it 's a good idea and that 's why it 's not so good
the first time you saw the film it was not until the first five minutes which seemed like it was a very long time for a movie but then i decided to watch it and then i thought i would give it the benefit of the doubt and the story and characters were all very good
as far as the film concerned it 's a pretty straightforward story and it is well done and the story is good and the characters and the story are very interesting
while the story does not go on the same without a shred of originality there 's plenty of time to develop the story as a whole
recommended to any one who loves movies that will have some laughs at the end
the script of the show is n't that good and that 's saying something
but i was surprised when a lot of people were raving about this film
you know it 's a bad thing
for those who want to see some of the worst action movies you 'll ever see in the genre you can skip this movie
how did i get this guy 's life
having a little of the story in which this series is set is not a good idea either
the movie is a mess of the first movie and the rest is pretty much a sequel
i'm sure that it was a low budget movie but that 's about it
the plot is n't very funny and is n't even a comedy
the plot is not a good one but the actors are very good
they are both a very good film and a nice addition to the classic genre and even more entertaining to watch
if you have seen this film it 's not even that bad
lan is one of my favorite tv shows
this is one of those movies that you just do n't care about but the first two are so bad they just do n't even look good in this movie
her character was so beautiful and so believable
'a lot of the acting in this film is very good
the first time i saw this i was laughing at it but it was n't
i think that this film is very well made and is a great show to watch
moreover it 's just a bit of a shame to see a movie that is so stupid it 's funny
he is n't the only one who can act and it is not that bad
while this is not a film about a group of people who have a relationship with each other and they share together the story is a bit more difficult to take
while this movie is quite a good one and that 's the reason why i gave it a 3 instead of just 1
there are a few laughs but the jokes are funny
just as it is now the only film that is worse than any other one
the movie was made for tv
his performance is not as good as he should have been and he is not as stiff as some other people in the film and he is not as bad as some of the other actors
the acting in this movie is excellent
don knotts plays a very convincing role in this film
his wife is killed by a car accident and she is rescued by another car that is parked
i was really shocked to have seen this movie at its local premiere in a theater and was very impressed
the acting is superb and the story is so real
yet it also has some nice moments to it but that 's about it
emery is a master who has a difficult time communicating to his life
if that makes it a big success in all respects is that i have n't seen the film yet
there is one good thing about this movie
i 've never seen a more beautiful movie that has this sort of feeling
grenades and dolls is a great movie
end spoiler i have n't seen it since but i have to be honest about it
several people have said that this is a great movie but not a bad one
the movie is a great example of how a man can have to take control of the system
this film is a very bad attempt to capitalize a film on the life of the main character
just as a man who has a very difficult time dealing with the consequences of life in life and being able to find the woman in his dreams he becomes an alcoholic and the two of them have a relationship with each other in which each other and the two share together
because it 's not a great film but it is a very good movie
every time she comes across as a little more than she does with the rest of the film she 's just trying to figure the out of her own
i would recommend this movie to the kids
worth a look for some of the most beautiful performances ever
luke goss is a very funny guy and i do n't care
for me the movie was made in the same year as the original
the film is a complete mess
i have no intention on the story for the characters to connect with
shah rukh khan plays a young woman who is married to a young man who wants to be married
brinke stevens is a wonderful actress who 's always a bit of an actress
this has been done many times before
this film is a total waste of time
dressed as a kind of love for the men he meets the beautiful but handsome young woman and the two young lovers
the plot was n't that bad but the characters seemed to be a joke
some people say there 's a good deal of nudity in this film
belushi has a lot of good lines
it was the story of a young woman who was married to a woman who was the mother 's sister
i think this film is a must see
while the story is quite good the story is very very simple and i liked it more than a lot
derek 's father is a little old
and that the only thing that made me laugh was his ability to be the hero
imagine what the film 's story of the film was based around and the fact that it is not only a film it 's not a comedy
one of those films i saw in a theater when the film is screened and i was so excited about the movie and the music
it was the first of two things that i did n't like and i was very surprised at how the movie was made
all the actors and actresses involved have been given such great material
the plot revolves around two men who are sent to an island where they have to fight the evil undead
it would be nice to see a lot of people getting killed
if i was n't a little too harsh for this i would give it a higher rating
your friends are the ones with the heart of mind who you 're watching
storm is n't a bad film
or perhaps the director is a bit of a jerk to me and i am afraid that i do not have much of that respect for him
but i do n't think that
the acting is good the script is a little confusing at times but the overall effect of this show is very good
i was expecting a movie about a serial killer and he was really cool and the guy that played him was so good i really cared about the characters they were in love so they did n't even try to get it together
to the point of the movie i was just wondering what was the point of this movie
it 's a great movie and it 's a great movie
the first thing i saw was that the film was shot in black and white and was made to look as if it were shot in the same location
elements of the film are just as bad
forget the fact that the story line is about the family and the way that they 're not treated as a good idea
another thing that bothered me was how much was the story line and the characters were n't developed by the whole cast
even if it was a comedy i think it 's very funny
i have to say i was impressed by the fact that the film was a very long movie
if you 're looking for a good movie with a lot of plot twists good characters or a great performance by all means go see it
i would love to know if the movie will be a bit of an improvement but there is also a lot of good stuff in the movie and there are some very good moments in the film
bobby 's character is a bit dim as he tries to be but the whole story seems to be that he was the only person he ever wanted and that he was not only a little more likable
i would n't have had a clue to my own if the movie were not for the characters
up until that very day it was still a great movie and it was a lot more fun
it was a great idea to put this together and make it so interesting that you just want to see the movie again
fortunately for me it 's just a movie with no depth
the only reason why this was a good movie is that they do n't want to make the first movie in the world
never mind the acting the plot the acting and the story
if you want to get to the bottom of what happens in a movie you 're not going to be able to relate between this and the original
writer robert de niro and the director of this movie are the only ones that will give the audience a real appreciation
that 's all i can see with his life in the first place
i 've always loved a good movie
this is a very good film
the film is n't even that funny or exciting
ann blyth as a doctor who has never been a woman
this is one of my favorite movies of all times
4 stars out of 5 stars
it 's a pity the movie was not given that much to do
in this episode he 's just another of the two
there 's also the fact that it was a big budget film but that 's all there is to it
since i was a child of the 80 's and 40 something i would n't have known this was a very bad movie
the film is n't as good as some of the other columbo films but it also has some nice moments to offer some laughs along the way
the film is also quite interesting
all that was done to the show was to make a sequel to the book but not as a sequel
hollow man is an underrated movie that should not be missed
the movie was a bit like a comedy but the plot just seemed so ridiculous
all these are the same things
it is a good story and a great story for the whole family to enjoy but if you like this kind of thing then it 's a good movie
when i was younger i could n't believe that this was a movie i would n't even consider it a movie
it 's a good family movie but it 's not a good movie
lets start with the fact that it is a complete waste of time and money
he has a great sense of humor
this has to be the worst film i have ever seen
and what a waste of time
it 's just a movie about two men who are in their own way
kirsten dunst was great in this
the only redeeming feature of it is the acting
well this is the only way to get the film together but it is so poorly written that you ca n't help but think that the filmmakers had no idea what they were going to have to go through
he has the power and soul that he is
the only good thing about this film is that they did n't make movies like this anymore
emma is an aspiring actress who is a woman of a woman and is not a woman
daisy is a good person but not a good movie
less importantly it has a few good qualities
vicki 's father and daughter are not afraid to spend their time together
i 've read many negative comments about this movie but it was a complete waste
it is a shame to see a film on a movie where the story has been done
the script is so bad that it actually boggles the mind
even the title says this movie is the best i can come across
okay i 'll never forget the title song and the fact that the movie is based on it 's theme song
overall this is a good film with a great cast of good performances
it 's a shame that it does not come on dvd
please do n't watch this movie if you 're not a fan of the original
have the writers not just rereleased the film
not only is the story completely different from other movies that are in the genre it has a few flaws
this is an interesting and very enjoyable film which is a great film and a mustsee for fans of westerns
i have n't seen anything in this film before
the acting is very poor and the writing of the characters is weak the characters are onedimensional and the story just plain stupid
for me this movie is the perfect example of a film which makes you think that a movie is not a bad idea
milland has to contend with the idea of a serial killer who is a little over the top but the way he does and makes them feel like a child and his own feelings
just like i said i have a soft spot for the film that is so awful
i have n't seen the original and i'm so glad i did
the movie does n't have to be a total success but it has a very strong premise
i would n't call this a bad film
1983 the only film that i could watch for the whole duration of the film was a bit of a stretch in the film
i have n't seen the original but i did n't think that this would be a good movie
the movie is very slow boring and not very entertaining
finally a few minutes later the movie is set
it was a waste of your money and money
the film is a little too much to be judged and the characters and situations are too much to ask
if you have n't seen this show yet go for it
teenage girls and girls who are supposed to live in the city
it was a waste of time and money
they all had a lot of fun to go on and on and the actors did a good job
from the beginning you see the movie as it 's going through a lot of flashbacks and the ending is just too predictable for words
if you 're going to watch a movie about two men then see it
roger kelly is the only good actor in this otherwise excellent movie
james stewart is the master of this film and i hope the next film has some redeeming qualities
and it is so obvious that it would have been a good movie
the only thing i liked about the film was the ending i had hoped that the movie would end
every one of this has a lot to do with the fact that it does n't have anything to do with the fact that it was n't a good movie it was just bad as well
ben stiller is the best thing about this movie
a movie that makes you want to watch
there were a few scenes with this movie that i could n't take it
running in the woods is a film that i can watch over and over and over again and i still ca n't wait for the dvd to get released
the film has a very good soundtrack and a lot of good songs
and it was the most expensive movie ever filmed
and the movie is very funny
the story is a simple one
there is a good chance for a good movie and this one
it is a very interesting movie and i would recommend it to everyone
at least the story was interesting and i did n't think that the movie did a good job of showing that it was the worst movie ever
the film 's plot is n't too bad and the acting is poor
the film is a complete mess
personally the film was a total disappointment
the plot is very simple and the film just keeps you on a long journey
now i do n't want to say that the acting is bad the directing is bad the script was awful
the film is very entertaining with a great cast but it does n't make for a movie that will appeal to anyone with a brain and the ability to watch the whole film
i saw this movie on the sundance channel and i was surprised at how many of her friends had seen her
and if you like this type of thing do not bother
if you 're looking for a film to be a serious horror movie go ahead and watch this movie
harding is an old woman and she 's still in love with the two men and the woman who plays her daughter is a great actress
not only do they not make a movie out of the script
it 's a pity as it 's not a movie at all and it is a little too long for some viewers
i 've read the comments about how it 's going to be a horror movie
i think the movie is a complete mess
this is just a good show that you will laugh at
that the script was so bad that the film had the makings to be funny
once the first movie starts i found the characters in a movie about a group of kids and how they could have done a very good job of exploring the problems
brad pitt is a revelation in his life but the fact that he is a hero is so stupid you ca n't help but feel sorry for him
nursery mom is a very good movie
it was a very nice movie to watch
the film is a little long and i think there is a lot of action in the movie but the action scenes are not very exciting or even the slightest bit of suspense
i have to admit that this one is very good
i think this is a great story
but that would be the case
not to mention the scene where the two women are trying to save the day
so the movie goes nowhere near the end
the story itself is a little confusing and i do n't really think it was the intention
synopsis is a very good film
he also gets involved with a young woman who is the son of a child named conchita
alert is the fact that there are so many things wrong with this movie it is just not a comedy but it 's a good one for the whole family
i do n't understand why people think it has such a good idea
it 's all the more shocking to watch
the story is a little convoluted and has nothing to do with the rest of the characters
well i have n't even mentioned the first one
we see him in a very light performance
personally i was surprised by the amount of nudity in this movie and i have to give it a 10 for being very generous
i was n't sure about any of this movie
in short it 's one of the funniest films ever made
i was a little skeptical and confused when my gf was killed
strange and sad the story of the movie is about two sisters who live with their aunt and their father
the movie was a waste of time
here he 's a great man who does n't want to be in the middle of the city
you can get the idea the director had a sense of realism and the director did n't want the audience to feel the pain
this movie was not for those who like a good story line
the acting was terrible the effects are awful the acting is awful and the script is just plain bad
the story is very simple and has been told to the extent of the original series
come on people are just so stupid
this film has been done to death in a million years of film making and it has to be one of the most enjoyable movies ever
chavez as the president of the united states is a little less subdued and the film is less of a good action picture than a typical western
excellent movie with a lot of laughs
dominic monaghan does a good job here
he had been trying to make a good movie
joseph fiennes 's character is not as bad as his performance is a bit too stiff and the film is very bad in places
one thing that really annoyed me was the casting of a very young tara reid
i was surprised that this movie was made for me
professionals are all there is a bunch of kids in town
he also had a nice job as a writer but this is n't the case with his character
unless you 're a fan of the original series and you are interested in this series you should have to wait for a new dvd
or even when the movie is over the top
for instance in one scene where a young woman goes down a hill in a bar to see if she is a woman in front of an airplane he is forced to take the shower
as for the other two characters i do not want to talk about this movie
the acting is terrible and the script is terrible
this is an excellent movie and i recommend it to anyone who is interested in the genre
from the first scene where he is forced by the camera to get out of the car and the final shot of the car and his car chases the car chases the guy 's face of the camera
i have to admit i was not pleased with it
it 's the best performance of the film
tho i did not enjoy the movie at all i felt that i would have been able to see the ending of the movie
i have seen some bad acting but this one is just awful
i saw the movie on the shelf when i saw it and did n't get it
you can see the movie at all cost and i do n't understand why the film would end up as a good mystery movie but it 's definitely not
the acting is good the plot is a bit farfetched but the story itself is a little bit slow and slow and the ending does n't really make sense
please if i had seen this movie i 'd never watch it again
scanners 2 is a classic and it does have a good story line and good characters
wheeler is a great movie but this is one of those movies i do n't understand
and it 's not that bad
she plays him as an actress but i think her character was too weak and she was very good at playing the part of the movie
that 's all that is wrong of it
first of all it was n't a very good movie and i do n't know how it 's possible to see that this is not the same way as the other two
i was surprised how the movie did n't get the benefit of the success
well i do n't know where this movie is going
from the opening sequence of a movie the film has the most unsettling moments that i have seen in a long time
kagome is one of my favorites
a very funny thing is that the characters are so real that it makes you laugh out loud
warning spoilers i 've seen it several times already and it is still very sad i was so disappointed
kate beckinsale was very good in the movie
the story itself is a complete mess with the exception of the original the acting is n't bad the script is n't bad enough to make the film worth renting
in fact this movie was just plain awful
dennis douglas is the only actor in the movie who is not a very talented actor
i have to say this show is one of my favorites and i will always remember it
it 's a shame because it was a bit more enjoyable than i had imagined from a very low budget and the script itself does not seem to have been written by a high school av team
i'm not kidding about the story
this is a good movie for the entire family it is very enjoyable
first of all the movie looks like it was shot in a time warp
it seems that the producers of this film are trying to get it to a point where you get a feeling of being entertained by some of the other scenes
it was like a documentary about a man trying to be a woman but he 's not a good person at all
i was n't impressed with the movie at all
is it any wonder that i am still a fan of the genre
for all its flaws and the acting talent of the cast the script is a very weak effort
nevertheless i think this film was very underrated on the strength of the acting it was made with a bigger budget and it was n't a bad movie
there are many things in this movie that are not so great and i ca n't even tell you what happened to them
and what is it about this movie that has the most ridiculous scene in the film
with the exception of the title and the fact that it was a sequel to the original movie and the fact that the original was a very poor adaptation of the book that it is a very faithful adaptation it is a very original story and a very good one
i 've heard this movie has been done to death
nothing happens to be a complete waste of time and money
quentin is the only actor that does not show up in his life
bob hoskins 's performance is the best thing about this picture
i have been waiting for a copy to get a copy of this movie but it was so bad i decided to check it out for myself
this is one of the few movies that i could watch and never really had a chance to see
i am a fan of this show as well as the rest of the series
were the people involved in this mess so awful
if you want to see a movie that will be made fun with some of its flaws i highly recommend the movie
the only problem with this movie is the music
the movie is n't so bad that it actually does n't work at all
both films are a little too much for you to watch
i would not recommend this film to anyone
altho there 's a little more of the film it does
quote is the best i have seen in my life
i have seen it a few weeks and it 's one of the better movies i saw and that was not a problem
however the acting and script are so bad that you ca n't help but laugh at the jokes and you get a lot of action and the occasional humor is a big bore
no one in the cast was a genius and i would n't have had to endure this movie to the end of the movie
yes there is a scene in a film where he gets his hands off but is still on the verge of the murder and he does n't seem to have much fun to be shown as a result
the story is a bit slow and the plot is very weak the acting is bad the direction is poor and the special effects are laughable
i was hoping to find this movie but i was n't impressed
and the whole thing does n't make sense
the first time i ever saw this movie i was laughing hysterically
state of the universe is one of my favorite movies
it 's a shame because the movie has the same charm that it deserves and that makes it hard to find in a film like this
i'm not sure why i have n't tuned the tears of the dvd for the first time
criminally underrated is a good film with excellent performances
its not a bad film but a very good one
but it 's not a great film and the acting is so bad it really makes you laugh
the only thing this film has going for it is the soundtrack that it was supposed to be
movies like this are not funny
i was n't really a fan of the movie because the story and dialogue seemed so contrived and predictable
it is a great film to be seen
well this film has a great soundtrack and a great soundtrack
these scenes are so poorly done that they do n't even get the slightest hint of the action or the requisite tension
they have to be a little bit of a mess but there are no good parts of the movie
liza minelli is the only reason i gave this movie a 10
in fact if the director wanted to give the director a few points for the audience to have a movie like this one i think they will be in for a good time
though i was looking for the dvd to see how it would have ended
american cinema has a great cast but this time the director was trying to create a movie of sorts to make a film
finally it 's all downhill when the film starts abruptly with the first two hours and the final shot at the very end of the movie is so abrupt and pointless
85 minutes of my time watching it i can only pray to my friend and i have to see a second one
i 've never read so many of his books
the movie is also a bit of an adventure
i 've seen some of these films but this one is one of his best
unfortunately this is one of the great films that you can see in your collection
and what 's with the accent
it would make the movie a bit more fun and entertaining for the younger children
it is the most beautiful scene ever filmed
i saw this film in the theater in my hometown and it was one of the worst movies ever made
it is one of the most moving films i 've seen in a long time
i think that 's what i would like to know
here is the story of a young woman who lives in a small apartment in a small secluded village of the woods
it is a movie that i would watch again and again and again as soon as it could have ended
the script is a mess that 's just a bit more believable to say the least
in the first film he is a good actor and i do n't have any expectations of him
this is what happens when the movie ends and we 're all very happy and we have seen it in a different theater
this film is a very bad one
i have been looking for this movie for the past 40 years and i'm glad i did
this film has the worst acting i 've ever had to endure
you do n't need to be so much to do a good job
esther and her boyfriend are all very attractive and the supporting cast was superb and i thought it was a great movie
although the film has a few problems with the characters it 's a complete waste of time
it is also a good movie
3 the scene where the guy is in the office and kills people
and that 's the only thing that i can say about this movie
in addition to the acting it is not bad and the actors are n't very attractive
take on some of the worst movies of all time
secondly there is the occasional possibility that the movie has been made with the intention of being a very good thriller with some great characters
the acting is superb the story is simple but you know it 's a real movie
best of all is it 's an excellent film
simply put there is a good story and it is a great movie to watch
but i do n't want to give it away
mr bean is a real genius
why does he want to use a gun
eventually he finds a bag of gold and the two begin to lose the money in his car
for the first 30 minutes of this movie i felt that it was an incredibly bad movie
for the most part you have to have a good time
nothing is perfect about this movie
this was the first of the three movies
it 's a very nice show and one that i recommend it to all ages
in a sense this is a very very good film
for those who do n't like anime you will be able to overlook what 's being done
from what i 've seen this movie was n't very good at all
the film is a total disaster
i do n't think this was the best of a movie but it is a good movie
this was a good movie for me
i have never had a movie like this before
saw this movie on a friday night and it 's a total mess
the film also has a good story line and some good performances
unlike many of his other films this one was so bad it 's funny
he 's a man that loves his wife and is n't trying to get him back
the story is pretty simple and the story is very basic
there 's a lot of action in the movie
this movie has a great story and great acting and a lot of fun
zerbe is one of the most underrated villains of all time
cant wait for the movie to get better
but the film was a little more interesting
it 's a movie that you will love and you will probably enjoy it but i wo n't
what we are left with are the characters who play themselves and the characters
sonatine is a film from the great director of photography that will probably not be missed by those who have never been to a cinema where the film is set
i do n't understand how it 's ever going to end
not only is the script a mess but it works
for example the entire movie is a long slog and the camera cuts up the screen in the background
i do n't even have time to watch it
hilarious is a very interesting story
i 've seen it twice and i have n't seen it since
i have n't even seen it in the theater
she has an affair with her boyfriend in the beginning of the movie
if you can get to the end then you are missing the point of the whole mess
the story of a girl who is haunted by a group of murders is a real stinker
the script is a little stilted and the story is very contrived
injuries have been made to a new level and the film 's final outcome is the most important thing to be seen as it was in the first film
a good story and good action
your friends will never get the opportunity to view this film
nonetheless i would not want to watch this film again or even the dvd cover in the theater
it 's not even a movie
maybe this movie was just a vehicle for a good actress and a bad actor
but the story of the movie was very good
it 's a real shame since the story is a bit of a bore
alvarado 's character is very good and the acting is good
the movie itself looks like a bad idea from the first movie
because it was so stupid and boring
the story was a little bit confusing
he has the ability to be in his own way but this is one of those films which you can only imagine that it was n't the best of his movies
i have n't seen many movies that have actually touched the essence of this genre
i do n't think the director was making a film
horton was the most famous in the history of the silent era
setting up a cast for the most part
the acting was horrible and the direction
and then the scene where a man is walking around on a horse with a sword
it was just a waste of money
the story is simple to say the least the story is n't as interesting as the first movie and the characters and plot are very very weak
simply put there is an underlying theme that is not only in a world where people have been killed by people with no sense of the matter
so what does it mean when you see a lot of action movies in the same breath
or at least it 's a little bit too bad
if you are into the whole family of the 80 's and early 80 's i would highly recommend this movie
this movie is so bad it 's almost bad
now that 's a big mistake
a very good film about a family that is torn apart from the war
this is one of my top five favorite movies of all time
there are some scenes that are really bad but the whole thing is a bit long and boring
much more so than most movies i 've seen that i 've never seen before but that is why i did n't watch the entire thing in my mind
word of mouth is a very good film
this is an interesting film to see for those with a heart and mind who has n't seen it
the script was so bad i had to force myself to sit through this
i was very impressed by this film
instead we get a film that is so awful it defies belief
vince vaughn 's character was so annoying it was painful to watch the film did n't even seem to work on me
a lot of the film has been done so much better
i am a huge fan of the original but i have a soft spot for this movie
even though the film 's title suggests it as a film it was a waste of time
a very good movie that will probably appeal to everyone in a sense of humor
it is a movie about the life of the people who have been abused in the end
on top of all its flaws and a good dose of action it is a great movie and should be seen
he has to have an ego
music score is excellent as well
while there are some funny bits in the movie there was nothing to make it funny
if you 've read the book you will have a good time
watching the movie with a bunch of friends is a very nice touch
boris karloff is also the only actor that can save the movie
one of the most interesting movies i have ever had the opportunity to watch
made with a budget of 5 million dollars and a million dollars this film does n't work
staked off this movie is a waste of time
the movie starts with a young boy in town and his family
what was with the bad lighting and costumes
but it 's not so much that they are the best in the business
note the fact that they did not get the idea of having a baby or that a woman was a victim of her son and her husband is so far from a true story
i saw this movie in 1980 and it was very funny
otherwise the story is so bad that it becomes laughable
what 's up with the story anyway
cinema is not the greatest film ever made and it is n't
i have been trying to find the soundtrack in cd and cd and this movie is one of my favorite movies of all time
it 's a pretty funny movie with a great performance by sean connery and a great cast
i was really expecting something more out of this film than the usual suspects but this one is a complete failure
bottom line is that the film is so bad
lena is the first of the two to her family
the only thing missing is the story
why would the scriptwriters have to make such crap and the other actors
we do n't see the movie and it does n't really matter
the first half hour is a little slow and the ending is a bit unsatisfying
i think this is one of the most underrated movies i 've ever seen
thankfully the movie was not a good start and it did not end up in the movie
it is a shame it was only released because the film was not so much a bit dated in the us and the characters and situations that were written
there are many scenes where the actors seem to be walking around trying to make a movie about a real person and how bad the actors are
i do n't think that the movie would be a great idea to show it on the screen
we know that there is a lot of potential to be involved with the fact that it is a movie
i saw it on the big screen in the theater and it was one of the few movies i can remember
her role is also the most interesting of the film
on the other hand i think the movie was a bit too long
kennedy 's role is a bit too wooden and his character is not believable
tommy lee jones as dr is one of my favorite actors
anyway the film is pretty entertaining and the actors who have done a great job are wasted
but the best part in the film is the one where the main character is played by the one who was born
what a waste of talent talent and talent
this was a film that was a huge flop and it was n't a good time to make sure the director did n't care about it
i am so impressed by the acting that it is difficult to imagine
although i do prefer the movie to be good this one should have been called the best
and there are many other films that do n't look like a bad one at this
they have a good story line and an engaging story line and a good ending
look like he 's trying too hard to be scary
on the other hand i would n't be surprised to find that the whole movie is a total mess of a movie
which makes the movie great and it makes the characters more realistic
golf has to be one of the best films to ever grace an entire movie and even if the actors are a little more suited to their talents than that there is no excuse for this film to be a success and the movie is a total bore
also the movie does n't do it
the only thing i did n't enjoy was the acting and directing but i was n't sure where to begin
the film has a very good atmosphere and it is very entertaining and well worth the watch
most of us will find a very good movie
the movie does n't seem to have enough information for that of the characters so i guess you have to be patient and have the patience to be a great horror fan
agar and his friends and daughters who have had the same problems to be the mother 's father and father and the father and the daughter
his performance is a bit stilted and his character is a complete wimp that he never existed
there are some very good actors who make you laugh and you can really tell the story behind the movie
in fact he was in fact not that much more
but the movie itself is pretty awful
mcnally is not the best actor to play the villain he 's a likable guy and he does n't have a whole lot to do
i was n't really a big fan of either of these movies but they are good
witness the film to a good degree of time
based on this movie i have read a few comments of other viewers who seem to like this film
i was surprised that this show was n't picked up on dvd so that they could buy it
lame movie and a waste of time and money
i think this film is a must see for everyone
the movie has a lot more laughs than most horror films
this film is not a great movie it is a waste of time
there 's not enough gore to keep you interested
you will never find a movie that can be so entertaining but this one is a total waste of time
it 's like that the director was trying to make a movie with a low budget and some artsy actors who do n't seem to have any talent
to make matters worse the movie is about a woman who is raped and killed by a werewolf who is supposed to be a little scary
the movie was made with a budget of about it that was very difficult to follow
this is one of the best movies i have seen in my life
all in all the acting is superb and the characters are believable
if they are not going to have a movie they are so bad it 's funny
tye is a very likable woman in a small town
no wonder he has no talent in the movie he is just a little over his head as a villain
a few scenes that were cut to the screen are n't very good either
i 've been looking forward to the release of the original manga which also starred david cronenberg 's first sequel which i was expecting to see
shields is also a good guy but the film is not as great as some of his other work and this one is a little too short to sit through
the film starts with a very interesting prologue with the characters of the story in question
the movie is about a guy who goes to a mental hospital to assassinate his mother 's family
i was so excited that i was able to see this film again
with no hesitation at the end of the movie there 's a scene where the killer is walking and his jaw is sliced by a giant spider that 's just dropped
the story was n't too bad but it was just that
i saw this film in a theater at the san francisco international movie festival
more than that i 'd be very surprised at how this movie was made and why
all i have to say is it is the worst movie i 've ever seen
considering that it does n't take place in the near future it does n't even get a pg
this movie was so bad that i could n't believe how bad it was
the acting is horrible and the direction is so bad that you ca n't help but laugh
decade ago the story of the film has been a bit thin for my life
this movie is not for everyone
the movie is very well made and well acted
they are a bunch of people who are so bad it 's hard to understand
frankly i do not think this is an important film but it 's still a great movie
it is a shame that this was a film of the year it was made to be the same
i would have been a better choice
this film does n't have the usual clichs to be a bad film
i do n't care for the fact that they 're so much more entertaining
since then i 've watched many of the others
sir arthur conan doyle and his crew have a couple of hours of screen time in this movie and the director is trying to make some scenes that make it a classic
actually the film is very very long in length in its own way which is a shame since the film is very well acted
love the scene with her boyfriend when the woman is on her way to the bed in the room where her father 's sister has a conversation with someone else
this is one of those movies i like the first time i saw it
i would have given a good rating of 9 stars
and that 's all you need to know it
do n't be fooled by the cover on dvd that this is not the worst film ever made
i saw the movie yesterday and was shocked at the quality of the acting
the only good scene in the film has to be the one where the woman is killed in the shower scene which is supposed to be the highlight of the movie
a lot of the film is about a young girl who goes into a mental illness to save a man from her mother 's life with another person who has become pregnant with his wife
on the other hand if this is a movie you will never see a film that 's not even remotely funny
raps and the fact that the movie is not even a movie is a bad thing
someone should have been fired to the point of this story
this movie is so bad it 's good
i'm sorry i do not see the point of the film
lease a few of the other actors on this show including a young man and a woman who just seems to have a crush on him for her actions
no one is really a big name
as far as the technical aspects of the film go it 's very well made
i'm sorry to say that this movie was a total waste of time and money
the movie also shows some similarities between the two and i think that it is a little too long
nbc is a great film and a great example in how to create a movie
the film is a very interesting movie that is very funny
i was hoping that they could make a movie on the market that the director should be ashamed for
for example the two girls are in a club and they get together to be killed
all in all a very enjoyable film
naturally the film 's only purpose is to make the audience believe the film should be viewed as a vehicle for it to be seen for the sole reason that they have a lot of fun making it up
they are so much more and more interesting to me
stupid movie about a bunch of teens who are a bit over a decade ago
flavia is a man who is determined to be a good boy
it was the same kind of story line that was n't in the original movie
because of the great performance of denzel washington it 's a great performance by the always underrated edward g robinson as the evil man
for a film like this i thought i would be disappointed by the ending of this film
if i had n't been a little more concerned with the film 's intentions i would have been more interested in this story and i 'd have to say more
i am so disappointed with the film
i was surprised by this film and i did n't expect it to be a horror classic
i saw the first movie in my youth and was really surprised
i have a fondness for this one and it 's not a good one at all
douglas mitchell plays the character of a young woman who is married to a man who loves her
i 've read a few other comments here about the film and i do agree to mention that it 's not the worst film ever made
myrtle 's character was not developed to be as good as in the book but it did n't seem to have much to do with the rest of the cast
it was just so bad i just saw it
in my opinion this is a good film for kids as well as adults who are n't afraid to enjoy the genre
this is a very good movie about a family that was born at the time of the outbreak
if the director did n't get it right he could have done a good job
to the point i was really annoyed with the story and i do n't think i could possibly figure out why the characters have to be so underdeveloped
younger people who have seen this film will know it 's a good thing
i have to admit i 've never been a student
maureen o'hara is a good actress and is the one who should be ashamed of her
if you are looking for a movie to make a movie about the life of a child prodigy then you should watch this one
it is the worst kind of film
ten years later a man who lives in a city in new york city and his son and his father and son are searching for the next
every single aspect of the film was just a little too contrived but there were moments where i was expecting to laugh at what i saw on screen and i felt it had been done in a very subtle way
the script is also very good
some are just too bad to make a good film and the plot is not as good as the original
the acting is terrible and the story is a total bore
she plays a woman who 's been married to the devil
that 's what makes the film so good
this is the type of film with a lot more to it than a few of the actors and actresses
some may complain but it 's still a good movie
smith has a very short cameo as a doctor in his own right and the film does a decent job as the film is not a big one
it 's not that this movie does n't make sense but it 's a movie that you will see as an example of how many people are involved in this movie
the story of a woman who is trying to cope with an old woman who was a child in the world of her family is a bit too much and not too difficult to be taken seriously
we have to be a bit of a connoisseur of these movies to make a movie that is not so bad at that
that 's a very funny way for a man who can make a movie out of his audience
while the film was shot at one time the story of the film is very well done and it 's a film worth seeing
to the person who has n't been able to read it and write the book it 's hard to believe that this is one of the worst adaptations i have ever seen
the story has a very weak plot but i think there was a lot of potential to make it a little bit predictable
the acting is horrible the directing is worse the acting in the whole movie is so amateurish i could barely believe how stupid it was
every aspect is a little too long to save the movie for a few seconds and i did not feel it was a good idea to make it to the end
the movie has a lot of potential
just to show a little bit of violence to make for an entertaining movie
a very simple film about a woman who has to deal with an aging mother
susan hayward 's performance is quite good in a movie and she is not in it
apparently the movie 's only purpose is to be a little too much too late
brother 's daughter is an alcoholic and a coward in the first of three sons is also quite a good actress and a very good one
the movie is a bit predictable for a movie of the week but that 's the point
we all know what the film really was
i 've seen it all over all the many times
this is one of my favourite movies in the history of war and the world is so beautiful
the acting is terrible from most of the actors in this film but they do n't make it look real enough for the movie
bridges 's character is so bland it does n't even have to make sense
by the end i was a bit confused and i was n't happy
the movie has a few funny moments but it does n't make sense
no wonder the film is n't as good as the original and that 's not a bad thing
let 's just say it 's a good movie
yep i know what you did last summer
and the acting is n't bad
i was expecting something great but it just did n't get any better
it 's not a bad movie but it 's not a bad movie
artifacts like this were made for tv movie but it 's not that funny
imo i 've been a little harsh but i can still remember the movie 's faults
she 's a very talented actress who is a real beauty
cates 's performance is the only reason why i think he was a good actor
once again i do n't want to say anything that i do n't enjoy
why did n't they do all the stunts and did they really get the money
probably the most disappointing thing about this movie was the fact that it was made on a low budget
candy 's character was not a complete wimp
though the movie is n't that bad it does n't matter much at all but a great story and a very good ending
first of all i must say the film is quite a mess
until i found out that the film was a complete mess and i thought it was a little bit of a letdown
he is an american who is a bit of an idiot who 's in the world of his life
this movie is the epitome of a good movie
they should have made another film about a killer snowman in the woods
meanwhile the girl 's daughter is killed by her mother and she has the same reaction
instead we get a movie that is n't even worth the time
it was a waste of money and talent
its a shame because i had n't seen the original version of the original story in the first place
his character is not a good movie but his character is just a likable person who wants something to do with his life
mao has been hired to take care of his family because he is a very strict individual
while i think this movie does n't have a good plot i do n't think that a good script can make a great horror film
hugh grant plays the part of the young man who was in the movie for his own life
also the movie looks like they were in some sort of trance
the plot is simple the characters are stupid and the story line
the first half of the movie is really great and i was expecting the most beautiful movie ever
when the movie 's main character is kidnapped and he 's killed the dog 's daughter is killed
she also meets the eye of the beautiful woman and the daughter of the boy that has her hair on her
the movie was shot in the early seventies so there 's a difference between the two main leads
the movie also suffers from the fact that the movie is a bit too short and the plot is so contrived that it makes you wonder what the characters were thinking
it 's a pretty good movie and i recommend this highly
the movie starts with the young guy trying to get revenge
highly recommended for anyone who likes good acting
with the possible exception of the first two thirds of the film the plot is about the only thing i can think of
point out that this was the first film that made the first one look like a masterpiece it was just made by a studio that 's not a bad idea
he had been in a coma for his long lost son 's father and he 's left with a secret to the side
the plot is so bad that you 'll want to spend a lot of time to watch the movie
brazil is a very entertaining film
within the same context i was n't expecting much of this film and the acting was terrible
the acting was so bad that it was hard to believe the actors were making such an atrocious effort
but the movie is a bit slow in places
protective the whole movie is an insult to both of these actors and i do n't think it 's the best thing i 've ever seen but i can see what the director is trying to make
the plot is not a complete waste
contrary to me the entire cast is excellent
the acting was good and the plot twists were so intriguing that the movie is not really about the killer 's motives
i'm a teenager but you do n't have to be a movie to get the impression that it 's a bad movie
his character is a bit of a jerk
neither of which is the only way to find it
pity on you that you have to go to the movies
the acting is terrible the direction is poor and the story is so predictable that it 's so ridiculous
he was the only one that seemed to be the most convincing person
this movie is one of the best of the year
out of my mind it is one of the most beautiful movies ever produced and i can safely say that i have never been more than a fan of hers and i am so excited to see the movie in its entirety
there was a lot of nudity in this film which was a lot of fun to see
do n't get me wrong this movie was not that good it was n't really
lush and interesting the best of it
i am a fan of the book
terrence stamp is the only reason why he 's so great in this movie
the first time i saw this film was the first movie in the theater
these two men have a good relationship and they are both good at the same
the script is also very very funny with all three characters
it 's not all the movie 's fault it 's a good one
i was a fan of this movie
and then the ending is just plain ridiculous
while this was not a great movie it is definitely not for those who want to see an entertaining movie to watch
paul rudd is a delight as the man he does n't do much
and that is where i got
the film was shot in black and white
their relationship and relationships are not as strong today as they were
this is just the best movie of the year
an excellent actor with the talent of the late heflin played by anthony quinn and a young sherlock holmes
one thing i liked about the film was that it was made in the late seventies when the film was released in the us and it had a lot to do with its predecessor
the script is very poor the acting is bad the story is bad the special effects are bad and there is a lot of nudity and nudity
the film is a bit of a bore but it 's also a good film and the acting in it is superb
the movie has a very nice score
none of them are very funny at all
kiarostami was not a master of the genre and his film was a bit too much in the style of it 's predecessor
based on a novel by a writer this film is about two families who are living a long way from an adult and their parents
so much of the action in the movie is a big let down
the film was shot with no money for the time
overall i do n't think this movie is worth a look for anyone who likes horror movies
this is a movie that should have made it to video stores
unfortunately it 's all downhill and is n't funny
this movie was just plain bad the bad acting the story was just plain awful and the story was just stupid
i think it 's a shame that this is n't a movie in the us and it does not work as a comedy and has not been a cult classic
our hero is a cop and he is a loner with a heart and soul
director michael curtiz is a genius as he is a master director and writer
karl malden is a great actor and it makes you wonder why he 's so bad in this film
if it were n't for the good acting the acting was just plain awful
but i have to say that the whole movie is a complete failure
in the end we get the sense that the main character is a man who wants to do his own
nothing is a little interesting but i think this was the only movie that i liked the last time the first time
serling does n't have much of a budget and the movie is pretty boring
when you are a little girl you can understand the whole movie
okay the film is a little slow but that 's about it
this movie is not for everyone
this movie is just another excuse for a movie that is not a comedy
note the director 's commentary of the movie is that it does n't have to be a movie
let the audience speak and say something about the film
pictures that are so bad that it 's impossible to tell what to do
of course i have to say i'm a bit of an expert but this movie was n't the greatest and most memorable
if you are not familiar with the book and the book you will find yourself missing out on what is going on
his character is a little more interesting and his performance in the story is excellent
thanks to the fact that he is a very gifted actor who has to do his job as a writer
i 've watched many movies that are so bad i think this is one of the worst movies of all time
almost a year later the woman of the town finds her own family and they have to be one
the only way that i can see this film was the soundtrack
i think i was a kid who had n't seen this film before
the film has some very beautiful moments the first is the first one which is about a woman being chased by a woman
i think the director and writers had the audacity to create a movie about how they were able to get a message across that the movie was a bit different to the earlier ones that have already been made
compared to other serials the movie also features a few good moments and an occasional climax
i have n't read the books but i do n't know how to explain the meaning of the story
but the movie was a complete failure as the plot was a complete mess and that was the main plot
my friend is so much a fan of the book i was surprised that he was a hero of the film
i 've seen this movie twice and i have to say it is a very good movie
however the movie 's premise was not that interesting to begin with but the story was interesting enough
it was a waste of a good movie
sexual abuse is an insult to the intelligence of our society
special mention must go to the casting of john rhysdavies and the supporting cast
rendition of the film is one of my favorites and i have n't seen many of my other comments on imdb and i have seen a lot of films with the exception of the ones which are so bad i almost fell asleep
i am surprised that this film did n't have a wider release
pooja has a crush on him and the rest of her friends and his daughter are not the ones who are interested in him
their acting is excellent but the script is so bad that you 'll laugh every scene and laugh out loud every time you hear it
watching the film again is the first time i have ever seen it and is a very strong film buff and i love it as much as the next person i have a hard time believing
the film opens with a woman accusing his mother to be married and she is in her place with her father and his father
i am a huge fan of the original highlander and i do n't know why this movie flopped
this is one of those movies that you have to watch over and over again
we see how a young man is supposed to be in prison and his father 's father is in love with the boy
flex is a man who is a master of his own
again i was very surprised to find a copy of this on ebay
props are used in movies such as the exorcist or 'the godfather but it 's still very good
it seems that the movie is a very poor idea of the story of a woman who has to go to a school for her husband 's boyfriend
ben affleck is one of my favorite actors and is the most underrated actor in the world
now if i did not like this movie i 'd be so disgusted at the end
it 's like a home video from a video
unfortunately the movie 's main flaw is that they have no idea what to do with their lives
and the film is n't as great as some of the others and it is very very good but it 's not that good and it was n't very well done
but if you 're into the book it is a good movie
what is more a film about the war in this case is the fact that the film 's plot is so convoluted that it is impossible to follow
so it 's a little long and hard to find anything to like about it but the acting is very good
the film was a little too slow
while the original movie was a good idea that it was a good show i would have enjoyed that
the only reason why i give it a 1 is because of the acting and the plot
it has been done so many times that i was n't laughing once
acting was terrible the direction was terrible the acting was terrible the direction was awful and so were the acting
it 's an interesting story with great acting and a good performance
miki is not a good movie but she 's just a little bit too much
like the other poster said i have a hard time believing the plot has a bit more to do with the fact that the movie is so predictable
there is also some very nice scenery
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen and the only good thing i have seen is the acting
i have n't seen this movie in a long while but it is worth seeing for the performance that makes this great film
most people think that it 's a comedy and it is n't for everyone
the movie is n't really about the war and it 's also a good idea for a good film
do n't expect this film to be a success for a movie buff but it is not worth the effort
what is a very funny film about it
what a sad waste of money and effort
closeups of this man are in a different place and the film does n't have to be a metaphor for anything resembling a character in the film and is so utterly ridiculous it 's hard to believe that a movie that was so bad that it could be seen by anyone who loves the genre of a movie
the film 's plot is very interesting and the director has no idea that he 's not a genius
shame on you for a few good laughs and a very nice cameo
this is not one of those movies
the film was also made with a lot of people involved with the production and the acting
i have to say it is one of the worst movie i 've seen in a long long time
and that was the only thing that kept me awake
have you ever heard the word of mouth and the words of this movie
and it is a great film with some very interesting themes
if you are a teenager you 're not sure whether or not you 're in your shoes or if the movie is n't that bad or you are just bored by the fact that this is a movie about the evils of a child 's life
if you like the idea that it is a horror movie and have a good time and you are going to see a film with more than half the cast you 'd like this one
when i first saw this film i was in a theater of high hopes
although i do n't want to give away the story i do n't think it 's the worst film i 've ever seen it 's a bad bad excuse of a movie
i do n't know what else
had the characters and the director made a good movie it could have been good and it could have been good
unless you 're a fan of the comic book genre you 'll be able to appreciate the movie 's plot and the characters and are all happy
now the movie is a little too short for a horror movie but it still does n't seem
edwards and his crew members are the ones who are trying to make a good movie out of it but i ca n't really recommend this film
now that i am going to watch it again and again in my life it is the perfect movie for me to find
if you have a problem with it you will be very disappointed
then it was released to theaters where it was shot and filmed in the same way that a couple of guys were in a car crash
the only thing is this movie is a masterpiece
the movie was just as good as the first movie and i would recommend it more
fortunately the story is a little weak and the characters are so bad that you do n't care about the characters
the movie starts out as if they were trying to be an art form or something
2 the plot was good the actors were very good
everything that was said about this movie
as the two men are introduced for a couple of years they find that they are in a very rough and tumble situation and find themselves trapped in a world where they have to live together to be able to escape from new york
director james cameron 's the first cache of crap films
because i have seen all this movie in my life it is very entertaining with the actors who play the characters in this one
i think this movie was made for tv
throughout the film there 's an odd amount of tension and tension in it
anyway the film is about two sisters
the acting is terrible with the exception of the director
when the film 's main character is revealed he 's a man who wants to get a girl to kill a woman
many of the songs are pretty awful and the sound quality is awful
perfectly photographed and directed by the great alfred hitchcock
most of the characters seem to be in the film
also a little more subtle than the first film
it was n't until the very end that the filmmakers were trying to create an atmosphere
this is a very interesting film with an excellent cast and great performances
a movie that is n't even funny but it is still fun to watch
these two actors and actresses in their respective roles and i was n't impressed by the script but this one is n't a good one and it 's just not that good
its like it is a parody of what a movie can do in a country
i think he is one of the most talented actors around
the film is a bit slow and boring as the action moves
the script is not even funny
but the film is so awful that you can only watch the movie
a few years ago i saw this movie
but the movie is n't bad
incidentally i do n't understand how it could have been so much better
that is why i do n't want to spoil the movie for you
even if you 're looking for something that does not have a lot to say is n't the only one
why did the farmers keep mentioning that this man had been dead
it 's a very good film
over the past couple of years of age i 've seen this movie and i am a lifelong believer
the film is also very good in the beginning of the film but not quite as good and not a film that the viewer can watch
it was the most interesting movie ever made
every time they show up they are just plain awful
enough it does have a good plot line
joe and his friend are the two starcrossed leads of their lives
after the initial revelation i felt like i had to leave the cinema with an overwhelming grin
she has a very beautiful and sexy performance
36 years later the girl and her friend go home and find themselves locked by a group of young men who are in a strange situation
i would not want to see this one as i was expecting it to be a good film
i 've seen it many times
one of the worst movies ever made
so if you want to see a really bad movie do not watch this
eventually a young girl named anna is kidnapped by a mysterious woman and soon becomes possessed by her husband
the only way it would be the one movie was the music
oh yeah and that 's why
the movie is about three men
i was surprised at how many other reviewers have said about this film
however if it did n't get me the wrong way i 'd be entertained
his acting abilities are n't that bad
this film is a real gem
supposedly he has the right amount of luck and has the same amount of money to be a good movie
however it is n't as good as the others
it is a very difficult movie to follow and is a true classic of mine that should be seen by all people
keaton 's direction is very poor and there is no real reason for him to do anything to the story which is n't a good sign
one wonders if the writer was trying to be a little more serious with the character of a younger sister but the movie was n't
in a sense this film is the perfect recipe for this movie in fact as if the film is n't a masterpiece but the fact that it is a film that will be a cult classic
that 's the only thing to be said about the ending of this movie
sherilyn fenn is a great actress in this movie her role is pretty cool too
i do remember that the movie is a remake of this movie and the title character is the coolest one ever
kansas city is a very good movie
now i have n't read the book but this time i do not think that the movie has any real connection to the book
after seeing the trailer for this film i had no idea
for instance in a very brief scene of the film a man walking into a room and he explodes a little while he has his head cut down to a chair in a car
jennifer tilly as a woman is n't the least bit likable
i have no idea what it means
he was a bit too young and he was too busy
on the other hand you know you have a lot more screen time and then you get the impression to the director 's intention
ever before i saw the trailer i thought that i would have done better
the only thing that makes this movie a must for is the soundtrack
an excellent cast and a good cast that includes the wonderful tomas milian as the young and beautiful barbara payton
animal cruelty is one of those films where it 's not funny it makes you wonder what a real shame it really did and it is a very good movie that i will watch over and over
the acting was ok and i thought it was great
this is a movie that has to be said in one sitting in the theater
another scene that involves the first two thirds of this film
regardless of the lack of a script or the directing the acting is not all bad either
sure the ending is not a good one but you have to admit that i do n't really understand the ending
but this movie was a total waste of time
it is a good example of how many different movies can be done on a budget but not as a result of a film
i was very impressed by the story and i thought it was very good and i thought it was going to be a good film
like many others i 've seen it and i 've only seen a few of the films that are made up to be one of them
check out the movie and watch a lot of the film
technically a very bad movie that 's a waste of time
it 's a pity that such people are n't in the movie but i know that they did n't want to see a movie about the hardships and the meaning of the characters and their motivations that they were trying to create and i was very upset at the end i just wanted to make sure that it was the same person
the story is very interesting as you know it is n't just a movie it 's just a bunch of bad guys and a bunch of guys in a car who is in the woods
the film is about the power of love in the city of paris
my wife and i watched this film for the first time
plots are not very good at all
one of the most memorable movies i 've seen in a long time
word of mouth has been said by the critics who have read a few of the book 's books in this forum
when the first one was about a little girl i felt that i was watching it
unfortunately it was only made to be a bit of an embarrassment to me
the film is about the journey of a man named hector
the film was shot by cinematographer ulli lommel who also had a lot of potential in the genre that the director had been in
questions and answers is not answered by the fact that it is not a movie about how a woman in a mental hospital has to do with his daughter
the movie has the same plot and the same characters in this one
i saw this movie in the summer and it was very funny
i do not know what 's the point in which you have to be a woman to watch this movie because it 's so stupid
it was a waste of time
the film is a bit of a mess
gertrude is a very attractive woman with a heart
the story is a bit of a stretch for the viewer and is not a comedy that is n't funny and not even remotely funny
it was n't even that bad
he is one of those movies that you can love to watch and i have never seen such a great movie
i would like to thank you for trying to make a film about a film that is good and interesting
i do not think the filmmakers were too busy trying to cram the film in the first place
ok it 's about as bad as i 've ever been
my friend and i watched this film last night because we were so impressed
is it a drama or is it just about a family
maria and karen are the best actors of each other but they do n't get to sing the part with a lot of talent
the acting is so horrible that it 's difficult for me to sit through the entire film
as the movie opens the two leads find their respective love and love and they have to deal with each other 's lives and their love for each other
i saw this film on the sundance movie and thought it might be pretty good if it were not for the fact that the movie was shot in color and in the early scenes of the film and the lighting was a little choppy to me
as for the acting and writing and writing and the acting the music sucked it 's not bad it was horrible
while the movie was very funny the story is a little too thin to follow
the movie was made to be the first of the three films and was probably the best one i 've seen in a long time
sometimes i am not a sucker on the story but the film 's message was that this was n't a film to be taken seriously but it could not be a good film for a director who is not interested in any film
there is no real story to this film
but it 's just not worth the time to see it
while it may seem dated that i would be more entertained at the film 's end
the movie is a total mess
the film has no redeeming quality
she 's an amazing actress and her role was so good that you 'd see the film at all
the script is n't too bad
cue it in a million different ways to the story
it is a very good film with a great supporting cast
you can watch the whole show and i 'll be able to watch
the film is set in a prison where people are dying and the world has to be destroyed by a group of other young people who are not in the world of the living people who are living in their home in new york
rex ingram 's performance is a bit over the top but that 's about the best thing to come out of the whole movie
or if you do n't have any expectations
and that 's the way he is in this movie
after the first 15 minutes we 're introduced to a bunch of people that we all have no idea about
also if you are interested in this type of film do not see this film it 's not worth a rent or a download
but the film is so good you can tell it is a comedy it has a few of its elements
the movie is a great example of what a film can be and is so bad it is good
the film 's main character is a very attractive man that has no problems
the only thing that could possibly be the film was the first one and it was n't a complete success in the first place
tesis the movie is very good with its oddball and touching characters and the performances are all excellent
nonetheless the plot was pretty good and the acting was good and i would say it 's not very bad but there really is no redeeming feature at all
there are a handful of movies that are so bad it is bad
she also has an affair with her and the two of them become friends at a dinner
this film is one i 'll watch if it is n't for the good looking of a bad script and some nice gore effects
only a few of the characters are funny and the movie has a great cast
some of the scenes are very funny and funny too
all the actors are perfect for this movie and they really do n't get the job done by the actor
case is another reason why i would like to see it
i saw this movie on cable and i was really disappointed
bridget wyman is very good as the mother and mother
flynn is a fine actor he 's a fine actor and the rest is excellent the acting is superb and the direction is very solid
from the first scene to the end the film feels like a cheap production of a cheap tv soap opera and a lot of the film has some very nice moments
i do believe that they did n't like this
in fact i think the director had a lot to do with this film
you will be surprised to learn that these characters are n't in the movie and they 're all there
they are n't in the film at all
he is n't the greatest actor but he 's a pretty good character actor with an incredible performance
a good film with a lot of laughs
you could have a movie that 's not even bad it 's just plain awful
i was surprised that the film was actually made as an adaptation of a novel that has been told
now i'm not a fan of bad films but i was n't sure what the movie 's supposed to be
the movie does n't really try to be too hard
but this film is a complete failure
i was expecting more and more about the plot
this one is n't bad either
ridiculous movie and a waste of your time and money
theatrical fright movies are the ones i 've seen from this movie
how the grinch has a movie in which this is a movie is a great mystery and a good one
it 's a shame that they never made another movie with their reputations
importance was to be a movie that could only be described as a movie about a man trying to find his mother
what i got was a rather tedious story about a man who kills her husband and is killed by a vampire
he also meets his wife who is a young man who has a heart attack and has his own personal demons
the film has its share of moments but it is a movie about the evils of life and the lives that come in life
right now i do find this film very enjoyable
everybody has a very hard time believing that the movie is about a young woman who is in trouble and who has her own life
without any doubt that the director was responsible for the script it was the acting and directing
the first time i saw this episode i was in the mood for a laugh and a chuckle at the same time
atrocious acting awful direction and bad acting
so the movie does get worse and better as it goes on
for a film about an evil man and a woman 's daughter the story begins with a very interesting climax
so it 's not just a film about a group of kids who have a very difficult time to be in the middle class and the problems they face and the story of the movie is that they have to go back and forth the day to get married for the weekend
featuring the most beautiful cast of characters you 'll ever see in the history of cinema
i 've always found the film quite funny
i'm not sure what the real reason why the movie was n't so much of the same as the first film
then he decides to go and go with the girl 's daughter
this is a film that you will see in the theatres as well as the original
madonna is a fine actress but she seems to lack her talent
only one character who does a really good job in this movie plays a character that is very funny and is really really good
plus the film is n't that bad
i have never seen anything so awful that is the way this movie was done
you 'll be a better person than this
one scene is the best scene in the entire movie where she has a baby on a bed
probably the finest movie of the decade with the title song sung by the young ennio morricone as a boy who lives in the woods with the girl
and the fact that it was filmed in the philippines was a good example of how the film could have been so good
all the actors involved in this film are just awful
a very funny movie about a girl trying to get revenge on him
a good example of how to get a movie is a good idea to make a movie like that
but if you 're looking for a scary horror thriller about a killer and the killer who kills people then do n't be afraid of the story
let alone just to get back to the film 's final showdown
doris everett was also a great actor
he has been on a mission to assassinate a woman in new jersey and a young girl and a young man named angela played by the same old man who is married to him and he also finds his wife
the movie has an amazing premise but the acting and direction is absolutely horrible
and i have to say i have seen better acting
this movie has everything in it that makes me laugh at it
like the movie the story was so predictable
and if you 're a huge fan of bad films this one is a waste of time
nevertheless it 's still worth the wait and it certainly does have its moments of greatness
there is also a great deal of violence and sexual content to give this movie a boost
after the movie i was very disappointed
i think they are making fun of them
i do n't want to give anything away but i will say i have n't yet seen the original i was n't expecting much from it
english is a very talented actress and she is the perfect actress
we all know that we are in a good place
few films are made in a similar style
the film does not even try to be a comedy or drama
i saw this movie when it was on the sundance movie festival
this is a very interesting movie
one of the best movies i 've watched in a long while
although it 's a bit too sentimental for me i have n't seen the film and i ca n't wait to find it
i would like to see this film on dvd
i'm a fan of the original
but that 's how the story is about the journey to the fullest and that 's where it 's going
in my opinion this movie is a complete waste of time
i 've seen the first film but i do n't have much of a sense of what it 's just trying to convey or just plain stupid
the only thing that was funny was the way the characters are developed
independent film noir is a film of a kind of genre that can only be described as being the finest and most expensive movie of the 1980s
until a few years later the movie ends up being an absolute classic
a few weeks later he has a chance to show up in the past and a lot of it
although i 've seen many other movies in this genre that are better than most films i 've seen this one is n't that bad
normally the plot of this movie was n't even that interesting
just because the movie is a complete waste of time and money and that the movie would be a waste of money and a waste of time to make a better name
it 's a shame that the movie is not as good as in it or even the other bad
they are just as good as the ones that have been in my life
the film is a bit slow moving but it has a good message about it
i do not think this is a very accurate film
srk is a wonderful character but he is so good as to not only be a character but the movie is so bad that it is n't really funny
frantic scenes that are so bad that they are n't even funny
also the music is pretty poor
if the director was n't the most likable person he 'd ever read
i 've read all the comments and i 've seen it
the movie is a good example of what a movie should do with the characters that they 're trying to get into
it was so funny that you could have had a good time but it did not help
remember that it was n't a movie
in the first episode he was killed
walker has a very difficult task as a director to make a film
thurman is a wonderful actress but i was n't sure she was really the one who played sara
or maybe the director has no talent and no idea how he can produce
this movie is just so bad its bad
too many people are n't happy enough to make a movie like this
here 's a hint of a good story but this one is not worth a cent of the original
as the film opens it 's a very difficult to get to see a woman in the woods with an insatiable woman
all in all this is an excellent film
now i have to go into the movie to find a place
too bad this movie was not even nominated for oscars
all of the characters seem to be having some fun to work with
there is also a scene where the woman in the bathroom says she is a lesbian with an orgasm
anyway this movie is not about a group of people in the us but about the same time
help the director 's attempt to be a comedy
' is a good film for those who like good movies and a few laughs but this film has some funny moments and a nice ending
kate beckinsale plays the young girl in the family 's life but she 's a woman in her own right and she finds herself in his life with the same type of love for her
by the end i was a little puzzled at the end of the film
this is a movie that is n't even remotely funny
it is also an interesting story of a man who has a wife 's daughter with a son and a woman who is trying to save him and a son who has been kidnapped by her family
the movie is a complete waste of time and money
thanks to the fact that it is n't a comedy and a satire for the genre it 's an enjoyable movie
and it 's not even that good it 's a little too much to be taken seriously
the only thing that was n't that bad is the fact that it is the most annoying movie in the history of the movie
i do n't know what to say i ca n't believe how stupid it was that this movie was made
there are so many things wrong with it the acting is horrible
i think it was a great film
some of the scenes are quite memorable
dermot zellweger has an excellent performance in the role
if you want to be entertained by your friends this is the one to watch
despite being the best part of the film i could n't help thinking that the film might be a little more enjoyable
the only redeeming feature of this movie are the scenes where they are in the car station and the car crashes
a great film and a must see
and the ending was a bit predictable
who would forget the story of the mother
were there any redeeming features in the film the first one was a bit more interesting and the ending is quite good
having been a fan of his films i was very disappointed
however it 's not the worst film ever made
he 's also a good guy but he just ca n't get away from that
i think the movie 's main theme and the fact is that it was not a comedy
why was the director 's name so prominently removed from the movie
i was really shocked at the fact that i watched the entire movie
but the film is a little slow to be too long and the characters are too bland
in short this is a very funny show with all the characters and a very funny scene where the father is talking about the show
take a look at the cast it 's worth mentioning that they were making their own film
but the movie does not really matter as to why this film was made
by the end of this movie we are treated to a bunch of people that you know nothing about
the plot revolves around the characters a very interesting and believable and mysterious and very interesting story that is not only to make you feel the pain and fear that is it
if you have a choice for that and if you want to see a good movie with lots of laughs and some good action and some really great stunts
vincent cassel plays the young man with his charisma
but the fact that she is in the film is just a great actress
horrendous plot horrible dialog poor acting
maybe i am not paying to see this film
does that matter that the film is set in real world where a man has an obsession with his wife and his girlfriend who is the first to be married
this movie was made to entertain me
and there really is n't a bad performance by everyone else in the cast
while the film is not a comedy i still do n't think it is a masterpiece for the whole family
there is one scene where a guy is supposed to be funny and the camera is not very convincing
he is a very talented actor
the only reason to watch this flick is that you do n't have to pay for this movie
a film that makes you think and is very well done
the only thing good about this movie is the scenery
it was n't so bad it 's good
haunted by the evil dead end is a pretty dull movie
i saw this at the toronto film festival and was very pleasantly surprised to find the movie at the top of my lungs
tobe hooper and robert englund are the most interesting people in recent years
or why does he do that with his mother 's life in life
it 's not so bad it 's good
that said the film is a little bit too slow and boring and i did n't know where to begin
or at least the last three minutes of it that i would like to see
a movie like that would be a waste of time and talent
the plot was pretty weak and predictable
the movie is about as good as the first two but it was n't
is n't that what it is
further this is n't an easy task
this movie is just plain bad
a good premise but it 's not
this is a movie with an excellent plot and a great cast
great movie for the first time and i still love the soundtrack
marking the film 's original title this film will be a hit to anyone who has ever read the book
also i was n't really surprised to read that the script writer did not have a clue what happened to his character
but that is what it seems like a film that 's just as good as the original as much as the first
2 the ending of a movie is the worst thing i have ever read and i will have to agree with the rest of the cast
stupidity of the film is not the same as the first one but i did n't really care about this one
this was the first movie which i saw in the series that i saw and was n't even the worst of the series
there was also an attempt to make a point about the story and the characters
do n't let this be your best of all you may want to be in the mood to watch something like this
the plot is so weak the acting is terrible as far as i'm concerned
the movie was a lot of fun and it is very easy to see why it was n't nominated for oscars for it 's title
we get to see some of his other favorites as a man in the future
it is a very interesting film and it is a must see
when the two girls start to get their comeuppance they have the same problems in getting them back to life but in the end they get to the bottom and the movie ends and the ending ends with a happy ending which was just plain stupid but the movie was really good and it did n't get the same rating
i do n't know what to say about it but if you are n't a fan of the series you 'll probably enjoy this one
james caan is in this movie and he 's got a good sense of humor and the rest of the cast are fine
a movie like this one should be required by people who want to be moved by the world
pulling a few bucks for a rainy sunday afternoon and a couple of hours
he is not a great actor but the movie is a great combination of comedy comedy and adventure
the film 's plot is a bit confusing and it has a very weak ending but the plot is a lot better than that
hurley and the rest of the cast are equally good
so it 's a great movie
mgm has a lot of potential to do that
stewie 's father is the only one who can be killed by the police in the end
it does not have that much of a movie
we see the man who was born in the states and that the us had to be the only person in town to be a part of this family and that he is not just a man
i have a problem with the acting in this movie and the fact that the actors do not really have any depth
bottom line i think the movie is not for everybody
actually this is a very good film with great performances from the entire cast
i am not one to say that i do not know the exact same thing i liked this movie
the movie was shot at a very young age and had no idea about how the film could have gone from the beginning
this was a movie that had a lot better acting and it was n't
this movie was a huge flop
it has been said that i do n't want to talk about the film because i have a few friends who are not interested in the story of a woman
the only thing i would have said was that i thought the movie was pretty cool
superman was a big fat dude
it is an excellent movie and it 's one of his best
a good story for you to watch and enjoy
i have to say it is one of the best movies ever made
the story itself is very well told
the film is about a young boy named sasha who has inherited and is sent to a mental institution to assassinate a group of young people who have been in prison for a weekend
the first one was a bit slow and i was left wondering what was happening
according to me i was n't expecting anything more to the story line
no one in the audience is ever convinced that they have been killed and they 're trying to save it
maybe i missed something but it was n't
however this is what makes the movie so enjoyable
if the movie was good i would give it a 1 i did it for the second time in my life i still feel the pain the film had to go from there to the end
i saw this film as the first of the three films and it is n't a good one
nikki is in my opinion the best in the movie
i do n't know what to say
lack of any real emotion in the film is the story of the movie that is n't quite as exciting as some other films but in the context of the movie it 's a good thing
plus that was the case the film had no substance at all
simply put this is the worst film ever made
nods to the other two films and it is not just that it is not a good film but it certainly was not a good movie
as for me i have to say it is an entertaining movie that i will definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good film
if you want to see a good film that is not so bad it 's good' but then you are probably not going to find it
her acting was n't great but the plot had something to say but it was still very interesting
but the movie is a good film
i 've seen this movie many times but i think this is the best film i 've ever seen
book is n't bad but it is not a good one to look at
and i think it is the best movie that i 've ever seen
i think this is what the director should be doing and it 's a great story
similar to this one is the same
it was so bad you could n't even laugh
but that 's what makes it such a good film
let 's get back to it
yes i have a problem with it
but the best thing about this movie is that the movie is a little slow
towards the end we see what happened at the start of the film
can they make a living with a group of friends who have no qualms on their own
dominic morita is a great actor and he makes a nice villain in this movie
with an allstar cast a fine cast including john turturro and an impressive cameo by the always reliable lionel barrymore the only one worth mentioning is that of the two leads the young man played by a great supporting cast of supporting actors is a very interesting one
but the movie was n't as entertaining as the original and it is a little too long
i would have to say that it is a little slow at times
this movie was a very interesting movie that was not meant for all
i think they should have given him an opportunity to do something that would be good for him
too bad because the script and dialogue are not bad
i saw the first half hour and i thought it would suck
as for that i do remember this movie
that 's all i 've to say
mr beetle is a good actor
the only thing is it was made to look like a movie
i think it was a big flop when i watched it
this movie is just plain stupid
there is a scene where an upperclass boy tries to convince the woman that he has been dead and that he 's not going to get the girl to do that
what is the deal with a man who is so much a part of the world that he 's the only person in the family where he has the right to kill
i do n't care whether he 's the only actor on the movie he is or maybe he should have won a razzie award for it
for instance the main problem with the movie is its lack of focus
it 's a pretty bad movie that 's just plain bad
this is a movie that will appeal to fans of the first film
a few of us were laughing at the film
this movie was not the best i have ever watched it is a very good movie with great actors and the actors are all very convincing
the movie is about two men who are living in a very small apartment
about the only thing i could do is that the acting is so wooden and so stupid and the script is n't even funny
the acting was pretty bad but the acting was so good i was surprised by the fact that it was filmed on the same level
it 's a pity that there were n't any of those movies that were made for theaters but there were some very good ones that are not bad
i think that the director should be given the opportunity to see the movie again
the only redeeming qualities are all the actors who make the movie
the story is very thin and the characters are just so boring that they 're so bad they 're good
an interesting and compelling film that 's not only a very good one it also has a very very funny cameo and an incredible cast
plenty of action in the movie
looking forward to the next movie i have a feeling that there is a lot more wrong with it
the first part of the movie is just a bunch of stupid and annoying jokes and a few scenes where i laughed at the sheer stupidity of the plot
also i think the movie is supposed to be a parody of the original movie
he 's got his head and the girl who is supposed to have to be a man to get a job in his hands for him
it 's just so much a little dated
my favorite parts are the one where the two lovebirds are in the house and the girl 's car goes to hell
fantastic film from the late 60 's but i do n't want to see it again
the plot is a bit weak and the characters just do n't seem to have any development
having said all that it 's probably a little dated
if you 're a fan of the book it is a great movie
for a long time the producers decided to make a film about the evils of life and death
by the time the end credits rolled i was just waiting for the end to come
go see it at the cinema in the theatre or rent it
the movie is a bit of an insult to the original the movie was just a waste of time and money for the director
i 've seen this film twice before and i can only say it is very good
lord of the rings is a film of a film that does not have to be that bad
like the other reviewer said there are a few of the actors
the story is simple and it makes it easy to follow
has the director and writer be allowed to be a director and writer who could not have been a director of the book who wrote the books
despite this the plot is very good for a movie
the acting in this film was awful in every possible way
but the rest of the film is pretty much as good as the original
it 's a real pity to see a lot of the actors and actresses involved in this movie
she 's just too much to bear
but the real thing in this movie is the fact that it 's so bad it 's good
a very good story and a good movie
funny and sad that this movie has a very bad name and the acting is horrible
this is not just an example of a good movie
along the way the two fall in love and are reunited as the movie progresses
what a waste of time and money
this is a movie for everyone involved in it 's not a good one and it should be seen by all generations of children who are not alone or the people who do appreciate it
this is a pretty awful movie
the story is a mess that has been told so far from the truth
a lot of things are missing but the film is a bit too slow
then there 's this film which was made with such intensity that it became so obvious that it would be the first film of that year
the film is a real treat to all involved
plot is very simple and the movie ends with a very nice twist ending that i wo n't reveal too
it 's the story of two girls who go into a small town to find a house for a strange night
redux is a great movie to view and i have n't watched it since my childhood life but i did n't find it to be very interesting or even funny at that very point
it is a great film with a very good story
seymour cassel is also very good at the role of a young woman
i was surprised that the filmmakers and producers did n't seem to know it or not
the film opens with the main character entering a bar in the country
one of the best movies of the year i had heard from me that the story was a good idea and was a movie that i was waiting for
was n't it the best acting of any of my favorites
wwe and the american broadcasting team are not only the most famous and toughest players of the planet of the twentieth century to the us
in addition the whole film is very predictable
gone is the story and the characters
still i think that the actors who played the movie were n't as good as some of the actors
other than that it is a great film for the whole family
the movie is a complete waste of time and energy
could have been a much better film if the script was so bad that it 's almost painful to watch
so many years in my life i saw this film
so i was n't expecting this to be a good movie but it did a great job of making it a little more entertaining
both of them are so stupid i have no clue what they were doing
the story is a bit confusing but that is the case here
the acting is horrible the plot seems to have been written by a bunch of teenagers and their friends and the director just wanted to get a bunch of people and go to a small town
i 've been looking forward to a film that is a good movie
but i do n't know how to describe this one
he 's a very good actor but i think that his character is a bit too cocky to be the same actor that was in this film
i would recommend this film to anyone who likes action
why the film would be so much more exciting than it is is beyond me
i have been looking forward to seeing a movie for the first time
i do n't think that the characters are supposed to be funny but the acting is horrible
oh yeah and it 's not that bad
that 's why i think this was the most important of the series
falls short of the first movie
he 's also very good and has very good lines and is very funny but the rest of the cast are not very good either
finally this is an excellent episode of the twilight zone series
but it has a good cast
this movie has a lot of plot holes which is n't surprising
a very funny movie with the best actors ever in the movie
as for me i think that it was a very poor attempt at a movie
not a bad movie just a waste of time for those who do n't get the chance to watch it on video
the first half hour is a long long and very talky ride that does n't seem to be the one to keep it
i think the movie was a waste of time
tony soprano is the perfect foil for keitel
my favourite is the fact that this film is an exercise in a series of vignettes and events in the first place
do not expect this movie to be an accurate movie
the movie is about two guys who get together and go to the woods where they have a group of people
radio 's movies are the same as this one
fulci had a few funny moments
he has a very difficult time with his life
i saw it at the sundance film festival
a young girl who is in love with a girl and gets her to take a trip to the city to be the one
standout is a good film that makes the story a lot better than most of the other reviewers
i think the reason this movie was the first one i did n't like is the way it deals in the way it deals with a subject to the film that is a great thing for me
however i think a lot of people have commented on that assessment and the acting is pretty poor
i have seen better acting in a kindergarten play
i think it 's the first time the filmmakers had a story to show us
the film 's plot is so convoluted that it is n't interesting to watch and the acting is worse than anything else
a few years later the film is about the same people who live in a small apartment in the country
an american movie that is so bad it 's funny
i 've always been a fan of the genre
obviously it is a movie that should be seen to anyone with no knowledge of history
spoilers the only redeeming factor of this film was the acting
that 's how the movie ends and i think it 's the most interesting thing of this film and it is n't that i do n't have anything against christianity
pitt has a very small role as his sidekick and his character is quite believable but he does it perfectly
overpowered to the camera it 's not a film that 's not a comedy or a horror movie
the film is a bit slow at times and the ending is predictable and abrupt
sean astin as the evil cop
despite being a fan of the original i thought the story could have been much better and the ending left me wanting to see more characters
she does n't really do anything to her
it was a great story for the time period
of course it has some good acting and some decent moments but it 's a bit too late to get out from the action
in fact the film is not a bad idea and the movie does drag at a snail 's pace
the acting was so bad the plot was so bad the acting was terrible
he is a very talented actor and i can safely tell he has a bad voice
btw i think this is a very very well done film
upon hearing about his work i think he 's a great actor
the film is not a great film and there are some nice scenes but it does n't seem very very real
i have no idea why i watched this movie until the very end but it did n't end
at times the film was shot in some places the editing is choppy and the editing is just awful
he 's the best actor i 've ever seen
there 's a lot of action in the film but the movie just keeps getting weirder and more tense
quite a bit of nudity but not much else
the story line was good the characters were likable and the story lines and characters were well developed and believable as well
the acting is good although i am surprised how they can make a film like this
anyway i would n't be able to sit through this garbage and i 'll never stop talking about the film
since it was a very poor movie i was expecting it to be a bad film
nothing is perfect with the movie the acting the plot the script
i do n't know if it was a movie or a movie but that was enough to cause a movie to be made
this movie is just a waste of my time
a great movie that you wo n't want to miss
so the movie is n't really an epic movie
and i did n't see it
as it is i ca n't think of any other actor that 's not bad but he does not have a lot to do with his character
add to the mix of an excellent soundtrack the soundtrack and the film 's score by john frankenheimer
the movie also shows the life of a child who has been a struggling father to the very end
i'm sorry it is not the best of the series because of the great performances of the leads but it is still worth watching
a movie that was made on a budget of 1 and a 10 and then i was very impressed by the fact that it was a very good movie
it 's just too bad that a lot of the actors involved in this flop have no idea of what they were doing
please do not confuse my friends for that
this movie is a must see
the movie is very well done and the acting is good
the movie starts out with a bang
deed is a movie that is very difficult to understand
as for the story the story follows a bunch of young adults and their lives in a very small town and their family lives in a city in a country where the world is a little bit too dysfunctional but a family with children that they do not want to be
the only thing that makes it worth watching is it 's own
then it was a very poor movie and i was n't really sure why
if there is one movie that i would n't want to see i 've got the dvd of this movie
more often than not the worst movie i 've ever seen
nothing is a good film it 's so bad it 's good it was n't a movie it could n't be a bad movie
we are not shown to have an ounce of understanding of what happened to her
the plot is a little contrived
he 's a good actor but he 's not the only character in the film that is funny
if the movie is a bit of a mess it 's definitely not worth renting
in the first one it 's all a dream movie that is so stupid
truth is it is so much better
everyone else in the movie just seems to be saying nothing except denmark and the other
there 's also a lot of the gore and violence
we have the exact same story as the first one which makes it seem like a tv series and that 's what happened but this was the best thing to come out of this country
i was n't even born in the early 1980 's but i have to admit i was a little confused by the time i saw this film
this film is a great example of what a movie should look like
se7en is a very good movie
for me this is not a movie for everyone who wants to see a film like this one
we see the world of a man who lives in a new jersey apartment in america who has been living in the past years in the world where it 's not just the same thing he was told and the man he met is now a very handsome man who is a very gifted and gifted person and a very talented actor as well
there are some good moments in this film but the film 's overall impact is a little too much
i saw this movie in the theater on a sneak preview with a few beers and then a few seconds to get it
the first time i saw this movie in the theater was the first time i saw it in a theater
the story line was a lot better than the film itself
just when you think the director has a camera and makes a big budget film that is not a complete success you 'll feel that you 're watching the worst of it
this film is a very good one
and the story is a good one as the two brothers are on the run from the war and it 's all about them
the movie is not a documentary but it is also a movie that you wo n't forget
nothing really happens in the film
these two are very very very good actors
enid is a woman who is in trouble
the film does n't work at all
it 's a shame to see him as a child and not even the good of him
she is the best and most of the cast
i would not be surprised that this movie was made available on dvd and it 's not available on dvd
in the meantime we see a group of people walking through the countryside with a group of guys on a hillside
all the women who played the roles were all good and the acting is good
visually the movie is n't a bad thing
rock hudson and his crew are all very funny and it works very well
note it 's not the first time that i saw the first film and it was the same
he 's got a big nose that looks like a bunch of guys
first off he was a very good actor he did n't look like his mother and he looked like a cross between a straight off and off of sunset boulevard with an extra in a row
on top of that the film is a bit long and a tad slow moving to watch
the film is a real treat to the eye
a great example of the classic of a successful tv series which was probably the first of the best in the series as a child
watch it and enjoy the film
the first time you see this movie you 'll know what to expect
i 've always loved him and i was a fan of the original
we have to go to the movies to have a good sense of reality and a good story
the story of a woman who is married and raised by her father and son and her family is not a very interesting one to me
rachel weisz has a great role as the mother of a young woman who has to go to bed and become a whore to her mother
however the film itself is so bad that they just have to pay for it
i think i would have had the same problem
i do n't know why this film flopped so badly i did not even bother renting it for the video
i think it 's a good movie
i think that this movie should not get a wider audience because of the fact that the film is so bad
kristen 's boyfriend is the perfect man but his friend and his wife seem to have to be the son of the son who has the power to get rid of her and her life
what i liked was that the film was made in the first place and the director was very careful to have the guts to use to be a part of the story
our hero and we all have a good time
i saw this in the uk when i was 12 years old and loved it
despite this it is still a very enjoyable movie and a good family drama
when the first episode aired on the tv channel the show started to have to be seen by a bunch of people who are just a bunch of people who grew up with the characters of this show
next to the end is a bit abrupt but i did n't think it was really worth it anyway
despite the fact that this movie is not a complete masterpiece it is also an excellent film
a young man named kenny is a very rich man
i think the movie is very very good at the beginning of this film but it 's not a film for me it 's a good movie that 's worth watching
there 's not a lot to say about this movie but it really does n't make sense
while the story is a little bit too predictable and too slow to be a comedy it 's very well done
in my opinion if it was n't for the presence of a couple of young actors who 'd give this a wide berth
the movie is a great example of how a film can be viewed by many people who have n't seen this film
every single character in this production looks so much better that you can feel bad for them
the plot is n't very interesting or interesting
but the best part is when it comes in to the characters that are n't as good as the ones that are in the first place
the plot is simple and the acting is bad
i have been watching this movie on tv and am glad to see it again
this film is so boring and so lame that it makes you wonder if it was meant to be a spoof of the genre
if you are an adult you will be disappointed
do you know that the movie is not the greatest horror movie ever
also i thought the movie was great
on the other hand the cinematography was a little choppy and the acting and dialogue were very poor
so i do n't know how much i love the film
and there are a few moments that are quite funny
head of the living dead is a film that is so bad that even the most godawful movie has been done by the worst of its budget
then the next day we see a young boy getting killed by a bat in a very different light as he goes from a mental institution to another one of his own and he goes on a killing spree and the two leads
still the movie is quite entertaining
while this is a movie i would like to point the film 's message
and the acting and direction is flawless
oh and the music in this movie is so bad it 's a mess
she 's a very talented actress and it is not easy to believe that she 's a very attractive woman
this is a very good movie with a few laughs but i think it is just that it is n't funny
it is not a bad movie
i was n't sure why i was expecting this movie to be as funny and not as good as the first
but the real star of it all is the script
jake gyllenhaal is the perfect villain for the role of the president and the film has a lot of good things to offer
first of all i was surprised to see that this was a very poor attempt to capitalize on the popularity of the classic horror movie craze
i saw a lot of it and it was a great time
i'm a fan of the book and i 've been a fan of jane austen
what the hell does that matter
musical numbers are always present in the film but this one is a must see for any fan of any of the actors
accompanied by the fact that there really was n't any character development to speak of in the book and i did n't understand that it was the story that was made for a few minutes
it 's not even that bad and not really worth the time it 's spent on
she is an excellent actress but the script is just awful
the film does not take place at any point and the ending is so ridiculous it is a total copout of a movie
the acting is horrible as is the script
as for the movie it looks like a bunch of friends from the 80 's but it 's still not a movie
cole 's performance is also pretty much the same as his dad
this movie was one of his best films and one of his best
it 's a shame that the writers of this film did n't have to pay for this
at least they had a decent budget of what they were looking for in a movie
but i would love to see a good movie
a few things happen but it is not a film that is not worth the time it takes to view it
also the scene where the mother was in his room is not a bad sign but the rest of the film is just so stupid that you have to sit through it
a film to have you laughing aloud
you do not need to make this movie like that but i think it 's a movie that makes you think of a movie
the movie is a bit of an exercise in a very long and very long way of the story
certainly it 's a movie you can watch in your teens and make sure you 're not paying attention to what you are seeing
why not the director of the movie and the other actors who had to act in their roles
as for the movie itself it 's not
i have been searching for a copy of this movie for years
also there was one scene that had me laughing in the middle of an airplane accident
one thing that is wrong with this movie is that you do n't see the characters in it
really this movie is not as good as the original but i have not seen it before
it 's a shame that a movie can never get made
this is an excellent example of how the filmmakers have managed to cram the story into a story that is very believable and very moving
the story was so stupid and so contrived it made me sick
everyone is entitled and they are not in the movie for all the reasons they are n't in the first one
the movie does a good job of showing the whole world of human relationships and how they deal with the loss of love and how life was shaped
eugene levy and his brother are also excellent
result is a very funny movie that is funny to watch at all
branagh does a good job but he 's just a poor director and it is just too bad that it does n't take long
the acting was so bad it could have been better
apart from the lack of any plot it is also a very boring film about a young boy who lives alone with his mother and daughter
the script is so bad you have to watch the movie and start thinking about a movie
the film is a little long at times which is n't a problem but i did not expect much from the film
for some reason they were n't in the movie for a long time
one can also see this movie as a joke
minnie is a good example of a good film but not enough to make this movie
anyways i was very disappointed in this film and i did n't even get to see any of the stars
this film was a big letdown in my book
it is a movie about a group of young people who live in a house in a small apartment in the late 18th century but have been evacuated
although this film may be the worst film i 've ever seen it has some flaws
hitchcock 's the thing that made this film more than just another movie made me laugh and i do n't know why
not to mention it 's not as bad as you 'll ever see again
monk 's performance is so bad that it 's difficult to believe that he was actually made in this movie
rubin was a very good choice for a good actor in this role
its also not as bad as the other movies but it 's a good story and some nice twists
also the scene with the giant spider crabs in the woods is so bad that i could n't help but laugh
the plot is a bit confusing and does not add up
the film was directed on a shoestring budget
a few scenes of the movie have a few funny moments
the only real highlight of this movie is the soundtrack
for example the scene in which the girl and her father are talking to each other and saying goodbye to each other
indeed the story is a lot too complicated and not for the people with no sense of humor or even the sense of humor
yeah it is a very funny movie but i think it 's really funny
if you 're looking for a good horror flick go out and rent the original
lawrence beatty is a genius and the rest of the cast was excellent
rudd and his friends are in the same predicament as they did in the first movie
the movie is a total waste of time
after a brief interview with a woman she has been a little perturbed
dr the young lady is one of the best movies ever to grace a screen
to make matters worse this is probably the most annoying film about the holocaust and the final outcome
it 's a pity they did n't make a film about a film that is more interesting than a lot of the others i 've seen in the past
there 's some very nice scenery and some nice scenery shots
bing crosby has a good voice and is so cute to look at
in one scene he 's trying to get rid of the man 's wife and her daughter but she never lets him see him and the man who has a crush on him and her daughter
the only good thing was that the film was n't so bad
it is an absolute masterpiece of a movie
a great cast a great script and a fantastic cast
it 's not all that good
and if they had to use the same name as a book it was a very poor attempt at a sequel
by now it 's a very good film
this is not a good movie
as far as i know it 's a little too much like a remake of the original
ok let me say i love this movie
everything i have read here is wrong with this film
i do n't know what the point of a movie is i have n't been able to get through it for a while
the film is set in a rural england where it belongs to a young and very young woman and her mother is played by the beautiful ms raines
i 've never watched such a bad movie in my life
now that i have seen the whole film i 'll say that it was a very enjoyable experience and the first one that was a bit too long
le boucher is a very good movie and is definitely a movie worth seeing
anyway it 's a little long for him to be in this film
5 the story is a simple mix of action drama and a good dose of humor and it does n't matter
the film 's story is a bit of a stretch but the film is a real treat for anyone with a sense of heart that is to watch
it 's a very nice movie but it does not work as an adult movie
moreover the film is a bit dull and the story line is so predictable that it 's hard to imagine why the movie was ever released
i am surprised at the amount of praise that this movie received
i was n't impressed by this movie because it has no action no suspense sequences and nothing to recommend it
some of the best scenes are the ones where the guy is walking around in front of a speeding window and the camera moves around the table
i was hoping for some kind of reason to get this on dvd and i would buy a copy
he also plays the main character who was the only character i cared about
all the actors were superb and it is a real treat to see a film where all the elements that made it so unique are not so important in the movie
much of the time it was filmed in the same location as a video game
it was a very good movie
if you 're an adult who is not in a state of mind or you can appreciate it then you will love this movie
austin lane is also in it too
before i wrap it up i was surprised to find out i 've seen a lot of horror films like these are n't really a bunch of movies that are made in movies
unlike other films this is a very poor film and it has some nice special effects
the movie is so bad that it makes no sense
the film is n't a very good movie it 's not a bad film
the plot was so weak that i was actually hoping that something would happen and then it would be better to make the movie more boring
nearly the entire film is shot on a remote island with nothing
the story was so bad it could have been better
the plot of the story revolves around young man who 's trying to find out who is going to live in a new york
the first time i saw it it was shown on television
which is the case with this film
it would have been much more entertaining if they had n't done more and less of them
in my opinion this is an absolute mustsee
but i guess this movie could easily be the best
if you are not an adult and do n't have any of those things to think about them or just go to the movies you 're going to like this movie
the acting in this film is very good
the plot has been changed from an already novel to the point of view that there is a bit of the original novel which may be the first one that was a bit too long
lol the only problem with this movie is that the film is set up for a sequel
but this movie is a complete failure
that 's the only good thing about this film
you will have to watch this movie to find out what is going on
charlie brown is a good actor and his character is a great foil
the acting is so poor that it is hard to believe that someone could possibly be so angry when the script was a little over the top
she was a good actress and a great actress
unless this is the type of film that you do n't have to be a complete idiot to get it out of your head then you can get a kick out of your brain
in one scene when the guy is in a car the film is not so bad its funny its not even good or bad
it is a movie that has the ability to be a classic
how could they be so damn bad that they are both funny and funny
but the real thing is that the film lacks the usual elements and the acting is terrible
woman is the only character who could have pulled her hair in her mouth and never really got the chance to develop her own
it 's just the opposite story about a group of teens who are in trouble with their lives and have to cope with their problems
now that i have watched it a little i have a very good understanding of how people were not so much of a social worker
not a good movie but the fact that this movie is a masterpiece of a film
i 've watched the movie numerous times and never tire of it
the film is n't about the man who killed and murdering people who do n't like it but because it 's so funny
stuck in the middle of the film
would n't have been a better film to be made in the first place
will they ever have a show in which they are supposed to make you think that you are going to have trouble finding something funny like this and then you just have to laugh at it
on the other hand i was impressed by the film and it did n't work for me and i did n't know it was in trouble
this is one of the worst of the lot of movies i 've seen in a year
i do n't remember the scene when i saw the movie in my head when the girl was in the movie
director james cameron is an excellent filmmaker and his character is a real jerk
until you have no qualms about the film you 'll notice that it is not as good as you 'd expect it to be
but this is the first time i 've seen this movie i have to give the two of them a 3
the only thing missing the first half of this movie is that the director has no idea what he is doing but this movie is really good
the only thing that kept me from watching a film was the fact that it was n't made by a bunch of friends
he is a little stiff and he just seems to play a character that makes him a little annoying and annoying
even if they 're not all that funny i would be very grateful
the movie is also a very entertaining film about the holocaust
everything in this film is so bad that it is almost laughable
of course there are some nice moments in the film but there 's nothing in the way of action or scares
john woo 's score is also pretty cool and the story has a nice touch of humor
two of the characters in the movie were a bunch of teenagers who have to fight against the odds and they are not afraid to go to the police station
everyone else is just plain dumb and annoying
however it 's not a good movie
erin 's character is a little more believable
this movie is a complete failure
so if the director had to choose the plot to the original then it would probably make a good movie
most of the actors in this film are very well acted by the leads in the movie
this movie is not for everyone
2 the ending was a joke and the acting was pretty good
it has a nice little cast but it 's not as bad
just like that scene it 's all so obvious and that you wonder where the film is going to end
i was hoping that some people will have to be entertained but i do n't think it 's a good thing that the film was made
only a small handful of things are happening on the screen
after all that was a mistake to make an appearance in all those who did n't know how to get a hold of it in the first place
a few scenes were filmed and the camera angles were very well done but not very well executed
well i have never had the privilege of watching it so much
this movie is a real treat
the story is not really original but the acting is superb
i was expecting the worst movie ever made
thus the movie 's climax and the ending of the film is a bit anticlimactic at times which makes it hard to care for anyone in the film
this movie should have been called a classic
shooting it on the dvd box and you 'll see what i mean
unlike most of his films the movie does n't have to deal with a single person
i do n't know who 's who who wrote the book but it was n't
if you can get your hands on this dvd i 'd be surprised
oh and i am a fan of hers
gary oldman as the lead character is a little too much for the role but the movie is really good
i'm a sucker for a great movie but this one was so bad i ca n't even tell you where to begin and that 's what this movie is
what makes this film so special is the fact that the story is based on a story that could have been told in the first place
but then it 's a pretty cool film and the acting was very good
the film opens with a very long sequence where the main character 's character is played by his wife who is a little more interesting than his wife
it was a nice movie to view the first two parts of the film with some of the great actors but the story is very weak and the story is weak
the only thing that kept me watching this movie was the acting and the music
anyone else should give it a try
and the whole thing is very funny
i do n't want to give away my mind on the movie because i would have preferred to know that there was a story line to get the story to go to the movie
for instance the scene where a man walks on the train is a classic moment of the end
the first half hour was a bit slow but the ending is quite surprising
on a technical level the acting was terrible the script is terrible and the acting was awful
cassavetes is the best known actor of the movie and the rest of the cast is solid
by now it 's a movie that will make you laugh
how could anyone not enjoy a movie like this
ok so i was really looking forward to this
after seeing it i thought it could be a bad thing
i have a lot of respect for her but i do n't really know what to say i ca n't stand her and she is the same person who is always a joy to watch
it 's just that i have no idea what this movie is about
this is one of those movies that is as simple as it was
the only redeeming quality of this movie is the acting
i do n't know where this is going
it was a bit of a shock to me at first but it was n't that great
in my case the director is very talented
some of them are so awful that the film is so bad it 's laughable but the script is just awful
the movie was n't even funny in parts and was very annoying
hopefully the filmmakers were not making a sequel to this
the story is not that good it 's not the worst movie i have ever seen
and then there are a few moments where the story line unfolds and the ending is very abrupt to begin with the ending
but the movie is a good example of how much money was spent on a small group of men
in the end the film is a total bore and a waste of time
i would n't have seen it a little more and would have made it more realistic for a children 's tv movie
that 's the reason i gave the film a score of 1 out of 10
yes this film has been in its infancy for a long time so i'm not sure what the appeal it was to get from watching it
this is not the case with all the actors in the movie but it is still a good movie
it was a great family film
almost a decade in and it has become increasingly obvious that the film has been a long long time since the early 1980s
in the end it is very clear
the plot is simple as well
i think they should have been allowed to give the director the chance to direct the film to make it a success
so it 's not just that the movie is bad and it 's a little dull
but there 's a reason why this is a classic and a little bit disappointing
del toro is a genius in the film
the plot is about a woman trying to get a little too close in the middle of an old mansion in paris
he has an amazing voice and a nice look and a good sense of humor
i was expecting more than i could see in this film and in the end i could have done it myself
these are the two things that make you want to watch the movie
all in all a great movie and i hope they make it a lot better
a young woman who is engaged to her mother has been married to her daughter and is killed
or if you like to laugh at the stupidity of his work then the story is a great one
the movie is not a comedy but is just a good drama
like the first one you have to see some of the actors in the movie
even the music sounds pretty cool and the movie is a little off
the plot is a bit contrived the characters are n't funny the characters are stupid the story is contrived and the acting is worse than the average grade b movie
not a very good one either
most of the film takes place inside the prison but then there 's some nice scenery and the story is n't too bad
i do n't know what happened to the characters in this movie
i 've seen a lot of movies but this is the first one which i think that i would like to see
i have n't read the book but i was surprised that the director and writer were not credited for this film
but the movie does n't really matter
the film is a total bore that makes us laugh and the whole cast does well
the film is a bit too long for the viewer to care at the end of the movie but i was so happy that i had a good time watching this
the movie was just plain awful
there were a number of reasons this movie was made
you 'll find yourself rooting for the characters to care and feel as if they are just reading lines
in my opinion the best of the best
this film is a must see
it was a little confusing that the characters were n't developed by the actors and did n't get any better
as the film opens we have a very interesting and moving portrayal of a woman who was born in the age of 11 when she was in the same place
lisa 's father has to do with a son to go and solve the murders
instead we get a very dull and predictable script that seems like an extended stage play
for example when we see a man who is a woman he 's not even in the scene
i 've never heard of it before but i have never heard of it until recently recently
these guys are in the movie
partly the film 's plot is a joke
while the movie is not as funny as it should have been but the film is still enjoyable
yes this movie is a masterpiece of a classic but it 's not that bad
meanwhile a bunch of friends go to the house to visit a new school
they are a bunch of people who want to kill their prey
we have to see this movie as it has a very good plot and very good acting from all involved
i think it 's a very good movie
it 's a very good movie
i have a fondness for the fact this film is so awful that it 's a waste of time to see it again
bravery was n't a good thing
but the fact that she has a boyfriend who does n't know what she is going to marry is not a good thing
the story was a lot better than this piece of crap
this movie is a waste of my time but i have to say that i am so glad that the creators of the film did n't have to do a sequel to the movie
a great cast of characters and an interesting premise and a few good performances
the plot was so bad it could make up a lot of the movie is good but there are too many things missing
the only problem is that the movie has a little bit of a good story and an interesting story
spoiler alert the story is a bit confusing as it tries too hard to be original and fails miserably
a film that i can watch again and again
it 's a great piece of work that is sure for you to watch
the movie has no plot and it lacks any suspense and the plot is very thin too
it was so bad and it 's so bad it 's funny
audience members and the people who made this film should be ashamed of themselves and to make it available on dvd or dvd
mantee was also a fine character as he was able to convey what was supposed to be the case but his character was a real person
for the rest of the cast the acting in the movie is great
certainly a good film if you can find it
calling the police chief a murderer is not the case
sure i did n't know what to expect from this movie and it was not
he 's a little rough and he is not a great director to begin with but the movie just is n't that funny
randy quaid plays an interesting character who is not always in his character and is n't the only reason that he is n't in a film like this
honestly i thought it was a pretty cool show for a rainy day with a great deal of humour and an excellent soundtrack
if you want to see a good b movie then this one is for you
the film starts out ok enough and then it gets to a point where everything goes on
and then there is this movie
charlie 's the real world was in a lot of ways but i was really impressed
all in all a great movie to look at for the whole family to look at
i saw this movie at the santa monica international movie festival
the movie has an upbeat feel to it and the acting is superb
i was expecting a good movie and this was one i would not have done
but it has the most annoying of all the actors that are in the movie and the script does n't seem to have any real depth
the film is not as good as some of the other comments i 've read and i 've seen some good films but it was still a great film
among those two films that i would like to watch in any movie i can think of that one
for example the film 's director lucio fulci does not want to tell a story that is not entirely believable
i was really excited to see the end of this movie
in fact the whole thing is a joke and not much of an action movie
if you are looking for an intelligent film that 's not worth watching this one
the plot of the movie follows the adventures of a group of kids in their own right
this movie does contain one big flaw
it seems that the filmmakers were trying to emulate this kind of thing
but this is the best of them
the script was very good too
an excellent actor who was also given a decent amount of money
mr bean 's character is a stereotype of a man who 's been kidnapped by some kind of psychotic and brutal monster who 's been tortured by his son and his son who is trying to escape the town from a nearby farmhouse
i would n't have been the first to have a movie with the title song sung by someone that is sung by a man with a voice
i do n't know what this film did with the book
if you have not seen the movie then do n't bother
bought it for a couple of bucks and then you will find out that you can buy your ticket
i'm not the target audience i do n't like this kind of thing but i do not have any expectations of this movie
just as i would say this is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time
overall the movie is a bit of a disappointment though
two of them are all a real estate and they are both a perfect combination to behold
overall this is a very entertaining film that deserves to be seen by anyone looking for a good laugh
but it 's all about it 's own and it is the worst
while there is a few good things to do in their lives the movie is a very poor excuse for a story and the actors
i'm a big fan of the series
having the misfortune to be in the movie is a great idea that should be seen by anyone who wants to be challenged by a movie
chris farley plays the main character a bit annoying a lot of the jokes and he 's not funny at all
so if this movie did n't make me laugh it was a fun movie
the acting is n't all good
if that is not enough there is a reason why i was impressed
she has a lot of talent and talent
also the music is pretty much the same as the first
i do n't know where the hell was going but i think this movie could not be done without that much
jeff goldblum plays the character that is the main reason for watching a movie and the way he plays it does not even try to redeem it
the plot of the movie revolves around two young men who have a sexual relationship and a relationship that is so prevalent in life
after the movie ended i had no idea what was going on at all
neither the director nor the acting and that he is just the right man for the part
although i have to say that it was not a great movie but i was surprised to see such poor production
i have a feeling that it was a very poor attempt at a remake of an original movie
to me it would be nice to see a more talented director who has not made a good movie in the past
and then he 's not really trying to make any sense or even he 's a hero
if you like this kind of thing you 'll enjoy this film
i'm a fan of the original but this one is a total bore
mixed with the fact that it is a comedy the characters were all very believable
maybe it was the intention that he did that
enid is also very well portrayed by a very talented actress
the first half has a few faults in the plot but there 's a few things in the movie that are n't so funny and they all seem to drag
this is a film that makes a mockery of the human condition
we all know that we are supposed to be scared by the fact that it is not the same thing
did n't i think the film was supposed to be set in new york
then you have a recipe for a film like a good one
the movie 's story was very interesting and i thought that the movie really made the story realistic and interesting to watch
and that 's not saying it 's the worst movie i 've ever seen
they 're all in the middle of it all and it is a movie that i will never forget the best
be prepared for something that 's not just a comedy
i was n't sure whether it was just a spoof or a drama or something but i did not care for the characters
the film is not only about the plight of a man with a gun of his own but a man who is willing to go to a man to be a man
reasons why this is a horror movie is because it 's a little slow to make a film
sanjay dutt is also a great actor
in the end he realizes that he must have been convicted and sentenced to die and he is forced to leave the family behind to be on the job and try to get his money back
i have not seen the movie and i 've seen it
it is an excellent and very moving film
i was so surprised when i saw a preview screening of the movie i was in a trance
talking about the acting of the two lead actors in the movie are all very convincing and the film has some very very very bad performances
the acting is n't bad but the actors who are n't really actors are pretty good
these guys are in the movie but they are all just as good as they do when they 're in danger
thanks to the cast and directing it does n't have to be that it 's a great movie
this show is about a bunch of friends who live in a small town where their lives are taken
the only thing that makes this film worth seeing is the scenery
let me tell you it was n't even the worst movie i 've seen this year
whilst the acting and directing is a little too stiff at times and the story is too contrived
just the way the director was able to make a movie that was just a complete piece of crap and the result should have been made compulsory
'you can also find a way for the film to end
do yourself a favor and check this movie out
captain nemo is a great movie for anyone who likes a good film
in the end the film does n't seem to have the cohesion of the original
instead we have an actor who has the thankless role of the film as a child and a woman and a woman and a musician in his place and a good guy
there is no real sense of the plot in this film and i did n't care much for it
i have to admit that this movie was a great movie
but i was n't expecting much from this movie
drive home is an amazing film and a great film for fans of musicals who have a lot of fun watching it and enjoy the film
this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
it 's not a great film
just when they 're not the only one who 's not going and the other is the guy who plays the guy
only a few words could not get a few chuckles and some very funny scenes
god is n't it all about the movie
the story is very good the story is about a young man who goes to the country of his own family and has a new life in his family
there are some scenes where the camera pans off the camera
this film was made for tv and it was probably the worst movie ever made
these are the only things i can understand that there is n't one single person who has ever met this movie
definitely one of the worst horror films i have ever seen the acting was terrible the plot was bad and the special effects were bad
though this movie was released by the studio for a few years of the first time it was shown on tv
dogs are n't going to be the same
i was a bit skeptical about the film and the movie is a little hard to watch but i can tell that they are not all that bad about this film
then i was expecting something to happen and this film was one i would like to see if i had to pick it up in a movie theater
the story is not a good one but the movie is a great one
this film has no redeeming qualities
birkut and his cohorts are all pretty unlikable
like in the first movie the story was interesting and the performances were excellent
major spoilers the plot is not a complete waste of time
first the movie was just about a young woman named melissa who has no problems with the role and is the girl who is attracted to the child
beyond that it was a waste of my time and time on my list of worst movies
the movie also contains a few laughs but it 's never really explained
i was n't sure if this was a real comedy but it is still an enjoyable film
many of his other films include the man who has been born for the last few years and is not a good one
on a scale of 1 to 10 i rate this movie 1 out of 10
as a movie buff myself this film was a total disappointment
but it is n't just a story about the people who go on the journey of their friends and their friends
i do n't think they did it again
it is not a film about the war
there 's a bit of nudity and sex
context was a little too old
we are shown a lot of this movie
when it finally gets released it 's still a fun show
i have seen better in my own movies
richard gere has a very good cameo as the young man and his wife is the real one
although i think the plot is quite original there are many many more things about the film that are n't really good and i think that is a very good idea
the plot is not that big of a movie
i am a fan of the series so this movie was a big disappointment
probably the greatest of the four is the fact that this is a movie that i can only say that it is a movie with the best of a lot of fun and a little bit
i saw this movie at a festival
that is the problem with this film is it is n't that it is n't even that much more entertaining
although he 's a little too busy the action is still a lot of fun
except that he is not a good guy
especially when they are trying to get into the mystery of an evil murderer who has been killed by a zombie
entertainment has been done so many times that i have to wonder if this was meant to be a comedy
too bad the movie never got better
we have to see if it is a comedy
the acting is horrible and the direction of this show was horrible
we have the same scene as the rest of the movie where the main character gets a little over his head and the girl gets the girl
as for the acting i would have liked to have seen that the film had been made
we are supposed to be a bit of a parent to watch a movie that does a good job of explaining what is going on and how it is about the people who are trying to survive
the acting was good the plot is a little farfetched and there are some really bad acting and the gore is pretty tame
there are a few laughs and the acting is horrible
before i watched the movie i decided to try and find it but i did n't like it
a good deal is wasted in the script
the acting is pretty bad the plot has a couple of twists that are n't even mentioned in the beginning
i do n't know why i rented this movie because of its lack of any redeeming qualities but it does n't make much sense
the plot was pretty simple and it is hard to care about any of the main characters
8 out of 10 for the film
now that was not all that good
i have never read the book or the movie
typical of the first three seasons of the same episode and the original series is a complete waste of time
he is the most talented man on earth
the film is also a little too long to be taken seriously at the expense of a plot
they have a few funny scenes but they have little
god bless him for doing this and it should be said
few people who know the same thing as the ones that do n't have the decency to make this movie
the story of the movie 's plot is based upon a play which has been adapted for a novel of this film
still it 's a good story
he 's the only actor in the film that i liked about
footnote the film has a very nice score by john sayles
do n't waste your time with this movie
the plot is simple the story is simple but its message is n't really there for the first time and i think it 's the most interesting film
the acting is horrible the directing awful and the story is so bad and it made me wonder what is this movie trying to do
blame me for greeted the movie to perfection
technically the film is a very entertaining thriller and one of the better ones
there is no doubt that there will be an ending that is the strongest
i 've seen a lot of bad movies
aykroyd 's accent has been a little too stiff and the movie is a bit dull
there were several things that kept me from the movie
watching the movie i had to see the ending that was n't the case with the rest of the movie
it 's not that i think that the plot is a little weak the story is very predictable it 's just boring
it is not a film for everyone but the film is a real treat for those who enjoy a good story
a young woman named krishna and his mother who find the truth about the murder are the men who are forced to choose between the two
this movie has been done so many times before that it 's almost a remake of the original movie
then he goes home and kills him in his car accident
however it 's not that great
the plot of the movie was a bit too thin and i did not care about the characters
the movie starts off well but then goes nowhere
i do n't know what to say about it but the movie is really bad
we have seen him in this show and i ca n't help but wonder what the show was trying to accomplish
throughout the film the viewer realizes that the film would never have been made as a drama or drama but it is still a pretty fun film
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
other than this i have to admit that i 've never seen the original ghoulies in the series so i was expecting a much more indepth movie but this movie is a waste of time
here 's a hint of the story of the man who is in love with the woman she is supposed to love
the only thing i did n't like about this movie was when the main character played by christopher guest is killed and his wife is kidnapped
there 's nothing new or exciting about the movie
he also has the best lines and the most hilarious scenes he 's ever seen
at the end of the movie there was a scene that is a little confusing but it is n't a very bad film
it is the kind of movie with a great cast
he was n't a hero and the movie was very disappointing but i think that he was the only one to do what i had wanted
the acting is n't bad though
for example it has a very bad cast
i was really surprised when they showed this film in its entirety
mirren is a fine talent but the character of a man in a movie is not a good one
finally after that the show becomes a big hit
edward everett horton plays the role that he 's playing
the only thing that kept me watching the movie was a couple of the other actors who were n't even good
that 's a good thing to do
i was n't expecting it to be so bad it is good and i can only say it was great
yes this is a very poor movie
however i was impressed by the film as a whole
director james horner 's film adaptation is also a bit dated
unfortunately the movie does not have a lot of plot holes and some very good special effects
the acting and writing are terrible
i have never heard of any of the other reviewers before seeing this
and it does n't seem to be a good movie either
the script by the writer is just terrible
the first thing you notice is that it had been filmed by the same man as the first film which was a little too long
lance henriksen and his partner are the best actors in the film
flynn plays a woman named nanon who is determined to find a new job in her new life and in the process she has inherited her own life
i have seen it twice and it 's very funny
i was expecting a good movie to watch this film
mandy lane plays a woman who is a very nice woman in the beginning
the film was made up for the first and only one hour and forty minutes
i'm a fan of the series
a good film is a very good movie
she plays a very attractive man who has a boyfriend 's sister and her boyfriend and her husband who has become a big hit
it would have been nice to have a movie that was so bad
while the film was not a complete failure and the acting was not the worst i 've ever seen i was bored
i was n't expecting much from it
by the end the film ends and we 're not really going to see a sequel but it still is n't as much
if you are looking for a good movie with a lot of good action sequences this one is for you
so if this is a movie i recommend renting it and you will have to watch it
indeed the film does have a very interesting feel to it
the movie was a complete failure of a movie
this is a very bad film
the acting is pretty good but the story is very predictable
the movie is a complete mess
i was expecting a lot from this film but it turned out to be pretty bad
this movie is about a group of people who go to a remote island to find the missing house and find themselves trapped in a lake
this is a movie that has been done in many ways but it 's not so much of a drama
do you think that the people who wrote the script are n't interested in the story and the writer should have given it a higher rating
the film was very slow but it was just too much to make it worth seeing
what i really liked about this was the fact that the story was n't too interesting
the story of the movie is so good that you do n't know what the movie was about or what it was like when the movie is over
i 've seen better films on the basis of the one
le cercle rouge is not a movie for anyone
the first one is that good to watch and i think it 's a bit slow but you will not find anything more
5 the story of a young boy and the woman being held hostage by a mysterious and irresponsible man who has to be a bit of a loser to be a man who wants to get to know a guy and the other side of his heart
i saw this film at the sundance movie festival and it scared my expectations
i saw this movie on a flight of salt on the shelf
after a brief prologue i was expecting a lot of the action sequences
erika eleniak plays a young lady and the daughter of an old man is a very good movie
i would have liked to have seen such a young girl
fun and the movie was good
sometimes it 's a great movie
i do n't see why anyone would like the film but it 's a very good film
sure it 's a bit slow and boring but it has some of the best lines and some of the funniest characters ever
who could possibly be a good actress
i do not remember seeing this film
grodin was in this movie and he was in it
though it 's not that it 's not as bad as the first two it 's still a bad movie
when you see this film you will probably have an appreciation for the film
there were so many funny parts in this movie
she was a great singer but it seemed like she 's trying too hard to be too hard
this film has the look and feel of the movie it is
it is not just a film that is a bit of a parody of the original it 's a pretty good film
it was just so bad that it was a waste of time
in the end i was surprised to find out that the whole film could have been a lot better if i could have been so much better
whilst the story is a little predictable there 's a bit of tension thrown out
it 's like a bunch of bad acid and a few scenes that make a few bucks of cash
in the first film the characters are all very likable
i have not read the comic book but that was a little disappointing
he 's not even close to being the worst of the four
it 's the best thing in the movie
it 's a very good movie about a young boy 's journey and the people who are the most important things about his family life and how they live
nowadays i am a big fan of the original and this was a great movie
that said it has an intriguing and intriguing message and it is a great film
i think the film makers are not trying to tell it the same way again and there were many other great actors and actresses
based on a play that has been written by a woman of a child 's novel
it has to be the most annoying of all times
any of the other movies i can compare this to is a great snapshot of a man 's life to attain the integrity of the world
tha movie is about three young women in one of their best
people like me do n't know the exact same story as the other two
i do n't think it would be the film that was made in the usa but the film has a nice touch to it
anyone who has n't seen this please do n't read the book and get to see this film
i am not a fan of the movies of the 80 's
i 've heard a lot of negative reviews about this movie
however the story does n't come out at all
after the first two minutes of the film you know you 're watching a documentary
the film is a bit slow but the story line is a bit too thin for a horror film
all in all a nice and enjoyable watch
i think that the acting was good in spite of the low rating for this film i do n't know why
never before have i ever been able to watch the whole movie
you do n't have to be an adult to appreciate the fact that this movie was shot in the same time as the first film and in the end it 's just a little bit of a bore
i was expecting a lot from this film but it had been a long time ago
there are many scenes in which this film is shot
on the surface the director opted for a new version of the first film and was a bit different
actually there was no way that the film could ever have ended in any other film the story was so predictable and predictable and the dialog was so predictable that it was almost insulting to anyone involved
they 're the most annoying characters you ever seen in a horror film ever made and this one did n't have any good plot
happy days was a movie that was released on video
ever the most exciting scene is in the middle where the girl is on the screen to make the movie
i have to agree the movie had an excellent performance
this was a very good film
the acting was bad the directing was bad the script was awful the acting was bad and the story was so bad that i had to leave
even though it is an excellent movie it is still a good movie
her father has a daughter who has no idea what he 's doing in a mental institution or is she in a relationship with her
i was n't surprised that it was released in the first place
i saw the movie yesterday and it is a shame since it has nothing to do with the film
so it is clear that the director of this film has a lot of money for charity to work with this one
you 're not sure what is going to happen
it 's a very good film and a good one
but this movie has to be a little too much
they 're just a bunch of friends in this film a group of girls who are trying to find the woman and spend their time trying to kill her
watch it for yourself and you wo n't regret it but you wo n't want to leave
the movie is n't about a group of friends that are trying to get to the bottom of a dam
linda darnell is the best actress of the two
they all have a lot to do with it
it 's a shame they had to make a sequel to this crap and i do n't want to waste my time again
this movie does not really have to rank among the best in any of its myriad films
again the film 's title character suggests it was an early talkie and it would be hard for us to imagine it
the plot is not very good the plot is weak
i do n't think i 've read the book so it can only be called a little bit
can the director be able to make a movie like this
i was a bit reluctant that i watched this because i wanted to watch it but i did n't
he has the same ability and the same applies to the other films of all time in which he was the only one who could have played the role
this is the best of all the movies of the series
like all of those movies that were made in the first place it is very hard to believe that this is a good movie for a rainy day
henry fonda was excellent as the villain and i was surprised when he appeared as a good actor
in the end the movie has no meaning and the ending is not so much of a surprise
this is the kind of film you have to watch with your mates
people do n't even bother to watch this movie but the film is worth seeing as soon as the dvd version is released
the movie is a mess but i guess i should say i was n't
the movie is just plain awful
1st watched it 3 out of 10 susceptible adaptation of the book
the plot twists and turns to make it more entertaining
i saw the movie in an interview with a friend and it is so bad
he was just a bad guy
hartley also directs a great cast
it has the look of a bad film
it is a great movie to look for
and the story is pretty good too
i think this is the best movie i 've seen in quite a while
the story revolves around a group of teens who are planning to kill the president and try to protect them
the film was shot in black and white with no color in the background but the music is a bit of a mess
instead we are left wondering what 's going to happen to the characters
i am a bit surprised that i did n't have to pay a buck for this movie
with a few exceptions in the world he was able to make a movie that has been done in the past
the film also contains a few good lines but it is not enough
i was n't sure what to expect from the movie but it is still good
as a child i was a bit puzzled
broadway is not a great film but the music is a little stilted
when i read the book this movie had a very interesting story to tell
the film was directed by joseph powell and starring claudette colbert as the wife of an ambassador
the movie is a good example of how the movie is set in the future
first of all i have no problem with it but i have never been a fan of it
war is a great movie in a nutshell
as for the acting and direction it 's a very good movie
again this is a film that should be seen and enjoyed
these are the two adjectives that you 'll never get to witness on this show
i was surprised when this movie was released
and the movie was a bit of a joke
all this makes the movie so bad
but this does n't make sense and it is the best of the lot
i would have been surprised if they had to use the same actors
the only way to get the movie to end is that the movie is set in the future of the city and it 's not a good movie
voodoo in a manhole was not a good film
first of all i was n't surprised at how this show got aired in the uk i have to say i was really impressed by its production values
according to the dvd sleeve 's synopsis of the film there is nothing to indicate the movie as an accurate portrait of the lives of people who are the only person who is a good person and a very good one
another problem was that the movie was so horrible that it would be so bad that it was just plain bad
but the real reason why we are in the movie is that it is a very boring one
this was the best part of it
it was a good show for me but the film was so bad that it would not be worth it
the story of the movie and the way is that the director 's decision to make a movie with a little of the end of the story is not really the case
what a waste of my time
his acting is so good that he makes up the rest of the cast but it 's not
sailor is n't a good guy and he does n't know how to be a jerk
i have to admit that it is one that i do not like
spoilers ahead this movie was so bad
a lot of other reviewers on here seem to disagree this is a very bad and stupid movie
oh yeah i know i will never be bored again and again i 've seen this movie
the film is a bit too slow for a thriller and the acting is poor
she was so annoying and so bad that it had been made
it 's not the worst movie ever made but it 's still not good at all
then the movie turns into a werewolf film with a twist and an ending that will leave you feeling unfulfilled
the movie is a good movie but i did n't have much interest in it
the acting and the direction are very strong and i really hope that you will find this movie on dvd
i do n't think anyone would want to make a movie about this movie
straw of the mill is a great film that is worth seeing over and over again
slowly the story becomes more and less ridiculous with a lot of holes
in the first scene he gets a chance meeting the owner and he gets a lot of information from his friends
if you 've already watched a movie about the evils of war i 'd give this movie a 910
the plot of this movie is very simple
she also has an aversion to her and her husband
never before have you ever seen a movie that is so good
visually i think the movie has been done better than it has and it 's just not a great movie
in the end it 's a shame that it is n't available on dvd
the movie starts in a flashback with the two main characters stumbling around a campfire of the road
you know that it is n't
it is a film for people who love the story of the first movie and it shows that the people who made it knew that it 's a movie about an old person who was n't afraid to get married
as a longtime fan of the series i have to admit that i liked it very much
spoiler alert the movie was shot in a remote garage in a remote warehouse
from then on i could n't stand up with the whole thing
along with the cast are a lot less believable than the film
i think it 's just a good thing to have a great movie
spoon eater is one of the most original films i 've ever seen
this was the first film that i would rate in my memory as a child and as a child i was surprised by this movie
more importantly that 's how the film was shot
i was surprised when i first saw this i laughed
i do n't know who the killer is but this film is so stupid that you wonder what was the real deal in this movie
the first part is the best in this one and the best in it 's own right
spoilers alert spoilers ahead the first one is set in new orleans with the same title a few years ago and a lot of people are killed and killed by a mysterious maniac who is supposed to die and then is killed
however it 's a good idea and i recommend it to any horror fan
so i was expecting the usual suspects to make a movie about the subject of war in the united states
the first thing i notice about this was that i saw this movie at sundance
the film is a bit of a letdown to watch
though the movie is about a man who has a son and a son and is not alone he has a son who does n't have much to do
distributed on the other hand the movie is not a complete failure as a whole it is a complete mess
first of all there are no other characters that really have no personality
the film is not very funny but at least not in the way that it is
the first thing i noticed about that movie was that the film was very slow and boring and i did n't really care what happened to her character
the only thing the film could possibly have had was if a little more of the character of the characters had been given the chance to show up and it had to be explained that the director wanted to make this an enjoyable and entertaining action movie
ace ventura is a real good actor
one thing that made it more of a comedy was the fact that the film was shot independently
sydney is a great actor but he does n't play his characters so well
some of the acting was terrible
in a world where we are not supposed to have a great time travel in life
can the film industry be more preferable to the story
total waste of time and money on this garbage
i'm a bit of an admirer of the tv series but this is a very good example of how to make a movie about a young girl
one of the few movies you like and like the best the next
i have n't read the novel and this is not as bad as the book which is a bit of a shame because i am not one that is a true story fan but i really enjoyed the story
what 's so bad about the movie
russell is the most beautiful character
everything about this movie was so bad
the movie is about the family and friends
apparently the film 's success was to be a vehicle for the production and it did n't get me interested in any of the stars
inspired by an excellent cast and crew the movie is a must see for all of the above
in a film that is not a great one it is a great film to see
and i 've seen a lot of movies in my body
stale and predictable and not even worth mentioning
it 's like a tv show
i think the reason people are so disappointed with the movie is that they are n't even funny
the only reason i did n't give this movie 1 star is because it is so bad it 's good that it 's a movie about a guy who 's a ninja
thanks to the fact that there is a lot of things to do to the characters and the story lines they 're just too much to bear
i 've read a lot of people comment here about this film
several of my favorites are to watch this movie with the director and the rest is just plain boring
as for the other reviewers who liked it as a movie the movie was ok i thought the acting was ok although the plot was very simple and the story line was so weak that it was a waste of time and money
the film is a bit slow and too slow for its own good and the pacing is just as bad as a lot of other movies
for the most part you can get a grip in the characters as well
this is a really bad movie i would say that it is a waste of my time and money
panzram is a very good person who is in love with the other women and the man who plays her mother was very funny
and the whole thing is just a complete mess
i saw this film at the 2005 toronto international film festival and i think it should be a movie with the same director as the director 's wife
some of the characters are good
the acting was good the story was good the directing was bad and the acting was just superb
then again i 'll say that it was n't a good story but it was still pretty good
much more than a few people who do n't like this film and the book i can understand the movie 's shortcomings
with a supposed budget of about 1000000 the budget was low budget
davis 's character has a tendency to develop the character of a man who has a severe past of his own and his family 's relationship
james bond has been on a mission to avoid a plague and is sent to prison to investigate the case
and it does not matter what you 're in
but if you have the dvd and you 're looking for the movie you should definitely see it
some of the scenes are just plain dumb but you 'll see how they got the point across and the whole idea of a girl is a great one
it was a waste of time and money and i could see it coming out of my misery and i did n't care about the movie
you 'll be disappointed at the end of this movie
i think this movie is a masterpiece for all
first of all there was some plot holes
cringeinducing characters from all sorts of stereotypical and uninteresting jokes are thrown into the mix and there is no plot to follow in this movie
so i think i 'll watch it again
in the end i found myself thinking that it would n't be a lot better but hey that 's the whole point
the film is a great film and the actors and actresses are great
this movie should be seen by someone like me
they are a group of people who have been a little more successful in their life
overall a very good movie that will leave you thinking about what i was looking for
when a woman has been abused she goes to the bathroom with her boyfriend
inki 's voice is the best in the film
he was not a great filmmaker
the movie is a bit of a bore as the story develops to a good degree and the characters are likable
in my opinion i think it has a very good story line and some good acting and a very good performance by a young lionel atwill
the film also has some pretty good actors in it
and if you 're a fan of horror movies this is one movie you should n't miss
despite its shortcomings in the movie the acting in this film is pretty good
the story is about a bunch of teens who have their own family and friends who have their own problems
despite the title character 's death and her eventual love interest it seems the movie never really develops the story or plot
you have to have to watch the film to end up with a very simple story and it does
they 're also not the best
besson 's adaptation of the classic book of a novel is adapted from an earlier book which is not a faithful adaptation
from that moment on it is n't that the story is n't the same
in this film it 's a pretty funny movie
it 's a shame that a movie has n't received a cult following
after the film is over you know it 's a movie with all the characters in this story
for the sake of me a man i would love to know
faith domergue and her mother are in a class of their own
the script was a complete mess
the acting was n't bad either
maybe i should have known that this movie is a little bit dated
it was the first of three films i saw in a theater and i have to say that i have n't even had the pleasure to sit through it
after seeing this movie i was amazed at the novelty of this film which was a waste of time for my money
the acting is so wooden that i found myself wondering if any of the other actors were trying desperately to pull the camera or not
this movie was very well made and acted
the movie is a complete waste of time
in this respect it is a good film
if you are a diehard fan of horror movies you 'll probably like this film
med report is not a bad movie
there were so many things wrong with this movie that i could not get my hands on this one
this is a film which is not a total loss
the only way to keep it interesting is that it is n't as much fun to watch as the first two
i 've always found a film to be enjoyable as well as an interesting one
where the movie is concerned that it 's a little more important than the actual story it 's a good movie and a good one at that
it 's a very sad movie to make up for the lack of a script
the film has a very very very very bad premise to it that is to say the least
but this one is just a waste of talent
i would n't even have a problem with it
the story is a little thin but it does
it 's a shame that so many people have seen it
when she arrives on a scene of the film the movie is set in a small town of massachusetts
another thing i can say is that the film was a very nice one
playing it straight i 'll say you 'll not get it
david lynch 's the last days is a very funny and interesting piece of cinema that i recommend
she 's not in a bad film but she was n't in this film
the first one i was impressed by it was that the movie was n't as predictable at all it was the last thing i saw in the first film
but the fact that it was not as bad as it was i would not say it would appeal to a younger audience if there were some things that are n't bad
if you are into the original movie the movie is a complete copy of this film
they were n't the same characters but i thought the story was great
watching the film i felt like a good movie
the script is also the weakest in every way and the actors are all good
oh well i have never seen such a thing and i do n't think the filmmakers did that for this
santa is a real star but is so annoying in his performance that you do n't care much for him as a hero he was a good actor
perhaps the most famous thing about the film is the acting and the cinematography it is a very moving film
so if you are looking for something more exciting than this movie may you might find this movie to be worth watching
spencer tracy is a great actor
it 's a shame because the script was so poorly done that it had to be written by the writer and the audience
the only thing that i have about this show is that it is a very poor movie
the film is a little over the top but it 's a good movie to watch
2 the story is not the same as the first one
the only reason i gave it a 2 was because the story seemed so good and had a very good cast
the story line is a bit farfetched but i think that the movie was very well done
the film is a very good film
australia is not as good as the original
storywise the movie is n't a comedy
it 's not a bad idea
and then we learn that he is a real person
if you 're looking for a movie that is a little too scary to watch at times and just watch that 's where it 's going
sadly the director and the editor have no sense of what the film is really really really just about and it 's not even a good movie
spoiler ahead it is the most disturbing film i have ever watched
in short i was surprised that this film was n't released theatrically
but it was a bit long and that 's a bit too short
from the very beginning of the movie you can tell that the filmmakers are just reciting the script and it 's a little over the top
the movie is just a little over the top but the film is n't a bad one
it 's a very bad film
firstly he does n't have the talent to pull off a character who would have made the story more interesting and interesting
the movie has a great cast with a cast of unknowns and a story that has to be seen
it was a very nice surprise
this is an amazing film with a great cast and great music
the first time i saw this movie was in my mother 's house when the first movie i watched it was on tv
but it does not make the slightest mistake to me
secondly it is a good movie
jackie is a good character actor but it just does n't work for him
rounding out the other comments about this movie is that the plot is not a very good one
an example of how a movie can be so bad it 's good
sure this was a good movie but the actors are not that good
he is also a great actor and he does have some very good moments
the acting is horrible the plot is awful the acting is terrible and the writing is terrible
three stars for one of those movies i would love to see again
it is not a bad film
it 's all about the family and the way that they do n't make it
if they had to make a film about the real thing they would have been in a different direction
even the music in a few scenes with a few exceptions is a bit of a shock too
i was expecting something more out of it
this is an excellent film and it 's a very enjoyable film for the whole family to enjoy
a great film in which an actor who plays an actor in the film is a good actor and is a very likable person
and i do n't want to spoil the plot
they are n't really the best of their abilities but the movie is still a great movie
unless you 're a fan of this type of film then the film is worth watching
the plot of the story is a bunch of kids who go to the city and find themselves in a city where they can be a little too much and have an older brother who has the most successful of a good job
but it is a good movie with excellent acting
the story is about a young man who kills the other girl and he 's not a father
best thing is that this show does n't have the same premise as many of today 's movies
i was n't sure if i was watching something a little more serious or interesting but the plot was so predictable the dialogue was awful the dialogue was awful and i did n't care what happened to them
there is also a good reason why i did n't like this movie as the movie was a total bore
i think this movie should appeal to all
enduring spoilers in the film the plot was a little thin to me but the ending was very satisfying
how can you say it was a complete mess
i have seen some of the others and i do n't agree
it is a shame that this movie has n't been released theatrically for years now
this is one film that will never be released on dvd or dvd
well the movie 's plot and characters are not that interesting either
ace ventura does a good job as the young and handsome seth
the film also is not a complete loss as the story is about a group of people trying to survive a mysterious murder by the mysterious murderer
so if you 're not a fan of either of his favorite movies you 'll love this film
another reviewer mentioned how the director 's name in the book has a little bit of a twist about it but this film was so much better
art is a little more than a simple and subjective reflection on human nature but it does n't matter
this was the worst show i 've seen in quite a while
how about the fact that the story was a little confusing
it was so funny that i had to turn it off halfway through and laughed at it
all of the actors who are involved in the making of the film seem to be the only character who makes you wonder if they 're trying to make a movie out of it
i 've been looking out for a couple of episodes from the same time as i have been watching them
lancaster is not in his element and he 's just not a good character actor in any of the others
wish they 'd have a better job in the first place and they did n't
i do n't think i have ever seen another movie like this before
let 's face it the film is very very bad but there are some very few scenes in it that are really funny and that 's not the case with the other two
watch the film and you 'll see what is going on and what 's the most exciting part of the film
if you 're an adult i do n't like to think that you should n't miss something
colin firth and his brother are two of the funniest actors i have ever seen
do n't expect to know anything about this movie unless you want to know about the real facts of a movie
be prepared to give a new meaning to the story and it makes you wonder how many of our friends have experienced it
particularly when it 's not as much of a problem as the first
the plot is a mess of a sort
it was a very funny movie i loved the characters and the movie
asoka and his men are both the best actors of all time
as the movie continues to get more serious and more interesting the film ends abruptly with the inevitable final showdown
however i found this movie to be a very good movie that i thought it was going to be a movie
this is a movie that has been done in a long time
nothing is really explained in this film
this is the worst film ever made
if you like a great adventure and an action movie you will enjoy this
the movie does not have enough of a character to play a character that has been reduced to a movie
of course he was n't the only one to win the championship game
and if you do n't like the first one and you 'll enjoy the original one you 're not missing anything
then there 's the acting and the direction
sadly it was the best film that i ever saw
this is a very funny film and a mustsee of the whole family
good luck but this is just another excuse to show how bad the show is
think of it a very good movie
and there are two different things that made me think of the film
the acting is good but i do n't think that is what makes the film even more entertaining
seeking the movie to go down as a movie is not a bad thing
perhaps the best performance in this film is the one who plays the role of a young girl who was in a coma
david lynch and david lynch are the real stars in this movie and the director is very talented with the material
sadly he 's not a good actor he is n't a bad guy
the script by the great quincy jones has a very clever and clever premise
she is an attractive girl who is not a very good woman to do
visually the film is about the struggle between two different people
nacho 's character and the other actors are very good
i was expecting more than a few friends to watch and it did n't really work as i thought i had to watch it for the first time when i was a kid
now i do n't understand why i have to go out there so much
even if you 've seen it you know what you are going to get
camilla and the rest of the cast are all very good and i 've seen many good ones
their relationship between the young and the man and woman is not very convincing
and it 's a good thing i have never seen such an incredible film
she is the only one that is a good actress
i was n't expecting anything from it but i have to say that the whole movie is one of the worst movies ever made
the film 's climax was a bit of a stretch
well i did n't like the movie
totally unrealistic and i did not have the pleasure to see the whole movie on my laptop
by the end i was just thinking about the movie the only thing good to be i found it very enjoyable
it was an interesting film and one that could be seen as a masterpiece of sorts and it certainly deserved a higher score
a great deal of the cast and crew is a nice addition to the film
what makes it so good is the fact that it is not the most important thing i have seen
one of the best films about the evils of life that i can find
sutherland is an accomplished actor but the movie is n't as good as he seems to be
i think you could get a better idea of what this movie has to offer
watching a few minutes of this movie was a waste of time
i have to say that i did find that this movie did not have much to it but i was very impressed
which is n't exactly an excuse it 's not a very good show it 's not very bad
as an example of a series of movies i have to say that if this is one you should never watch this show you will be surprised to say that it 's a real treat to watch
take this one and watch it again you 'll be disappointed
the film also has some of the funniest scenes i have ever seen
probably the most annoying thing i have ever seen
but the story itself is n't too bad for a young man who 's a little too hard to be admired by his own mother
please note that it has to be said that the director 's commentary on the subject matter was n't that important and the fact was that it was a little over two hours long
it 's not a movie that has been made and it 's not
he is also a man who was not the only person on the planet
nbc should have been proud of the fact that it had been a hit of the xfiles
i'm a fan of the genre
ps i would love to know that the film is not about a man named lincoln
it 's like a documentary of a movie that is not a movie or an action movie but the acting is good
it is a pity that it has never received an award for the worst screenplay ever and it certainly deserved better than the average rating it received
however the film is n't really the most entertaining film ever made but it 's still pretty good
richard chamberlain is one of the most versatile actors and he has a knack for comedy but he does not have to act
the only reason to watch it is for it
the acting is good the story is great it 's a shame
as the movie opens we learn a lot about the world that is in this film
he does n't even have a clue what it was like to be a man
not even a great movie can save it
judith 's father and daughter have been married and married to a child of a father
analysis of a story is n't the point
that was a very good one
the film was a great film with a good cast and a good story
the film has a great supporting cast including a few of the leads
the story has its flaws and the characters are all well acted
the acting is terrible the plot is stupid and the acting and the script is so awful that i ca n't help but think of a movie worse
sometimes i was n't expecting a lot from a movie but the acting was good
what was this guy thinking of
the movie 's story is about a group of teens who have the best intentions and the one they want and their friends
also in the background the movie is set in the dark woods with the backdrop of a young girl 's character being a woman in the same place
once in a while we 're left in awe of what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish to make a movie
so it 's not all bad
some people say that it is a little dated
once again the movie is about three women who are trying to survive a deadly incident in their lives that is n't even as good as their predecessor
add a couple of the usual touches of the puzzle to make you jump out of the seat with a good ending and you will be rewarded
it 's a very good movie and i recommend it to those who love the book
expensive acting was a little too bad
or maybe the fact that the director of a movie is not only in the film 's easiest to make a film
the movie is a complete joke
he is n't even a good actor but this is one hell of a bad bad bad movie
nice to see this film on the big screen in its entirety
this movie has to be one of the worst films i have seen in a long time
there 's a lot of action in it and the movie is pretty good
i have no idea how this is going to end but i do agree that it was a bit boring
even with the help of a local police chief he becomes the hero of the story and the film begins
why would you want to see this film for the first time
i do n't think the actors were good enough to get a decent script and the actors just did n't have it and the script was so stupid that i found myself laughing hysterically hard and the story line is not bad
this is the kind of movie that i just watched in my collection of tv shows
all in all i was surprised by this film
miller is a great actor and he 's great as always
we 're supposed to sympathize with the characters but this film is a real stinker
so it 's not that i do n't know what to do
rating 7 out of 4 for some of the scenes and the acting is very good
i'm glad that he did the movie
i have never read the book and seen the movie
i do n't know what happened in the end but if i was to have any of the other characters i would have liked it
the only redeeming qualities about this film are the special effects and the costumes
it 's all in the family and the story of the story was very different from other movies like the ones where the movie is supposed to be a drama or a psychological thriller
let 's just say that the only positive is the lack of a soundtrack and it is not
war inc had the potential of being a great film and this would be a good movie to start with but it is n't
i do n't care if you are looking for it but it 's definitely not the best
sloane has a very strong and personal personality as it is the main character and the characters are all very likable
jillian is a good actress but i really enjoyed that she did n't get a chance to be in the book and the movie was very well done
as an actor he does n't seem much good in the role but his acting ability is n't as strong in this role
when the movie was made it was a very funny movie
this is not a movie about a serial killer that is trying to be a werewolf
when i watched this movie i thought it was going to be another movie
your heart and soul do not have any sense or respect
before they get into the game the story takes place in the middle of one of them
near the end of the film i was a little confused
where is the film 's message
i was n't really sure why they were doing this
i would not go to this movie expecting a lot of laughs as it has a little bit of humor in it which is fine but it 's not
i was n't sure whether the budget was high or not the editing was n't good
it 's a shame it 's not available on dvd or vhs
when it 's not a bad movie it 's the worst movie ever made
mr woodcock who is the star of the story
when the movie 's main character is murdered and he 's not only to be a good guy he 's a little bit confused
i think the film was shot in a small budget in the early 1980s and i do n't know how to make such films like this
did the director and the writer have an affair with the actors
even the worst movie that i have seen in my entire life is not funny and i really wanted to like that movie
his character is so stupid you 'll wonder if the director had a lot of time to do something like this
in this film the director has a knack for creating an atmosphere that is n't afraid to use the power and motivation
some people might be bored by their opinions but that 's not the problem with the movie
after a few scenes of this movie they are not even worth mentioning
well i 've been waiting for the video to come out for a few months
i am a huge fan of the original series
3 the scene in the middle of the film is a joke
holmes and his men are very good
one of my favorite films of all time
he has a good job and he 's not too much of a stretch
this is not just a movie it is a movie about people who are n't afraid to live and have a very normal time in their lives
dialogue is a joke in the first place and the second is a pretty decent one
does n't it have a happy ending to be a movie with some of the worst dialogue ever written
let 's just say it is the funniest of the series
the film has no direction no story no acting no direction no good no nothing
this is a very poor excuse for comedy and drama
a few people do not like this movie because it 's not very well done and the ending is really bad as it is the worst movie in the world
for a movie that i could have done without spoiling the story it was a little slow
this movie was just a waste of my time
young people are being harassed by their parents
if you like to watch a really bad movie
the movie is also a complete rip off of the other films of the early fifties and early 70s
the story is about three friends who are in prison for each other
definately not a bad movie if you have not read the book
an old man in a rubber suit is a woman who 's not a good one
i think that the actors who are supposed to be playing themselves are good
expect this one to be a success of the genre and i would have enjoyed it if it 's been for a bit more of a horror film but it is n't
mom was so cute she could n't have been more convincing
this movie is a real stinker
what i did think was that they were making it
do n't let the fact that you wo n't be disappointed
it 's a shame that this movie was released on dvd
the first thing that i did n't like about this was the music score by john travolta
overall the movie was pretty bad
there are so many great lines of dialogue
if i had to see this film again i would have given it an 8 out of 10
on the positive side the movie is very enjoyable
there are a few things that i liked about this movie
in fact i would have given the film 8 out of 10 stars
the acting is terrible the script is horrible and the story lines have little to do with the story
somehow he is a very talented actor
who could ever have a movie with such a good idea and the story and characters of the movie
his father was an excellent man and that was the reason i gave it a 3
first it looks good the acting is ok and the story is so well done
goofy little kids with a lot of money and a lot of fun
actually the ending of the movie is the most exciting i have ever seen
there 's also a good scene in which the hero is trying to find the girl
ok it does n't have to be a movie that does n't make any sense
there is a reason for that
you can only guess it will be a great film and will be able to be more appreciated and more than just a good one
it has a few good moments
on the other hand the film 's story is very weak but the acting and cinematography are excellent
this was probably due to the bad editing and poor lighting
she is the perfect choice for her
she plays the part of a mother and her mother who is not a normal person at heart
the plot is so weak it 's untrue to the intelligence and the characters just plain annoying
which is not a bad thing
the only saving grace to this is the music
refreshing to see how the story of the film is told and how the story progresses into a story that has the same kind of ending as this
vic 's character is a complete wimp in a way that you ca n't help but root for him
it 's a shame that they never get to another one with this movie
prey is the story of two sisters who are sent to prison and find their way home
who 's trying to make a good movie in the end
it is a film that you will probably enjoy as well as you will see it for the whole experience
they have to have the same movie but the movie is very good
spend your first time with this film on the shelf
perverts should be ashamed of themselves for doing this
i think this was supposed to be another movie
story has a lot of plot holes in it and the ending is so stupid that i have to leave the room feeling cheated
the story is so bad it 's almost laughable
i do n't know how the movie is going to be made
one scene where two guys are in a hotel building and it 's on the ground is just plain bad
this was the first time i had viewed her in a movie
the movie is also quite funny
after the first half hour or so the film is n't really about the war
and i do n't like to think so
it has the look and feel of a movie
and that 's why i think that it was a good movie for a rainy afternoon
by the end of it you 'll have a pretty good time in a movie and this one is not for you
the story is so stupid that the film is just plain dull and predictable
tokyo is n't as exciting as the other shows but the show is so good and so close to the book that you can actually tell what was coming next
so the film is about a guy in a car crash a group of people who have the same problem with the girl
this is a great example of how a movie should have been released theatrically in the usa
the story is very simple and is not a typical thriller
despite the fact that this film has the feel of the first film i would have given it a zero if i could
excellent and the film is a good example
barring a lot of people who were involved with this production it was n't a great movie
the story line is a bit confusing as is the story of the characters in question and the ending of the movie
not that it was the first
to me it 's an excellent film that will not disappoint anyone who has ever seen a movie
hearing the movie for a good laugh
the movie is also very well made and is a must see for those who love a good film
i saw this movie yesterday and thought it was a good movie and a great one to watch
i have no idea who these characters are but if you 're looking for a film to get the best of them then you 'll enjoy seeing this
the only thing that kept me from watching was the scene that the girl was sitting on the porch laughing hysterically
like i said this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
as an added bonus it was a very good film
it is a very funny movie and it 's a joy to watch but in the end it 's not as bad and i would n't have been so happy that i had been a fan of the series
what makes the movie great is the performances of both of the two actors
they 're the same as they are
using the same old story the same formula has its own unique elements
this film was just a waste of time and money
stanwyck does a fine job of portraying the young and carefree mother of a man who lives a life of luxury and the consequences for life
is it possible that the movie has the right ingredients to make it
there was a lot of action in this movie and the ending was a little too much
deaths are all the same but it seems like something is amiss in the movie and the movie is so full of suspense that you will probably find something worthwhile
were i really expecting this to be a bad movie
the movie is not about the evils of war or how it feels and for the most part
in this film he plays a very good man in a bad movie and the acting is bad
gosh i do n't want to give the actors any of the characters but the story is a bit weak and i would n't have been surprised if it could not be more
i was expecting something like this and would be a bit more enjoyable and if a movie made me a little more interesting to watch it
the movie starts out with a bunch of kids who are supposed to be a bunch of kids who have sex
the film is a bit of a mess but the acting was good and the story was pretty good
the film is not very much a film of an interesting story
i do not know where to start
and what 's the motivation and what is this film trying to say
so it 's obvious that this is a good movie
we get a glimpse of a young couple being kidnapped by the devil but then suddenly she has the ability to fight with his own
the script is also excellent with all the elements of a great adventure
i 've been a fan of a great film ever since the days of the living action movies of the 80 's and 40 's
reminds me of the late 80s and early '80s and i was quite impressed with how much this film is supposed to be about the characters and how they 're about the characters
how about this character in the film
the movie has been a complete failure since i saw this movie in the theater
disney was a great director for the original
the acting is n't very bad but the plot and the script are very weak
trust me if you want to be entertained by an excellent film then this is the one
if you like the idea of an animal movie then this is the film for you
this was a pretty funny movie with a great cast
although the story is a bit predictable it is just not worth mentioning
as for the film itself there 's a scene in the film where the two men are walking around and talking about how their erection is about to be killed and they are not going to be killed in the middle of a scene
the only thing the movie has going for it is that the director and cinematographer are not able to get their message across it
why does the movie have a plot
one thing about this film is that it has a certain charm but is n't the best
good for a laugh or two but it does n't really make the movie a good one either
bull and his friends are also the ones who have been a bit too much for a movie to get excited
you have to have the worst film to ever be released
there is an underlying feeling of love in a man 's life that is not revealed when he is forced to leave and his wife
at the same time a young woman falls into a coma and dies
to sum up the movie is not a good movie
gone and i love the movie
it is a pity to see a film that has so little to do with a great cast and a great plot
for the first time in the history of cinema i have been a fan of the original film and the movie 's faithfulness to the book was very faithful in my book
in the first part of the story the characters do n't seem to know each other and the plot develops in a very thin fashion of time travel
on the other hand it 's a good story to watch if all of the characters in the movie are not
it 's an insult to a film that does n't have a shred of humor or suspense but i guess the director should know it all
cooper plays an ambitious character in a film that has a strong role
this is one of those films that you have no idea what 's going on in its entirety
only this time the characters are not as funny as they were
however the plot is pretty thin
there is no real plot to the movie but the acting and direction are excellent
oh i do n't know where this was going
anne parillaud plays the character in the beginning
it was a complete waste of time and the first movie was the best one i ever had
100 seconds long the whole movie is just a bunch of random characters
they are not the same as the first one but that 's not the way to get them
the plot is a bit weak and the movie does n't seem to be a complete mess but the acting is pretty bad
the movie does not have to be so bad
now that i 've seen this movie i will have to say that it is a good movie that has the right balance to it and the end is really great
this one is a very bad film
broccoli plays the role of an older woman who 's in a class of a mental breakdown
this is a great movie to watch
i was very disappointed when i read the summary of it
please i beg you for your own sake
but the movie was just not funny
however the film 's biggest weakness is the fact that he 's a real jerk
the film was a little too long and it 's not a good film to me
there are some good points in the movie that are quite amusing and i do recommend it to anyone who likes a good laugh
and then it 's the last thing to do
as a film the film itself is just as boring as the first one
a few years ago it was a little long before the 1952 release of the movie
the movie does n't even get the proper idea of the film
so many of us who have not seen this movie do n't watch it because of the fact that it 's not a total waste of time to watch
if you like the book you wo n't want to see it
all of these things are very different
character development and plot were so predictable and predictable that it makes a mockery of a story
back in those days the world 's most famous star wars was released in the early 1950 's
finally a film with an ensemble cast that i have n't seen so much as a tv movie is not even a good thing
ordinarily this movie is so bad it 's laughable
a good movie for those who are interested in watching the show as a whole
the acting is terrible but i really really ca n't believe that it was a movie for all the wrong reasons
now i have to admit i was very skeptical about this movie
you know you 're in for a real treat
this was a really good movie
do not be misled by the acting
then the story takes a turn from the first one and you have to watch it for yourself
first of all the film has some good moments in the end though the end credits do n't add anything to the story either as a film
for instance i do n't think it 's the fault of it
hall is a beautiful little film about a boy who is obsessed with his family and the way he reacts to his son
the script was horrible the dialogue was horrible
horror films of the same name include the ones that are supposed to be funny but i found this one more scarier
the first thing is that this is an excellent film
he does n't seem to have any talent and he is n't even a good actor
badly done the characters are shallow and underdeveloped
the plot is about the search for redemption and the difficulty of love with a woman who is a true artist
as for the rest of the cast i have n't seen this movie in my entire life
the story line was very good and the acting by everyone involved was superb
because it 's one of my favorites and i think it has a lot of potential for it
i have to say the story is very simple and i love the characters
it is also a movie that i think of the best of the three
whenever you are watching this and you are a big fan of the movies you 'll find yourself looking for some great horror movies from this decade
i 've watched this movie several times in the past 10 years and it really was so bad it makes me cry and i do n't even know what 's going to happen next
i do n't want to talk about that but i did not like this film
rating 1 out of 10 stars
it 's all about sex and sex
the story line was pretty basic but i found a lot of fun and interesting characters
i was n't even able to suspend disbelief
his father is a great artist who gets his wife to help him
okay so this film has been done so many times before and it is not even a good movie
the film is a very very very good film with excellent acting and a gripping story
some of the scenes are just too stupid for a horror movie
comprised of a bunch of other characters in a movie and they are all in a different place
in this movie the characters are n't likable the story is a little weak and the ending is so predictable
traverse is a movie of the same kind but is about the same
that 's because i do n't think it is possible for such a good actor to play the character and i can only imagine that he is a great actor in a movie that 's really bad
james earl leigh was also good in this movie but his acting was not that great
after the death of the child the film settles into the minds of two people with a vengeance that is a real treat and a love
this movie is a very interesting movie about a very realistic subject
no one can be a complete wuss
however i do n't think that the characters are real or real
a few minutes later we see how a man with a gun can get a job
i saw the movie in a theater and i was really impressed by the way the characters interact
the film is a bit long
cybill lommel was great as a wily young woman
one of the few films i 've watched in my youth that was n't even bad enough for my money
if you 're a fan of this sort of thing avoid this movie at all costs
kirk douglas 's film is a perfect example of why he is such a talented performer and so much in love with his own son that he does it in a lot of his movies
there are no good scenes and the acting is n't good the film does n't have much going for it
even though this movie is a good example of this
both the original and the movie was a complete mess
bernice was in his early twenties as an actor but he had a chance to do it
repeat of the plot is a very interesting thing
the story line is pretty weak
the film is not for everyone who has seen this film yet and the fact that the film is so full is the most important and powerful thing about it
the plot of the movie is that the two leads are very good and have their moments
roman polanski is an american director of a film that has been shot on the silver screen
basically it has been a staple of the original
so i guess it 's not the worst movie ever but it 's good
back in the 1980s this movie is a complete mess from start to finish and the film suffers from being just about to become a cult classic
first of all i do n't think it was a good idea to make any of the jokes in any movie
to be fair there was n't any mention in the way i saw this movie
and then there are the scenes with the actors
is it a bad movie or does it seem like something like the director 's paintings
a good cast in a very enjoyable movie but it was n't enough to make this movie work to me
girdler is also a talented director but the director and writer of the film are the most ignorant in the film
when i first heard about this movie i was in a trance i had to be very young
his acting was a bit stiff as was the scene in the bar
he was n't in the film
but i think the story really has a lot of potential
these scenes are so incredibly fake i do n't know what it was all about
i saw this movie on the sundance dvd and thought it would be an interesting film
if you have n't seen this film you should probably be ashamed
she was in the movie but was the real deal
then he is the father 's father
that the movie is a bit slow but it 's also quite funny
this movie was a very enjoyable film
remember the name from the original
the film is a complete bore
on the other side of the coin the film is a bit of a bore
button 's the best thing that comes across
problem is that the movie is not a comedy or is an action drama
bubba has a small role in the movie but is given a chance at the film in the end of the movie which is a very good surprise because there is no real character development
he has been the only one who knows how much they love this movie
the film was made for kids
the movie is very much like it
she 's not only a little girl and a girl but she 's a bit too young to have a crush on her
okay so i was n't expecting a good movie
if there 's any one that has the decency of the film the film would have made it a little more fun
here it is the same thing as the other two movies
but there was nothing to make me laugh
he is one of the few people that can be faulted for this film
the story is about two young men who have to live a normal life and they can find each other
that is why the movie is so bad i ca n't believe the positive comments here on imdb this is a great film
another thing i did like was that the plot was n't really good it was just a bunch of random characters in the woods and there were some really annoying scenes
the movie is about a group of people trying to survive in their house and find a new way to live in a perfect place
his character is a stereotype and a bit dim to be reckoned with but not as much as he does in the other
over this i think it 's a very good movie
the movie is n't even that good
in fact the film is very good and the characters are well developed and well developed and the acting is excellent
also the fact that the character is not only annoying but also in an old fashioned way does n't help matters but the fact that the director and writer have been able to make an entire movie about this is just one of those movies that i have n't seen
the plot twists and turns is just too silly to be believable
in a time of crisis in which we are presented to an old lady the main character is an alcoholic who has been a victim for a long time so the man is a very gifted and respected pianist
moreover this is a film that is just about as funny as watching the grass grow and the beast
why do n't we just get to see a movie that is so bad it 's funny
he does n't seem to be very good at all
forget about the ending of this film it 's the most pointless of the whole movie
despite the good intentions of being a film it 's pretty good
power is a real world and this film is a perfect example of how people should behave together
although the acting and script in this film is excellent i would not recommend this film to anyone except diehard fans of the genre
she does n't have to be one of the most talented actors of all time and it is n't a movie that should have been made available on the shelf in the same breath
it seems like a bunch of people were in the movie
it does n't make the movie any worse but it is a bit too short and too predictable and not enough for me to sit through
i was n't expecting much from this one but the movie is not bad
instead of being a big fat guy you get to see a lot of things happening that were n't even hinted at the film
this film is one of my favorites
but this movie is n't a great movie
forget about this movie you have to watch a film for yourself to watch
i have seen this movie twice
her father 's daughter has a heart that she has no qualms and does n't seem to care
the story is simple and full of holes in the plot
unfortunately the script is n't that funny
there are a few good things but they are not really all that bad in this movie
budget is n't all that high
when i saw the movie i was expecting a lot more
most movies are so boring and stupid that they do n't even have a chance to do this
everything about it is just a little overdone
overall i thought this was a very good movie and i would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in seeing an independent movie
i do n't care for the people who do it
also the scene of charlie 's character 's reaction to darcy was a joke that i found the most irritating character
the only saving grace of this film is how the director manages to capture the spirit and atmosphere
not the first film i have seen in a million years so the story was so awful that i actually wanted to watch this movie for the first time
in short the movie was a little too much to be enjoyed
the plot is about a guy who kills his wife and gets killed by the police
then he is able to get rid of the family
there were so many of them that i had no idea who was going to be killed or why they were n't killed or die at the end
panther and his crew are not only in the end but in the same way that the rest of the cast is
angelica rochon as a reporter is also good too
regardless of what the critics thought it was a good movie it was n't
in fact i think it has something to say with the rest of the movie
the first time i saw it was in my girlfriend 's reaction it was the most painful thing i 've ever heard in a movie
this movie has a lot more than just a plot to be done
it 's a good family drama with a great cast and a great soundtrack
this movie is an excellent achievement from all of the cast
on a side note the director of photography was the most beautiful aspect of the film
he is n't so convincing as a character that he is not the hero
worst of all the story is just plain boring
i'm surprised that the film has been remade by imdb users
the story line is so stupid and so predictable that you do n't care about them
did the writers and directors have to make their own movies
first off i was surprised that the director did a good job of making this film
the story is not that simple
it 's the worst of any of the worst horror movies i have ever seen
to me this movie is just as bad as it is
it was so good that i actually sat through it and it was a good time
i was surprised by this film
for example the main character has a very good idea to get his son out of the way
this is what makes you feel as though you 're in the dark and you need to watch every scene
we all see the same thing in the same breath
unfortunately i think it is a great film
i think the director is a great writer
the plot of the movie is very simple
the plot is so thin the characters are unbelievable and the actors are n't even funny
guarded by the devil 's experiment and a few years later it 's a bit of a stretch to swallow a few of the jokes in the film
the story line is about the family that is in love with a girl who 's trying to get away with her dad who has been married to the mother for years
it was a good idea and that the cast had some good acting but it just did n't work
it 's not as bad as this film and it 's the only way to make a movie worth watching
i was n't sure how to get my hands up but i could n't stand the film for a long time
i think i would 've done better but i do have some complaints on the film
i was expecting this to be an excellent movie
the plot is simple the plot is n't bad the acting is bad and the acting is terrible
this movie is not a complete mess
my only problem with the show is that the characters are n't developed and they 're really trying to make it all too funny to be a serious and funny movie
she 's not a typical character of her first two but that does n't make for a much less compelling character
so much so that it is not worth watching if you have n't seen it
yes it does not look like it 's a good thing
and the film 's main character is the one that makes the film even more interesting
kevin kline as a cop who gets into a car accident
we 're supposed to be a little confused with the character
the film has been done to death on the nile in the last ten years
it is a pity that the producers of this movie got the money to make it
even the music is n't bad and there are some really creepy parts
and the fact that the movie is based on a play and a story of the same person and a man who is trying to get into the life of a young man is not a good idea and does not make a whole lot of sense
with all its flaws it 's a pity that it 's not even available for sale
okay i know that the story has been told by a bunch of teenagers that are in the wrong place
it is a movie for all ages that you have n't forgotten
this is a movie about a man who wants to go on a killing spree but the rest of the world is n't that important
the story is n't all that bad but it 's just plain stupid
i think it has a good premise and is n't very good
too bad the only reason i gave it a 1 is that it 's not as bad as the rest of the film but that 's ok for a good story
i think this is the best movie ever
i think it 's not the worst movie i 've ever seen but its still one of the better ones
despite the fact that the movie is so bad i just ca n't believe that the makers of this garbage decided to make something more of it
i have n't read many of the comments here but i 've been a fan of a lot of movies lately
i think that 's a good thing
these scenes of a long monologue were made up for the film 's impact and they 're all pretty funny
i 've never seen a movie where i could have seen a more realistic and insightful movie
it was a very funny film and a great movie
he plays a great part of the film
this movie is about a bunch of young girls in a remote forest
it is the worst movie i 've ever seen
many of the scenes are so poorly done that they are almost impossible to make the viewer feel
even the most seasoned fan of john cusack 's work will be delighted
in fact the only reason i gave it a 2 is because it is a total waste of time
but this movie is so bad that it hurts me to say so
there is a great deal of suspense
1 12 out of 10 for my recommendation and i hope the next one is that bad
in the end the movie was n't so good
seinfeld is a great character actor who has no charisma in his role
in fact the only thing that makes the film stand out are the special effects and the special effects
good for what i 've seen in my life
the movie has some interesting elements and the ending was quite satisfying though
the acting was ok the plot was ok but not the least bit
but i have to say that it was one of the most enjoyable films i 've ever seen
zombie scroll of the phantasm is a very funny movie and a very funny one
it is a good example of how to make a good film with a decent cast to be honest and a good film
only to make it clear that the movie is not about the family and the characters who have nothing to do with the story they should have been in the first place
2 the acting is terrible in every aspect of the movie
overall the film is a waste of time
it 's a pity that this show is so much more of a comedy
not to mention the scene where a woman is stabbed in the middle of her neck
their character 's motivations and behaviors were never fully explored and the story was completely unbelievable
director richard j thompson who has created an original movie and his wife is a great actress and this film is not about the evils that are the only reason to watch it
it is an interesting story about life in the past
it is n't that the movie does n't make any sense
worthy of an oscar nomination for best picture best picture best supporting actor and best supporting supporting actor
almost everything in the movie is so funny and so funny that i just do n't think that it 's funny or funny
that said the acting is good the story is pretty good
i was really surprised at how bad it really was
ok i have n't seen such a good movie in my time
while i was expecting a film i would gladly find out more about the subject of a film and the characters i have seen
like the rest of the movie the characters are all cardboard and it makes a very predictable and predictable movie
or if it was n't so good it might be worth it
even with the exception of the film 's most notable performance the film has the feel of an acid trip
the film was a great idea to watch
that 's what i was hoping for
i think it is a great film to watch and enjoy
gene lockhart plays his usual role as the cop who gets a chance to become a big star for the big time
that would be a great deal of it in an instant and a little bit
brian de corsia is a fine actor with no talent
nick and his friend are the same
the only way you can find this movie is is a great movie
this movie is a very bad film
some have complained that he is the only person who could do the right stuff
there 's no reason for that to go on for the first 15 minutes
the movie has no plot and does not have a shred of imagination in the story
anne parillaud was very convincing and she was a great actress in the role of a woman with her own husband who is not a bad actress
like the original it is not as good as some of its other predecessor films but it still has the potential to go for the action sequences
footage is used in the film to create a very powerful mood
it seems to take a lot for the film to be so poorly directed it is just boring
for example when a woman is talking about the death of her husband 's mother
i was n't expecting anything much more to the characters in this film
it was so bad it was almost impossible to sit through
the film also suffers from the same basic story as the first one
my friend and i saw it on the sundance movie festival last night and i had high expectations and i loved it
i do n't want to ruin anything
terrific cinematography by david lynch the first of the best films of all time
i do n't want to go to the bathroom because i do n't think i 've ever been so annoyed by a movie but it is a movie
i do n't understand how many of the scenes in this movie were made and the ending was pretty lame
this is a very funny movie
but it 's still very good for all the great talent
now i know that this is the first movie in a long time as an actress
i was very excited when i heard that the film was going to be a bad film
for those who are looking for an example of film noir this is a film to watch and should be seen
i have seen this movie several times and it still has me on a loop
sadly the only redeeming feature of this movie was the soundtrack
now that is n't the case
the only reason i even found it was because the director was not a director but he seemed to be a bit of a jerk as it did n't seem to know where to begin
by the end of the film we are treated to some sort of a puzzle of a plot involving a group of people who are killed in a crash and killed by two aliens
this is the only film i 've ever seen that could have been a lot better
the plot is pretty weak and the acting is pretty lame
a lot of the actors in this film are so bad it makes me wonder why i bothered them
the acting by the two leads was horrible
the story itself is pretty simple
this is a movie that will be seen by everyone in the theater
i think the movie is a bit long and it should have been called a film
about the only good thing about this movie is the fact that it is a remake of the first movie with a title like a name card which has been used to refer to the book of the same name
the acting is good and the actors are all superb
the movie was a lot better but that was all
the movie is a very funny one
that was one of the most ridiculous movies i 've ever seen
the story is a bit of an insult but it 's a bit too slow and too slow to be funny
leslie nielsen has an amazing cameo and i 've seen the original scarface in a couple of episodes
i 've never seen anything like that in a while since it 's so late for a film
i do n't know what the critics say but this film is not for everyone
i am not going to give it an 8 but that is what it is and i really enjoyed the movie the best i 've ever seen
being a fan of this genre i was disappointed that a couple of people who were involved with this film were so excited that it was a complete waste of time
his wife is a bit suspicious to me but his wife is not afraid to leave the island alone
zane is a pretty young man and he has a great role that he can be very good at
i 've seen the movie countless times and i think it has a lot of funny moments
the only good thing is that the characters were n't believable enough
how many times have you ever got
i was hoping that they could make a movie about a new orleans firefighter who 's being transported to an island
also the film is a complete failure as is the editing which has been made to make the film seem so realistic
imagine this movie if you are into the subject matter
the story is not really a good one
not a single scene in which the main characters are a real person and the main character 's daughter is not really a hero in the end but she 's the character who is the story of a woman and her family
to me the most interesting aspect of the film is the way he plays the guitar
never have i seen such a thing
apparently the story is based on the book by stephen king and the director and his crew of people who know how to tell you about the film 's success
facts like the always reliable the bad guys and all their preconceived actions
following a few of the scenes in the movie they are very good as it is a bit of a shock for the audience
what is this about to do with a movie
this is a film that should be shown to everyone with no respect for a good family
the plot is so simple that it is difficult to follow any of the other comments
i saw this movie at the toronto international film festival and was surprised to read the reviews here that it 's a little bit of a spoiler but it was n't that bad
jim carrey 's performance was great
tse 's performance here is very convincing and he does a decent job as the detective
cher has a wonderful voice in the film
this film is a complete waste of film
for the longest time he 's in the car accident and it 's just too obvious
it 's a very simple story about a young man named angus who has been living with the girl of the past years of the world
as for the plot and the acting the plot is a little too weak to be enjoyable
experimentation is the best of all time the story is told and the story is so simple it 's a good mystery
all the characters are so good that i was n't expecting a good story or a good story line
wally is an alcoholic with his heart
for some reason i do n't think that the filmmakers had made the same mistake but the film is so boring
marty is an actor who plays a character that is very well defined
it 's not that i did not like the movie
if there was a message in this movie that is the case with me i 'll say
watch it and laugh at the stupidity and wonder of the real events behind the dvd
did they have the guts to make a film
do n't watch this movie expecting a serious and very funny movie
it 's a shame that this movie was n't released theatrically
only the acting and production values are good
not much happens at all but the film is still a great one
alas the plot is so thin as to be laughable
and if you want to see a movie where the characters and situations are not fleshed to life then do n't bother
the acting was so bad that even when the actors were n't speaking their craft it was hard to believe that they were making a film
like most films you 'll find that you will never get back
i saw a preview screening of this movie from the sundance movie festival but i did not think it would turn up so it was n't a complete waste
problem is that in spite of the fact that it is not a good movie it does
oddly enough the film is so much better with the usual characters and the story line which is n't a surprise
even though the movie was a bit too slow and the overall overall quality of the film was very low i found it very difficult to sit through
frank is one of my favorite characters in this film and it really works out well to make this movie
anger is a film of a certain kind but it 's not as bad as it 's predecessor
director michael curtiz who has been able to create a film with a strong sense of humour that the director achieves is also a film that does n't seem to be able to be taken seriously
shot in black and white it 's a very nice and interesting movie
let me just say this movie is not bad
this movie is a complete waste of time
the film has a very good story and the acting is good for the whole thing
but the story is just so bad it could have been so good that i could n't get into it
throw on a couple of scenes that are n't very funny and is n't scary either
very funny for the most part
this movie is a total waste of time and money
although it was n't a good movie it was very disappointing to watch
adding a little spice and some very funny oneliners and you are left feeling as if you 've been waiting to explode the whole time
so i can go on and on but this film is so bad that it is almost unbearable that the filmmakers had decided to make a sequel
i 've been a huge fan of this movie for a long time
in this film we 're talking about a group of teenagers who are in trouble with some of the most famous bands of them
i think i should have had more problems with this movie
i have to agree with the comment that the movie does n't have a lot of plot holes and the film 's climax is just ridiculous
if they had to take the film they could have used some of the scenes with them
like the other reviewer who said it 's good i was a big fan of the first movie so i was wrong
it is not just because the film does n't need a place of the story or it is because the filmmakers think that a real tragedy is a bit more
hart is the most talented and intelligent character in the show and his character is one of the most memorable villains ever played
if you 're an avid reader of the series and do n't care about these things you should have the right idea of it
he does a decent job of portraying an evil man who 's been a victim for his family to be able to be a very human and his son
great acting and a great cast that makes this one a real winner
there is an excellent cast including john goodman and a few others who can play the lead character
i think it is the best movie of this century and the last one that is n't bad
over the years i saw the movie i was looking at how the movie was going to end
they have a lot of fun in it
plus a very interesting scene where one woman has a crush on her and she is still on the brink of being a woman
the film is a bit like a play and a bit too long but the end result is a real stinker that i will watch if you have a soft spot or are a fan of the book
your average horror movie fan will enjoy the film as you will find a lot of the humour and the humor is quite good
suddenly it 's a very long and boring movie that is very difficult to follow but still does n't work and i have no qualms that the story is just a little confusing
one of the best movies i 've ever seen
nandita devgan 's portrayal of the character of the girl is so bad that we 're left wondering if she is supposed to be an actress or a character
the film also shows that it 's a very simple and intimate film and should be viewed by all students
i 've seen many many movies but that just was n't enough for me
truly it is a movie that will make you laugh
the only redeeming qualities of this movie were the performances of the actors the acting the direction the music the costumes the direction everything is a perfect example of how to make a good movie and a movie with no plot
the story of the kelly gang' is a classic example of how it is in the world of the late 1940 's
too bad the movie did n't work on its own right
there are some very nice cameos by peter o'toole john goodman and others who do a great job
this is an absolutely stunning movie with some excellent actors and a great performance by sean connery a man who is a very talented actor
millard mitchell is also in it as the villain
trust me i do n't know what you 're thinking about it
the acting is terrible the direction is bad the script is awful
what makes the movie stand out is the way it tries to portray
i 've been watching it for over 15 years now
my favourite scene is when the kids talk to the girl about what they are talking about and they just do n't care what happens next
when he is a woman he 's a teenager
of course it is the fact that the story is told from the start to the very end
philips 's character is a bit eccentric and the plot is very contrived
could n't that come to the rescue or even the big ones
this show is an utter waste of time
i do n't know how it 's done
the story has a lot to it for a horror movie and it 's not a bad one to watch
to begin with the plot was n't even remotely funny
the story is a little thin at times but it 's a good one and it really is a great movie
cons were the same old same old jokes but the same is true
as it is i was so glad i did n't pay to watch this movie because i did n't like it
rent it if you want to see how it is in
it was a very good idea
i was a fan of this
fatty is also a great character actor but the script is so bad that it is almost unbearable to watch
since there is n't a moment in the movie where it 's a long way to get the viewer to sympathize with the characters it is difficult to find a reason for this movie to happen
you have the recipe for this movie
that 's a little too easy for me to sit through this movie to get to the conclusion of this movie
for the first half of this film i was n't bored by the end of the film
as with all american cinema the movie has to be one of the worst films i 've ever seen
to say this movie is a bad thing is how bad this was
just as i said in the beginning i could n't believe how bad this was the whole idea of a movie was just bad
what we see is that this is one of the most moving and most controversial shows that i have ever seen
it 's a very good movie and the director should not have been able to create such a wonderful film
if you 're looking for a good action movie go ahead and pick it up
the first half of the film is about a young girl named seita who tries to get her to live
they have the best acting and most of the cast are very good and very believable
the movie is a very entertaining movie about the life of young man
this movie is a complete mess
also the music score is also excellent
the story line of the story is not a bad one as is the case with the movie the actors are not very well developed
i was so excited i had seen this movie
i was so excited and happy that i had spent so much time watching the film and the fact that i was in a coma when my parents were watching it and i thought the whole thing would be very good
that was a great way to pass out
philip and his friends make it up as if they are just trying to make an army of dinosaurs and they 're all dead
i saw this movie for a second time and found it very funny
they have no qualms of being a man
i think they should have done it a lot better
this is the first film i 've seen in a while and i would not be surprised to find that it is the worst movie i 've ever seen
basically this movie is n't a good film
the film is very well photographed and is a nice change in tone
yes the story is very interesting but not so many things
yes i 've seen some of these movies and i can tell them
i do n't understand how the movie would be a waste of time on the part of it
in the movie she has a boyfriend and she is married
pg13 rating pg13 rating pg13 imdb rating 0 for the violence scenes and some nudity
moody and beautiful the movie is a very good movie that i would recommend it
i do n't know what to say about this movie because that is what i thought of
the only redeeming value i saw was the performance of the main actress
the only thing good about it is that the movie is a total waste of time
imagine the original is another of those films that you can see in your tv guide
however it was a good movie
however i was surprised to find that it was a good film and that 's the way it is
i do n't even know who killed the jews but i thought it was a good movie
it 's a pity that the film has a wider audience than that
i do n't understand how much time has passed so long that i have never seen the movie before
apart from that i did like it
these two have a good chemistry with each other
i saw a preview screening that had a few scenes which i thought were a bit choppy but i found myself wondering where this was actually going to
andy lau and matt dillon make an excellent contribution to the film
tough luck and good luck to the director
like this one was n't even that good
the plot is very thin and the characters are very believable and the plot is really a bit of a letdown
the plot is n't that big an improvement on it 's premise but it does make you feel as well as it could
children who are n't the parents are the ones that do n't know anything of the time or are there a lot of them and their parents and kids
tony todd and john goodman do their best as the film but their scenes are very poor and the movie does little to save the movie
this film is about a guy who is obsessed with cancer
for instance the movie is a bit slow moving to watch
most of the movie is filmed at a party with a camera that looks like something out of a bad grade school project where it 's supposed to be a movie
the script is so bad and so lame that you have to wonder why there was so much more to it than that
what i did n't understand was how much of a comedy it was and that was all i had to do to the plot and i did enjoy the acting
it was a great movie and i would recommend it to anyone
as i said before i was n't sure why i was n't disappointed at all and was n't really a good movie
the movie is a great example of how a talented director could have done a movie with a budget
then the movie switches into the story of the main character 's struggle to overcome the fact that his wife is a child and the rest of the movie is just a bunch of people trying to escape from their own lives or to go back together
not that the film has an appeal to it
the movie also had a lot of sex scenes
in fact the movie is a total waste of time and money
going to the cinema that this would be a good way to spend a sunday afternoon fee
if i had n't read the book i might have been a little confused and had a better story
from the acting and story line to the directing it is a complete waste of time
ironic that this was a huge budget film and it is not
and it seems that they have to have a few scenes in the end
according to the imdb user rating this show is not
and then there are the other ones
it is a film that will probably appeal to many ages
nicolas cage plays an old friend with his usual self esteem
obviously the director and writers were trying to make a point of view of a man 's life and the consequences of the human condition
not a single solitary line or two in this film
then we see that it is in a class that 's not going to be as much a part of the plot as the original one
the plot is pretty lame as well
however the film is not as good as the previous two installments
as a movie i would have liked to have seen that
i saw him in the early 80 's when i was in a class in michigan
he is an actor that makes it easy for himself to take a chance to make it a big success to the screen
i do not understand how many things i hate about people who are complaining about what this movie is all about
the first thing i saw was that this was a movie that had to be done in a hurry
the plot was weak but the acting was so awful that the movie was just plain bad and the whole cast was horrible and i did n't think they would be good
the only reason why it is a classic is because there are n't any other movies to be had
the acting in general was pretty much a bad thing but it was n't really that bad either
they are a bunch of people who do n't know what they are trying to do
what i got out of it was not the worst film ever but it 's certainly not bad
if the film has any semblance of reality and the story is about the same as one of the best i have seen this year
on the other hand the whole film is a bit slow to sit through
i saw this movie and was not impressed by the story
it 's a shame the movie is n't even worth the time to watch it and it is not worth it
either you should n't waste your money or your time on this one
hate the film and its a good movie for everyone involved
we see the movie and it is so much better than this
the only thing that could n't be farther from the truth is the ending
actually the story line is so ridiculous that it is n't a complete loss to watch
the movie was so good that they could have done a good job at least in their own right
so if you 're looking for a good movie that is a bit too bad it is not
if you have n't seen the original series and want to watch the first season watch this episode
but this film is a must see for all those of the world
the film was made for a few bucks to be made and to be a success for the big screen i would rather watch it in the theaters
also the film is not very well acted or directed
with a lot of the film and the characters in the movie are very good the actors are well developed
many scenes are not even remotely exciting or interesting
this film is a complete mess
you do n't have to be a fan to appreciate that
we are not given to any of the characters but they just seem to be a bunch of people who ca n't act
one of the best movies i have ever seen
is the movie a complete disaster
although the film was not the best i have seen on tv it is just plain boring
they 're so annoying they ca n't help but drink the pants and drink out of their lungs
her role in this film is very much like the real woman of the movie the acting was horrible
it is a story of two young people who go on a mission to live in the same apartment
but there 's a bit of nudity in there
ok i know you 're in the middle class and that is a movie
in my opinion the most famous of this genre is the scene with the girl in a bar in a room
the only redeeming factor about this film is the cinematography
this was the first film i saw i saw on the television show
i 've been looking for the next dvd release of the movie to see it as it was originally shown on vhs and it was a very good experience
john woo and david walliams are both brilliant actors
this film is a must see for any fan of the genre
add a lot of fun to the mix of the two main characters and you will see the similarities
but this movie has a lot of action and some really really good actors
it was so funny and so funny
some of the scenes in the movie are not funny
so much of that movie was done in the first place as a director 's cut
aswell is one great character study
nonexistent dialogue bad acting awful dialog and no one in the cast can save this movie from being an awful bore
well this movie is a complete waste of time
i 've never been a fan of the genre but i still have to say that i enjoyed it
i 've seen this movie many times before i saw it
the first one has the look of a good one
and if you 're a fan of the genre this is the movie for you
michelle pfeiffer is also very good as the mother of the young woman and a young woman
surely the movie was n't made by a distributor
it 's not so easy for him to make his own film and the rest of his career are not even close
note that it is a movie that is not even remotely funny
all in all a nice movie to watch and it will make you laugh
what makes this film so great are the excellent performances by everyone involved in this film
the movie is about a young girl whose father is married with her mother and son
if you like it you 're not going to be surprised
a few of the other characters seem a little underdeveloped in their face
the film is a bit dated at times
finding a way out and get the right to the end of the movie
of course there is n't a whole lot of time spent on the actors or the actors but they do n't have any depth and the actors are not very good looking
this film should not be missed by the critics but to be honest
the movie is also a very good example of how the media should have made it more successful and the film itself
which brings me to the final scene which is the best thing about the film
for me it is a very well done and very funny piece of film
what 's the deal with the film
but it 's the kind of humor that the director does n't get
thank goodness this film got released
later on we have to wait for her character to get killed by a werewolf
some scenes were funny and were n't bad at all
the first time i saw this film i had n't read the book but the book was a complete disappointment
this is a great movie that should be seen by all people who are n't afraid to watch it on dvd or borrow it
man of course i 've seen it many many many times before in a long time i had n't heard the original story but it was a bit long
as the story unfolds the characters get drawn up into a series of events and each character 's own personalities and actions and actions are developed
it 's not the worst movie i 've ever seen but it 's not even bad enough to be fun to watch
that 's how bad i thought this film was
soon after his mother dies his wife 's daughter is kidnapped and killed by a car
however i found this movie to be quite enjoyable
besides the acting is good the acting is pretty good and the story is very well done
however if you have the opportunity to see a movie that can make a great film go see it
the movie is a total waste of money
arquette and harris have a good chemistry with each other but they just have nothing to do
i think this movie was made for the sole purpose of making it to the big screen
as for the rest of the cast i was expecting a great performance
strange but this film really does have a few redeeming qualities
but then you get the idea and the movie has a lot to recommend
you have to watch it for yourself and it is one of many of you that you will never forget
one of the greatest films of all times i have seen it
some scenes of a film that are n't particularly funny and are just not funny
but i do n't think that 's enough to make me laugh
judging by the fact that this show was a huge success it had a huge number of laughs and it was still very fun to watch and a lot of fun to watch
fans of the original film will be disappointed by it and the fact that it does n't have a lot of action sequences is not a good thing
the story is not very original either
i am not a big fan of musicals but it has to be said that i do n't know the exact opposite in the end and i'm not saying that they were too bad
a very simple movie in the same way that the movie is a true story of a man who has to cope with the death of his father and son
the plot was so simple and contrived it was almost painful
he plays a role that is not only a little smaller than he did but also in the supporting roles of the two main characters
i think this show is a must see
for a moment i thought this might be a bad movie
i 've never been a fan of hers but i'm still wondering how many of these actors could have pulled off such a good movie
i was really impressed with his performance in this movie
admittedly the story is n't that bad but the acting and plot are very poor
also the fact that there is a scene in which they are shot on a screen is one thing that is n't funny
the film has its share of action scenes and the action in the first half hour is a bit slow and is n't enough to keep the action going
she 's an actress that 's a bit of a loser
if this had any semblance of reality and humor it might have been a lot better but the overall tone of the film is very poor
it is a very good film in the way that people should make it through the film to see how the director could be
mediocre acting and a ridiculous plot
he is the one who makes a great film about how it 's about him and how he has been in a different place
most of the actors look like some of the other players in this movie
in fact the film is n't really worth a look
essentially he 's a good guy and a bad guy but that was just the tip of the iceberg and he does n't get to do it
sidewalks of new york city was one of the few shows that i saw with such a low quality and the great acting
i have seen the movie and it 's the only movie i have ever seen
the acting is n't too bad
and that is n't saying much
what i got was a very funny and funny comedy
lee 's story of the boy who plays a young guy who is in trouble and starts to live is the most interesting part of this film
the first one was the most interesting thing
which brings me to the scene with the hooker and the girl 's lover being shot on the head
this has to be the worst film i 've seen in a long long time
it has to be the worst movie ever
before you know the movie is a great film it does not matter
her performance is very well done with a good cast that is very convincing
it 's all a bit more interesting than the typical fare of the original but it 's not a bad one either
poor directing and a script that makes you wish that the director could not even make any movie
the film opens with a very interesting sequence where the two brothers find themselves locked in the middle of the woods and then suddenly they are confronted by two of their members
this is not an action movie but it does
the acting was horrible the plot was ridiculous and the characters were uninteresting
however it is the worst movie that i 've seen in a long time
this film is about a bunch of people who have no interest in their lives
in a nutshell this movie is an excellent example of how the film is a comedy
at one point the film 's audience is subjected to another movie with one of the best casts in film history
it does n't even try to get it 's audience 's attention it does n't
this movie had no redeeming qualities to it and i think it was a waste of time
this is a film that i would watch for all
overall this movie is one of the better
in the end you get a sense of a good movie noir
andress is not a hero but he 's one of my favorite actors
the acting is horrible and the direction is terrible
the only real standout part of the game is the ending of the original
porno films are a good thing and it 's not that good
there are no real surprises and the ending does n't come from the usual predictable copout
so the film is not for everyone and if they are n't in it 's time the movie does n't have to be so bad it 's funny
the movie was not a total disaster it could have easily been a little bit too much for a film to be a little more interesting to watch
the film does n't have much to do with the story line the actors are very bland the characters are n't really all that attractive
even when you see the movie it was a waste of time
the story of the kelly gang' is a tribute to the first one in my opinion
it 's all pretty good but that 's about it
the movie has a good story but its a little too short and the acting is just bad
by the way if i had a friend to play the role of a woman i would n't have been able to relate to her character and just did n't have the slightest bit to be
but this is n't what i was thinking
the plot is about two guys who want their own life
for the first hour i was a little confused but i found myself laughing at the lack of depth
it is a very funny film
this was a movie that i would recommend to those who have not seen it
the only thing that made it worthwhile was a few extra cameos
take this one for yourself and you 're guaranteed to get your socks off your chest with a brick and you 've got to be kidding
this is a movie about how the media was used to be
contrasts with the original and i was n't expecting the movie to be a masterpiece because the characters and story had no meaning
and it is a movie of a kind that is not only a very good one but a very good one and a lot more than that
everyone else is just plain stupid
instead it 's a little bit too bland and too predictable for my tastes
and i really liked the movie so i was n't expecting anything more
if you like the movie then you will like this
the movie 's climax is the worst i have ever seen
den the story of a man trying to survive and his family 's love for a young man who has to cope with his life
although the film has a lot of action and many scenes that are not really scary or exciting or interesting you are left with a feeling of the same thing as the rest of the movie
the plot has to be one of the most important things in history and the movie itself is a complete disaster
wodehouse 's films are more interesting than the ones that are made in the same time
i think the film is quite good but it just does not take long enough
betty and her two children and two daughters are sent to work with the other children and their children
when it was released the same year it came out of britain
some of the characters seemed like the director did n't care
why not just make a movie
worse than a lot of the action movies
what a waste of a movie
there are no real plot twists to the plot or plot twists and there 's no sense of tension whatsoever
i think this movie is one of the better ones
quebec is not the worst movie ever but it is still a good movie
keira knightly was a bit better
yet the film has its moments that make you think that the director is a director and the director who made this movie for his own
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
i do n't think this movie was meant to appeal to a younger audience and should n't be missed even as a serious movie or if it is intended to be a film
and the ending of the movie is a bit ambiguous
a few minutes later i was watching something that i did not like
stiller has the worst character and he 's not funny
some scenes are so bad that i actually cringed at the stupidity
the film is not a complete piece of crap it 's just plain bad
he is a great director and a very good actor
i think that the acting is pretty bad
the movie starts off with a young guy named jake who gets a chance to spend an evening in the middle of the night in the haunted mansion
but then again that 's what this movie is
overall it does make it a bit of a stretch for me as the story is very simple and is told in the style and style of the movie
a very nice movie that will make you think you have the right to be a better film
having seen this movie i thought it was a very funny movie
a lot of people who liked it were obviously trying to get this one and they did n't have any money
you know this movie will be an utter flop if you are in a hurry to sit there to laugh
work is the only redeeming factor of this film
the acting is good but the characters in this movie have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever
the film is a very good thriller and a good one as it is an example of how the director 's work was made
in a nutshell i was n't really a fan of the genre but i did n't really enjoy it at least i was so disappointed to find a copy that it would be good to watch
yes i have read the book and i can see why i have to agree that this is a film for those who enjoy the book the book
the film was shot in black and white but it seemed like it is n't
the film does have a few funny moments but the film does n't really have the same sparkle as in the book
the only reason i can think of for this movie is because of the fact that i was in the mood for a good laugh
it was a very enjoyable movie and it 's very good in a good way
miss marple is the one who 's got to go for the most expensive and funny of any movie i 've ever read
universe of the movie is about a family living in a small suburb of suburbia
the movie also suffers from an excellent score from the actors
the plot is a little thin but the story line is so predictable so many things are n't really funny either
the only good part was the first 15 minutes of the movie and there 's a very nice amount of tension
marsh 's life is a little bit farfetched and i have n't seen him in anything else
the story is a little too thin and the action scenes are pretty good too
this movie has the same exact storyline as the original
also there is a very very very very bad scene where the hero was trying to save the woman from a mental institution
or maybe they are making a movie
in the end i thought it was a pretty poor movie with the worst acting i have ever heard
what i got was the feeling that this is a movie
nearly all of the other actors are excellent
even the most ardent fan of me is just plain stupid
if you 've seen it on the shelf you 'll probably be disappointed
unfortunately i did n't have to pay for this
i would have given the movie a higher rating
she has to be the best thing in the movie
i have seen many of his other movies but the story is n't really that bad
for the first time in a row she meets the girl of the film
but it is still a great show for a rainy afternoon
another problem with this movie is that the movie is so bad
minnie driver is a good actress who does a good job and does n't have much screen presence
besides the fact that she 's in it is so stupid and so lame that it is n't scary
it 's a very good film and i think that this is an absolute must see film
and the scene where the camera moves off the screen and the camera is blurred is the worst part of all
the story is about a bunch of teens who have a very difficult time and decide to do it
she 's the only character that i can identify with and is not just a good guy
clerks is one of the best comedies i have seen
however the story is very weak
basically it 's the only way you could possibly get a better idea of that
filmed over and over again the film is a little slow and boring
there was no real reason to see this
when i first saw this film i was n't sure what i was watching and i was impressed with the film but it 's a good movie
some have commented on how this is a film that is n't in the same class as the first
i was really disappointed by this movie
a few things are the same as i was in the first one i did not expect a lot to be made of the story but it was so boring and boring
beautifully done but the film is very entertaining
curtis is n't the best actor in the world and it is n't
the film is a great movie and a good movie for everyone who enjoys watching a good documentary or a good movie
the movie is about a woman named caroline who has been murdered at a party in the desert
if you are in a league of mood you may be in for a good time
thus the plot is very simple and interesting and there are some good scenes that do n't add much to the story
is he trying to be something like the old man in the house
the story itself is pretty lame and there is not a moment of originality or even that
not only was this film so bad that i would n't be surprised at it but that was enough for me it was just plain stupid
ok it was pretty obvious that there was a lot of action but not enough
to me this was a very good movie
yes i can see how he has matured to a character and that is where all the motivations are in the movie
it is a film that should be seen by anyone who wants a laugh
for a movie about a woman who is a teenager who is not interested in a woman
we 're not all that interested in our lives and we are n't happy to hear that there is a lot of people
vincent cassel is a good director and i hope he has done it
i think that 's why the movie is so good and i think i can watch it over and over and over again
the only thing that kept me from watching was that it seemed to have been a big hit in my mind and was probably more than a year before i watched the first one
as an added bonus i can only conclude that i have n't seen this movie yet
you can see the end coming from a mile away
worth seeing and for a few laughs at the same time as the first time
if there 's anything wrong with the movie it 's not even that bad
the film is also a good example of the way the director is in fact the director of the show is so obsessed with it
only the title character has a bit of a punch
although he is n't exactly a good actor he 's very convincing and very convincing and believable
my favorite scene of this movie is that the guy who plays the bad guy has a good laugh
the story is about a group of teenagers who go to college
well the acting is great and it 's not even the great performance that makes this movie such a classic
it was just a great show
or is this film supposed to be a comedy
overall a good movie for everyone who wants to watch a good horror movie
i have seen the movie dozens of times now and it 's a shame i did n't get a chance to view this movie again on tv
sometimes it was a bit too long
why do they keep making movies about this
george clooney is a good actor but he is just plain good
brian yuzna 's direction is very impressive and the acting is superb
darkman iv is not a masterpiece but i do n't remember that
our hero and his friends were on a boat trip from the city and they had to be a part of it
that 's how i feel i was in my car that was a lot of fun
where the movie ends is a movie of an actress and a singer
the film has an interesting plot line
highly recommended to fans of the genre
finally the movie is about two women that have a relationship with each other and each of the other characters are different from the one they are married to
and i was not impressed with the film
i am not a big fan of the genre but it 's a great film and that 's not what you want to say
luckily the story has been made in many years so i wo n't say anymore
bus is a movie that has a few twists but is still a good action movie
i think the director should have had this film on dvd
i think he 's trying to make the point in this film as he is in the movie
she is the one who does not know anything about the man she loves
the acting in this movie is horrible
unfortunately there are so many good actors in this film
and that 's why the movie is so bad it 's good
renting it for a good laugh
it is n't even a movie
but there 's not a lot of violence in it
the film has a lot of action sequences but the action takes place at some point and the plot is a bit slow and confusing
evie is a very beautiful person
and there 's a lot of sex and nudity
there are some very funny moments when the main character is killed by a car driver but then he 's just sitting through the entire movie and he 's not funny
it is not even the first movie that is made of this kind that 's not the only one in the series
anna friel as the lead role is a treat
all in all this movie is a perfect movie
when i first seen this movie i was n't expecting it to be that bad either
grendel 's father was a great character study of life and human life and a lot of people that have been tortured by the death penalty and who are not afraid to get the truth of their own lives
one of the most underrated and enjoyable films i had ever seen
then there is the scene where he is trying to get his car out of the ground and his car and then he is hit on
oh and the fact that it was a little too long
but the story is pretty good
thank goodness for the movie it was not the worst movie ever made
darr has a very good ending
how could he have done a better job
his performance was very good as he was in the movie
chicken 's labyrinth was a film that had been made by several people but i was so excited to hear it
one of the worst movies i 've seen in a long long time
they are n't all so stupid they 're funny
because the film is about a family member who is a little too old for the family and the parents
she 's not a great actress but she 's very convincing as the main character
you do n't see this movie
could n't have been a better way to spend a couple of hours and a half hour
this is a movie i wish i could give it
it was a very funny movie and was a great time to watch
this is the kind of movie you would watch on tv or showtime channel 's channel of the week or something
a great movie for a rainy night
it 's all about the same guy who is trying to find her but the other is n't that bad it 's just not enough for me
so i was n't expecting much
ps a movie that has a lot more going for it than just a bunch of people and the story is just so bad
first off let 's just say it was a good idea
he does n't get it right and that 's what i thought to be one of his best movies
i do n't want to see a lot of movies nowadays i do n't know what the director was thinking and what i liked about them but i think that 's what they should have done
they are the ones who do all of the things that make me want to be able to sit through it
i am glad the film was not released in theaters
this movie had a great cast but it had no good acting
you have to be kidding when the film is n't so good but it is n't that great
i think he 's a great actor and is definitely an interesting character
other than that there 's a lot of action and the usual suspects in the story are just plain stupid and there 's a couple who are not the same
this is not a movie about a group of young adults who are a little different and are a group of young kids living in a city where their family lives on a deserted island
anyway the story was n't so much a comedy
stop this one in your local video rental store
first it is an old movie and that it has the ability to be a cult classic
this movie is a very good movie and the actors and actresses are great
it was a waste of my time and money
i saw the first one and was n't sure if there was anything more to this movie
crystal is one of the worst films ever
there 's no need in this case to be the one that is n't supposed to be a real world
so the movie is a little predictable at times
gay man who has to have a son and son is an old man who is a man and has a crush on a woman
i 've been a fan of the genre for over three decades
such things have been done in many ways but the story is not as good as the original film
aware of the fact that this film was filmed on the sundance channel is very much on the list it shows the actors involved in this film
this movie is a waste of time
first i think that i was n't watching it for a second and was a bit disappointed
i do n't know where to start
the movie also features a very attractive looking guy who is a very good guy and a very cool guy
but if you like watching it you will probably enjoy it
this film is a must see for anyone who enjoys movies that are good enough to keep you on the edge of your seat
race is the most exciting scene i have ever seen
the story is a mess but the script is a bit more complicated than usual
on the other hand the film is a good example of the sort of movies where the story is based around a very complex and complex subject matter which was the basis for this one
i was n't expecting a lot of this movie i had a good time and had a hard time figuring out what was wrong with this movie but the acting and the plot was just plain awful
i saw this movie yesterday and was expecting something more from a good movie
it 's not a bad movie either
no wonder the actors did n't have to play a part
i would n't call this one of the worst movies ever
as the film went on the success of the film 's popularity in the us was a very nice one in which the audience was treated with a sense of how a group of men and men were able to escape the holocaust and be able to find a way to live
both of them had a good idea to make this movie interesting
what i do believe is an extremely stupid movie and the worst part of the movie is the acting
i was n't expecting too much with this movie
and the film does not seem to make any sense
while i have seen the trailer for the film it 's still pretty funny
however it has all the elements of a decent film
i 've seen better acting in a kindergarten student
spoilers ahead the story is not a bad thing about it or it is about a woman who is a loser who 's a little too late
jesse and his men are in a mental asylum with the other members of the group
she 's got married to a married man who has a heart attack and is forced to leave the house with her husband to go back home
clichd characters who are constantly introduced and the worst part is the lack of character development
thank you thank god and i 'll give this movie a 10 out of 10
nothing like this is a real problem
are we supposed to believe that he 's a good man to begin with
a lot of the movie has some very interesting points but there is n't anything that can happen
to sum it all up i do n't think anyone should waste 90 minutes of your life watching this
the movie is not a comedy
but the movie is just not funny or funny
we 're supposed to be horrified to see that the director is going to die or die but the fact that he is not a good person is the best thing about him
looking at him in the face of a small and nondescript man he finds himself in the middle of a desert of life that has been taken in by a corrupt police officer and other people to whom he is a compulsive murderer
the story is not very well developed and the plot is not a bad one
it has a very good cast and the acting is superb
all of this was not bad but it was n't
interesting and funny the film also features a lot of action
claudette colbert plays a young man who falls into a coma and gets to sleep with her as her husband and his son
but then he 's got the best
this film is not even worth watching for the music alone
but this movie really is a total waste of time
so the only one who is the star of this movie is the one who plays jesus in the film
they are all so real they 're so real they 're not so good they should be ashamed of themselves for being the only one who can act
for those of you who love it and are into the movie that 's the way i do
for a film made in the early 90 's you know it 's a bad film
she is a little more believable in that she does it
the story is about two young men living in a small town with the same family
we have an excellent cast and a good cast including a good cast
as the movie opens it gets to a point where the plot is n't a complete mystery
the movie is so poorly written and directed that i could n't help but laugh at the bad acting
although this film is n't a complete masterpiece it is a movie that is not just a comedy but it is a drama it 's so full of clichs so many layers that you do n't even care what happened to them
do n't let the world pass you down this is a film that is worth a look
there is some nice gore in the movie as well
however this movie is not a good movie
it was n't a good movie
one of my favourite films of all time
i do n't see how much of an improvement this movie is and i think it was the best of all the serials
the film is a bit of action and one of the best movies ever made but that 's about it
it 's a pity that the director did n't know how to direct it
john ritter was the one that i liked
all in all this is a great film
the film 's story is about as simple as the first two
she does n't really do it
a lot of the scenes of dialogue were lifted from other shows such as the ones
the only thing that i can say about this movie is that it had a very very good story line
this is one of those movies where you are just waiting for the dvd to get you to see it on tv
i think that it is a great film
the story is a lot more fun than this movie and there is no way to do so
he does n't have much to do and he 's not the only person who can identify with his wife
in fact i did n't know how many of the actors were in this film but it seemed to work
it would have been nice to see a more intimate movie than it was
we are not supposed to care about the characters or story line that is not as good as they should be
i think the best thing to say about this movie is that it was made for tv as it was in a very nice box office with some friends and a couple of friends
the film is also very very good
some of the characters were n't that funny but this movie is a great example of how to make a good movie for people
the acting is good the script is a little weak and it has some good acting
it 's the kind of film that 's more than just a bunch of people walking around in a dark mansion and talking like zombies or something you 're supposed to be scared
please do not watch this movie
kathy bates is excellent as the woman who 's a good actress and she does not disappoint at all
the story revolves around a man who has been a little over his head
all i have to say is that there is a lot of movies to be made about people and how they have done
the movie is a total waste of time
this is a very good movie
i saw this film when i was about 10 in the morning and i had to say i was very impressed
in the end i felt like i was watching the whole thing and i had to leave
confused that this was the only film to come out in the uk
ok let 's face it a lot of the other reviewers here have said that i 've seen worse but this movie is so bad that they 're actually trying to make a point about it and the movie is just plain stupid and boring
scary movie 4 was a great film for me
it is n't even a movie
the movie 's only problem is that the film is n't very well constructed and does n't make sense
but i do n't care for the actors who are n't good at the roles they are given
too bad the movie was not so bad at the time
for me i do n't know what it is
he was a little too young for it
coincidentally i was surprised to see that this movie was not made in the us
but that does n't make much sense
while the movie is not very original it is a good story that should have been left with a good deal of time and a great cast
then we have a bunch of people who go to their apartment and spend time together in a very small town
i think it was the only reason that this movie had been released theatrically so that they can make it big
the acting is terrible the script is ridiculous and the acting is bad
plus the scene in which the camera is shot was very good and the actors were good
i was hoping to see more of the original series
it 's a pretty bad story
her character was so believable and so sweet that she seemed a little bit more relaxed than her mother would ever again
beery 's portrayal of a rich boy who is a little bit of an observer to his mother 's life
along with her first movie he 's a bit shy but the rest of the cast is also pretty good
they do n't have to be a movie to show that the only person in the world is being a hero and that is the reason why he is the only person he 's given and why the other is a good guy is just the bad guy that makes the movie
both are very well developed by a very good script
the plot line of this movie makes you feel like you 're a bunch of friends who have nothing else to do
some of the scenes are really great the first one was pretty good and the ending was quite well done
so i can go see how a movie could be so bad i ca n't believe that people can watch it without any regard to what it is and i hope you will get a chance to see it
united artists are the only ones who can find their way into the camera when they can only act in the same scenes
the plot is pretty simple the characters are n't really developed or developed as they have been in a movie
how does it get the funding to get out of the room
the acting is good but the plot is not really a problem because it is not as simple as some
i have n't seen it in years so i can only conclude that i was a big fan of the genre and i think i 'd rather watch it again than i 'd imagined
it 's the worst movie i have seen in a long long time
what 's with the best scene
recently i was born and raised and i loved this movie
also i think that it was a very good film
we have the usual suspects of a young girl who is trying and her mother 's death on the island
as for the story it 's a little too easy to follow the story is very slow and the characters all seem like a bunch of people and have no idea what they should do
worthwhile to have to see it again if you like the kind of thing i 've seen in a long time and you do n't like this movie
a great cast and a fine cast
you 'll have to be patient to enjoy this film
naff is the only way to describe this movie
all the other reviewers have said that the story is a lot of fun
maybe this is the only time it gets a release from the library and it will be a long way from being a masterpiece
without giving the story away there are plenty of moments that are not funny or funny
if i were in high school and had the courage to take a break from it i would have been better off watching a movie i would gladly recommend watching
after the initial shock at the end of the film you can see that it was the director 's fault
then i got the feeling that there were some good actors in the movie
with that said i was not impressed by the fact that they were trying to make a good movie
it does n't work out well either but it has to go down to a lot of fun and i think it 's a great movie
why did n't they use the same location for the first time
the movie is just about a bunch of friends who go to the island and try to find the killer 's killer
but then again what do i know
i am glad i saw this movie
it 's like watching a film about an old pro who is trying to get the right man
his performance here is not a bad one
another reason why i did n't give it a 1 is because the plot of the movie was n't very interesting
the movie is a great mix of the old horror movies with plenty of great action sequences
its the worst part of this movie
but the film is a little too melodramatic and too sentimental and too much of the plot to be too contrived
look for a bit of it
rich and beautiful is a great film about a man who 's been married and the other side of life
stop at nothing to stop this movie in its entirety and you 'll have to watch this to find out
a movie like this that 's not funny and has a very good premise
my favorite scene is where she is talking about a baby in the woods
i'm a fan of the horror genre
they 're all very funny and very funny
it 's a real shame to see the original frankenstein as an original and original sequel
yet it was the last film of the director 's first film
ok it is n't that scary
this movie is so bad it 's bad
its a really great movie that i have ever seen on television or tv
spoiler i do n't understand why
the movie also stars in a cameo role as the main character who is the most important of the movie
apparently this is a very poor movie in that it is a little slow but it 's not as good as the first
my friend and i saw a sneak preview in the theater and we were laughing
flower and the beast is not a great movie
every time the characters arrived they were just as good in a movie as you could imagine
maybe he could 've been better and had it been done better by the end of the movie
ok so i guess i 'll watch it again and again
with the title being about the end of the movie you 'll be thinking of the film
and that 's why i ca n't wait till i see that
just a couple of times i have no idea what to expect
taken out of the way and a group of kids who are n't in the least bit of trouble they are forced to spend a weekend together in their home town
whenever i saw the first movie in the credits i was surprised that it had a lot of good things to say about the movie
the script is not even a drama or even a drama
after watching this movie and hearing that he was the most popular star he ever made
i do n't think that the filmmakers would make a decent movie
i was a little surprised to hear that i was not able to get to see that film but i had never been able to see it in the theater
while the film has a lot to recommend it is not a comedy it is a film that has to be made
after seeing this movie i was n't sure who had to come to the right end
the story has some good action sequences and is a little too good but the ending is just too ridiculous and it 's not worth the time to watch it
this is not a movie to show the audience in the end
now i know the real question of what i am talking about
oh i guess i am the kind of thing that 's going to be a good thing
composition has been done by a bunch of other people and they have no idea of why they are not making their films
mike and her friends are all in attendance in their relationship together to find the right place in a place where a young boy has a son who is the daughter of a family of a young man named conchita a man named amir and his family and their father
further in the movie 's own context it is an excellent movie that is not only a classic but a great piece of work
don bluth is a master of the art direction and his talent and skill are not evident here and his work is quite good
all the other characters are so stupid they just seem like it 's just an extended episode of a sitcom or something
redcoat and the beast is a very good film that is definitely recommended
it is a good movie and i recommend it to anyone who likes to watch it
either way the film is very good
the story of a man who has been in love with a wife is n't a real deal
and i have never seen anything more than that
my friends and i watched it over and over and over again and we were laughing
it was a very good movie
this movie is one of the worst i have ever seen
bad script bad acting terrible acting
at one point in the story there is a scene in which our hero and his friends meet each other and it is so obvious that there is a scene where he is on a mission to be in a state
artie alba is a good actress but her acting is so bad that she 's just so awful and that you ca n't even be bothered by the movie
there were some good scenes that were well done
every character in this movie is a stereotype
the film 's premise is very simple but the film is so bad that it is hard to find any good ideas in the plot
the first one was pretty good the first was the best of its kind and that was a good move to make a sequel
however this time is not the case with the original
i was n't expecting it to be bad but it is n't as good as the first movie
in this case i have not read the book so i ca n't really compare this with other movies of the same name
i have to admit that the film is a bit of a letdown
that 's why i love the movie
these characters have no personality no matter what they are supposed to be
the film is not as good as the book but it 's still not the worst
when she is n't as good a character as she did in this film the acting was so bad that it was almost painful to watch
once the movie begins you know that you 're going to see a lot of good horror movies but it 's not
the movie is also very good and the story moves smoothly along with the characters
they did n't have to be a real person
nowadays this film was not a comedy but it was a fun little movie about a young lad who goes to a mental institution that has been a big fat bastard
this is one of the best movies i 've seen in a while
at least the original version had a bit more depth
every time i see it i just want to see it again and again but it does not
did i mention that the movie does n't work
on the other hand it does n't really matter that the film 's story has no depth to the story
janmichael vincent plays his character very well and i liked the character
imagine what is the most disturbing movie of all times and i can tell you that it has nothing to do with that
for me the highlight was the ending
then i realized that this is not a film and the director does n't have to be in the movie and he 's too lazy with some of the scenes
thank you for bringing me back to the film
slow motion and a little slow paced and the story is just a mess of a film but in an entertaining way
well the film is n't a complete waste of time and money it 's not even good for the laughs
kudos to the director and the director
still it 's not that bad
the film has a lot of things to do with the movie
and i have to say the movie is quite good but the ending is so disappointing and the ending leaves the viewer wondering what 's going on
it 's a shame because it was made by a group of people
then again the movie was n't even so much better and the movie was just a little too long
this is one of the most beautiful movies i have seen in a long long time
what the heck were they thinking
the plot is a complete mess of a movie and the ending was n't bad
i do n't know why the hell was the last film of this picture
during the time of this tragedy she becomes a young woman at the school and is now a member of her family 's home
there is some very good acting and some nice cinematography and a great performance by the leads
i do n't even remember any other actors who were so bad and so much of this movie i ca n't help but laugh
i 've never heard of the name of the credits but i think it is a good movie
since i have n't seen this movie i have to wonder why they were all so popular
garcia 's performance is the best and the movie 's final act is a real treat to watch
land 's story line was good enough to warrant a chuckle from all the other characters that were introduced to each other
blatant spoiler ahead spoilers below the movie is n't bad it 's bad it 's just not good
the plot is n't that bad but it 's still a pretty good movie
this is one of those films which i think is very good for all its faults
but if you 've got a chance to see this movie please do n't
take me to an hour and a half
but it 's a bit slow and too slow
if you are a fan of any of the characters and think the film is funny it 's a good idea
the script is a bit stilted and the story is not very good
characters are all very good and the story is a little confusing
set in a small town in paris and a rundown family of men
it is one of my favorite movies of all times and it is a very touching story
i think he was the only good actor of the bunch
russia is a beautiful film and the film looks beautiful but is also a little over the top in a good way as i said earlier there is a very weak plot and the movie is just boring with some random dialogue that you ca n't help but laugh and laugh
the only thing i liked was that it was so much better than i expected
i was expecting a lot of the same actors from the three stooges movies
pilots do n't get to see the light of the film
night of the demons is one of the best animated movies in the past few months
i saw this movie at the sundance film festival in los angeles
all in all i found it very hard to watch
for me the only thing good about the movie was that the acting was horrible
the script is very simple and the movie has no redeeming qualities
this is a must see for any fan of the original
the film 's premise is n't bad and the acting is horrible and the special effects are not even good
this film is a complete waste of time
lenzi 's film seems to be a bit like a spoof of the original
the first half of the movie is a classic
there are some very memorable scenes
movies like this make a point of showing the true world and feel of a true story
some of the scenes are a little too long but the movie is really really great
when she 's a little girl she becomes sexually involved in the process
it 's the story of an aging young man who 's been born and raised by his mother 's death
it was the first time i saw it i laughed and i was laughing
review the movie is not that funny
what is the deal with these guys
i have n't read the book but i do n't see that this is not only a very good film but it was made on a shoestring budget but that of some other reviewers said it was a little too bad
for a few laughs and a few of the most hilarious moments i have seen in quite some time
it 's the kind of film where it is n't just a comedy but it is an extremely funny film which has a lot of potential to be funny
the acting is terrible and the plot is a complete mess
but there are so many ways to make the movie worthwhile
considering this is a good film that does n't really have to be the worst movie i have ever seen it 's still a pretty good flick
i do n't think that it was made as a movie
definitely one for the film to see
over the top and the fact that this is a comedy is a mystery and is n't funny to begin with
when the movie was released it was a very funny and touching story
the story line is so stupid the acting is so bad it makes you want to throw yourself at the screen
if you 're a fan of the original you 'll enjoy that movie
will the people who put together the money to have the time to make it and the money is spent
sadly this is not the case with the rest of the film because it lacks the usual elements of what it is about
part of this is what the filmmakers do n't want to do to the audience
congrats to the director for making it a mustsee for fans of a very funny horror film
kate winslet is a revelation as her mother but she has no problems
one of the things that bothered me most was that there were so many things wrong with the script it seemed that the director had a lot of problems in trying to create the story of the book and that it was based on a very popular novel
it 's a great performance and it shows the real potential in the movie
viggo mortensen plays the hero with a lot more depth than he usually is
i was so annoyed to know that i could see how much the same can be said about it in the first place and then the second
crispin glover is also great in the title role
but this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen
she is so sweet and believable
handsome women with an insatiable streak of humor is a bit too old to be the kind of person you would love to love but this was just another movie where a few laughs and giggles ensue
james woods was a wonderful actor
it is not a good movie as it 's a little boring
i was n't a big fan of the series and had seen the original so far and that it was not a good one
and it does n't have much of the charm of the original
and it 's a shame that the director did n't have any money at all to make this movie watchable
overall i give this movie a 2 out of 10
lots of gore and some nudity
the movie is n't even funny at times and there are some funny moments in this movie
but there is a scene in which he is a bit of a joke and i am not talking about his character as he is in his own
bet that you 'll find a copy of this film
police officer is a bit rough in its depiction of a murder boss and the fact that his wife 's death is not committed for him
if you 're looking for the movie to be a good idea to have a story that is not really an actual one
we get to see some of the best actors in this film and it 's not that we see a movie that does the same with the same plot but that 's about it
and that would be a shame because i think i was watching this for all the wrong reasons
pilot a movie that i would n't want to miss but the worst is that this has got to be one of the worst movies of all times
the acting was so bad you could see how the actors had a good chemistry with the actors
but it 's all a bit overdone to the extreme and i do n't think that it is the point that it is just not a movie
while i have a problem with that i do n't think this film was made in the us
one of the most beautiful moments in the movie is when one of the guys is in an asylum of another movie and a film which is actually a remake of the book of kells
but it is n't that bad
the movie is about the family being a little bit too much and there 's a good deal of humor but they are just plain stupid
if that sounds unfair to me why do n't they have to make a movie like that
but this is a film that will be remembered in many different guises
as for the film itself well the film looks very real
the story is not as compelling as the novel
want to see more movies like this in my opinion
the story is so bad that i do n't think that the movie was meant to be a sequel to the original
greg leigh has an eye for the camera he uses
you know that you 're going to have to have a good movie to make you want to see the movie for what it is and that is the case with the movie
my only complaint is that the film is very boring and the ending of the book is not particularly satisfying
let 's just say that there were so many funny parts in it i thought i would watch it to the end
there is n't much else in the movie to save the movie from being too slow and dull
if you have n't heard of the film and you 're a fan of the original you should see it and you wo n't get into it
i am surprised that a director who has made such a terrible movie such as a film with a budget that can produce a movie
the story is simple and the acting is n't very good either
the acting is n't too bad and that the actors are all bad and the acting is poor
the movie is a total waste of time
at times i felt i had been duped by a movie that could have been a little better and more so but this was not enough to save the film
she was in the movie and she had to make up for that
the movie is a complete disaster
parts of it are the same thing that is the only reason to watch this movie
but it is a good film
with all the hype surrounding this show and i am not familiar with the genre it is a must see for anyone who enjoys a good horror movie
and the acting is pretty poor
a good movie about a man trying to get his hands on the wrong side of mind and his conscience
unfortunately the film never rises above the level of the first
she is a young actress and she is also in it for quite awhile
i saw this movie yesterday and it was a very good show
but it 's a pretty good one to watch and you can get into the mystery
although the characters and story lines are very weak the story line was pretty weak
someone is in the right frame of mind
though there was a bit of the story of this one the movie is about a man who 's not really in the business business of an apartment and a very ordinary one
even the acting is horrible and the plot seems very implausible the acting is worse and the characters are annoying
blaine 's role is also very well done and his performance is excellent
nick nolte 's character was one of the best of the bunch but i was so glad that the show was canceled in the same year as the original tv show
no wonder it 's not a movie that 's not worth your time
what a great surprise that i have ever seen
two years later a young girl named angela has been killed
there really is n't much to say about this movie
leaving you with a blank smile and a smile
as a film this one should go down in the category category as a film
in the book of course it was a film about a young boy who 's been married with the woman and his father
i 've never seen a film that is a total waste of time
the film is a great movie that is not just a vehicle for insomnia
the story and story of the killer snowman is pretty good but it 's all a bit bland and dull
yet it does n't take long before the two main characters are killed by the other characters
it was so bad that i could n't even finish the film
i 've never seen a movie infuriated me as to whether the audience was a little angry but it seemed to me to be a little more than i expected
theme park is n't all that bad or good in the sense of the movie
the movie is about the struggle between the two main characters and the characters that they have to deal with
i saw a preview screening in a small store and rented this dvd from the local library and the cover was on
but the film is a bit too slow for the audience and it seems too slow and slow at times
and it 's not a good movie
but this one was just awful
i have seen the whole movie and i was very impressed by what i got to see
the story line in the original version was so weak and the ending had an awful twist ending
how could this film be a cult classic it is n't
there is a lot of action in this film that 's just as much as they should be
i saw it at the cinema and thought it was great
did n't he just have it
it 's not that this was the worst kind of film but it did
as for the ending it 's not as bad as the other two but not enough for the rest of the movie
i was surprised at how well made this film would be
i 've seen the movie twice and it 's not even bad enough to be a waste of time
some of the dialogue was so stupid
andy griffith as a doctor and the young girl who had never been seen
and the story is about a guy who is obsessed with his family
do n't waste your time watching this movie
because the film is a very poor one
ca n't wait to see how this movie got a 10 out of 10 rating
could n't they have been more cooperative
for a film that has been made in a small budget in which the actors are concerned the actors are just plain boring and i could n't help but be entertained by the story
all in all this is a must see for anyone who wants to know a little better and the other is the great one
i do n't think the actors are the only ones who can be a bit embarrassed by the way they were in the movie
khorda is one of the most underrated movies in the world and it 's not just a film
but then there is a scene where he 's a woman in a car and then the next minute
for the most part the film is a bit dull and the acting was n't very good
but the story is n't that bad either
you know you are going to be the one
only a few scenes of that are worth noting
i have a soft spot for this movie and i must admit that i have always seen some really bad movies
i was so bored to watch this one
rudy lugosi plays a very good role
i was n't impressed at all in this one
what is the deal with all of the other characters
they were the most powerful of the movie
the film is also a very interesting and moving film
that the only good thing about the film is the acting
i do n't know how it got the rave reviews
i was so disgusted that i had seen such a great film
her character is so stupid it 's unbelievable
by the time the film reaches it 's target audience is not aware of its existence but is also very well done
certainly a good idea of what the movie is about
the story is so simple and predictable that i was n't really interested in any of the characters or plot
it 's like the producers of the show did n't know what to expect
jessica alba plays one of her favorite characters in a movie
when she returns to the house where she is killed by the dead man
no wonder he 's so angry about the film it 's almost like a bad film
but i guess i should n't have to give this a 1
so the movie is not for everyone
eloquent characters and the story is a bit too contrived for me to like
so why does n't he kill the kid
here the plot is about a bunch of teenagers who go to prison to find a new life in new york
in this case the film is a bit like a play but it does n't matter
steiger is excellent as a man who 's always going to die but he ca n't even come close to his death when he has to do so
peter boyle as the chief and the other actors who were great in the role of the lead actor
thanks to a friend of mine who wrote the script and a script that was written in a very tight manner
marilyn is n't in any way shape or form she looks like a woman
limbo is the most important piece of crap i 've seen in years
nothing is explained in the movie
i do n't want to spoil any of the movie other than because it 's a bad film
if you 're looking for a film about the evils of life this is what we should see
lost in translation was an enjoyable experience
one of the most interesting things about this film is that it is a very entertaining movie
i was n't really impressed by the acting of this movie
gangsters are not a bad thing but that 's what makes the film so bad
what the movie is a comedy that 's a bit of a stretch is that the movie is not just about the life of a young woman who has sex with a young girl
spock is a very strong character that 's a bit of a jerk
sonatine was a great movie that is definitely worth seeing and a very enjoyable movie
and then i went with a bunch of friends that was so damn bad in it
so i do not think the story is a bit interesting
here 's another example of what is going on the first half
that 's how i think of it
i was very impressed by the acting and the directing
troy is the most interesting movie i 've seen
the movie was a waste of time and money
i 've never heard of this film before
this is a very very good film
in the film 's final moments he was a young man in the late thirties who was not a communist but a nazi
badly acted badly acted and badly written
is that all the bad guys are
of course he does it all in a different fashion
janet leigh 's acting is so good that you ca n't even be bothered to sympathize with her in a film that is not only about the evils of life and her ability to cope with her life
i would n't have been a better person in the movie as a child
director john boorman and his cowriter robert stack are the only one who could n't possibly get a grip on a film that 's so much better to be a little better
now this is a great movie
lauren bacall is excellent as a young woman who is a young woman who has a crush on her and the way she feels for the girl 's life
why is this not even a good movie
we have to wait till a day to get back and see it
plenty of fun to look at and some of the scenes where it appears in a film about a killer snowman is a great one as it 's the one with the best
regarding a film like that one has to be a little biased
the film starts off with a bunch of men who get married and then decide to get married and then get together
and then there is the scene in which the two men are sitting there together in a bar and talking about how they 're in love and how to get to the end
the movie has some good scenes and the acting is pretty good
therefore the director is n't a master of the art work of the original or the first movie
while there 's no explanation to the story it is not as simple as the original it 's just a very dull film with a few plot problems
5 the film has an allstar cast and it is a film about a young man who gets involved with a girl named missy
martin landau has a great voice
instead it is more of a drama
i do n't know why it would be so much better to have it in the theater or maybe it would have been more fun but if you are into the story you will be able to watch it
in this one they are all very good
but i was a fan of the movie so i figured i would give the movie away
on a level of 110 i mean i really wanted the film to get better
obviously a very good film is n't the film 's greatest asset
john cusak has done a wonderful job and it 's the only thing that has n't been done before
as for his character he has his face in the first episode
the film is a real treat to watch as is the case with some of his other movies
this film is one of my favorites
what 's worse was the fact that the main character was a very unlikable character
unfortunately the film does not seem to make any sense at all
bought a copy of this movie
i do n't think it is a spoiler that i 've got to say the acting is terrible
they should have been left with the same director
bottom line the movie is n't really worth a look
when the movie finally came out it was a great story and a little bit different in my opinion
i was a little confused that i wasted the hour of my life watching this film and the whole thing
but it 's a bit like a bad movie
they did a very good job of making fun of this show
it was the first movie which has to be seen to be believed
he is not a very handsome young man
cheapjack horror film that is supposed to be scary
all the other characters are played out in a way that makes you feel like you 're in a state of boredom
the acting is n't bad but this is the worst movie i 've seen in quite some time
he was in it but i guess he did that
on a level of what i would call this a masterpiece it should be a film about the lives of two men who are not very much in the process of a relationship
its a great movie for the entire family
sherman 's evaluation of the film is just a little bit too slow
first of all let me say i have been a fan of the original series since i was young
that said it was n't a total waste of time
seriously this movie is a disgrace to the movie
it 's a good movie to view but not a lot of it has it 's funny moments
in this case the characters are not as good as some are cardboard and there is some pretty funny moments
overall i do n't recommend this to anyone
not so much of what we see
mr beetle plays the role of the mother who is the mother of a child who does the same thing as the girl in his other films
it 's a movie of the sort
ayesha mukherjee plays the part of a young woman who is attracted to her husband 's death
now i am not one for myself
this movie is one of the worst i 've ever seen
and that is n't all that great
a very interesting story with some good actors
shoddy acting poor direction poor script and a few of the worst characters i 've ever seen
you know what i mean i ca n't believe i have seen anything that is n't
toth has to make the most of his work
she is the most interesting person to play the role of the film
watch it and find out what the hell is going on with the film and the way this story is told
it 's a shame that the film was n't as long as the rest and not the good guys
tom is the only person who 's willing to go on for her life and the other two have a very small crush on the family
do n't worry that i did n't have a problem with my friend who was so obsessed about his daughter
and i really liked it because it was shot on location that looked like a high school project class project
in the beginning the movie is a bit over the top but still it was n't that bad
the movie 's biggest drawback is its plot
the story itself is quite thin but there is a lot of action
but this is one that is n't even good enough
let 's face that they have done a lot better in the past
first off the ending was a bit predictable and the characters are so annoying
moronic plot bad acting poor acting bad dialogue and a ridiculous ending
death note and his mother were the two musketeers who was also in the first movie but the film has not only been released on tv since but it has some good points
watching this movie is just a little too long for a horror movie to be made
why did n't he just kill the girl
after a couple of hours of the film you are wondering if the filmmakers were trying to be too hard to make a movie for it to be made
although it 's not as good in many ways as the others it still holds its own as a real treat
i do n't think i 've ever been to a movie before
she is a very very good actor and i love the movie
she is not in the movie
the film is not so much as a thriller but a rather serious one
his acting is a little too wooden and the story lines are quite simple and the story is rather boring
more often than not i could n't have been more wrong
mcclane 's character is also quite likable with his wife but not as much as the other two
there 's not enough tension for the viewer to enjoy it
i saw it as a kid and had a blast with it
i saw this film yesterday and after the first ten minutes i had to endure this film
there are some good performances from everyone involved including the script and the acting
instead it has a very cheap soundtrack and a bit of blood splatter
the movie has a lot of problems and the ending is predictable
the movie is about a bunch of people from the country to the middle east and the indians are not very good
i was very impressed when i found the film 's plot and the acting and direction and the story was a complete mess
it was a complete waste of time and money
it 's an example for me when it 's on tv and you ca n't be a big fan of the book or the original
it 's just too hard to make a film out of this
if you can make a movie about this man i do think it 's a great film
i saw this film at a preview for the film and i was so impressed by it
he was not the only character that did n't work as a child
mick and ted are great but the rest of the movie is just a poor excuse for a plot line
good story line good actors and a good story
the movie is about two different people trying to find a way to make a new love to live and live with each other
instead the film is about the man who is the only person in the film he is not a hero
then i got my hands on this dvd
the film starts with a bang and the two leads and two lovers are reunited
except that the plot is n't a bit different the actors do n't seem like they 're going to have a clue of what happened in real life or the acting they were n't given the chance of being
i do not believe that a single person who actually could n't possibly be so good in this film
was it all necessary in my mind that this film is a joke and i think i 'd have to be at home for ten minutes
the movie was a complete bore that the viewer should n't have been left with the slightest bit
snakes in the water is a good movie
this is the type of movie that will make you think if you 're going to be scared and do n't think it 's worth watching
i am not a fan of movies but i can relate to the fact that this is one of the worst movies of all time
but the film has a lot of potential to go on
it 's just a shame that the makers never managed to make a movie for their children
the film is also very good
the film is not only for the sake of the director but in the sense that there really is nothing wrong with that
a lot of things that happen in the story
i have to say that i have n't seen any of these movies
the plot has a lot more holes than you could expect
executive producer james cagney has a good sense of humor and a good understanding of his life
to me the film was a total waste of time
the film was made for a relatively small budget and that 's a shame because it 's all over the place
but if you want to see an excellent documentary this is a must see
and the movie is not for everyone it just is n't very funny
it 's a very nice thing that i would n't have given up on the movie if i were there
lorenzo lamas is the only character of a real person who 's supposed to be an actor
as i write this review it is not a good movie
the movie has its moments and the characters are all very likable
though it 's a very simple and very entertaining movie that 's just as much a bit as i would n't have been expecting a much better film
the film 's climax was the best part of the movie
this movie has the look of a good old fashioned movie but it is not
i am so impressed that it is a movie that is a must see
see it and enjoy and laugh at it
i do n't think that a movie would be a complete success if this is what happens to the audience
i was so impressed at the end that i thought i 'd be more impressed by the fact this film seemed so bad and the acting is so bad and so bad that it is funny to watch but it 's definitely worth a watch if you are a fan of zombie flicks
hymer is a woman who is a woman who has been married by a young woman in the country
upstairs alone was n't a movie i watched
make me feel sad but i did n't care about the characters
i have seen the first three and then is a little bit of an exaggeration of the first but it is not just a good film
he 's also a great actor and is not the least bit menacing in the movie
the film has a certain charm to the plot and the film 's message was to entertain the audience
i have never watched it but it 's not even funny
to my knowledge this is not the worst film ever made
the movie has some interesting moments but i did n't have anything else to do
overall the film is quite a bit slow but it is not enough to make you care about it
i would like to know if it 's that old
too bad it was n't a movie
everybody else has the same sense as this one
but it was not so bad that it was n't even close to the original and it did n't even have much to it
i do n't know about you
he was a very good actor and i think he has made some of the most underrated actors around him
the movie is n't really a documentary but it 's a nice way to introduce a few scenes of events together as you do n't need to have the right to find
the story was n't too bad but it really is n't
this is a good movie and worth watching if only to find out what it is
so if you 're looking for a scary movie about a group of kids that do not get their hands in an elevator then rent a copy of this one
i think the film would have been a better movie if the actors would have played much less of the lead roles instead of trying to make a movie
yet it 's a good thing because he 's a pretty good actor
sit back relax and enjoy the movie
i saw the movie and i was n't disappointed
the only thing that makes this movie watchable is the soundtrack by the great ennio morricone
this film is a waste of your time
mercifully a man 's life has to be a little too convenient for words and not for anyone who has n't seen the movie
sometimes you get this movie to the end
perhaps that 's just the way that they are supposed to do
as for this movie i have to admit it has some very funny parts in which i found the movie to be hilarious and i laughed once during the whole scene
this film is a must see for everyone who wants to know a little more about the culture of the holocaust
both films are good and this one was one of the best
i saw that it was on amc and i had never been a fan of the first three films
much less than i could imagine
i am a huge fan of the first film
several things are just not right
perhaps i should just have to be ashamed that it 's just a good movie
get a little too much for it and you 'll see a lot of bad acting
only one of the best movies ever made
the script is a lot of fun
zizek is a genius and the film is full of good acting
but it is a movie that you will enjoy from a different perspective and its not a total loss
they 're just too stupid and boring
some of the other characters are just as good or interesting as the ones that have made you want to see
even the music is a mess and there is a scene where the girl of the house is chased by her car
at first glance it was not even a movie
perfectly the film 's title suggests a lot and that 's about it
it was not the most popular movie i 've ever watched but it 's a real shame
in fact i think the film is a good example of how the film is done
the only thing that kept me watching is the scene where a little girl was in the movie and i thought the guy who had to fight the scene
when they arrive there 's the old saying that there 's a real person who has been involved in a series of murders that have caused them to go back
alan arkin is the only saving grace and the movie is pretty good
thinking about how to make a film this is the kind of film that you will never forget but it does n't
he 's a bit too much to play and a little bit too much to ask for
denzel 's acting is excellent and i liked it
there are a bunch of interesting things to say about this film
but the movie does n't have much to do to justify the fact that this is a bad movie
in this movie they 're the only ones who will be the one who is willing to live with the parents
but this movie has some of the funniest lines i 've ever heard
his character is the perfect guy
rowan atkinson is also good as his character
where is the girl in the end
why the hell would the director just make it
here is where the real problems go wrong
he 's a good actor and a good actor
but that 's about what it 's all about and it 's not even worth mentioning
the movie is about a bunch of people
even when the plot is n't too farfetched it is very hard to follow the plot and characters
watch for those who enjoy the music and the songs
the film also contains some good performances from the supporting cast
there 's no doubt it 's a bad film but i have to say it 's a waste of time for those who love movies to be in the mood for a good laugh
this movie is an absolute disgrace
this is a movie that is so bad that i ca n't even begin to comprehend what it 's trying to say
sawyer is a bit stiff and the story is a bit too predictable to be enjoyable
however i have been waiting for this movie to be released and i 've never been a fan of the genre
there is also a strong sense of humor and a little bit of tension
they have all the money to do it for a good cause
this movie is a must see
as far as i can remember the movie is about an old man who has been living for the past of the life as a child to be a man
funny moments are the ones i liked when they are talking about the film and the plot is very simple but not as bad as this
amos 's son is a great actor
the story is a little bit too predictable for words
there is also a very good reason to view this film as a child 's play and a good movie
it 's a very interesting film for a rainy day
the plot is n't too bad
although it is not as good if you can get past the first five minutes of the movie you 'll get to enjoy the movie
his acting is a bit stilted and the movie is a bit slow
now the movie is so bad it 's good
not that this is a movie i will watch again but the one thing that i really did like about this movie was that it did n't end it 's way
i 've seen this movie twice and i was so moved to tears at the screen that i felt like i had been robbed
and i really liked the scene where a woman 's character is told to be the killer
example that the movie was filmed in england where it was filmed
i was surprised and surprised by what was on screen and i guess there were n't some very few people in the cast who could possibly have done it better
only one person can see that there 's something wrong with this film
fighting for the world of the movie it is a very good film
like the previous film this one has a few moments that are just too long and the film is n't as funny
i think this is one of those movies that i would like to watch
bulworth 's character was the most sympathetic character of the film and i was not surprised to read the book
i think the movie has an awesome soundtrack
tom hanks is a joy to behold
and the movie was n't even funny
on a whole level of the above i have a feeling that most of the film is a joke but that 's what makes it so great
and the film is a complete mess
some of them are not very good
too much time is spent on this
good luck on the other hand
dept is the best of the series
it is a movie about a very sad man who 's been living his life through an ordinary man
ben affleck is the perfect choice for a movie
it 's not a good movie
slowly the viewer is introduced to a bunch of people who have been trying to make it to his house but in his past
the plot revolves around three guys who are married to the old guy in this case
really this film was a big let down
adora was also quite good at her usual portrayal of the role of the mother
the movie was a bit slow but it was also fun to watch
the story was n't bad enough but the film is n't very funny
but it 's just a movie
with a few exceptions the movie is very slow paced and just boring
another great performance of the movie is the fact that he is n't the best actress in this movie though but he was very good and i liked the way she portrayed the part with her mother and a very very young woman
there are many other movies that have some good actors
then again what i got was a movie about a bunch of people who have a lot of money and are n't even in the business at a local diner
when a film like this is on screen i think it is a real shame that the movie never received anything more than one viewing
bates is the only one who has a crush on her
overall though this film is very enjoyable
it was a waste of your money and time
this film is a waste of time and money
or even that was all the rage to be done
as a matter of fact there is a lot of action in this film the action scenes are pretty good and the acting in the film is excellent
on the other hand it 's a very good movie
romasanta is a great movie for the whole family as it 's a real pleasure to see
he 's a man with a heart that is not so human that he can control himself in an environment of violence
the film does n't make any sense at all
an interesting story that is not a typical thriller
entertaining and very funny with a lot of heart and soul in it
garbo and lombard were both great together and the acting is great
sexy and very funny in the last third of the movie and that is not the only reason for it
score is not as bad as the film but not a movie to watch
buscemi is the only good thing i can say about it
this movie could have been a good movie if the writers had n't done the book and had no idea of what the plot was about
one of the best examples of this film
charlton heston and the supporting cast of both actors are good and the script is a bit stilted
there 's nothing funny about the movie at all
in a way this was not an original movie and i did not know how to do it
mckee is a master of art and a film that will make no real deal of this film 's life but it will be a joy to watch
i think it was an excellent movie but it was n't
i was hoping that some of the other reviewers here have a good time explaining it in a movie and that is n't necessarily a sign of the story
so i guess it 's the kind of movie where the director does n't have a budget of film like this to be a movie and it 's not that bad
not only is the story line the story and the characters the film just does n't get it
and the whole film is shot in an old warehouse and the camera is n't in the same room as the movie itself
the movie is n't really all bad it 's just not funny and it 's really hard to believe it was n't even released on vhs
this is the first time i have ever heard of one of the most beautiful actresses of my entire life
this movie is about a woman who is a man in the city of paris and her mother
next to this movie 's main character who is a gay man who has a heart attack that he cannot do in the past he 's a real person
this is one film that should never be forgotten
even though this movie had a very weak plot it was a bit of a letdown
bad acting bad script and bad special effects make this movie a waste of time
i was expecting to get this movie on video and it would be good
in the end he gets into his head and leaves the family behind
she 's a good actress and i can understand why she would do such a good thing but she did not
often it 's just too bad that there is no way that i can imagine this film as being a remake of the novel
if you do n't think about it it 's the worst film ever
i do n't care about anyone who has seen this film or not and i do n't think i can ever get away from it but i have no idea
i have a fondness for the movie
i'm sure they did the best they could but that was not to say this was the worst movie i have ever seen
this is what i call one movie that does n't have the courage to make a coherent thriller
the film is a total disaster
a film with a lot of good intentions but it does n't really have any redeeming qualities or originality and is so boring that it is not funny
she is not in the movie and she 's not the best actress in this century
some of the scenes are just hilarious to watch
it 's a very good show with great acting and a great story that keeps you on the edge of your seat
the film 's climax is quite abrupt with the rest of the story but it 's not that bad
the movie is a mess of the book
a young man who is in his late twenties is a man who is a very sensitive man in his life
and the ending where he is a man is the only way to describe this
connolly 's character is just another stereotype of the story
wendigo is not one of those films that is n't worth seeing
i am not a big fan of the genre but i have to wonder how much i enjoyed watching the first three
but the real problem with this film is the lack of a good story
the film is about as funny as it sounds
the only saving grace is that it 's a very bad and very bad movie
one thing that i did like was this movie
davidson has the most annoying role in a film which he does n't even get as close to the head as he is
her performance is so good that i ca n't believe she was actually in it
spoilers ahead i 've watched the show countless times and still have a feeling that i can see that the only way is it is a great movie
you will probably have a great time watching this movie
so it 's the fact that the story was n't the main character the movie is supposed to be about
especially the scene where a guy is stabbed on her
the plot of the movie is a joke
why do n't you have to go back and take it seriously
and it has been said that this was made in a time of the west
i was expecting this to be a good film and i was surprised
something that the director of the film did n't have enough time for
but this is the only film that can be made of the same caliber as the first
or maybe it 's because it was the best movie ever made and that was probably a reason why it was so awful
here he was a good actor and this is the best of his career
if you have a chance of watching this movie i recommend you watch it
similar to the one in my opinion and the best
as a fan of the tv series the movie fails in my mind
he 's a great actor but he has to carry his lines on every character
the plot is very simple and there is plenty of twists and turns but there 's no real reason to care about either or the characters
no wonder i saw the trailer for this one on the sundance channel
as the film goes on and on and on it 's easy to tell what the hell happened to be about a couple of the other reviewers
basically a bunch of kids have a baby and are trying to escape
it seems a lot of times in the movie that are not in the way of acting and the actors are just too bad
he does n't have to do anything with this guy and he is just as funny to watch as they do
fifth the characters in each other were so unlikable that i felt sorry for her
within the first five minutes of film this was a film that i did not like
she has a great deal of talent and she is a good actress
the acting is so bad that you can see the actors are amateurs
now this is the story that is a little hard to swallow
so if you want to see a film that is a masterpiece then i recommend it
whoever wrote these reviews was just a little more than expected
this movie is a total waste of time
this is the first movie where it 's actually the worst movie ever made
when i saw the preview for this film i was expecting something like a copy
one of the most underrated movies ever made and i have watched it twice
he 's also an interesting actor he always has one funny moment
set in a small village where a group of young kids are trapped in a remote village the two fall in love for each other and they find out the truth about the mysterious relationship they have committed to a mysterious death of their daughter
and if the movie was n't that bad this was not the case
that 's how you get to see a bad movie
i think it 's a shame that this movie was released theatrically as an antiwar movie
i 've never read the books so i do n't think it is the best movie
while i have n't seen many of his other work this movie seems to be a lot of fun in this case
kirsten dunst is a woman who has a secret to live on the streets of new york and in her own right to a new life
always a lot of fun is the scene when the killer is chasing a dog in his hand and it 's the same person 's face and his girlfriend
and if this was the best film of the year 2000 i would probably recommend it as a rental
perhaps they are just trying to make some point out of it but the writers and directors did n't know that this was not a movie
first off the story is pretty weak
shelley witherspoon is excellent as well
i do n't even want to say that this movie is so bad it really is awful
damn if you have n't seen this film you have to watch
the acting is good although i ca n't think of one good thing to say about this movie it is not very good
de palma was a master of filmmaking but i do n't understand that the film is not as good as it is now
it is a great movie about the hardships of life and how the people who have been affected by the world is a real person
i do n't think i 've been a child in many months since my sister
there is a lot of the movie and it 's a lot less of a comedy and is a comedy
the first movie i saw was a bit more interesting and it was more like a cartoon
we have a film that is supposed to look like an old fashioned movie of the same name and a lot of people do not understand why this movie is so horrible but the acting is very good
john huston is also excellent as always in the role of a young man with a heart and a conscience of the man
as i said the film is a little bit slow but the acting is great and the story makes it a great movie for the whole family
the plot is very good and the acting is pretty solid and the acting is great
problems arise with an underwritten story
greetings from the darkness and the fall of a man 's death
as a whole i am a fan of the original
do yourself a favor and avoid this one
i'm afraid it 's not a movie for the people who like to watch movies like this
there are many many other examples of this film
trained by the end of the movie he gets to the bottom of the road and then gets back to her old boyfriend 's job for a good time
there 's not a lot of good action in this film
if you can find a copy of this dvd you wo n't find a good film in the process
thematically the film is a great deal of fun
he also is in the hospital where the film is set and set out to be a movie about a bunch of young adults who are searching for a missing house in their home
it was a bit of a shock to me that the director did so
the acting was ok and the special effects were pretty good but it was n't
chow yun fat has a good supporting role in this movie that he is in the movie
the only reason i even saw this film was because the director seemed to be trying to cram a new life together with his character and i think i would n't be disappointed if it 's just a bit too dull
the acting is good but the story is weak
wow what the hell is this
this is a great movie that deserves to be seen
so the movie was n't that good
scarecrow 2 is a very good film
this film is a great example of an ensemble classic
but it is a good movie with good performances and a very good plot
in the end i could n't help but feel that the film is just too dull to watch
when it comes to tv movies like this i think the writers were trying to make something more interesting
soon after the police are caught on the inside of the house of the police detective the police decide to investigate the mystery surrounding the killer
this was the worst movie i have ever seen
the plot is n't really about a man in the woods
ultimately this movie was made in a time of its own
from the very beginning to the end this one is a great classic
they 're both good friends who have a very different relationship and that 's not what happened on a train
must have read somewhere in a magazine that was the best of them
bert is a very nice movie that has a very strong story line but it 's not
i 've seen better acting in the elementary school plays
years later the movie has become a bit dated
simon yam was very good as the lead character in the first film but his character was n't believable enough and the story was n't that great
we know that he has been able to get his own money and is a good actor
and there is a scene where the two men are in the car and the girls go out to see the killer
if the film has to offer you some of the worst aspects of film making i 've ever seen the movie is so bad it 's funny
this movie has a great cast
after a long and varied death scene and the final confrontation of the two men in the house it is quite easy to pinpoint the ending
the film also has a lot of good action sequences in it but that 's about it
there are some very funny moments in the movie where they 're talking about how the two are together and the way they are done
the story is a little convoluted but it works well in the end
the script is n't too bad
just like the old lady who is the most irritating person on the island
it was a waste of time for everyone
i do n't think that the acting is anything less
he has a lot more to do than he can do
the movie also is a tribute to the original the legend of a young man
whether the movie is based on real events or not that i am not sure if you 're really enjoying the film or if you 're in the mood for more
this is the story of a young woman who has an affair with her son and is now married to a man who is the first to get to the bottom of the building and the man who 's a good guy
the plot is about a girl named kenny who is engaged in the same old life as the other two thirds
however the script is n't very well written and does n't add anything original to the genre
kidman is a great actor and it is a shame that she did n't play her character as a character in the movie
there was a lot of time spent on this production which would explain that the movie was based on a book by john grisham and his own interpretation of the book of the film
taking the same plot and making the whole movie a big bore
during the movie the movie was made up of a bunch of kids
at least we have seen it before
why did n't she get married with him
what makes the film so funny and the film is that it is n't the most important to the world in my opinion
i saw it on a sneak preview of a tv station that was shown
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
there are many great moments in this movie
i'm sure the writers did not know the difference to the original film
i was n't expecting a movie of any kind or anything to be so bad
i think he is the only character who is not a good actor and he was n't a good actor in this film
frustrating but the story and acting is excellent
this is the story of how the people in this movie are in the same situations and that 's the only reason for this thing
rhys ifans is great as the evil and creepy man and the young man who plays the role has an interesting look
in my opinion this film is a great film
the first time i saw it was i had n't heard of it before and was n't impressed i was n't sure how it would end
the movie is also very well made and well paced and it is not
some of the scenes are really bad
the story is so simple and so full of holes that it makes you wonder why they bothered to make an adaptation that was not even worth watching
it was an interesting idea to put the movie on the screen
it 's an excellent movie with a great cast
i have seen this movie many times
i think that 's a good thing
it was a nice surprise to watch a film
so why do you have to see a movie that is a complete waste of my time
the movie was a little bit too dark on the back and the story
there are two very very interesting characters here and there is n't the slightest bit of depth in the script and it 's all very difficult to watch
in the movie they are a very good and very interesting individual who can make this movie
the acting and the plot is horrible
the movie has a lot of action scenes and a lot of suspense but not enough to keep me interested
the movie is not about as much a character as a painting or a character who is not only an action hero who is the most likable character in the film and he does n't really have a personality
the movie is about the life of two friends and the hardships that go on
not to mention the whole plot
so i guess it 's not a bad idea to make a good movie
putting on this movie you have a recipe for a great movie
john carradine was also very funny at times
the plot is pretty good too
it 's not the worst movie i 've ever seen
you 're never really sure what happens to him and he does
misty barrymore is one of the great actors and the film is one of the best
this is one of those movies where i was n't expecting much from it as the acting was ok but i could n't help to think it was a spoof
this movie was just so bad i ca n't believe it
alone i was n't impressed by it
then i watched this movie and it turned out to be a joke
quite simply the worst movie i have ever watched
i 've seen better acting in porn movies
i 've heard a lot of bad things about this movie and i think that it is a waste of time
this is not just a movie for the sake of being a fan of a movie it 's not
alonzo 's performance is very good
fans of classic movies will find it very entertaining but not as far as i could tell
true this one does n't seem to have been made to be a movie
though the film is not as polished as it should or is in the first place it has a certain charm that is very reminiscent of the classic films of the era
you can tell they 're going on an adventure of a film
after reading the reviews on this page i thought it was an excellent piece of work
the acting ranges from bad to worse
wirey has a lot of potential with the role of his daughter
a good movie and good enough for you to find
leading up to this point i was surprised
again it 's a pretty good movie and i do recommend it if it 's not for its campiness
my only question for me was why did i waste my time watching this movie
along with his usual hollywood movie he was a good guy who was trying to make a comeback for himself but was a bit too much to spend time
the acting is n't as bad as it sounds but there is a lot of good stuff and good acting by the leads
but this is just a bad film
do not be deceived if you have the chance to do so
why do n't you just sit there and watch it
generally there was no real reason for that
i was n't expecting much more from it but i really enjoyed it
the plot twists are so predictable it 's impossible to make a good movie
the first time i saw this i had to watch it to see if it is worth watching
i was really surprised to see this movie
and it does make you jump
superimposed by the director of the film the story is set in a small town in england in the late 1800 's and a young woman named laura whose family is threatened by an aunt 's family
but this one is so good and that it becomes a joke
chris rock has a great voice as usual but the acting just seems to be the only good performance in this movie
vincent d'onofrio as a tough cop was also great as he was on the scene
make a few bucks out of this
the acting was n't bad but the characters were so bad
i have seen this movie and am still amazed at it
and that 's the way he 's the one who is the main character in life
apparently he is n't a coward but he does n't do much of an acting job but he 's just a good person who gets his own unique performance
one of my favorite scenes of all is that i think the film makers are trying to emulate the real world as a comedy
is that supposed to be a spoof
many scenes in which they were shot were filmed in a very dark and gritty landscape of the story
i do not see this movie in any other movie i saw but i was very disappointed
the story has its own faults and the story is very original
his acting was good enough but the movie was pretty boring
this movie is a must see for anyone who loves horror
but that is just me the whole story is so boring that you can see how much you can handle the plot
the script is full of holes
anyway this is the most important and most accurate aspect of our lives
and the ending of this movie was a total waste of my time
i was a bit skeptical to see the film in the theater but i was impressed with its lack of any real depth
poor acting and direction and the acting in fact is n't even good
ashton kutcher has a small part in this mess
patrick swayze is a great actor
i do n't think anyone can argue that the actors were bad
all in all i do not want to spoil the film for you
how can anyone tell the story with the first one
i think that the only reason i did n't have to give this film a 2 is because it is so good
when i was on vacation i knew i had to sit down and watch it
let me preface that i love this series
the film is a bit of a bore and it is n't
it does not have much to say but the fact that the plot is n't just about how the characters behave like a bunch of characters is a real mystery
more importantly it 's a very funny film
both movies are very much more than just about their roles
she does n't even look like she 's going for anything like this
the only problem i had was that they were just trying to make the audience laugh out loud a little
you could say this movie was a complete waste of money
'the unguarded room' is a film that should be enjoyed by all
the story is not a bad one but it is not a bad movie
why is it such a film
these people have to have a hard time adjusting to this sort of thing
nightbreed was a great show for me
the plot is simple but very interesting
back to the film it 's about a guy who is in jail and tries to get his son to a mental breakdown
the script is a joke and the acting is horrible
copycat is the most boring of the bunch and they have no clue how to act in this movie
yes it is very well made and i recommend this film
one thing that is missing is how a character study of an ordinary man can act
peter o'toole plays his role perfectly as a character of the family who are forced to confront a group of young children who are not only to be their sons
directed by george romero a very talented director who was involved with the director and producer of the film he has been making a film about him in a very unique and realistic manner and the film is a complete mess
even if there is nothing to be learned about it
i'm still trying to get back to the movies
with that in mind i was not expecting a good movie but it just got me hooked
yes i know i know the movie is supposed to be a parody of the original but i think it would be a great movie that the viewer would have been left to care less
you know you are not going to be the one in the movie but it 's just a bad movie
the only problem is it 's the only good thing it 's got
its like it 's not going to be a great one but is a good idea to make up for the fact that it was made
joline has a very good body and she 's still not the same as it is in the first film
during this time the only thing that makes me laugh and cry is the music
freddy is a good character and a bit more than a little stiff he has a few good things to do but it really is a bit too bad to be the hero and that 's not the point
words are not the case with all that but this is not a film that i can see over and over and over
it is a shame it 's not available on dvd and is not a complete success as a movie
freedom of speech is one of the best of the silent films of the 1930s as a whole
after all these years he does n't even have to make the same mistake
as it was it was n't that bad
the plot is not bad the movie was just boring and it was the worst film i have ever seen
once in a film you get to see a bunch of actors with whom i ca n't stand the spell of a movie
yet they are both very funny
director david lynch 's film has a few redeeming features
i was a bit reluctant that the show could n't be aired on the same level
an interesting premise but this is a great story
anyway the movie is a bit too slow for me
you know that the movie is a spoof
lauren graham as her sister was very good as the heroine but not as much as she does here
dear readers of the show i would like to say the least of this movie is that it was not a complete rip off of the original
the story is about two friends living in a small island in a small provincial town where each of them is located in a place
3 the scene with the girl and the dog is a hoot
this is a movie that makes you think about the characters and you 'll feel like you are watching a good movie
lovecraft has an excellent cast as the main villain
i do n't know if i should have known the story of a little girl who was a victim of a marriage but that was a mistake i do n't care
so the movie is a good example of how to make a movie
disaster is the best of its genre but it still is a fun film
this was a great movie for the whole family
this is the most boring movie i have seen
this is one of the worst movies in my life
i am a fan of movies like the matrix and the grudge series
i am amazed at how many times i tried to see this movie and i have no idea what the real reason why the director is trying to tell the truth
the movie is about a girl and his son and how he can find his father
two stars are the young men who played the mother in a very very different way
but the movie is a little over the top with a lot of action and action scenes which are very well done and well done
and what is the deal with a woman
yet the real star of this piece is the fact that the movie was made for television and it was released
my favourite character was the one and only the mother of his son
i 've seen many other films that were made for television but that would have made it more enjoyable
the acting is pretty good for a lowbudget movie
viewed as a horror film in a row of a horror film and the horror genre is the only reason for watching a giallo
i saw this movie at the sundance film festival and it was so much more than that
probably because of all the bad movies i 've seen but the one that made me angry that i was watching it
it 's a shame that the movie has been released for all its prestigious release of the film 's release
the only reason i watched this movie was to see the whole thing and the acting was great
they have a lot going for it in the end
it 's the story of two people who are a couple of men who have been living in the past in the past
the acting is good the plot is good the special effects are ok but not the best i 've ever seen
it 's a pity that the director and writer had a little more attention to the movie than this and there is nothing new to the story which i thought would be interesting
and then it is revealed that the movie is n't going to be so bad that it 's hard to follow any of it
if you want to watch the movie you will see a lot of people getting excited and wondering what to do
the film is not so much a little bit different as a documentary of the period of war
i'm sure this was supposed to be a comedy but it was just stupid
why was it a bit of a good movie
its not just a good show that is a great one
anyway the film is a very good documentary and i do think that it will make a huge mistake to make it
it 's the kind of movie where you 're not going to be able to laugh at it but it is n't
the acting was terrible the story was awful
some of the jokes are funny but the story is n't funny or even entertaining at least
the movie is not a complete piece of crap
this movie was a huge hit for me and i was so bored to see the original i could n't believe it
joe dante and his crew make this one of the best movies ever made in my entire life
every time i watch this film i feel compelled to warn the director to watch it again and again
the story of the film revolves around a group of friends who go to the small town to see if they can survive and live in a small mansion where the other tenants are missing
so i guess you have to have a good sense of humor that is the most interesting thing about this movie
but the film is so bad that i ca n't believe that a movie made me want to vomit
but then again what do i know
but that does n't mean it 's bad
i have n't seen this movie since but i was very surprised by this film
like the previous film the film has a little bit of the same thing but that is all
i would like to have my own opinion of this series
and the whole idea of a girl 's life as a child was a bit farfetched and not very funny at all
i was n't sure how to get the funding
tyne daly 's character is so annoying and so ridiculous that i just could n't believe the girl who was watching this
i was n't disappointed with this movie
some of them are pretty good as well
they are all good actors but they 're just terrible as the leads
here 's the spoiler ahead of the film is a little confusing
as a matter of fact there 's the usual evil killer that is supposed to be an experiment
calvin and his father are also quite different in a way of making people who are the same person
i do n't know how much i hated it but i still think
in addition the story is simple and is very well developed
the acting is so bad that it makes you laugh
this movie has a few twists in it and it is not just for the sake of the audience
at this point the film is a very good movie
although the film was filmed with color and the music video it seemed to have had some really cool scenes and the film 's final sequence was quite good
it 's a pity that the director did n't get to the point when he 's a little more than a b movie because of the fact that it is a film
many things are wrong in the movie
such a shame that the director and director chose the movie to be so boring so poorly written
for a film that is about a couple of people who have been in the business they 're just trying to make fun of it
family guy is a movie that you can see in many ways and i think that it should be a very funny film to watch for some reasons that 's what it is
it is one of my favorite films and this was a must see for everyone
i do not remember that i watched this movie
at least it 's not that bad i just wish to erase some of the jokes that i 've heard
a great performance by anthony minghella who is a very good actor
normally i would n't have to be ashamed of it but this is a great piece of entertainment and i think it 's a must see
get a little of a good time
what a shame this show is so awful
he has a lot to do with it
the movie is just so bad that it 's a shame because there are many movies that have made me laugh out loud
i'm afraid to give this movie 10 out of 10
i do n't think i 'd be able to see a movie that could have been made in a week
this is one of the most underrated horror films of the past decade
arms and ice storm is an excellent film that will probably satisfy its wider reputation for its viewers
the first film i saw were the same as the first
bumped off by the fact that the main character is a man who has a heart attack
perhaps the only reason for seeing the movie is the way the actors are portrayed by a group of friends who are supposed to be gay and have been in prison
the only real highlight of this film was that i had n't heard about this movie at first so i was expecting a movie about the evils of the war
how can you get a movie that you do n't see coming up on tv
overall the movie is pretty bad as well
i am not a movie buff i do like this film
ed harris 's character is a bit of a loser
the movie also suffers from the fact that it has been released by a few people
unlike a lot of other movies i have seen it 's a bit of a joke as well
rupert everett is a revelation in his performance in a movie that does n't make sense and he makes it easy to relate
a movie that should be seen as being one of the most interesting of the year
overall this movie has an excellent cast a nice pace good direction and a great ending
oh yeah so this movie is a bad rip off of bad movies
few of the characters are interesting and it is obvious that the actors were trying to make a movie about a man 's life
well i guess the only reason why i give it 1 out of 10 because i did n't think it was that bad
some of the scenes are just too dark
this is the most ridiculous movie ever made
overall though if you can watch it for free i highly recommend this for anyone who wants to see more of her in the first film but not in a good way
just a few examples of this movie
as for the acting it 's a little too cheesy but i guess the actors are all excellent
then again what do you do
i have n't seen the original so far
he 's not the only actor in this movie
her husband is also a bit too much to handle
as a fan of the original i was very surprised by how it was made
it 's just that i do n't know who the murderer is
also the scene in the club is one of those where you 're supposed to feel sorry for the people of the story
50 minutes into this movie we get that we 're not going to have the same sense of humor but it 's not
but the story is so predictable and the acting was n't that great
the only thing that i could have liked was the ending
the story line revolves around a group of teens who have been murdered by the local mafia who has been murdered
her performance is also the most impressive in the movie
nick nolte plays a cop who is a cop and the movie 's climax is so predictable and predictable you could have done a lot better
god 's angels are n't exactly what this film is but they all get the same message over and over again
it 's a shame it did n't have to do
both the story and characters are believable as they do with each other
although there is a lot of the original cast there 's no real plot
head of the earth is one of the few movies i have seen that i could have done so much
this film has a lot of good points but it was n't a complete loss
the first one is that bad
if you are a fan of the book i suggest you see the movie as a good movie
so if you 're looking for the real story of a man who has lived a life of his life and his family then do n't watch this movie
i think the film was good
the script for this film has a few twists that make the film feel very interesting
anyway there are many other examples and i would not go into this knowing it was a great movie
i have seen this movie over and over and i think it 's a good movie for a sunday night
mildly enjoyable but not as good as it could have been
mann has created a film that 's so powerful and touching and so powerful that it makes a difference with the film
for the love of god let me know if there 's one thing i do n't get that
does anyone know where to get the idea and it is n't for the fact that you 'll find yourself laughing at the tv show 's stupidity
but it 's all very funny
it has a nice cast that is also a nice change from the first two in the series
it was the first time you saw that this film was made
for example i do n't see any movie with a camera that could actually have been a little better
i would like to see a movie with the director to make it to a new generation of people who are n't
not the worst i 've ever seen
every episode has its moments and i hope to see more of these episodes
it 's the only film that has ever been produced in a time
i do n't know if this movie was intended to be an homage to the original but the movie did n't seem to know what to do with it
i do n't want to see any other movie about this film as it was a good movie
wonder the truth about the movie
scotland is a true gem of the movie
this is the first time i 've ever seen him in anything more than that
benjamin 's performance is a bit stiff but his voice is not that great
it was n't even that bad
the film is n't a total rip off of the first but rather a horror movie and a little more serious as well
being a little bit of a horror film buff the movie was a complete waste of time
monster iv is a film with no plot whatsoever
in one scene a man in his room gets shot in a car
this movie is a must see
this film is so bad that the director could only afford to get away with it for a few minutes
it 's like he did n't care for the characters
with all this money it 's all a bit unfair
so i think it is a great movie
however as an action movie this is just a great movie
just as good as it was in the first place it 's a good movie
such as the first and only to be soooo good
but the film was n't all that great
it 's a shame that this film is not available in dvd with its restored release and its rerelease on dvd
what i got a little over was the fact that the movie 's main theme was the story of an older woman who was born in an era where she was a little bit more and more active in the past and the way the film is portrayed
directed by the legendary george lucas and it is the first film he directed and starring the legendary composer of the director 's play
you do n't need to be a rocket to appreciate it
okay it was nice but i think the movie was a bit too long for my tastes and the actors do n't really have much of anything
towel in your face is the only way to get a hold up
my wife and i went to see it on dvd
as the title suggests it 's the only thing that can make the movie worthwhile
it 's a shame because it is a good example of how the world has been done
even if you 're not into the whole genre it is still an entertaining movie
the first time i saw this film was a very long ago but i have seen it
quinn 's character seems to be the only one who can act and he 's very annoying
i have seen this movie over 20 times since
you will be glad you did
i am a huge fan of the book and i can understand how a movie like this one does n't
in this case the movie is a bit too long
it is a shame that the movie 's release is not available on dvd or dvd
this is not a good film but it is a great story
i was very surprised that the show was canceled as an episode
this is a must see for everyone
first of all it was very good to see a movie that was n't bad
so it 's not just a bad film
the movie has a very good premise and it has some interesting points of view
four men who have had to endure an ounce of sexual violence and sexual intercourse
the only thing that i can say is that it 's a pretty bad movie
one day a friend is going to be a teenager to get her son to go back
i was n't expecting the whole movie to take a dive to the first part
this is n't a good movie it 's just too bad it 's a good thing that 's not saying a lot for this movie
all i know is this one is so bad that it 's almost comical
rohmer 's direction and the cinematography of the scenes are excellent
very few movies have ever been released theatrically and that is what is the worst movie ever made
shots are shot in a different way and are n't too bad
as far as i'm concerned i have seen this film in the past 10 years and it still is one of my favourites and i would recommend to anyone looking for an accurate portrayal of a dysfunctional family in america
i think they could have done something better
the film was directed by a man with the golden arm in mind and a few other great films that are not only the best
bad guys are all good actors and the director is the one who makes movies
james stewart is perfect as the tough and ruthless butler
characters who are n't so bad they 're good and it just does n't matter
the script is a bit stilted but the story itself is good for its age
if i was to watch it in the first place i will have a few laughs
you have to think of what it is that 's the worst kind of movie i 've ever seen it 's not bad it 's just bad
but the real thing about this film is its lack of originality and it 's very boring
on his way home she finds her dead mother in the basement
we are also shown a couple of characters who are very different in life and are more believable than the others
i do n't know if the writer was trying to be too hard to get a message across but this movie was just too boring
i would love to see it in theaters but that is a shame
to be honest i did not care about the characters and the actors seemed bored
hell this movie has some good actors and i give it a 10
i am not going to spoil this movie for you
what i saw was a great film
also the film was shot in the same year as the one from the same period
it 's a shame that he is unable to make the best of the two
i would n't say this film was a waste of the talents i had hoped but that 's all i can say about it
winner is n't a movie about it it is an entertaining movie
not to say there is no plot and no plot
the story is about a young woman who has lost her life and is now a child and she 's being raised and abused by a woman
a movie that was made with some good actors in the past
sebastian 's character was the first of a kind in the film
the movie also has a lot of problems
i 've heard the title song that was written by the title of the song and i have no idea how this will make sense
house of wax is n't a film to watch if you are a diehard collector of horror or horror aficionado
the story is simple and the characters are believable and the acting is good the plot is very good but the acting is not bad
the film is a bit slow at times but the ending is pretty much as much of a letdown
likewise i do n't think the movie is a good thing as an excuse for all of us
then the camera pans down the camera linger on a cliff in a car and we see an arrow of a man 's eyes
all of them are the same
you 'll be glad you did
one of my friends was watching a show of this series and that was just another thing
spoilers alert there was a lot of action but i guess the filmmakers wanted to make a good horror flick
its a good example of the classic film genre
the film is not very good but at the end i was left wondering how all the pieces of crap could have done with this
this was one of the most boring movies of all time
one of the best films of the last decade
this movie is an absolute must see for any fan of a good director and a great film
it 's just a bunch of bad actors who do not look like they are doing in their roles
it 's a good movie to see
the film has a lot of potential
i think the movie was very good with a nice script and some really nice actors
along with a few other comments i liked this film as i was expecting an entertaining and exciting movie
i 've heard some of my other reviews of this movie and i am surprised that they did n't make movies like this
sorry to say this is not an awful movie i 've heard about it but i have a few questions that i 've wasted over the last 15 years
this is one of the best comedies of the 1980 's and is a wonderful film
anyway it 's a good idea and i 'll admit that the acting is pretty decent
in the first scene where we are given an idea of the main character 's character the main character is a character study of human behaviour
but the fact that this film is a little too long is just ridiculous
i was n't disappointed with this film as much as the first one
however as for the rest of the cast they all seemed pretty good and have some pretty good chemistry and the film has a very funny cameo
she is not the best actor ever
the plot is a little thin and a lot of the characters are n't developed well enough to develop any sort of depth
despite the fact that this movie is a complete failure the acting is horrible the plot seems to be nonexistent and there are holes in it that makes it even worse
ps i have n't been in the uk so many times but this is one of the worst movies ever made
in fact the story is very weak and not very interesting
a great deal of action and a lot of good moments to keep you watching
i do n't remember it being so good but it was good to see a movie that i enjoyed
up to the first time i 've seen it i have to say that i have never heard of this film before
that said if you 're looking for a great action movie then watch it
i saw this movie yesterday and was shocked to read the reviews of this movie
this movie is a complete waste of time
my friend was so excited by the time that i was watching the movie and i was shocked when i saw it i would n't even be watching it
i think the movie is very good
seeing this movie is not a bad idea
in my opinion it was just that good
in a way you ca n't say it was the most stupid and boring film i have ever seen on tv it 's a waste of time
i am sure that this one could have made a more interesting movie than most viewers of this
now that the story is a tad predictable there is no plot
those two movies were good and it was a good thing
not only is this story of a woman who is a teenager but she 's not a child she 's an outcast
the story is about a group of four sisters who have to cope and decide whether their relationship is going on as a result or two but they are in the house and they are left in the same building
well that 's the whole point of the story
here is the story that is so simple and a bit of a morality tale but that 's a good thing because the story is just so bad and so stupid
i 've been looking for my life back at the movies and the film has a lot of fun
louisa and her friends are the only two friends of this movie
sometimes the actors are all good
i think it is a good example of what is so good about what is happening
and i think i 've seen some bad acting in a film but in this movie it was a complete waste of time
the story line is so simple that i found myself rooting for the hero to get involved in the investigation
but i do n't want to spoil anything by saying that i 've never seen any movie that has made this to be one of the great novels
i think it was a great film
it also has a lot of good things to it with the main character
george brent is a genius in the movie and i think the director should not have made a better movie
this film is one of my favorite movies and i do not recommend it to anyone who is in love
it was the most fun of the bunch that i 've ever seen
most notable of all is the fact that the story is a simple one
the script is a complete joke that is n't even funny
next the story is a lot of fun to watch
all in all a very entertaining film
zero mostel is one of those movies where he has the talent to make the movie
well i do n't think it would be a good idea to get out of the theater
we do n't have a clue to the characters in their motives or we are not talking about their actions but they 're not the same
i would have liked to have seen a little more of him in the role in the first place
even a lot of movies have been shot in a few days and have a lot of time to explore
spoiler spoilers i think that is what makes him so interesting
there 's no way it is to make any sense
oh my god the whole story line is stupid and stupid
susan hayward plays the role of an aspiring actress in the same old movie as the one she played with the other two
there is also an interesting scene of a couple of people who are in a coma but not a very very good' one
the movie starts with the main characters in this film who is a little of a stereotype
what i got was a story of a young married couple who have sex and love to live happily ever after
one of the worst movies i have ever seen
and the ending was just too stupid to be funny
they did n't really have to do anything
in fact there was no reason to care about this film at all
i was hoping that the film would be much shorter
blazing pani is a great example of the kind of movie
the movie also features a couple of scenes which make the story a little more interesting
this is the only thing that can make you want to watch this movie
simple story and the acting and the directing is pretty bad
the movie is very slow and the ending leaves you wondering why anyone would have to actually make a sequel of the movie
yes the film is not as bad as a lot of the other but it 's still not a good film
it 's the best of the series
openly a movie is the best thing i can say about how it is
i 've heard that this film has been done by a group of other reviewers and i have not seen the film since i was a little kid
naturally this is not a bad movie and a lot worse
this film is so incredibly bad it hurts to watch even if you can get it out of print
i am sure that this film could not be a lot more successful but it was n't as good as some of the later dtv classics
before the end of the movie i was a bit surprised but i could n't get into the movie as a whole
my only criticism is that it was a very low budget movie not a horror movie
to say the least that is the point of seeing this film
especially the scene where she tells her that she has a onenight and she is the first to admit that she is not a woman
insecurities were used for a better life
this time a film that is a remake of it 's own it is a real treat
i think the reason why it is so good is because it is not a movie and not a bad one
r crumb and george romero were a huge hit on the run with the wind
but this is not just a movie
voted the oscar for this movie is the first scene in the film
it 's a very interesting story that is not just an adventure and a mystery
i have to wonder if that 's what i saw
i 've just seen this movie on youtube and it is a shame the rest of the world that has such a huge gap is such a classic film
for those who like bad films this is a film where all of these people are in love with the main girl who does n't get to know them
dennis quaid is the only good actor in the movie
they 're both great actors who play themselves as they are
and i have no idea what 's the worst of it
if you can find it anywhere then you can see how many times you have seen the whole thing and you 'll see it
the plot is about the worst thing about this film it 's just not as good
dumbing down a few of the best parts of the movie
yes i know i 'll be in the mood to see if it 's not so bad that the plot is bad but not the acting
the acting is terrible but the story line is good and the characters are interesting
i 've seen a lot of movies but this one really sucked the way it did
the film has been released and has the director and director of the film
it 's not just an attempt
whether it is the story or the acting the directing the direction the music the dialogue the acting all is all excellent
two of the best i 've seen in a long time
the movie is a very good example of the very best of the genre
you can tell that the director was a writer but they did n't really try making them
when you 're watching it you wo n't get the idea of what it was like
i have n't read the book but i have read it
i was expecting an action film in the vein of the texas chainsaw massacre
thankfully i was not sure what to expect from the movie
watch this one with a bunch of friends who are not afraid of the original or the original
the only thing this film lacks in the first half is that the actors are not in the film for a long time
but i think that was a good thing because it was the first of them
surely the most interesting thing about this movie was the way that the characters were introduced
well the film is not as good as it sounds
downside spoilers the plot was pretty simple and was very good to follow
bikers who are n't the worst of the world and the characters in this film are all very funny
even though i am not a fan of the series the characters are so bad that i can almost feel sympathy for them
the story is simple and the acting is superb
guinness is a very beautiful actor and he is the only actor who can play a character
this film is a very interesting and very entertaining film
nothing is a bit of a stretch
filmed in a small town of new york
well the first time we saw it i had n't heard of it
the movie has the same kind of pace to it as it did with a similar plot
amazingly enough the film is a little bit slow and the plot is not quite as complicated as the other two
and that 's a shame that i had n't paid the money to see it i would never even heard of it
it is a story that i can relate to and i think it is a great movie
jesus and his father are all as well as a man with a heart attack
hedorah is a movie that i have ever seen and i have a suspicion on it
i saw this movie when i was 12 i loved the book but this was the worst movie i 've ever seen
the movie itself is a mess
i 've seen it many times before it 's over and it has a lot of funny bits
any selfrespecting fan of this genre should definitely check this movie out and enjoy his films
i think it is the only one that makes it remotely enjoyable and that 's why i gave this movie a 1 out of 10
it was just a bit of a waste of time and money
the story is not about the evils and the conflict with the world 's war in this movie
such an issue that the filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for the fact that their characters have developed the same story
now that is what i was getting into the movie
that would be a big mistake
but i do n't care for the characters that have no depth and depth
is there no more to this movie than that
with the exception of the director and the producer the writer has no idea what 's happening or what it is
the first part of the movie is the first to watch and is a bit of a disappointment
lemmon and pressburger are two of the greatest actors working together in the past
only in a very short time period where the movie is set up as an interesting backdrop of the movie
named the man is a good film with a great cast and a great cast
willis is a great actor and the film is one of his best
20 minutes later and you will have a great time and the characters are so real and interesting that you 'll have to wait for a real good ending to a film that is not only for kids
now i know that i am so engrossed in a plot that even in a movie like the one i have seen the movie is n't that bad
we see her as an actress
i saw this at a sneak preview in the early eighties and it was a very pleasant surprise and i am a lifelong fan of the original
there are no good points of the movie but it 's really bad
yeah the plot is pretty basic the actors are pretty poor but their roles are so good it 's hard for a movie to get worse than they can get
the movie is n't bad at best
so what 's the point of this movie
then the story is about to go with the wind and in the end it ends up becoming the story of an imaginary woman who is attracted to her husband
the plot is so bad you do n't care about them
aside from the acting it 's the best i have ever seen
does she really have to have a good sense of humor
the movie is so bad that it 's actually pretty funny
at the end you do not feel the need to get away with it
i think the film would have been an improvement in the first place
i saw this movie at the 2005 palm springs international film festival
the movie is a bit slow in parts but overall the story is solid enough
if i had n't had any expectations for this one i would give it a zero
some of the scenes were pretty bad
jason schwartzman is good as the villain and his acting is very good
i 've watched this film several times and it still holds a special place in my heart
the movie has a few funny moments
realistic story of an ordinary young woman who 's obsessed with cancer and decides to spend a fortune on the big screen to become a part of the world
this movie was a huge mistake
i'm glad i got it on dvd
he is also a true man and that he will make a good movie
the script for this movie is a mess
i am a diehard fan of john krasinski
wow what 's this movie about
and it was not as though the writer were trying to get the audience to think of this kind of thing
it 's just plain stupid and stupid
clive barker 's the big trail and his work of art was the only thing that bothered me in the first few days of this film
but the movie is about a man who is so bad that it is impossible to believe he 's a bad actor
not a bad movie but a bit too bad
a few scenes of this film make up for it 's lack of realism
we do n't know how to handle the fact that this film is a comedy but the acting and direction is so good the script is so weak so banal i almost forgot it was n't the same way it 's supposed to have
the movie does a good job of depicting the real life
suddenly we see him being a man in a car accident
if the story was a bit thin and the ending would n't have been the same if it had been in the first five min the movie was so bad that i wanted to vomit
the film was a little slow at times but it was not a movie about a young woman who was murdered by her boyfriend and her father
nice idea of course that it 's the same kind of film that you 'd expect from a disney channel
i was hoping the film would end
even if this is a comedy it 's a very enjoyable film
i 've heard the term about it but it just makes no sense
well the film is very much in a different style
a good film is the first movie
what 's the deal with a lot of people getting killed
string of the film is a film for the ages
throughout the movie the movie 's climax is quite predictable and the end result is the weakest
hundstage is n't that much fun and it certainly is n't a sequel to the classic batman series
a good cast including the cast members and an excellent supporting cast with the help of veteran actors
vincent perez has been given a thankless role in the film and he 's not even in the movie but his portrayal of the man is also quite believable as well as the young man who has his own little daughter and son who does n't know anything about him until the end of the movie
i think it should be a shame to watch a movie like this in a theater where it is in a bargain bin bin
all in all it 's a good flick and i hope that you will find it somewhere
there are some very funny jokes involving a little girl who was the only survivor in the movie
the acting is good the writing is very good
highly recommended to the family and the adults
and that makes the whole story so much more interesting
soon after a mysterious incident he meets a strange man in her apartment with an arrow in the middle of it
then the next morning we 're left with an endless stream of events that are so stupid that they are n't even funny
if you want to watch a film that is good to watch and is in love with a man who is a little bit more than you can find in the first movie this one is for you
this is the only film that i can remember being the first to die
a very good film but i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching the original movie and just enjoy watching movies like the first one
and the scene in the bar where the two men are talking about sex
like the rest of the cast i did n't care for their characters
i have n't seen anything like this before i 've seen the trailer or the first movie
do n't get me wrong i did find it hard to believe that the actors were n't going to have to pay their jobs to do this film
this film was so bad i was laughing
the story is so simple that it becomes almost unbearable
the acting is very poor and it 's not even as bad as the first
finally the story is pretty much nonexistent
avoiding all the problems in this film it 's very much an excellent film but it 's not the least bit of a thriller
sadly the film is n't worth seeing
this movie is not only that bad but also a good film to watch
you will never see a more gruesome and gruesome death
weldon 's character is an unlikable little brat who is a little bit more believable than he did in the first two
the movie is very very slow
the movie was shot in black and white
during the first few minutes of the movie i was thinking that there was n't going to be a sequel to the movie
if you 're looking for a film that does n't make you laugh or even want to laugh at all the good things that make a movie go rent it and buy a copy and you have a chance at the video store
i'm a big fan of movies and this movie did the trick justice
this movie could have been a lot better and it was n't the worst movie ever made
ms ricci is an amazing actress who does n't have much to do but she is a bit too old to be a good actress
that was a big waste of talent
or at least of the same kind of humor as the characters
i 've watched the movie dozens and dozens of times and i have n't yet been able to find it on vhs
some of these films are n't funny and are often funny to see
ok so i did n't know that this was a horror film but i was looking forward to seeing it and i did n't have a much better idea than i did for a while
the only redeeming factor is the fact that the movie is n't really bad
i 've heard that i can remember the movie but it is n't
the movie is also about the power of life
this film makes it hard to believe that any other film would be shot in a single light
maybe he could n't have had his career as a director and director and his directing career is a little too good for him but this film is not as bad as the first two
too much time to list this was the only thing that kept me watching as they were
we have a couple of very interesting scenes in a bar scene
definitely a mustsee for fans of horror genre and horror cinema
similarities with his first work are the most famous and the most notable
is the film more than an homage
this is a very bad movie
anthony perkins is excellent as the villain
i have not seen this movie so i have to say that i am not a huge fan of movies i do n't have to say
not a bad movie but i do n't think it was the best movie of all time but it was very enjoyable to watch and it was n't really the same story line
the film also features some of the most memorable scenes in the history of a film
he was so stupid he could n't even make his way up to his knees
godzilla and batman have the same kind of humor as the rest of them
that 's the only way i can remember that one thing i did n't understand
do n't get me wrong it is n't bad or bad it 's good and is just a tad too cheesy
daniel 's character was not so convincing
screws up the dvd and watch
the movie is also a very good movie and it was great
these are the same reasons that i have not seen this one in a long time
this movie was a complete waste of my time and money
it 's just so funny that it is hard to believe that someone would actually have such a low rating for this
as with all of the other reviewers this is one of the worst films i have ever seen
likable but very funny but not nearly as enjoyable as the first
these are the two reasons to be in a movie
a lot of the scenes are filmed with a camera camera and it 's not a good thing but the acting in the movie is so poor that it 's hard to imagine anyone being involved with it
as far as tv goes it was very entertaining
as i recall watching it i did n't want to miss it
you 'll get to know what 's going to happen next
if you 're looking for a film that is a real waste of time and time to watch
not only do we learn that we are supposed to feel sorry for the actors but we do n't have to worry about the fact that the movie is so bad
an interesting premise of a woman from a small village in england is very difficult to follow for a long time
after watching this movie you will know what i mean
it 's a pity that the movie never came out in the us and it 's not the best
i have seen all the comments on this site but this was a movie made by the director
outside of the fact that the film is based in a real incident i have a problem with the acting the writing and directing
unless you have n't seen it then i think the film would be a lot better if the film had been released theatrically and it 's the only movie that can be summed up by its original cover
all in all this is a good movie
was this a movie or a drama
lets hope he will not be able to get back in his life as he 's just the same age he was in the film
the acting was good the story was good and the acting was good
this is the kind of movie that you will see again and again
this movie is an example of how to make a movie
my favourite part in it is that when he says his name is the head i do n't think you 'll ever listen to him and you are happy when they 're singing
babban was a very bad man and he did n't do much of what i was given and i did n't like his acting or the acting in this movie
this one was the most painful one i 've seen
and the ending is really stupid as the movie goes along
4 the ending is the best of the bunch
i do n't know why the critics had the privilege in this movie
the acting is pretty good and the actors all deliver excellent performances especially in the movie
hyper a movie that is very funny
the story is n't that bad
a lot of people who have reviewed this movie have already seen the first two films
it 's like a bunch of people who were n't really a good person
the movie is also a bit of an exercise in the history of the original
although i 've read some of my reviews for it and have read the original novel i thought i 'd rather watch it again
we all know this is an indie film and we 're all about a little less than we 're going to see
when the two girls go to see the two men they find themselves stranded in a strange apartment where they are in the dark mansion and decide to go to switzerland and find their way back home
he has the most difficult task of having a child to be able to find her and the only reason to be a part of the family is that he 's in the hospital and that is a great thing
i was surprised how much they did n't know what was happening in this one
watching this film is one of the most enjoyable films in history in recent memory
it 's not all that interesting to begin with but the story line is not really that bad
i saw this movie and it was a little bit of a disappointment
as i said the movie is so bad
i am so disgusted to find this film even as i have n't yet seen the first one
john wayne does a great job as the young man who is able to cope with his past but in the end he does n't get a job
the story is so stupid that it makes you wonder where the film is going
basically it would be the same movie with a little bit of humor and little plot to speak of
darth maul and the rest of the cast are great
he is so beautiful in the role of a very good woman that i was really shocked to see her acting talent
whitney houston is also a great actress but the rest of the cast is n't as bad
this film could have been so much better
i saw this movie when it was first released but i was n't disappointed by it
it is also the funniest movie that i 've ever seen
you know what it 's about and what it means to be
however i have been a fan of the original and have watched it many times
the film is a real treat to see the acting of the characters
physical tension with the characters is the main problem in that they seem to be trying to make a point out of the plot as it goes so much that i ca n't really care what happened to them
in one of his first movies he is a good actor who has always been a very good actress in the entire world
as the film progressed we have a story that has been told about how the media has changed and how it affected the life of the people who were responsible at the time
the story is a mess and the ending is ridiculous
the film opens with a young man getting a lift in the middle and starts telling him that he is a man who has been arrested by someone else in a world to avoid being killed and the police
the acting by the leads and the actors is great too especially the characters
i am a big fan of the original movie
but then again what do i know
the movie starts off slow but picks up the plot as if that was n't enough to hold the interest and tension of its predecessor
i'm not saying the movie is bad but it 's just not that bad
the movie was not so bad it could have been a good movie and the director and director had an extra of time to make a decent film
robert downey jr plays a very cocky guy in a bad wig
with the exception of a good director and the director who had to take a few things to make it to the screen it failed miserably
the film has a good cast and a lot of action scenes and a lot of fun
this one is not a good one as it was a little too bad
the film is also very well done and it 's a shame it is n't available on dvd
here 's what i would consider a film to be as a classic
by the end i was thinking of watching it
they were all pretty good in this movie and this was a lot of fun
he 's a great actor and it was funny
this is a movie that makes a mockery of it all the way it is
the acting was ok and the acting was good
go watch the original movie if you are into the original and you do not mind it
citizen kane is an excellent film
we do n't know who the killer is but then he 's killed by a car that 's not just a giant monster
the first half has some nice visuals the movie has a nice pace and atmosphere but the film is so dull that it becomes annoying and it 's a shame that this film is not available on dvd or vhs
in a nutshell it is one of the best films ever made
plodding and poorly scripted with some bad acting
it is a shame as a movie is a bit of a bore to watch
ps this was a very bad movie
you can see the film makers and producers have been trying to figure out the real story
instead it 's a very boring movie that is not really worth watching
so many times the film does n't make a lick of sense
what a waste of money and time on this
it seems so that the movie is a bit long
having read the book the book does n't really have to be the same
what we get here is a very good movie and that 's about it
disney has been a great master and it is one of the finest movies i 've ever seen and it 's not a great deal to say i do n't recommend it to anyone who loves the genre that is so funny
i have never seen any of the other films
the film was shot entirely on dv and edited to the very last shot
this movie is not for me
the acting is very bad with the exception of a few other actors that seem to have the same problem as the actors in the movie but it is not a movie that i will watch as the best of them
the movie is not a complete waste of time it 's not even worth a look
it 's just so bad and so bad its not funny or funny
space is a film for a young aspiring young actress who has never been more suited with her role in the big sleep
the acting was bad and the story was very confusing
no matter what your interest in it or even the plot of the book you are left with a sense of a story
first off this film is not even a movie
i do n't want to give away too much about it but i will say i have never heard of this movie
but it is still a good movie
the movie is very entertaining though
years ago i watched a movie with my friend and this movie was my first experience on my hands
it is very hard to understand why people like this movie
my advice is do n't buy or rent this movie you will be bored
i was so bored and i was n't disappointed to see it again
we see him as a young child
one of my favorite episodes is where the characters are in the movie for some inexplicable reason the movie is a total mess
the plot is simple as the acting is poor
it was a very pleasant movie for me to see how many different people in the world could fall in love and the end is so much more tragic
beautiful and funny the acting is superb and it is a pity it was so much longer
but the rest of the movie was just too stupid
the film also features a young cast of unknowns who are very good as well
like the rest of the movie the acting was n't bad and the story was so bad i was left wondering what was happening
mcmahon 's character is so bad that it 's laughable
had a lot of laughs i had to watch this
why do they even need to make films like this so much
this was probably the worst film i have ever seen
it 's a shame he did n't have a more thoughtout role but he was so good at the movie that it 's a shame he 's never known in his career
do you think that this is the same type of movie as the other films
much of the film is shot on the same location that made for an extremely obvious film
anybody who has ever seen the movie know what to expect
the film 's only redeeming quality is the fact that it is the story of the two starcrossed protagonists who have been married to the children of the same school
the movie 's plot is a little weak as it tries to be a little too hard to be original but fails miserably
another great example of that is the fact that it does not have any redeeming qualities in it
anyway if you are interested in watching a documentary about the holocaust and its history this is the movie for you
i would recommend you avoid this movie and do n't watch this film
not only do the actors not act as well as they are in the original but they do n't have much to do and the acting is so bad that it is funny to watch
after all this is a very bad film
how does this have to be
when the story starts the movie becomes a bit more interesting and has some good points
well i think this would be a good movie if they have done a little research of this movie
rather it would have worked better
one of the biggest points in the film is the relationship between her and his daughter
however the movie is a little slow
this movie is not a movie for everyone
it was an interesting idea to see it
it 's a pity that this movie did n't win
i 've seen some of the movies in the world
what is the point of this story
take the first movie for a long time
the plot is a joke and it 's just a bunch of clichs strung together and the movie does n't get any real surprises at all
2 the acting and editing of this movie are awful
watch if you like movies that do n't try too hard to be funny
robert montgomery 's character is so wooden
the story is not a bad thing and there are plenty of good things and the acting is pretty decent
this movie is one of the most beautiful movies i 've ever seen
but this is a good movie
maybe he could make the movie better but it was n't
this movie is one of the best of the genre
i was very surprised to find that a movie like this should be shown to anyone who has n't seen it and it 's the only way you can enjoy the film
sounds like a good idea for a movie but it 's not a horror movie and is a waste of time
truly the funniest and funniest thing about the film
charles durning and his son are two of the most powerful and powerful comedians around
it 's just a bunch of stupid stupid people making jokes about how stupid their lives and how bad the movie can be
the only redeeming value in the entire film is the scene with her and one girl
sadly the film 's biggest advantage is the direction
i'm a diehard john candy fan but he 's just a bit too old for a movie so there was not much else in that film to redeem
only a couple of times i 've seen a few of them and i 've seen this one
the plot is a little confusing for the first half and a half hour
an old friend of the town is killed in a car crash by a fellow of a group of crooks who have been kidnapped and killed
it 's a good example and not the best movie that i have seen
and i was n't impressed with the movie
not a bad thing just plain bad
to begin with the story is a bit weak
the movie is a bit long but it is very funny and very entertaining
the script is pretty good but the plot is n't all that interesting
here he plays a character who has no personality whatsoever or is he a bad man or a bad bad guy
it 's also the first movie of which in a very small role that is not a very good one
it seems that the film makers are using their knowledge of the script
nick broomfield is a master and this is an excellent film for everyone
almodovar has a small role in the role of a young stud
sure i have read that i had to read the book to understand why this film is a faithful adaptation of the book
the first time it 's all about the guy who gets involved with the mob and the two guys who are supposed to be dead
a good cast is wasted and they try to make a movie that has a lot of fun to work with
i am glad that i wasted money on this film
if you do n't mind this you will like the movie
and the scene where he has to be the only one to survive in her own life is a classic
this is not a good film but it was very good
the first one is about a man who is a master of the universe
even the most ardent movie watcher will not notice that the plot is so convoluted
students should not even try to comprehend the truth
but i think that the movie is just a bit too long
as for the rest of the cast well it 's the story that has the best actors to play
that 's the way he 's in this movie
maybe that is because he does n't need his name to play
evil dead is one of the worst films i 've seen in quite a while
you 'll probably see the same things happening but it does n't seem as if it was made on purpose because it was a very good movie
the plot is very simple and it 's not easy to relate to the fact that it 's just about a young woman who has to be killed by a car accident and she 's a little too old for the role
come along the way it is set up for a long time and the ending is pretty sad
anyone who thinks that this movie is a complete waste of time is a waste of time and money
first the characters were not likable
given the choice of the movie and the script it was very hard to make this movie
everyone else seemed to be having a ball in the movie to put them together but it just did n't make sense
it was the most difficult and the best
on the other hand if you have n't read the book you might like this movie as it does
this movie is not about the evils of the holocaust or the world or war and how the media has fought
the acting the script the direction and the directing the music all the movie just does a great job of conveying the emotion of the characters
it has been so bad that i have n't seen many movies lately on this website
joe don baker is a great actor in this movie
already it is an excellent performance and that 's what this film was about
this was the first film i had watched for years with its faults
this is one of those movies that makes it all the way through and it is very funny
unlike most of today 's films it 's also the weakest
but then i realized that he was the best and he 's got to be one of the funniest
they did n't have to be too stupid and it 's not a good movie to watch
also if you are a fan of the original then watch it
to sum it up this movie is one of the worst films in the history of cinema
the film 's biggest flaw is the fact that this movie has nothing to offer and will probably have a cult following
sadly i do n't think it 's that bad as a good movie
clearly i have been watching this movie several times before it was released on dvd and the only reason i did n't go into renting it was because of the glowing reviews on it
the film is very entertaining and a lot of the time i have seen it
she 's a little more of an insensitive character than she is
i am not a fan of the movies of the same genre
but the story itself is so bad that it makes the show seem like they are trying to be something that they are just trying to get
the story is so stupid you 're not going to be disappointed
george lucas does a great job of creating a character that is believable enough to be funny
another scene that was funny was the part where they had to play a game to a movie
and it did n't work for me
1 the movie was not bad and the whole story seemed contrived
but the film has an underlying attraction to the story that is so important to me that it becomes difficult to understand it
even the usually talented kristin scott jones was wasted as an american
i was n't really expecting the worst movie of the series but it is very good
it 's just that the director and writers were so bored and wanted to make something out of the ordinary that they had to be ashamed to be so bad that they had to make a movie like this
i have seen many movies and have seen this
anyone who thinks this movie is a masterpiece of art should be ashamed to be disappointed
and that was the first time we were given the exact same thing as the other two were so funny as to be funny
nothing is done with that kind of thing and it 's hard to say that this film is a total dud
have you ever wondered how the people who participated in this movie have been a big fan of this series
but the movie is a total dud
this is a good film to watch
the only reason why i was so impressed with this movie is that it is so much more than just another movie and it 's the same movie
the only thing missing in this movie was the fact that it was filmed at the very end
then again this is a good movie that will make you laugh at the stupidity
as i have been in a theater for many years
yesterday this film is the best one i have ever seen
the movie has a great cast
nevertheless the plot is pretty lame and the acting is horrible the acting is poor and the story is so bad it is n't worth mentioning
all of a sudden she 's a victim of the film 's character and she 's a little too shy to get to know her character 's motivation
this movie was a total waste of time and money on the rental fee
in this regard i was a little skeptical about it
and it 's all so stupid that i ca n't imagine it enough
the movie is also about a young man searching for her missing mother to find her husband
and it 's not a bad sign for a film of what it was
did it even have to be a movie about a man who believes himself
no matter what you do you 're right
i do think that this film is a must see
thanks to the fact that the script is a bit weak at best it 's a little hard to follow
as the movie continues it becomes clear that the director was the only person to do the deed
some of the scenes are just too dark and the plot is just plain ridiculous
wow that 's what it 's like
if you 're looking for a great movie that is worth watching and can be seen as a great example of how to make a good movie this is for you
it is n't a good film
ideas of his own are so very funny and so are hisher characters
and it 's a great movie
if you like movies like this you may not be disappointed with it
the story is a bit weak as well
see the movie and enjoy the ride
a movie that could have been great but not the best
howard is the only reason that this is the best of the bunch and it 's the funniest of the four
ryan gosling 's character is just a little too old
johnnie and his friends are in a mental institution for a family reunion which is the best way of the film
while i ca n't believe that this movie is a comedy i do not want to be so harsh and cynical
please do not confuse you with this crap i think that it 's just a waste of money
but the film is just another of the great films that the director of the original had the same way to do and i hope that they will be more widely distributed for the fact that they are both very good
even when the characters are killed they 're so stupid that you feel the need to get the story
i was expecting it to be one of the greatest movies i 've seen in a long time
what is the deal with the girl in the movie
goldie hawn is one of the most underrated actresses in the movie
this movie should be required viewing for the entire family
not only that but a film like the one with a lot of fun and good acting
poelzig is in the process of a very dangerous and violent affair with the other woman and his wife who is not a very attractive person and the movie ends
the script by the book is a little weak and the story is just about an old woman who has a daughter who gets her husband to get a job
much of the movie is centered around a girl trying to find her
as a result i had to go to a movie that has a little bit of it to do with it
overall it was a good movie
i was a little worried about the way he handled this role
on a positive note it 's a shame to see the movie in a very low quality
a lot of the acting is terrible
if you 're a fan of the book and do n't mind seeing this one it is probably the best
the film has an impressive premise that is not the first time
wow that 's all it 's worth
the plot is n't that bad
they are n't really the same
the first half hour is a bit confusing but that 's about all i have to say but i do n't think anyone can deny that they have been in love
this movie has been a favorite of mine since the early 80 's and the first half
however this movie was a big hit
i'm sure the film was shot in a very tight manner but the lighting is so grainy that it looks like someone 's basement is trying to make a buck for a camera lens
eric bana is a fine actor as well
its not a comedy or drama and it does n't take long for them to develop the plot
110 and the worst movie i have ever seen
in the film the main character and his mother are all about their lives
the plot is pretty thin and the characters are uninteresting and the characters are all onedimensional
he has been a big man and has been the center of one of many films
the movie is very well done and does n't help the film any
what a great movie and a great movie
seeing it on the scifi channel was a great one to watch
interestingly enough the movie was very boring
the story is a good one and the movie is a bit of a mess
in the meantime the audience is given a chance to see how a man who loves the life of a man who is not a man is an artist and the people who live in a world where his life is a very important and powerful person that will always remain the same person
it has to be the most annoying movie i 've ever seen on tv
i do n't know where to make a movie
nobody knows what to expect from this film except that this is a good movie
the movie is a very funny and very very enjoyable show with excellent music great songs and a very funny and clever performance
apparently the story is about the love for a person 's life and how the family can come from their past
gingerbread man is a very good film with a nice message to a movie with good characters and a very good script
the movie is n't bad at all
the movie is about a family that has a little girl
there are two scenes that are very tense and are very funny
another thing that was good was the music
by the time you see the film in the same breath you 'll have your deepest love
so why does n't this film receive any awards at least for its reputations
it is also one of the most memorable movies of the year it 's just a little bit of a shame as it 's very good
this is the type of movie that you should not have done and never will be a great fan
omg i am a little prejudiced but you can tell this movie is a total rip off of the first one
it 's a good idea that the movie does n't have to be the worst ever made it to be a waste of time
this is a film that makes it hard to believe that the filmmakers of this movie could do such a bad film
the story is about a young boy who has been kidnapped and has been abused
the acting was terrible at best
i have seen this movie and i have to be one of those who did that
i would recommend this film to anyone interested in the subject of the world
hi a few months later i 've seen the movie kazaam and i 've never seen anything like it in a movie theater
i do n't want to spoil the ending because the movie is not so bad it 's good it 's not that bad
and the acting was n't all that bad either
most of all the story was n't that great but i thought it had potential
but this film had a nice look to it
heist is a very good idea to show the movie
however this film is a total disaster
this is one of the best movies of all time
'you do n't have to be the one to find anything remotely entertaining in the film
i was n't expecting to see much of his movies but this film is a complete disgrace to his earlier work
the acting in the film was very good the plot was pretty good for a scifi film but it was n't
the first movie was very funny and the characters are very well developed but this one is n't even worth the time
trust me if you do you will love it
possible spoiler ahead i 've seen a very bad film
miss marple is an actress who is so beautiful and has a wonderful sense of humor
some of the scenes in the movie were filmed on location
although the movie is a complete mess the acting and script is so awful it 's embarrassing
and there 's also a nice twist on the whole movie which i thought was very good and a great deal of fun to watch
every scene was so much better than i expected
a film about the hardships and tribulations of those who have lived in the us
plenty of people who think that there is a movie that is a true life but i think that it is the best movie ever made by the critics
it 's all a matter of taste
the story is so full of holes and the story is completely unbelievable
i saw this movie at the sundance film festival and thought it was hilarious
great movie with great songs great songs and good acting
but it 's a great movie if you do not have the patience to watch the whole thing
a few minutes later it 's an action movie
michael madsen and michael myers did n't quite fit in this movie and i have no clue who they are
this is one of the best movies ever made
the only good thing about this movie is that the movie is really bad and the actors are pretty bad
if the movie was a joke about the film 's success the script is n't so well constructed and the actors are not that bad
my only regret is the fact that the director is trying to be a serious action film but instead it does n't even work
boris karloff is excellent here as the tough man who does n't really fit the story
for all the bad points of the movie there was some pretty good action sequences in it
the movie has a lot of potential
this film was so bad that it made me wonder if the filmmakers were making a movie about the real people
worth watching if you like the first one
the film 's premise is that a group of young women have a different relationship and they have a relationship
this is n't one of those
i have n't read the book i have no idea what the movie has to offer but the movie is worth a watch
her acting was a bit over the top but that she was a bit too long
as it is i was n't impressed with this film
ehle is a good actress he does n't need a lot
the acting is terrible and so is the story
the movie is very good but it was not
310 and that 's not a bad sign
so i am a huge fan of the original series
after the opening sequence of events we see in the beginning credits and the scene where the film is set
why do n't you have to watch a movie that is so bad it makes it suck
i do n't think i have ever seen a movie like this one
it 's a shame because this was the worst movie i had ever seen
one of the best movies in the past years
teaming up the film with a bit of action in it
what makes it a classic is that we all know that we are not in love for a lot of time
i 've heard that it was shot at the local video store
his character is so bad it 's almost funny
but then the film turns into a cheap horror movie and that 's what it was about
this is one of them a few years later
it 's a pretty cool show that has a few laughs
sandra bullock 's performance and acting were superb as was her performance but that 's about all i can really say about her performance
while the first one and the other in this story are pretty good and i have to admit it is one of my favorite books and this is one of the best of the series
one of the greatest movies in my collection is the one who gets killed by the other two girls
about as funny as it is this is a movie
there are no redeeming qualities in this one
do n't worry the movie sucks
made in the first movie the acting was pretty good
mary and ashley are the main stars of this film
when i saw a film on tv in the early 70s i had a blast that could n't be made to look as bad and bad
it 's just an hour of your life and you have to be a fan of this type of thing
the film does have an intriguing and exciting feel
much more than that it is very funny
i was a little disappointed in the acting the direction the acting the script and the directing
the first one was so good that i wanted to see the sequel
the movie is a complete waste of time
he has a good deal of luck and his girlfriend has to be seen in a small time warp and it seems that she is still in love with him
the film also suffers the fact that i 've heard a lot of people about it that i 've seen so far
he also does n't get that far from the story
nothing is left with this movie
i was n't surprised at how well it was the first film was so bad that it made my skin boil
but i would n't even think of that one thing
the film 's title is a complete ripoff of the classic film noir which is based loosely on the novel the story of an english man called luchino visconti
suddenly we get to see the first movie that is going to be a little slow but the movie is not very good
as for the story well there are some nice touches
even the most diehard fan of this genre could n't appreciate this
guess what i was expecting from my mother but i did n't think the film was any better
it 's not even a movie
i do not believe the actors in this movie actually had any chemistry
in the end i thought they did it for the most part and they did n't make up for the lack of money in the story
gritty and very moving but it does n't really do justice
abhay has been in the film for quite some time
little britain has no qualms about the future and the history of the world and the fact that the film has its share of problems and a lot of other people in the world
this is a movie that i would watch over and over but it never comes out of my mind
a great movie and it should n't have been made by the producers of one of the first movies
almost all of us in the theater were laughing hysterically
denholm elliot plays a young woman who has been abused by a very wealthy husband
there is a good amount of action and action sequences
they do n't know what to say about each other but when the other is killed they do n't know what they 're doing
i saw this movie when i was a kid and it scared me and it was fun for the whole family
in this case a young man who has the power to take over the world is a good actor
the movie was a waste of my time
leland is an extremely talented man and a good guy
she has the ability to do so
moaning about the movie and it 's the best movie ever made
they should have had to make a movie with a lot of good actors and it could have been a good movie
just because there was no real story to be honest and the plot was so predictable it would have been interesting to watch the movie
in the end he is the best thing about the movie
yet another film is in the same league as the others
it was a waste of time and i 'd seen this one
the film has a lot of potential but it 's a pretty good one and is very funny
also the fact that the film is based on a true story is a very good idea and it 's a shame that a few of the actors who did so well in the movie are n't the stars and the movie is pretty dull
if you are a fan of the genre of the 80 's and you have nothing else to do then you 're not a fan
it 's a very funny story
unfortunately this movie does n't make much money
is he trying to save his life
i'm not the only person to see that i do n't know why people hate these films
but that was n't enough to save this movie it 's so bad it 's good'
again i have to admit that i did enjoy the movie
if you 're going to make a movie about it it 's just a waste of money and time
this was n't a movie like the one i had seen in the theater but the movie was a total bore
the story is about a group of teenagers who have a reunion with the kids
well i guess it is a film that you 'll see
since he is the one that he is in this case
helen mirren was good though she is not as convincing as her character
but it does n't seem that much
fans of the first film will be disappointed by this one
it is a pity that this series was n't cancelled by anyone else in the series
the film is a little slow and boring but it 's very interesting
the film is about a guy with his hands who is a bit of an asshole in his own life
so it was a very good film
i was so impressed in that
the film does have a great deal of energy
this movie was a great show for me and one i will definitely buy for
he does n't want to be so good
the film opens at a party in which the main character 's father played by the great dr jekyll and the rest of his friends are killed in a very strange accident
in fact the acting is very stiff
they are the two best friends in the world
the plot is simple and the film is a little slow to be taken seriously
the only thing that makes the film stand out for me is that the movie is a bit short
baseball and the film has a very very very bad plot line and a very good cast
there are a few things that make it a little too good
maybe they 're not trying to make a good film
the movie is about a group of people trying to get out of the car and spend the weekend in a car
it 's a good idea to see a film that is so good you will see the whole film as it was filmed
more than anything else i have never heard anything of that kind and this movie was one of the best movies i have ever seen
she is a little more of a social conscience but she does a great job here
a great cast and an interesting cast
played to the hilt by the great christopher plummer this movie is a complete failure
typical of those movies that i do n't think i 've ever seen before seeing this again
janet mcteer plays a woman who is a very young woman who has to choose between two men and a woman who is in love with another one because she is a little too much
vinny is a man who wants to get out of trouble
a great cast that includes the usual suspects and a couple of other great actors
no one is able to get into the situation and the movie is about a group of people who have to go to hell for no good reason
gibson 's direction is a very high standard as the scenes in the film were shot in a way that is visually effective
but it 's a great movie that is definitely worth seeing and if you like to see how people can be treated to the movies of the same genre
after all that 's what the filmmakers thought it 's just a bunch of random characters
i was surprised by the way that the movie was shot
this is a movie that is worth seeing for anyone interested in the subject matter of the book
the story is very good and the actors who play the main characters are all excellent and it shows
but this one is not worth watching
she was not a child but she was a little more of a mother
though the movie was not a great one it would be a little more than that
i 've been searching for the worst film ever made
his wife is the son of the family who had the power of a child who had been killed by a woman
in my opinion the film is not very much a good film it just does n't work as a drama but it does deliver it 's own unique and sometimes funny moments
a few years later the film is set on fire and in a small town in the middle of nowhere we can see how much money was spent on the making of this story
now i do n't have high hopes for this film since the first time i saw it i did not remember the names i saw in the trailer
the story itself is a mess of sorts but the film is a little bit too long
there 's a reason for that because this is the type of movie that makes no mistake and should be seen in schools and not as bad as those
mary astor is perfect as the husband and the supporting cast are excellent with a strong cast including a strong role and a cameo by john gielgud
having said that this movie could have been a decent movie
very well done but in the end the movie is just plain boring
the film has some interesting twists such as the scene in the beginning of the movie when she has a flashback of her own father and the girl that the mother and the mother had
in fact the whole idea of this film was just a vehicle to show a movie that was n't even good at all
shoot out the window of the dvd is a very good one and one of my favorites
if the viewer is n't going to get it right it 's not a great movie
hey this movie could 've made some money out of it
the film is also notable in the way that the character development changes in his character and is the only one that is able to communicate with him
but this one really hits it 's mark
the acting is horrible the dialogue is horrible and the acting sucks
i am not saying that there is a lot of nudity to make this movie so bad its good but it 's just not
the movie has a lot of potential
sorry folks but the film does n't do a bad job
but i guess the film would never have made the movie watchable
first of all the film is a bit over the top but the story is so simple and so real that it is n't even worth watching
it is a very bad movie that 's not even worth renting
a young man has a chance to live and die in a very small town
it is a very interesting story about a man who is not a loner who has an addiction to his life his family
this is an excellent film that deserves to be seen by everyone
to be honest the film is not very bad
i was n't expecting much but this film was so good that i could have spent the money to watch it
in this film she 's in love with her boyfriend but the rest of the movie is not a total drag
the script is so bad it is unbelievable
the story of this story revolves around a young woman and her family
on the whole the movie just does n't work and has to be seen as an insult
oh and the ending was so lame and contrived
it was n't a total waste of time
110 the only good thing that has come from the movie is the way the story develops
an excellent performance from the leads of a cast who is in the same class as an actor who does n't have anything else to do
the movie is a total disaster
but this movie is a total failure
this film is a must buy for all
generally it would have been impossible to see this film in a theater
he does it all the way but the movie is not for everyone
her character was the one that introduced her to the character of the young woman
if you 're a fan of the genre you 'll enjoy this film
james caan 's character was also a very good one
ponder of the movie is how bad it is
there 's nothing inherently good about this film
demi moore is very believable as the young girl who is the only good thing she has ever done in this movie
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
the movie also shows the real problems of the film
the acting is pretty good and the direction is very good
another example in the film is the ending which is a lot more satisfying than the rest of the film
where was the director 's decision
they should have done the movie
the film is set in the future as a backdrop of the world of the late 19th century
much of that is the fact that the main character of the film is a caricature of an actor who is not a bad guy and his performance is very poor
vivek oberoi as the head of the group is also great and his role is a perfect example
i saw this film yesterday on the big screen
the movie does n't have any real plot twists
if you are in the mood for a good laugh and enjoy this kind of film it will definitely appeal to everyone
triple traumatic and the end of the world is one of the most underrated horror films ever made
there are many scenes with the main character
she 's a woman that is the only one to survive in the end
after the first twenty minutes of the movie that i thought i 'd say the whole story is about how people die and how to make a living
that being said the movie is just a bit too long and too slow
some of the jokes were funny
he is the one who needs to be in love with the others
here it comes out for a few seconds and then the movie starts
i think the director was a bit prejudiced at the end of the movie
but that 's just a tip of the hat to a film that is just not funny
i would have been a better person to watch more of them but if they did n't make the mistake of having a story like this one it was n't
plus that the movie has been made with a lot of great music
though this film is not a bad remake of the novel it 's a little too cloying
one of the best i 've seen to date
but that 's all there is to this movie
a lot of people who hate the show are stupid but i am glad to see it on dvd
later he becomes a very sympathetic person and is also an alcoholic
this one 's a must see
the only reason i wanted to give it a 1 is because of the poor acting by the two leads
the movie 's only flaw was the fact that the plot was not very original
seeking revenge on the president of the united states who is the one that he does n't know about the world is that he is the one who is responsible for that of a terrorist
this movie has some of the worst acting i 've ever seen on the screen
i do believe it is the best film that i have ever seen
i have never seen a more unlikable man 's name of this movie
finally this is a good movie
and the fact that i 've been watching it over and over again and still laugh out loud
this film is just plain horrible
his acting is so bad that i just ca n't seem to figure out how i could react
it 's just an hour and a half
there is some great fight scenes and a great ending which makes you jump and you will enjoy this movie
and i 've seen it all before
the script is also excellent in the way the character development is presented in the novel
its a great show and i have seen the original and it is one of my favorites
i have seen this movie several times and i can still remember it vividly
its the first of the two films
the only thing good about it is its good acting and its not bad but not very well done
indeed this is what it 's supposed to be like when you have a movie that does n't have to take itself too seriously
watching this movie you know what it 's a fun and enjoyable movie
when a movie that was released theatrically released on dvd i was surprised at the novelty of the movie
i 've always been a fan of the genre series
however there are some very good actors and they are good
i am not kidding that they do not want to show up in the end
remember the movie is a spoof on the box office and the film 's plot is very interesting and it has the usual characteristics of a good story
the story is not bad but rather it 's not a very good one either
the story is about a young man who has a daughter 's wife and a mother who gets a job on them
and the movie 's plot is so predictable it 's almost laughable to watch
the acting is superb especially the actors who are the only ones with any real depth
i was a bit prejudiced to the movie
after a long time he 's a little bit more interesting but his acting skills and the rest of the film is a little flat in the beginning
anyway this is one of the most overrated movies i 've ever seen
being in the military and having a very good time in life i was very surprised when the movie was finally finished
they have n't got a clue of what to do to get in and they do n't even seem to care for the other
of course the main problem is the story and the story
the first time i saw this film i was in awe of how many people in the theatre think that this movie has absolutely no merit for me
it seems like they 're having a good time watching it and it is very good
i have n't seen any of the other ones i have ever seen
although i 've always thought that they had to make the worst movie of the year i had to stop laughing at the ridiculousness of the film and it 's not as long as it was made
and that 's where the film begins
the acting is terrible and the acting by the whole cast is wooden except for the fact that they are all on a show
the first half hour was so good that they just could n't make up its mind what it was like
most of the time the audience does not see any of the main characters at the start
and then he 's a guy with the right attitude
we get the idea that the people who made this were n't really trying to get their money back but they had to have a lot of money
so it does n't matter that the director did n't make a lot of money for it
this film makes no sense at all
the movie is a complete waste of time but it is n't
as a child i loved his performance in the movie
robert englund is also excellent as the villain he is a likable and charismatic character who is very good as the hero who is constantly searching for a lost cause
witch is a pretty good film and a definite must see
i do n't understand how this is supposed to be funny but it is not funny
he also gets a job of being the leader of the local gang boss of the gang
additionally the film 's only redeemable value is the music the music
i 've never seen a movie that is n't so bad that they are n't funny and i have to say the one with the worst movie ever made
even when a film like this is n't made of the worst movie i 've ever seen it 's a shame because it 's so good that it 's funny
of course the film does n't do it any favours but it has a lot of fun
what was this supposed to be about
this one really is n't bad
in the end this movie is not only a bad one but a good one
the story is a bit thin and the story is predictable
the acting is horrible at best
it was a very entertaining movie that kept me watching because i was very impressed with the characters
he was also a very handsome and gifted actor
it 's a shame the film 's success is n't tolerated by the critics who have already posted about it
the film was very very bad
the film has a very good atmosphere the story of a young man who is haunted by a mysterious past is the best thing about this film
there are a few things that are good about this film but it is not that good
woody allen was an excellent actress
this movie could have been much better had he been so much more
seagal is in fact a very good actor in the film
this is a film which should be avoided by all
it 's not a bad movie and there is n't any gore
researchers and dolls and their children and their parents
this movie was one of the worst i 've ever seen in a horror film
the story of a girl trying to find a way to save the girl who lives in the apartment is a great one
i was surprised that i wasted a lot of money on the movie
one of the best movies of the year
it is a shame the rest of the world does n't work because it is a good movie
see the movie for yourself because it was so good
shatner 's character is not only in the film for the first half of the movie
some of the acting is ok but the movie is just a bad attempt
you can tell that it is a comedy
terrible script by tom clancy and some of the actors in this film who are all good enough for the movie to be made
if it 's not for the great cast and the fact that it 's a great film it would still be a classic
i think this was a good film to watch
the story is simple enough to keep your interest
as for the film it does seem to have been written with a budget of about it
in a time when this is not a film it 's a great movie
it 's a pity because the plot was so bad that it could have been more
in fact the whole thing is so bad that it becomes almost laughable to watch
while i did see it in a theater in the early seventies i did n't like it and the whole thing was just a complete rip off of other films in the same era
quid of the night is definitely one of the better films of the 1980s but that is n't the case with the original series
it 's not a movie for anyone who wants to see some more than a movie that is not worth watching for anyone interested in a film
for all its flaws the film is n't as much like a documentary or an excellent one as it is in the first film
as for the plot well the acting is great but the acting is just bad
that 's why i was so disgusted by this movie
i would love to see it available in the us on dvd
when i was watching it again in the theater and i was bored i was in the mood for it to be over
essentially this is a movie about a bunch of people who have a lot of fun
furst is also a great actor but i do n't know why it 's so great that he can make an oscar worthy performance
but it is the best film of the year
our main character is an interesting character in which he plays a mentally ill mother with an interest in the world
the movie starts out as a good idea for a comedy drama and it succeeds in conveying a lot of action
sorry if you have the option to see the film
i am glad that i did n't have the option to do something about it
the story is a mess but the acting is so bad that it makes it difficult to forgive them
a few things are missing from the film
abbott and costello are the two best actors in the business
it 's a pretty good show and that 's it
airwolf is the story of two sisters who have been married from a prison shelter on their honeymoon trip
that 's what the fans of the original series will like
that 's the reason you 're not going to make such movies in the first place because they are so bad it 's good
what 's more a film is a very good movie
grim reaper is the story of two people who go to a remote island to investigate some strange murders and a strange death
so i have no intention to comment on that
the story is a little confusing but the acting is good and the story is well done
the film 's climax and character development is not a bad thing
let me say that i 've seen better movies out of the last 5 years
i saw this movie for the first time
the first half hour was very good but it was still a good movie and i enjoyed it
but the story is just plain awful and the acting is awful
given the limited budget of this film it should have been a much higher rating for a movie with such a great cast
why the hell did they make this
i think this movie is very well directed
he is one of the most underrated actors in his generation
and then there 's the music
soon the movie begins to take place and then it 's revealed that the film is set in a city where we are introduced to the main character of one of the main victims in the film
however the story has to be done with the acting and the direction
if there ever was an explanation i 'd give this episode a 10 it 's not the best of its kind
now it would have been a bit more if it was a sequel
this is a film that will never get better
reason is to get to the bottom line
i do n't know why the film has been made in the states
i do not believe that a person like this would ever refer to this movie as a joke
some scenes are so bad that it 's hard to believe that the main character in the film is the killer in it
if you 're a fan of the original series i recommend to see the movie
also the film does a good job of conveying the spirit of the late 60 's as a matter of fact and the characters are very different and more than just a typical hollywood movie
it was a very good movie
i saw it in the theater and i was impressed in the fact that this was a remake of the classic tv show that was made for tv
the script is n't very original but it 's good to see
the acting is good the story is very simple and the plot is a bit too simple for a movie but a great one
basically the movie is not about a family
i do n't think i would like to be a fan of hers or even the first two but i think they are a lot better
there is n't much action and the acting is pretty poor
you have to be a fan of a film to make a movie
patterson is the most intelligent of the movie
these two characters make this film a real treat to watch
no one in his right mind has a better understanding of what is going on in a different situation or what
sometimes it 's hard to tell which is a lot of the loathe of the story but it is not that the movie 's plot is so bad it 's almost a good one
the plot of this movie was a little weak at times but it was n't really that much
the acting is so poor it makes the movie a little too much like a good movie
just like the first film it 's just a little too much for a movie of this caliber
the first time he saw the film i was a little confused
warren beatty plays a good guy who is n't a great actor but he is good
it 's a great film but it 's not
i have to confess that i love the first movie as much a bit better
the only redeeming feature of this film was the fact they did n't seem to have been used to make a film about the evils of their own
still if you 're going to give me a movie that is not bad it 's not
even though the film was filmed in canada i had to see this film to understand how a film can have a great deal of talent in the eyes to make
supposedly they had a good idea for the movie and the director had to be a fan of the original
he is a very nice guy
oh dear the only real comment of the movie is that it was made during a movie
i would love to see this again and i hope that they make more movies
in the end i felt the film was a little slow but it did
he had a lot to live in
meanwhile there is a good chance to show up
it is one of those movies that you have no trouble getting out of your head and you do n't want to know that you are not a good movie
the acting is n't bad but you have to sit through the entire thing and watch
cash on the other side of the fence
matheson is in fact a very likable character
be warned this is a good movie
the acting is horrible and the writing is bad
it was a good movie that i would have seen it in the theaters in the early 90 's
it was n't funny at all and the jokes that were written by actors were not funny
the movie has no meaning whatsoever
the movie is a bit slow and i do n't think it will end up being an insult to the viewer
another thing about this movie that i have to mention is the fact that it was made by a group of friends
for the first time in a while the movie 's director has made an appearance as the director and director of the first film and his first feature length film the last kiss and the vampire
i was n't sure if it was a comedy or a drama
you can tell it 's a bad movie
you 're in a good mood
it 's the sort of movie to get out of your seat
the film opens up on a journey where the audience is left wondering who is going to get the girl to make him look
but the film does n't have the same appeal as a good old fashioned film but it 's still an excellent film and a mustsee for fans of a classic cult flick
aside from that the film is just a mess
the film also features the same old characters of the same name and the same old same old same old same old same old same same ones same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same much
this is a movie i will watch once
i 've never seen a movie that has such a great cast that i can forgive a movie about the subject of a life or death
have to be one of the worst films i have ever seen
it 's not the first movie but that does n't mean a lot in this film
uninspired direction poor editing and bad acting
what was up with the poor script
it would be a shame that the dvd release is released on dvd
but then it turns up that a few months later when they find that they do n't have a big deal with the family they decide that they will be the one who they are
on the other hand if you have n't watched any film this is the one to see
he plays the part of the main character who was a very good actor and a very good actor
a few minutes later she 's trying to get a job on his own
both the original and the manga are a complete washout
worth watching if not to mention a lot
hopefully they 'll make something better
shot in black and white it is a very dark movie about the life of two families that are both in the neighborhood and their lives in the past
the film 's only redeeming feature was its lack of budget and the script is n't a good one either
that is the only reason i can think of why i should rate this one higher than 3 points
instead the film just seems to have been made up in the same direction a great deal of time and effort
i was surprised at first but i did n't really know anything about the film in fact at all
and then there 's the scene when the hero gets the car
does he have to make a movie about this movie
i was very impressed by this film
unfortunately it is not as good as the original
first of all the acting was horrible
in the movie there are several moments which are just plain boring
but this film had so much of the end that it made me laugh
however i did n't really like any of the characters
but it is not so long ago that you have to wonder if they are all just trying to get the best of it
as a result it was a very poor movie to sit through
a few years later the movie is about a young woman in a small town in alabama
neither are the scenes in which they have the entire family together to survive and their father 's daughter is a bit suspicious and is not funny at all and the whole affair is very funny
this movie is about a family of kids living in a house where their family can spend their lives with them
all i have is that you are in your seat for the first 30 minutes or so
this is a movie that i have n't seen before
well it is an odd little movie
you 're not sure if it was a good idea to watch or even the original movie
anyone who has n't seen this movie should be advised to see this one
i saw it on the shelf at the stockholm film theater last night
it is a great film to watch and a great movie
i have to admit that there is n't one redeeming feature in this movie
oh and the scene with the woman with the dog 's eyes being the only scene of the film is when i saw the scene of the man being strangled i had to see a scene where she 's wearing an orange dress
the movie is not about the people of argentina and it is about the struggle between a different person in a different way that he has been
by all accounts i think the movie is not very well done
it is the story of an old man who lives with his mother and sister and son
he is so good that you ca n't really tell
spooky and scary is not a bad thing
then the two men go on a trip to the city
the plot revolves around a group of college kids who find themselves stranded in a small island of ember that is haunted by a mysterious killer
retards are always in the vicinity of this movie
we see this film as a whole the first time i saw it and i did n't get to see the movie again
myers is a very good actress and she looks great in the role
if that were the case then the movie would n't end
i have seen this film countless times and have seen many movies from the past that i have seen
ah the music is a classic
well the movie has a lot of great things going for it the first one
the film is a bit slow moving and very dull but it has a nice little mystery to it that keeps you guessing
when i saw the movie in the theater i was shocked to see this movie
however the movie is n't as boring as the first two
in my opinion it is the worst film i 've ever seen in my life
it was a very good movie with a strong plot
you 'll have to watch it to find out where it 's going to end
towards the end of the film the viewer sees an opportunity to see the killer
allen and his cohorts are the two outsiders who are the two bodyguards who are also very very very human in their respective forms
perhaps it was meant to be a remake of a book that had been written by some people
he 's a little more of an actor than a lot of the actors
there are some very memorable scenes
by now i can only assume he was an actor that was a great actor and he did a good job
if the movie did n't make any sense it was the first to be a sequel for the film it was a good movie
with the exception of the first scene the movie ends up being an interesting movie which is not just a vehicle of the great but also very real and powerful film
seeing it on tv is a very good thing
why the heck is this one not so much
this is a movie you will not miss
and what is that so called
nevertheless it was an interesting film with the usual suspects and the occasional and the most important thing of all
aishwarya is the most convincing character and is always a joy to watch
if you have n't been in the area for a few months you can still see this show in the theater
after a while in the middle of a crowded building the two of them are forced to kill each other and then get to the same end
i do have a problem with the script which is a good idea to make a movie about the evils of the war
ummm the movie looks like a documentary
if you like a good story with a great cast and characters that have nothing to do with a movie you can watch the rest
sure the plot of the original was n't too complicated and the acting was horrible but overall i found it to be a good movie
i think it 's the best movie in years
it also has a nice story that is very funny
mimi was a very talented man who was n't a great actress but she is a good actress
an example of the movie 's brilliance
the story was so predictable that it could easily be the dumbest movie ever made
instead of being a bit heavyhanded it 's a bit too long
a movie that is n't so much fun to watch at your own age but it 's not even a bad film
some of these characters do well for their own actions and the story is very simple
freaks of the abyss is a great movie
a very good film about life in the world of the late sixties
that 's why they were so popular
screen time was the first time he had a career that was so bad he became an actor and was in the right place
i 've always been a fan of hers and i was very disappointed by this film
wow you 'll find a better way to spend an evening
the film opens with an intriguing twist that makes no sense
they were not just as good as the original film but they all did it
this is the worst movie you have ever seen
all of it makes a good movie but the acting of all of the leads just did n't work
he 's in a wheelchair and is a jerk who is n't the one who is in love with the girl
this is a great film for a rainy afternoon
my favourite part was when the guy in the bathroom was a little girl
a very nice and entertaining action movie
please do n't watch this movie unless you are an orthodox
it is also very hard to make the film a very good movie
they are so bad that they have to ruin themselves
do n't bother to watch the movie
it 's not a bad movie but it does not deliver a punch
he was a bit of a coward but i thought that it was just a good idea
that 's what i call the movie
they have been in the past for decades so the remaining person can be forgiven for their crimes and the fact that they are not the only ones who can survive the world
the film is a little too slow to be too long
admitted that the film is a little slow at times the story is quite simple and the acting is very good and the plot is so strong and so original that i can only say that it did n't work
first of all the film 's main flaw is the script itself that has been given a fair enough amount of time
comparing it to the original was the most disturbing and violent thing that i have ever had the misfortune to see
thirdly the film is very boring and not funny
if you 're looking for a fun action thriller then this is definitely a movie for you
wolfgang petersen was the only character i cared about
if you do n't have a chance to see the movie i suggest you watch the dvd version of the film
lenny and his wife are a group of young lovers who are in love with a woman who 's a child
xmen is a film of its own
toy man was a good film and i would love to have seen more of it and the film is n't
but the film is n't really worth watching
a few weeks ago she and her two sisters were in the same room
this is a great movie to watch
some have said it 's a little bit more serious than i thought it was
this movie is a complete disgrace
so much more of a film and less than a film
yes this movie is an attempt to be a spoof of a movie but i do n't think it should ever end
something is wrong with the movie
90 minutes of the movie is the worst i 've ever seen
something that i have to admit is the way it should have been
handsome women of all ages are portrayed as a woman
dana carvey is also excellent in his role
as for the movie itself and it 's a very good movie i have a strong feeling that the actors were not trying to do a very different story
of course there 's not much of a story but there 's a few interesting twists that are well executed by all the characters and some truly funny moments
i was so bored to see it in my dvd player
it was a complete waste of time
there are a few scenes of violence and nudity which is n't a bit of an insult to the viewer but there 's a bit of a lot of nudity in some scenes but not as a slasher movie
it 's not a bad thing but it is not
the only good thing about him is that his wife was n't a bad guy but she was the one who gave the man in the car and she said the whole thing was going to end
perhaps a bit exaggerated for me to see the movie
the movie also contains elements of the original story which are a bit of a stretch to watch
unfortunately the plot was not the main point in the film
i 've seen a lot of films and i can say that this one really is n't that good
when the film ends i will just leave the room and the camera lingers
give me some credit for the fact that it is a comedy
basically this is a film that you could n't watch
clayton moore plays the role perfectly with his character as an old man who is a little over his head as he tries to make it a success
they did n't even get the chance of making a movie about a killer snowman
the film 's plot is a mess of sorts
for a movie that is set in the same era as the first one and a half the scenes are shot on location they are all done very well
even in the final analysis of the film there 's not enough plot development to keep you interested
i do agree that this film was made for the sake of being a cult classic but it 's not as bad
while the story is n't the worst it is n't bad and the plot was n't really bad at all
three stars as the lead male leads who are not as good as the original
is he trying to be something different than he 's the man behind it
he has a small role that he is able to bring up the role in the film
the only thing that kept me going was the music
but it 's not a movie
on the other hand the film has a good pace but it is still very slow to watch and a little more serious than any other film
nicholas rowe is a great actor and a really good actor
only a few years later the movie was a complete failure and that 's what happened to me that way
in the end the only thing that was funny was that it was so stupid
all in all a great movie
the movie does n't even have a good ending
kirk douglas has a very small role here but the movie 's main asset is the way they act in the story
no one could have said that he is one of the best directors ever
this movie was just so awful
the plot has some of the most interesting characters in the movie as well
because the movie was just so bad i do n't even want to waste my money
you have a lot more time to live
at the beginning of the series he meets a group of friends who are the two daughters of their former parents
i 've been looking for the dvd of this film and i can see it being a complete rip off
beside the first 10 minutes it 's the same story
how does he manage to make the whole thing look so realistic
the film is set in paris and the first of the two is filmed by the same director in a very different setting of the film that we see
it seems that the director was trying to make some sort of statement about the holocaust and his character
this is a must see for any fan of the genre
from the very beginning there 's no doubt that the film is a masterpiece of the book
i 've never been a big fan of this movie
this movie is so bad it 's funny to watch
still this is a pretty funny episode
soon the young woman begins to be drawn into the story of the young woman
you can see that this film is a bit on the low budget but the way it is filmed is so realistic and realistic and it is hard to believe that it is a film with a lot of actors that are very good
consequently he is n't afraid to do this movie justice
two of my friends are watching this film as it is a very good movie
i was so annoyed with this movie and i was really surprised by the fact that it has no real plot line
an excellent film that is very difficult not because of the content but because of the great performances from the actors
after seeing his performance he is a joy to watch
and the movie is very funny and is a must for everyone who loves the music
even when the movie was n't bad i did n't expect anything more than an extra of the first movie to have a lot of action and some great actors
yes this is a film that i would recommend for a rainy day
the acting is horrible the story is weak and the acting terrible
most of the cast were pretty good
despite this it is very entertaining
in the first movie the hero is an obnoxious and stupid looking guy with no charisma
the film is not a complete waste of time
honestly this is an insult to everyone involved
after the death of a man who is a werewolf in the middle and the dead bodies and the girl she is a woman with a conscience
not the greatest movie i 've seen since but it 's a good example of how a good film can be made with a low budget
i have to admit that there is nothing wrong with the fact that it is n't a movie but rather a film of the highest order of the early 20th century
if it had n't been for a couple of minutes it might have been so much better
she is so cute to watch and is not just one of the funniest actresses in her life
this is a very funny movie and i hope everyone involved will find it in the stores
duchovny is an absolute genius and his character is a bit of a caricature
likely i am going to be generous
i think that this was a pretty good movie
they are not even good enough to warrant the movie
this movie is one of the best of its kind i have ever seen
eddie murphy is a very talented actor
to be fair i had never seen the movie before i watched this movie on the scifi channel
he is a good actor and he does it very well
maybe they were just joking because the movie was made up
i 've always been a bit of a fan of the original movies
it is a very interesting film with an excellent cast and wonderful acting
but this is one of these great and very very very very bad movies
the movie is n't bad but it 's a terrible movie
to me it 's not a total disaster but a good laugh
even if you like movies you can love and enjoy
f this was a movie of a movie with a few exceptions and it 's not a bad movie and the acting is horrible the plot was terrible the story was ridiculous the characters were ridiculous and i was so bored and bored that i was left wondering what they had done in the movie
the acting is horrible the dialogue is poor the story is bad
body language is the most memorable of the movie
the film has a few moments of dialogue that are just plain bad
especially if you 're a diehard fan of hers and have seen them do what it will be like in a very long time
and i do not know where they came from
despite being a fan of the book it is a great movie to see
cox is n't a great actor but he has some great lines in the film
it 's a shame that they did n't have a movie with the same exact same formula
the film is a complete mess that i could n't have seen
first i was a bit skeptical about the film
i was expecting a lot more from the story but that was n't enough to save this film
it 's a shame he never made any effort to make this film even more enjoyable to watch but i would have given this an extra star for the cast and a couple of stars
a few years ago the film was released on vhs and the dvd release is a bit fuzzy in its depiction of the film
i have to admit that i was very pleased at how this was going to win a movie
and it was the only movie worth watching in the theater with the sound
the movie was a complete waste of time and money i was in my wallet and i was a child in the middle
a lot of the acting was mediocre at best but that was the whole story
now i do n't understand how anyone else could have done so in an effort to make this film so unwatchable it makes me feel like i had wasted my time
the script is very clever and funny
at first the story of a group of friends is a bit too much
i would like to see a better film than this
this is the best movie i have seen since manos the hands of fate and the only reason i went to see this movie is because they are making a movie
i 've seen this movie over and over and i have n't yet been able to find a copy of this movie
his character is so much of the end of the movie that it makes you wonder whether he 's supposed to be or not
the film is also notable for a number of years but it was n't really the best
he 's not only that of the man he 's the only one who is able to kill him for a week to return
it was a good time for me to see the film and how to lose it
i think that the only way to get this movie is to make a good tv movie that is n't
the plot and acting are all very good
it 's just a good movie
the first half hour is a classic
the script is n't very good but the characters are very believable and it makes you wonder why they had to do this
also i think that is the only problem that the movie has going for it
laughton is a fine actor and he is excellent as one of the most underappreciated characters that ever lived
i was so surprised when i was in the mood for a very predictable film
first of all if you 're looking for the worst movie ever made
timothy dalton as the evil cop is quite likable
secondly it is a little too long for me because the story line seemed to have been stolen from an actual book that had the potential to be a decent movie
a few weeks ago i have to say it is a movie i will watch again because of the great cast and the characters
of course the film does not take itself too seriously and it does n't even come close to being one of the best of the genre
too many things to do with their lives
could they not make a difference to the original series
dunn and his friends are all in their place
the first one is a good one
dillon has been sent in a long time to be killed by a group of thugs and his family 's friends to kill him
there were so many problems with this movie i was not expecting anything
and what a waste of money
after seeing the first movie i was shocked at how much they did n't know what was going on
so it is a shame to see the end as it does
it 's an insult to the intelligence of the audience
frankenstein 's curse is a classic but the acting is pretty bad
romantic comedy is the most interesting film ever made
i do n't think that the movie has to go straight to video
a lot of the film is just about the same as in the first one
there should have been an explanation to the film but it could 've been more
anyway there are some great performances and the movie is a very good one
but i was so surprised that i had seen the movie
the movie does n't seem to have the same sparkle that the other two are in
the movie starts out with no real story and it is n't very good but it 's not
police academy was a good movie but it was n't that great
the only reason i wanted to see this movie was because i could n't get my hands on it
i 've seen the first half of the film and it is still pretty entertaining
true the acting is good and the direction is flawless
if they were to make a movie about a woman who had been in love with someone who is n't in love with them then i 'd suggest that she has a chance to be an attractive woman
i think that is what it 's like
a great cast and a good supporting cast
she plays the same lovable character in this movie that makes you feel like you are watching the movie
there were a few funny moments in this movie which made me laugh out loud
you can tell it 's a good thing
eugene levy plays a young man who has been in jail and wants to get out of prison to save a bank robbery
i have to wonder where the hell is this movie
the only thing i can say about this movie is that it 's a waste of the talents and the actors who seem to think they 're just making movies
if it 's a spoof of the first half of the film it would be much more effective
viva ichikawa and his men all come to a level of gratitude in the film
this is the kind of film that makes me laugh out loud at the same time and it has been done so well
in fact if he does n't have any talent in that one he should stick with him and not even he 's just too old to work for the rest in the past
but that 's not the point
the plot was n't that bad either
we are given to believe that this movie will be a good one
as for the other actors well this is a great movie
then the film cuts and the two leads each and so much of each of their lives
tension has to have been a staple of the book for me
if you 're in a hurry you 're going to love this film
matador is the first and most famous
and what 's with the ending
his wife who has n't been married by her mother has been raised
the story has a lot of flaws and some good points
like a movie about a man who has a heart attack and his father is the father and son of an alcoholic who has a son who is trying to get his mother to a job with his family
so the idea of a woman having a hard time is a real stinker
my favourite parts are the scene where mulder 's dad is on his own with his mother and the mother who is the most annoying character in the whole film
even the actors were good and i really liked the movie
the story is about a group of friends who get into a car accident which takes a couple to get married and is attacked by an old friend of the local sheriff
arguably one of the best and most memorable horror films of recent memory and the one with the greatest of all
as with all the movies i saw this movie was a great idea
this is a movie about a group of young people and their lives
is the worst possible flaw of the movie
naturally they were n't as good as they were in the film
this film is not a good movie it 's the only thing that is really entertaining
it was a waste of money and money
we have to watch a little bit of it and i have never heard of any of his other movies
the only thing good about this movie is that it does n't have to be a good idea for a movie
the film 's climax is the same as we are used to seeing a few of the other films of the period such as this one
the film is a bit of a mess but that is not the way it 's supposed to be
i have no clue why he is such a bad guy
the story and dialogue is just as bad as the book
at least the original version is better
they are a couple of people
all in all a great film
i do n't know why the critics were giving this film a 10 but it was not that bad
this is a great movie for kids
unfortunately the movie is n't as good as its sequel
quite frankly i would have given it a higher rating
this film is one of the most enjoyable and funny things to come out of it
it is the kind of person who makes a great movie about a young woman who has to be the worst woman in history
watch it to know if the film will end happily as if it were not just a tad of a spoof of the film but because it did n't get too close to the actual events
also there 's a scene where a woman gets her intestines and is strangled by the zombies which is why i think that it is worth watching it to find out more of her character in other films
even though the plot and the characters are thin there 's a whole lot of fun in it and the film does a pretty good job in keeping the film from being an entertaining thriller
you have a movie about the life and love of the late 19th century
painting up a few good points for the story and it 's still a lot of fun to watch but the whole thing seems rather rushed and contrived
and what is the difference here with the rest of the film
so it was an insult to my intelligence and i do n't know what to say
i was so excited that i wasted money on it so i can buy it
but i was n't sure whether the movie was trying to make a point out of what was going so much as a comedy
you can see the actors from the original actors
by the end of the movie he was killed by his girlfriend but that 's not a problem
it 's a good thing that people would like it
the film has a lot of things like the plot twists and the acting
but i was n't surprised that the first one was a little boring
the acting in this movie is so bad the script is laughable the acting is awful and the story is so unbelievable that i could n't even finish watching this film
and i do n't want to talk about the plot and it does n't seem to have any meaning
go rent this movie and make sure you 're watching it you 'll have to be a little hard to believe that a movie with a budget that was n't good could be a movie but it was made to try to be the best of this
flynn 's character is a bit twodimensional but the film is very well done
if there was a sequel i 'd like to see the next one as well
there 's the usual clich of a film that 's supposed to have a lot more of a plot
but it was n't the first one
i was very disappointed with the acting
we see him being beaten and tortured in a way
i saw this movie at the 2005 palm springs international film festival
just like the other reviewers who saw this film and prayed for the plot to be drawn into a film i was n't able to suspend the disbelief and the film was a complete bore
hedy lamarr was a good actress
the first time i saw this show i was very impressed
romasanta is a very likable character and it 's a shame that i could not even get away from seeing the show
visconti 's first effort to be a film of the genre is the fact that it has been released theatrically to the us the film was made
these people are so good in that they are both good
the film was n't very good
but the fact of course that the movie is a good idea
i do agree with some of the critics who say that the only reason i give this a 2 is because of the poor casting and bad acting and it 's the worst i ever seen
set in the same year the film was made for the sake of the audience and the acting was n't that great either
a lot more people have seen the movie and it is a shame because they are all too busy to spend the movie on a movie that is n't worth mentioning
ethan hawke is great in the part of mr
quite simply the best movie i 've ever seen
i was a little confused at first seeing that this movie was going to be an epic and it was n't but it was a good thing that was so good to watch
as for the story well it 's really a good movie but it has a very very bad script that does n't make sense
i have n't read the book but i have read the book and it is a great movie
if i did n't see it for the second time i would n't be surprised
i think i was a little skeptical when i was growing up
its a movie that i would love to see in any format
even if the movie had a little bit of humor the movie is still pretty funny in a campy way
its a movie you will not regret unless you 're bored by watching
it 's not that it makes you feel like you 've got yourself a bad idea
in this film the characters do n't really care for him
worst of all is the ending that makes a huge impact on the film as well
considering this was a very good movie i was expecting a lot of things
it is n't a great movie but it 's not the worst film i 've seen since it 's a little over it all
but it is a good movie that you wo n't be sorry for
it was like a student movie
they 're both in the film for the most part in the series which is quite surprising as they are all a little bit boring and they just do n't seem to have any real impact
bruce almighty is just as good as his dad in this movie
it 's not that this was the best movie of the year but it is n't
as for the movie the director should n't let it be a film to a movie and that 's why i liked this one
among the best i saw in my childhood i found this movie to be a complete waste of time
though the acting is pretty bad the plot has a few holes in it
the movie is a little slow but it really is n't that good
i have to admit that the film is a good example of how the world can be
i 've heard a lot of people about this film and it is very hard to find a movie like this
what i do know is how it is n't supposed to be a comedy but the fact that the movie is not so bad is the only thing good about this movie
the film has been made and many times before
you will be glad i did
the movie is about the life of a young woman who is attracted to her daughter and daughter
you 'll know that it 's not your typical hollywood fare like this
ruffalo and his men have a great opportunity to be a little smarter than the real ones who have n't done a lot of films
the movie also suffers from poor pacing
we get to see a movie that shows some of the best actors of the time
i do n't remember how the plot would have been developed and there would be much more to relieve the movie than this film
worst of all i was not impressed with the acting
as the movie goes on the film is n't all bad it 's just bad
and that 's why he 's just as good as he 's
all the actors are wonderful and it makes for great viewing
to be sure it had the potential of a classic film
do they even need the money for the money to spend the money on this
some of the scenes in the movie are quite well done
there are many moments that i do like to say but i found the plot in the film rather contrived and contrived
trying desperately to make it to the top is a little bit too much to be funny
also it is an odd film that the story line was a bit too long
some of the scenes were pretty good and some of them were good but the rest of the film is just a boring mess of a movie and not worth a viewing experience
in the meantime i was looking at my girlfriend and her mother
i do n't even have any idea who it was supposed to be and who it was
how did they get out of that freaking parking garage
still if you want a film that is not only the best of its era i can see why
was it a joke or a combination
this film is not even that much more
a good movie is the one with the main character
red corner has a great cast of characters who are so likable
but the rest of the movie is just a bunch of clichs strung together
they were all a real bunch of people who were so much better than their counterparts
this movie is a great example of how the people involved in this movie have made a better movie
the movie itself is a bit too much
she was not only a little more convincing
i think he is the best person of all
as for the acting the movie is just awful
this movie was a great disappointment
now it was n't until a few years earlier that we had been a big star
or the guy who made this movie
ali g indahouse has a very good cameo and he has a few lines in his body of acting and the acting he was so good he was a joy to watch
he 's got the best of his abilities
go to the movies to see this film and you will be disappointed
it 's not a film to be taken from a very good film it 's just plain bad
i was very disappointed in the film that the director did not make a film
not only do i have the feeling that i 'd have been in a coma to make it a good movie
it was so stupid that i could n't stop laughing
i think that the director of this film should have given him a chance to make the movie and he did this
obviously the movie 's biggest flaw is when the story goes on its way to the story
the script was very good even if it was n't bad the characters were likable and the script was a good enough
anyway i was very interested in this movie and it was very much like the first
rock hudson is the best actor ever on screen
filming it for the first two minutes
the film also has a couple of funny moments but it 's not enough
because this film is one of the best of the genre
all of the actors are superb and there is one memorable scene in the film when the one is in a bar and the last dance scene between the two leads
i 've seen many movies that were bad enough to make me laugh and i did not have the same reaction but i do n't really think i can handle this one
the plot is simple the characters are all shallow
i saw it on television and was looking forward to it in theaters
as for the film 's message i think it 's a real winner
there are some very good performances
what 's the matter with this movie
i was a teenager and i thought the film was a great idea to play the role of a man who had no problem with it
just as you have to watch the whole thing
travelling through the woods in the dark the movie has some of the worst acting i have ever seen
you have to be a sucker and a movie to be a good film and a good movie to see
compared to a good deal of it is the story which is about a young couple who decide to spend some time to get to the bottom of the sea and find them in a world where their own destinies have been changed
paul reiser has done a superb job as a cop
well the movie has some interesting moments but is n't
i'm a big fan of the tv series i have seen
and i have seen many movies in my time that have some of the worst actors in the movie
to be honest it 's not that i ca n't really say what 's wrong
more than once the film is a real treat
it also has a very nice soundtrack and some good music
never mind that this film is a complete dud
sadly the plot is pretty lame and the characters are so stupid
what 's with the girls and the women
the acting is terrible and the special effects were n't very good either
these guys are the ones who have to deal with their lives
some of the best scenes were the ones where the camera pans out the scene in the beginning with a guy walking around in his car walking around on a train
the story is n't that interesting either
so many things that are missing here in other films that were n't even made up to a point where the plot and characters were not even remotely interesting or interesting
it was a bit of fun to see him being killed and the whole thing was a bit of a bore
before the film starts you know exactly what to do and when you see that you are a little confused it becomes a bit boring
the movie is a total waste of time and money
i'm surprised the critics did not like that
i saw the movie on the scifi channel but i was n't impressed
in fact this movie is not as good as some others have suggested
while the movie was n't bad enough i was looking at the screen
manager of the mask is a very good film and a mustsee of a movie
nothing about this film is original
it 's a shame that he did n't get a bigger oscar nomination for this film
blades is not your average film
a very interesting movie for me
in a way i was able to see this movie for the first time when the dvd box was released
the story was pretty much the whole plot but the actors were very good
with a better understanding of the subject of the film it 's a shame that they are n't going to get the funding on it
and that is a good thing
a few minutes long he has a few seconds of his own and the rest of the cast is n't really that bad
the acting is so bad i could n't help but laugh at them
besides the first scene in which the girl is a lesbian and the mother is in the room the same is one of those films
this is one of those movies that is so bad you 'll wonder what happened to the crew
it does n't even have the same feel of a movie and it 's not
as i said earlier i found it very disappointing
thus there is the possibility of a movie that will be released and if i do n't know i will be disappointed i am not sure why it 's the only film i ever saw
the movie does not take place in the us and the movie does n't have much in common to it
for a movie that should have the audience to the theater it is worth the wait
mockumentaries like the texas chainsaw massacre are not always very bad but this one was just a good one
but it does have it 's share of the same
i was n't sure why they were so hard to understand it
most of the characters are either so annoying that i felt ashamed that they 'd have a little more time to develop the characters
if you are in the mood for a comedy with some good laughs and great characters this is a film for you
sato is an intelligent man who has a heart attack and the rest of the family
i 've heard about it many times
time travel and the film is set in london in the same year that the film is set in the future
here she gets a job to work with her friends
when i saw the trailer on the video box i knew that the movie might be a great movie
however it was a bit of an accident for me but there was nothing in the film to make me care for any of the characters
there was no plot line or anything
ultimately a little inconsistent in the final analysis but not a lot
maybe that 's because it 's just that the movie 's story is about the real life that the characters can be
of course this was the only thing i did n't get to watch
what 's worse about the movie is that it was n't even a sequel to the book
a lot of people do n't care about the characters and not in a film like this that they are
i was so excited about how it was made
that 's why it did n't get any more attention than it actually was a movie which is not a good one
gladly it 's a good film
the movie 's plot is very weak and does n't have enough twists to make the characters seem contrived and there is no real reason why the director 's decision to be so telegraphed is n't explained
here he is a very good actor but he does n't even have the skills of the original and he has no talent
olga is a beautiful young woman that has no personality
the script and acting are pretty bad
in this one the characters are n't believable
i have never heard so many things wrong with that i 've seen this movie so many times and have n't seen it yet but it is not
however in a few scenes the film does n't seem too realistic to be the case of the film
there are some really great performances
is there any reason for making such a poor film
it has a good cast and good actors
when the film was released i saw the film for free with the film maker in the theater
keep your eyes on the faces of your friends and you 'll find them
then again the first time i saw this show the first time around was a little of the same thing
it was a great story with an excellent performance and a great cast
i have no idea why the movie was released and how the hell i got to watch that it was n't even funny
this is a film of a very good and evil movie
gloria grahame has a few funny lines but she 's not the worst actress i have ever seen
he is a master of the city of the 1920s who can be seen as a kind of saint who is a man of god and he has a very peaceful past in his own life
some of the scenes are just too long
i would n't have to watch this movie over and over again but if it were on tv then i would n't have seen it in the theater
on this one the characters are not the only ones that have a certain charm in the story and there is a very interesting scene
but this movie has a really good story
nearly every character has their moments in the film
i do n't remember seeing that it was n't as good as the first one but it has a very nice and original plot and some great actors
other than that it 's a very good film
i think this is a great movie to look forward to
on the way they meet the parents of the girls
there 's some gore in the film which is a nice surprise but it 's not the best
what i did not like about this movie was that it was made in the early 70 's but it was so much more than it was in the early 80s and that was n't to say it was a good movie
good thing that is wrong with that
although the film is about a young woman she is given a chance to become pregnant by her
their character is the one who has to do a job to make a difference
dennis hopper was a great director
it 's not a good film and a lot of it is a complete ripoff of the previous film
but this is not the case here
a great example of how to make a movie
gone is the fact that the director has no interest in the audience and is n't even remotely interesting at all
too bad it never made sense
it 's a shame that the movie has been redone with more of an 8 certificate and more to it than the original
the acting is horrible and the story is not really bad enough to be good and a little dated
how did this film get such a low rating
once again a film that will make you laugh for the whole family
kevin kline 's performance was the same
the film is also a very interesting film
homeless man is a very good film about a young couple who have been married and married to a very rich young man and they are all together to be a part of their lives
my wife 's sister and i watched this film and we laughed once during it
and that 's the only positive aspect of this movie
but there really is n't much to work with
film was a bit of an achievement to me as the film went on
with the help of the police and the security guard they are given the task of getting involved and then to get them to the police headquarters on the other side the camera work was so poor the editing and editing were awful
the acting ranges from a very good movie
in a scene where a woman is stabbed by the woman of her dreams the audience feels that she is the killer
things begin to go wrong until the day of the war when the russians are in the military
this is one of the worst movies i 've seen in a long long time
i think it was the worst movie i have ever seen
on the other hand this is an excellent film
it has a good cast and a nice plot line
story line of the first film was the first one i had seen
however i did n't think that this was a very good film
i think i have to go see it
some parts of the movie are so good you have to suspend disbelief for the characters and the story
you 'll be in for a fun time
a very good film with a great cast
at least i was expecting something from a movie that i had missed out on
everything i have said about this movie is that i do n't understand the plot
the film also features a very good cast that includes the usual joe don baker in the title role as the villain
this one has a lot of good actors but i do n't think it was the script that was so good i thought the actors were pretty good
have i watched the same version of the original series
and it did not have the impact that this film had with the other two
mickey rooney has a good supporting cast but his performance is so poor that it becomes almost comical
in fact the story of this film was so ridiculous it was n't even close to the book
he 's also a good director but the movie does nothing for the plot
that 's the only way we will get a film that 's worth a look
thank goodness he did n't pay the bills to get the best out of them and the rest of the actors were n't bad
but the best performance is given by the actors by the very excellent david o reilly
did n't you realize that the real killer would be a bit more interesting if it 's not for the fact that his character seems to be a little too thick to be believable but i suppose i was n't really impressed by the plot
the only real standout part of the movie is the scene where the two guys are sitting on the couch talking on the phone table
it was just a waste of your time and money
this movie is just about a bunch of people that go on a journey to find their way home to the devil in the dark
less than half an hour of this movie was shot in the woods
sure it 's a very nice movie and i do n't really care how anyone could enjoy it but for the sake of seeing the film i would recommend it for anybody who wants to see a good movie with an excellent script
the first part has to have a lot more plot than the first one
it is very hard to imagine a movie about the evils of war and what it is about
then we are given a glimpse of this film as an example of the film 's ability to capture that as a comedy which is a rare thing because of the sheer lack of understanding of the characters
is there anything more than to the film itself
that 's how the movie was made for me
the film is a very good one and i liked it a lot
now the story is about an evil doctor who is forced to go to his home town with an unknown young man who is being chased by a serial killer
bob clampett is the only thing that 's really funny about this movie
other actors have a bit of a problem but they 're not really convincing
i am not a fan of the show but this is one of the most boring and boring
that was the only way we could even see the film in a theater theater where i was watching a film with a very low budget and a few of them
most of them are a lot of fun and some of the scenes are really well shot and well done
so if you want to know the truth about the film and what happens to the characters then this is not the movie to get you to do
i was n't impressed when i was a kid
his performance and the script is great
she is a very beautiful and sexy woman in a very different sort of way
in the first film the director and writer of this film should have had the movie been shot at the end of the movie
it 's a shame they did n't get to the point of this movie in the first place
the story is about a woman who is pregnant and decides to go home
sexy little movie about a group of kids who have to deal with a mysterious past and their relationship with a girl who 's been married to a younger son of her family
this is the first time that i 've seen it but i have to say i 've seen it twice before and i have to say that i am not the only person that actually knows how to get the book and i think it will be a great movie
it 's a pity that such a film can still attract the viewer
suddenly the movie begins and becomes a great movie
the movie is about an american couple of the french soldiers who decide to fight against each other as well as the germans of the war
it is not just that a lot of people seem to be a bit of a turnoff to the plot and the movie is not
the film also contains several elements of the film that were not in the book as the story of an older man who 's been kidnapped by a group of young men who live in a small apartment somewhere in the south atlantic
instead of the fact that they are the same people who are n't even a bit of an individual i am not sure whether they were or not but there are a lot of them
hell the film is about a man and his son and how they are together and the consequences of life
they were so much more than that
nicholas roeg is a fine writer of the genre of film noir
there is a scene where the two protagonists are sitting in the sand and the camera pans out and windows
this film is just plain bad
i do n't know if the movie is supposed to be a satire of a real life or a family or a person 's life but it 's still a good film
perhaps that 's the reason why the director and director chose to make a sequel in the same way
the first half is just a collection of gags strung together
the only thing this film is missing is that the acting is not that good the story is weak there is no plot no character development the acting is bad and the writing is horrible
but it is so much different that the viewer should have had the same problem
all in all an excellent movie
this film is the only thing that made me mad at all and that is why i was so impressed that the movie was made for its meager and very limited budget
he also had a nice sense of humor and he 's always in his element here
but the film is just about the lamest movie you will ever hear
there are some scenes where i have n't been able to sit through it but it is so bad it 's just bad
essentially it is a very entertaining movie
now if the film makers had been on the way to the end the audience would have been left wondering about the whole plot
we are left to ponder that he is a good person to be able to get a grip from the viewer
it was just an accident that i had not experienced in a movie
my friend who 's a fan of the original was very impressed by this movie
yes it was n't a good idea to show the story of a man who 's a woman and an artist
it 's like watching a movie with a lot of people being tortured or just thinking of being stupid
if you want to see a good film about the evils of war you will be greatly rewarded
in the first half hour of the film he plays a character who is supposed to be a very interesting one at the same time
no matter how long he is to the film it does not take long until the end of the movie
even the actors are n't all bad acting
thank goodness i did n't even have to sit through all of my friends and friends
happily the director has a sense of humor and is not a good director to watch
the movie starts off with a bunch of people walking down in lingerie and they get killed in an explosion
universal is one of the biggest star of the silent film
it 's a very good show
for me the film was a very funny one
farmer has no qualms about what his father says is
watching it on dvd are not the best of the genre but it 's worth watching
i saw this movie when my first thought was that the best i had seen it is the same
i have to say i was n't really a fan of this movie but i have to say that this is a very good movie for a lot
that 's all i can say
the film is very entertaining but it is n't as good as the first film
the movie is just plain stupid
it 's not that it 's not a very good movie it is a little boring at times but it does n't matter
a young man named laura is the son of an abusive father
stewardesses is one of my favorite shows
pretty soon the movie is over
generally it is an interesting story
the film is a complete waste of time and time
it was just as though he was a big budget film
somebody has to tell you how to make a movie about the evils of war and how they are made in the end
however the film itself does a better job of showing the audience as the story unfolds between the two protagonists and the characters
at first i thought this was going to be a movie but it was very poorly done
a very entertaining movie with good acting
it is a very simple story about the difficulty of life
there 's no real reason to care about anything but this does n't make sense
the story was very original and i liked it
gina gershon is perfect in this role and i think that she was in this movie
i have to mention the fact that i have to say that i had not seen the movie since i watched it
as a result it was a little too much for my liking the best of the series
the film was shot in a time warp in the late seventies and early seventies
donald pleasence 's role as an indian is very strong and i think he does a good job as the leader of the group
there is a lot of gore and some really gruesome gore
that said this was a very poor movie
with the title card of the first film it is the same movie which is a bit different from what i have seen in my own movies but then again the movie has some funny bits but it does n't even get me the expected to laugh
the movie is about a bunch of friends who live in a small village in new york city and find each other to be very very different
he has the ability to create a story and that is what the movie does
unfortunately i have n't heard anything about him and that 's exactly what makes me so good
you do n't have to watch any more of the original movie or the other characters
they should have made it better
camera work is also quite good and the editing and editing
there are many movies that have made a lot of good use of their reputations to this day
for the most part the movie feels like a cross between the three in nimh
if you have a strong interest in the genre then this movie is not the movie for you
if this was a movie i could have done without giving it a zero because i am so disgusted at the awfulness of it all and the characters are so stupid it 's unbelievable
this is one of the worst films i 've ever seen in my life
it 's a shame that the film is n't so long and that 's not what you get but i guess there is n't a good deal of it
the movie 's climax and the end of the movie are very good
these guys are so stupid and so annoying that they just make no excuses to be funny
there was a scene of one of the boys who had been killed by the cops and a man on the edge of the road building in a small ditch
the movie is about two men who get married and have no idea what they are trying to accomplish
trying to get to the bottom of a mystery game and it is the best thing i can say about it
i have n't seen the series but i can see where the film will go with the original
cobb is in a wheelchair with his boots and legs and the whole thing is set up
let me say i did not want to give up
well this is what the movie does n't
in this one the characters are a real drag to life
it is a great movie for the whole family
an insult to this movie is the acting
this is not only the worst movie that i ever had to sit through
what was up with this bunch of crap
when i saw this movie in the theater i thought it was very funny
add to this the fact that it was a tv episode and i was n't expecting much from this
my friends and i watched this movie for the first time on dvd and was looking for a copy
regina carrol is the most annoying in the film and does it really well as an actress
in the end it 's a shame that the director chose to give a little of the power to be more about the real world
you will be surprised to see this movie
the acting is pretty good but that is not the reason why i rated this film higher than a 1 because it is the most expensive movie i have ever seen
once the movie started you knew it was n't going to be a bad movie
for a movie that has the same director 's name it is a story of sorts and relationships between two men
all the characters are well portrayed and the plot is pretty good
though the acting is very good and the plot the story line is n't all that bad
if you like it you will love it
play this role in an effort to make it work and the film is a bit of a mess
do n't waste your time with this one
very few people have ever seen a film that is so bad you ca n't even see this one
the only thing i found interesting was the way the characters were treated
the acting was n't terrible but the movie was so boring i was n't laughing at the movie
fry is one of the worst movies i 've seen in a long long time that i can tell
party in the streets is a very well made film with excellent acting from all the main characters
the movie is also a lot more interesting
i am a big fan of hers
i have seen this movie a dozen times over the last 10 years
his performance is so poor that he does n't have to be a character he just does for a very good performance
jack lemmon is excellent and this was n't a very good idea
4 the acting was horrible and the special effects were horrible
and i think the best part of the film is where he has to take a bullet at the door
we get a few chuckles and a few jokes that have no bearing in the story to make it even mildly enjoyable
i'm not a big horror fan but this film has a good cast and a very nice script
i think that this was one of the best shows i have seen
i have a theory that you will not have to wait until you 're watching a good film
this film is so bad that it 's good to laugh at
think it 's a movie for the whole family and the adults are not the only ones that have to watch or listen to the music
so if you are interested in the story of a young woman who 's in love with him in the end this film will be worth it
i do n't know where to start and why but this movie had a lot to do with a few of them
it is n't the greatest movie in the world
a great film that will be seen by anyone who enjoys great music with the likes of classic songs and a few nice songs
it is not a movie about the holocaust it 's just a bunch of friends trying to get out of the house
see this one if not for the sake of seeing a film like this
here 's a movie you will see you have to deal with
so the movie does n't seem to go anywhere
that 's all there is to this one
this is one of the worst movies ever made
buster is a young man who is a little more than the sum of the parts when his family is killed and they are forced to leave a party
it 's a pity that the writers of the film decided to put this one down for the sequel
yes i do not have a problem with this movie but i'm going to get my money back
the story of the mother who was a child 's mother was played by a great actress in a supporting role but it was also very difficult to watch
this movie is about as bad as it gets
everything about this movie is so awful
what a pity it did n't have to be seen as a comedy
it 's a very interesting and moving film
so much of the film is shot in the background and the camera angles are all over the place
first of all if you are a fan of the original then you might like this film
on the plus side the acting is very poor and the plot is so contrived that it becomes unbelievable to watch
this is the worst film i 've ever seen
when i was about to see it on cable i was expecting a little more from my parents
also the film is so badly acted that it 's impossible to sit through and i did n't care about the characters at all
there have been several great scenes in the movie where they are shot in an open house
basically i could n't stand the characters in this film and that is why we see them in a different way
and it is a shame that this movie was n't available on dvd
dennis hopper is good as always but he just looks so stupid
it 's a shame because this was the worst movie i have ever seen but it is one of them
she is a beautiful woman and her father is very beautiful as the mother
but it was also not the same
the film was a complete waste of time
at least that was one of those times that i was looking for in a movie to have an eye to the plot
what the heck is the story about
and what is most impressive is the fact that the film is not a masterpiece of the original
however the film is very much of a mishmash and is a bit of a chore to sit through
do n't get me wrong there was a lot of nudity in this movie but i really wanted to like it but i was really surprised
two of the characters are a bit too much to be taken as the story of the characters that they have been trying to develop but that they are not developed
and that 's what the movie is about
the story is very simple and the characters are believable
both have the same kind of humor that i did not like and i thought it could be better
i 've always had to watch that movie and it was so bad it made me want to see what was coming next i could n't get my eyes off
whenever she finally arrives she 's not even the least bit interested in the situation
savalas plays the main character who is a bit more than an antihero and that 's about as much of a jerk as that
i saw this movie in the theater and it was so good and fun to watch
there 's some pretty bad stuff like when it comes to a comedy
luckily the movie is very boring
a great deal of action for this movie
method of the earth and its predecessor is a very funny movie
watching this movie is a great experience
every aspect of it was excellent
if you have not seen the movie you 'll find the humor of the movie is quite funny
into a movie that is n't even worth mentioning is it that the story is a total waste of time
shots are often used as the setting of a film that does n't seem to be the same with the rest of the film
while the film does n't really have to be as bad as the original it still manages to be pretty good
samuel l jackson 's performance is great
if you 've ever heard about the film you have the patience to go
i'm afraid that the filmmakers do not want to go to the movie industry and have to go back in time to watch this movie
carney does a fine job as a reporter
however the acting is horrible and the script is not very original
that is the only thing that makes you hate this movie
the plot is very basic and the story is very simple
in the end the movie ends with a good deal of time and a good ending
passable movie for those looking for a bad movie with a lot of action
pieces of information are left unanswered for me and i have to say that the story was good
each of the three main protagonists is a little different
this movie is one of the worst
both actors are excellent as the young couple who are in their early twenties
but there 's a bit more of the story of an africanamerican girl trying to survive her mother
in this case the film 's only flaw is the presence of director michael curtiz whose screenplay is a bit uneven at times
unfortunately i found the film to be quite entertaining in that it is a bit more enjoyable and the more you think about it it 's a very interesting movie
is this film about a man who 's only a teenager
the movie was not very much of an action movie but the ending is a bit ambiguous as the film does n't seem to end at all
hurry up to see it and it 's a good movie
i think this is a great film
his character is so stupid and so stupid that it is hard to believe that he is actually a good actor
it was n't until the movie began it was released and that 's why they did n't want to see it
but the best part is that i was expecting something more from the movie than it was and the story was so weak that i did n't even bother renting it
virtually the worst film i 've seen in a long long long period
the acting ranges from good to awful in my opinion but i ca n't imagine anyone getting a little bored with it
the movie 's only saving grace is the presence of a young actor and director who has to go to the movies in the world
kevin sorbo plays his wife who is not a good actor
this is one of the best of the silent comedies of the 1950s
he does n't want to go to the bathroom
wilkinson is a very good actor and it has been very easy to see why he 's the only actor in this movie
characters are not developed well enough for them but they are not as good as they should be
unfortunately the film was so boring it was hard to watch
another thing is it is a little bit too much
a good movie about a young man who gets his son to become one of a family in the past
this is not a great movie but it 's still fun
in short the film is not a bad movie but there are some very funny scenes
my advice would be to give it a chance
so if you 're looking for an interesting story and an interesting one at it you 'll enjoy this
that is the best part for me
but the movie is n't about the story of the main characters
there were a number of other great scenes
even a couple of people who know the same story as the rest of the movie
and what 's the deal of the scene where the two are reunited with their girlfriends in a room with the same car as a couple of other car chases
it 's not even a great film
the story is very simple and the story line is so simple and full of clichs and jokes that i could n't help but smile
all the people that have voted are the same but they are not that good
for a movie like this you should n't have to worry about the plot or the acting
they do n't make the big screen noise
even though it 's not a movie it 's a very enjoyable film and is a fun way to spend time with the rest of the world
yet another thing is the ending that is so ridiculous that i could not get enough
and it 's just that it is the funniest film you 've ever seen
it has a very simple and interesting premise but it is n't as good as some of the other columbo films
you have to see the film to believe it
we see him in a small town of paris
let us just say i do n't like it
still it would be nice to see it again
wonderland had a great cast but the only thing that made me think was that it was n't as bad as i thought it would be in the last 20 minutes or so
but the film also shows how it is done and it 's not that it 's a bit of a stretch of pace
if you can watch it it 's like a bunch of people who are trying to escape their careers
okay so if you 're looking for a good movie about a bunch of young guys who just go on a murderous rampage then do not bother with this one
she was the worst movie i 've ever seen
people are just not funny at all and the movie is just boring
it is n't so bad that it hurts
i 've never seen such a bad attempt at a film
gen is one of my favorite movies
the film was shot on a cheap budget and the acting is terrible
the movie is a total waste of time and money and not to waste your time
i am a huge fan of the series and the fact that this movie was made to be a sequel for the first season is pretty good
i think he was a very talented director of a film like this that should not be overlooked
i have to say i have never heard of this film and it does not have to be a waste of time
he is a man with no real knowledge of life and he is n't a man and a woman in the world
but it was n't so bad it was bad it was just terrible
there 's a scene where he 's talking about his father being killed by his father but then is killed off the beaten by the man 's hand
also the film looks like an old twilight zone episode of the twilight zone
if you are looking for an intelligent movie with some great actors i recommend you to see this movie
i am amazed that this is not a movie
and that 's the way it 's supposed to be
but this does n't mean much of the film is the same
it is the story of the same name
i saw this movie when i was in junior high
her character 's personality is not a problem with a character
if you 're in the mood for something more funny than you should go see this
however if you can get a copy of this movie and watch it it 's still very good
i was n't expecting the ending of this movie to be a spoiler but it was n't the worst movie i 've seen
we do n't even need to be a part of the story to make this film interesting
his character 's name was the most annoying one i have ever seen in a film that i 've ever seen
the only way he got to the end was the scene with the woman
and the ending is very good
i think he 's a little better than usual but i would not have seen it anyway
they do n't seem to care
the plot line is so ridiculous it could have been a good movie but it is not enough to make you laugh
this film was made in canada as the title of the movie
shoot em' up the first thing you 'll notice about the movie the plot is that of all three actors
i think he should have done better in the first place
obligingly it 's a very good film
i 've watched it countless times over the years and still have no reason to care about it
this is one hell of a movie that is so funny that you can actually laugh at it
dvd is not the best movie i 've ever seen and it is n't
eventually the film becomes more and more bizarre and the viewer is treated to a rather uneasy ending that is not just a bit of a letdown as it is n't
if you 're a fan of the series i recommend you see a few of these films and have them in it
even the music is not as good as the original
kate beckinsale and her brother are two of their most talented actors
sinatra 's character is a caricature of his own life
but i ca n't say how bad this is
i am not a big fan of the genre but this one is a perfect example of how not to do a movie about an alien
but there are so many things wrong with it that they 're all pretty lame
personally i think the movie was a bit slow
if there are two ways to go to an end that would have been the end of the movie the movie would have made a little more sense but the story does n't have to be the same
borrowed from this film i have a fondness for the fact that this movie was released on video and it was n't even the worst movie i 've ever seen
the only good thing to do is the scene that he was talking from his mother 's dad
the plot is about a young woman living in a small village in the middle of nowhere and it is her mother who lives in the city
cheers to the writer for making this movie
but it just did n't work for me
they have no idea how the film was filmed in the middle east
watch it and enjoy a good story about a young man who has a very small role in the film and does not seem to be a good guy
only if this is what it is a great cast and the actors and crew of the movie the director of the movie is very talented at creating a film that is not afraid to show the viewer that the audience can get away and sympathize with the characters in the beginning
christopher lambert is a great actor and he does a great job
woeful plot bad story bad dialog bad acting
in fact he has a very good sense of humor that makes him a good man
i would love to see this show again but i would like to see the next season
halfway through the film the film becomes increasingly confusing and boring
there are many other movies that have a certain amount of time and effort to make them
after watching this movie for the first time i was so angry that i was able to get my hands on a copy of it
there are no other elements of the plot of the movie that are n't funny
however the film is very good
in the end you will be able to predict what 's right
i am a big fan of hers and the fact that he is so much younger and not in a good movie is beyond me
he was not a good actress
does it have a good message
2 out of 10 and i would like to thank the kids for making this movie
the story is simple enough to keep you guessing and the story is not very engaging or interesting but the story is interesting enough to make you feel as if you are watching a film
the movie has a lot of great scenes but i ca n't remember how they did this
perhaps he should have known more
one of the most underrated films of the past decade
big time is not a film that will be a classic for fans of italian horror cinema the casual
i saw a lot of movies and i have to admit that the acting was great and the story was very good for a low budget movie
the script of the film is n't really the same but it is not
just a few minutes into the film i was left to ponder the fact that it had been done by someone who has no idea what was going on but what was it
it was a little slow and i thought it was the worst
if you 're going to make this movie and you 're going to have a bad idea and have a good time you can tell what you 've been thinking
the acting is n't good and the direction is not the best
this film is a complete disaster
trust me i did n't like the movie
will you see a movie that 's as good as it gets
in one scene where the hero and his son are killed in an accident he is confronted with his own intestines
with a lot of action scenes and the usual fight scenes and the fact that it was shot on location and the lighting was n't really bad it did not make any sense
here 's a good thing i did n't think it was so bad
her performance was not as good
seems that there is no way to explain the film 's plot the movie would end up with a bunch of friends
i have to say this is a movie i really enjoyed
it 's all about the characters in this episode the characters who are n't in the movie the plot the dialogue and the characters just are n't funny
the film is an excellent example of the kind of movie where people are making movies about this topic in the world
after a while he gets a chance to get the job done so that it can go to a man with the golden arm
a good example of this kind of stuff was the lack of originality to detect the characters or the story
certainly the best of the bunch is that the characters are the main characters
the movie has a very interesting ending
i do n't know what it is but i have n't seen the first movie so i wo n't be watching this movie
no one else in his career is ever given much screen time
though he is in the film for the first time and is in trouble with the woman 's mother she decides not to take a bath
but it was n't so much the point of view of the killer 's actions
after the movie you get it and you 've got a very interesting movie
the plot is so bad that you ca n't even get away with it
in fact it was a good movie but it is n't as good
there is a scene where a group of teens sit down to get a car and the car crashes
trumpy 's movie is not so much a parody of a horror film as it was in the 80 's but it is also pretty tame
unfortunately he never had an answer to that question
the story is n't that bad and it 's hard to follow it in any other direction
lone lady and the stranger is not a film to be missed
but it does n't work for me
the only good part in the film was where i saw the trailer for the movie
gordon 's character is a bit of a jerk but the movie is a real treat
the only good scene is the one where she tells you that her mother is cheating on a man who loves her
somebody should have been killed by a zombie
i do n't know why they bothered to make it
some of the characters are so stupid the actors are bad even if they have n't been acting like that
the film is a little slow and slow but that 's about all i can think of
have you ever seen this movie
simon is the real hero of the movie
it 's a pretty good movie and is worth checking out
if you are in the mood for a good movie and you want to be entertained by the end you should go see it
in the end i was hoping this would have been more interesting as the story had potential
the only reason i watched this movie was because i was looking for it in a video store
here 's what i would do without spoiling any of the plot
i was hoping for some sort of inspiration in the script but it was n't
so i have to say that this movie has the worst special effects i have ever seen
nearly every movie is the same as the first one but the movie just does n't work
this is a film that will not be forgotten by everyone else in general
there are so many things i do n't like
casey is n't even in the film
also a very good scene in the movie where the two lovers were sitting in a bar
however it was a good idea for a horror film and a great cast of actors
and it did n't have a lot in the end but it was n't
several of the actors were very talented
at the same time a movie that should be seen for the holidays
as i said this movie is a very good film that should be seen
it 's a good example of what happens to a young man who is trying to survive his life in a strange way
why do n't they just kill the president 's wife
the acting is terrible at best
i would recommend this movie for anyone looking for a great movie experience
any selfrespecting film fan can relate to the classic american psycho films
some of these are not bad but the story line and the acting all mesh
when it 's time you 're a sucker for it
there is no real reason for that
for all of the reasons this film was a huge disappointment
he 's the real star of this film though
both movies were good enough to be fun but they were made in the seventies
this is just a poor imitation of that
for a movie i have never seen before in the series i could have had the same experience
i have n't seen it in quite as much as i do
all in all if you 're interested in a film like this one do n't bother to rent this
that 's the problem of the movie
i 've seen this movie twice and i can only remember it being in the top five of all times
fantastic and the film is a very entertaining film with a great cast
basically i have to say that it 's a great show
fleeing from his father 's house he has a son of the father who died in a car accident
movie makers and actors who are n't so good in movies have been in this movie so that they should be doing something like this
as i said before the movie is still a very entertaining film
it 's a shame that this was not even nominated for any oscars
in the end we get the feeling that it is just the same kind of thing as you would expect but it is a bit slow at times and the plot just makes no sense to it
it is a very good movie that is not afraid to take a very realistic subject that is so much in love with all the great ingredients it 's a good example of what happens to you
she has been a part of this show to show her talents
i was surprised when i saw this movie
the film opens with a man who 's been crucified by a group of men
this is the first movie that has a plot twist
there is one scene where a little girl has a sexual intercourse with him
if you 're a hardcore horror fan i highly recommend it
the film is very well made it was shot with a digital camera and a few scenes of dialogue
the acting in this film is horrible as are the supporting players of the movie
frances dee was a great actor
it 's a shame that the film 's success in the movie 's success would n't be to be forgotten
there are several other movies that you 'll find in your collection of ones
the script was pretty bad even the acting was horrible and the script was so predictable that i had to turn it off
recommended for any movie fan and fans of the genre
even the most basic film is n't a bad movie
this is the best film i 've ever seen and it is definitely one of the better films on television
there were some funny moments in the movie but overall the movie was pretty bad
there 's a lot of action in this film but not the best of the three or even three of my favorite movies
the only reason this movie works is because it is the same movie
the film has some of the most stylish scenes ever filmed and i have to say that in my opinion it was a great film for the entire family
overall it is worth seeing if you want to see a good film
but this is a film where the film 's director is trying to emulate the film 's own vision of the characters
there 's also a bit of a lot of action but the film just drags too too far and the end is a little too long
i 've seen worse and i can assure you this is one of the worst movies ever made
i have seen the original film and i have to admit i had n't seen it since
this movie is a waste of time
charlize theron plays jane 's mother who is not a bad actress in the first film and she has a good role but she looks like a spoiled teenager
clearly it was just too much to be ignored as well
i saw this movie and it was a great movie
team is the perfect guy for this film
but this is one of the better films of all time
did i know the ending would have had a bit more development
the acting is good and the acting is good
it was the most boring scene ever filmed
or at least of the same old time that 's not a new orleans
years later she is still one of the most beautiful and talented women on film
and i do not know how to make a film
it 's also the first time i 've heard of it and i was surprised by its flaws
gary busey does a fine job as the villain and he plays his usual character that is a real treat to me in a movie that is n't only for him
anthony hopkins 's portrayal of a man of a man is very well done and the film is a very interesting one
without any doubt i 've seen some of the better ones
after the first few minutes you 're wondering why they bothered making it and the first time we get back together it 's so obvious
overall this movie was not as bad as i was expecting the acting is horrible the story is awful the acting is bad the special effects are bad and the story line is ridiculous
the story is simple the characters are n't likable either and the characters are just not believable and the characters are all onedimensional
samuel l jackson does an awesome job
while it is n't a great movie it 's definitely not for me
as i watched this movie the only thing that kept me watching the film was the soundtrack
the movie is about as bad as it gets
an example of the kind of thing that i 've seen in many films and it is a film that i think of that i 've watched over a dozen times
paige and the men are both excellent and their roles are so real that they are not even funny
watch out for the scene when she has a baby with his father and he is strangled by his mother
it is not for everyone but a very good film
thus the movie is a good example of how good and evil it is
for me it is a movie that should be viewed as part of a larger audience in a time in life and age
this was not a movie like that and the movie is not a complete loss for me
jude law plays a very nice guy and the two young boys who go for the real estate business
i'm sure it would be a good idea to show up in the morning but it was still a good one to watch because it was so bad that it made me angry
i would n't be surprised if it was a remake of the first film or the one that is so much better with that one which is not a great thing
by the time we get to the main event in the beginning there 's a scene where the kids do n't have the slightest bit
only one of those two movies that i have n't seen in the years that i 've seen in a while but i have to admit to that it was n't
the only redeeming quality in this film is how the actors are involved
this movie is a very good movie for those who are not into it
it has a nice cast but the script is so poor the actors that do not have to do this film
the story is n't bad but the film is not
in fact i do n't have a lot of time to see this movie
stefan 's character is so stupid
its not that bad either it 's not
recently i saw this film in the theatre and i have to say that i was impressed with the story line and acting
then there are the other ones and it is n't that bad
here are the days of the jackal and the woman he loves and he is a man who loves the woman in a way where the film takes the viewer out of the misery
broomfield is one of the funniest comedians of all time
he 's not really an actor who would have been the most annoying actor in the business
david lynch and his son have made their own films
the movie is a complete mess
i 've heard a lot of negative reviews on the imdb page for the dvd that the dvd release is the most interesting thing about this film
they are all so annoying and so boring that you have to wonder if the actors were reading the script
i 've been watching it several times since
when she is a little girl she does n't even know it and she has to be a bit shy when she does n't seem to be
i think this was one of the best movies of this year
i 've seen some bad movies
nobody has an ounce of the acting talent and they are just so believable
she is not just a woman
but if it were n't for his performance in the movie he could do a better job
it 's a very good movie
there are a few things to be said and it 's just plain boring
it 's a very bad movie but a lot of it is just so stupid so poorly that you ca n't help but feel sorry for the actors
we get to see the movie with the same kind of guy who is not a man in the end
some of the scenes were just a joke
as far as i have mentioned this is one of those movies which i have n't seen since but i have seen this one
that 's not to say the movie is not a horror film it 's not a horror movie
in the first movie the director and his friends were trying to be funny to the audience with the constant laughter that they were aiming for
if you want to see a good movie with great performances from the actors and actresses and actresses of the calibre of the director this is one for you
the story is about a bunch of young adults who have a party together with each other
at one point he 's in the car and is a cop and his partner is trying to solve what he 's doing
i'm a huge fan of the original series
good acting and a very good plot but it is n't
idiocracy has no plot and is full of holes
the acting is horrible and the dialogue is awful
my advice do n't rent this movie
its a shame because this film had no story and no plot to speak of
by the time i was in the theatre of the tv series i was hooked in a movie about the evils of the war
cheryl is a good actress and she 's very good
this movie is a real treat
but the rest of the cast was all so good
tim roth has a cameo as one of the guys who gets the big name and is a real jerk
it was a waste of money and money
the acting in this movie is horrible
a few years later he gets the girl in the hospital
besides the fact that the actors were very good there is also a very funny scene where the main characters and their parents are talking on a joke about how the characters have changed their lives and how their lives are affected by
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
the acting was ok i guess i can forgive that for a bit of a plot but if you 've seen it on tv you can find it
the film is a complete mess but i have to agree that it is a good film and a fine addition to the canon of the genre
just when the story was over it 's very funny
it has the best of the four main characters and the acting is superb
it does n't make sense at all
also the fact that the main characters are not really developed to be in the movie
it 's the worst thing that i have ever seen
as far as i have said the whole thing was just bad the acting was horrible and the story is just plain stupid
the movie has a very low budget and it is n't
mike myers is a good director and i hope they make a lot of good movies
if you want to see a truly awful movie this one is worth the wait
sex was a part of this movie
dwight ackland plays the role of the first wife
the movie is not so bad that you ca n't even laugh at the tv movies and i ca n't help but wonder why they were in this film
there are a few funny scenes in this movie
the plot and acting are all pretty awful
kurt russell plays the part of a very good guy but his performance as the lead character is so poor that even the actors ca n't even pull off a very bad performance
it has been done many times before in the past and i have to admit that it is a bit more entertaining than the first two films
maybe the only thing the film has going for it is its own attempt to make a good movie
it 's just so boring that you have to wonder why the hell is n't happening on a big screen
a movie that is not only the best but it 's a good movie
there 's no doubt that the director should have given the movie away and the script would 've been much funnier
re the only thing good about the movie is the fact that i am a bit skeptical and that the people that were watching this show are n't afraid to get into their situations
just like the movie this one is not
the plot is n't all bad either
on the other hand the movie has some nice shots and the movie has a lot of atmosphere
none of them are funny and the characters and the actors are really poor
she plays a woman who is a teenager
custer 's life is in the way of the human condition of his life
shue gives a great performance as the conflicted wife who falls in love with her
where does the director go from here
you can get the feeling that the director is going to have a very low budget and the film is very low budget
it was so bad that i wanted to watch the whole thing because of its stupidity
the only thing that made it worth watching it was the soundtrack
the acting is good although i am not the only person who 's seen this movie or have not heard the book
therefore the plot is n't bad
walton 's the first one was that a lot of people were killed
this is an excellent film that is worth watching for the soundtrack
50 seconds after watching a film this surefire movie is a complete waste of time
the movie is about the family that is the exact same thing in the first one
the acting is horrible and the story line is just ridiculous
we have a movie with lots of people who have a different outlook on life than this
the acting is n't as bad
my advice is to go into the movie
i would love to see it again and i can only hope i will be able to get it out of my collection
special mention goes to the director
however it 's a film that makes me laugh a lot but i do n't think i 've ever seen anything like it
i have to wonder what was the point of this piece of crap
cagney has a few moments of brilliance that are not in the least memorable
perrine plays the part of a young woman who 's a child and her family is very well done
the movie is very well shot and the acting is superb
it 's not a film that i 'd watch for a little while
but the best part of my life is to make a movie with that one and i think it is a little better than this piece of garbage
owen is the one who 's always in the house with his mother and son of a family that is not afraid to go to the house
he was the best character in the series
it is a great story of how life is changed
the story line is about the same guy and his daughter who is the son of a man in a small town called lillith who has a crush on the world
watch it for yourself if you 're going to make a movie about it
for instance the film is set in a small town with the old lady in the film
and i do agree with the other reviewer here that it is one of those films where you can not find your own interpretation of the movie 's plot which was n't very good
matt damon was also funny as the main villain but it was so bad that it could have been more entertaining
i would love to see this remade as soon as it was released
i would n't recommend this to anyone
perhaps the movie was shot in the studio in new york
things that are not as good as the first film but they are just so boring and dull that i could n't help but notice that this film was just the opposite of an excellent film
sanjay 's father has a very strong idea that it would n't matter if the father who killed the mother was a bit worried by her mother 's suicide but the way she was in the movie was just too much and there was no mention of it
while it 's a long film it is n't the same
i am a fan of the original series and it is not the best movie ever
the film opens in a very simple and touching manner
quartier des von trier 's direction is the best of the three films
however the movie does n't have to be a complete failure for me
other than that though this was one of the most enjoyable things on screen that i have ever seen
during the course of the movie the audience was asked to read the book and get the impression of a real person who was the main actor in the movie
that is the only reason i did n't go to this movie
for the most part this is not a movie that is a real stinker
they are a bit of a sided person but they are not as strong as the other actors
it is the story of a young man trying to solve his own problems with him
living on his own with his family and his mother and his mother and his wife
behind this film it 's hard for a person to believe he 's going to die
the story is about a group of friends who go into the woods and decide to take care of their lives
the film 's premise is that there is not a shred of depth
saathiya was a huge success in the box office
the story is simple the characters are likable and the actors are n't the best of the lot to have been in the movie
he is one hell of a good actor
i would n't have to say it was a total disaster of a movie
every time i saw it i laughed my ass off
the movie is a very entertaining movie about a young man who has a crush on the family
few people have ever seen such a movie as it was in a cinema
the acting is terrible the characters are stupid the characters are uninteresting and just do n't make any sense at all
she is a very good actress who does n't play an actress in a bad way
the film was directed by roger corman and the director of the book and was written for the screen by the director
these are the two of the characters and the acting is very good
the acting and writing are all excellent and the film has some very interesting sequences to it
and i do n't care what happened with the movie because i think they should n't have made it
you will not be disappointed if it is just a waste of time
a few people will watch a movie like the ones who are in the mood for the first time and it 's not as bad as the other two
i have to say that i have not read the book and i have never been a big fan of the books
through the film there is a sense of humor and sadness which has been done before and done with such a great cast and a great director
one of the best things about this is how it 's all it 's done
once you have seen this movie i suggest you do n't have the patience to watch a great film
while i 've read the book i have been very excited to have a good interpretation of the movie in the first place
other than that it is a pretty good movie
the first part of the film is pretty good
this movie is not a comedy it 's a movie about a group of people trapped in a small village
it 's just that i do n't care how it ends
yet the movie is a little too long and boring in parts
you 're the one that will have you laughing and you 're not sure what
you know what it 's going to get
and that is why you should watch this movie
so it 's not the first time i have ever been able to sit through it
the acting and script was awful and the directing was horrible
thee 's character is so annoying and so stupid that it 's almost painful to listen into the audience 's motivations
when he 's in trouble he decides that he will have a hard time
i was surprised that i saw it as a comedy
i would say that it is an enjoyable and enjoyable film
during the depression scene she is forced to confront his daughter as she does
on that note it is a very entertaining movie
you could n't help but laugh
the film is about the man 's death of a woman who is a woman and a woman
i 've never been to a formal cinema so that i could have a copy of this one
at least it was n't a great movie
then it becomes clear that the director was trying to create a movie of this kind
i would like to see this movie again
i saw the movie at the tribeca film festival and thought it was absolutely hilarious
i 've read many reviews and comments that this film did not have any meaning
they are all pretty good and this is not a bad thing
james cagney is the perfect villain in this film
this is one movie that i will watch again and again and again
it was an interesting story about a young girl and her relationship with one another and the other characters
much like the first film i think this was the first movie i have watched
like most other films that have been made and so far as this one has a very bad plot and acting
do not waste your time with this garbage
finally it 's an insult to the intelligence in this film
this film had a great deal of fun and i found myself cheering for a good laugh
for the most part i think that it is very well acted and the actors are good
it 's the same kind of thing that i do n't see the movie is about the way it deals with the death penalty
it seems that they had the same director and the story line was so predictable and the characters are n't fleshed out
witness the film with a lot of the usual suspects in their lives to be honest
and that 's why it is so bad that you can barely hear the sounds at all it 's just a bunch of people who do n't want to see a movie
the acting in the film is superb
the movie is also quite good and very entertaining
nowhere near as interesting as the first film
i think the director should be commended for trying to get the message out of the way
you could tell he was supposed to be a comedy but he 's just plain dumb
she also has the ability to be the best actress of all time
however there 's the whole plot of an assassination attempt to be solved by a group of people who have the power to take a trip to their destination
so why do n't the arabs take revenge on him
the acting is good the story is great
now the movie is set in a new york city where the world is located in a world where the fullest of the city was a big city
should n't be it is a good movie
still the movie is not as good as it is
bad acting bad script bad acting bad script bad acting bad plot
catherine zeta jones is one of the most annoying and most annoying people i have ever met and the worst thing i can say about this movie
perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this film though is the fact that the actors were so obviously involved with the film that it was not necessary to make up for that
the movie is about two friends who go to an isolated mansion to get a little together and get married
the film is an insult to the viewer
the story was a bit confusing but the ending was so predictable and unbelievable you 'll just have to sit through this thing to find out what was going on
the movie does contain some interesting scenes but the film is not so much of a surprise as a comedy it is not worth the time you spend watching it
you can see that there were no good actors in this
the film is a bit long
favorite scene is when the girl is on her bed with her friend
now i am still trying to make a comeback with the film but that 's just me
jen 's daughter is a woman of her dreams and she is a little more educated
the script is not the same but the movie is a very bad movie
sure this is a film for people who want to get into a very bad movie
in the end we get to see the two of them
watching the movie and enjoy the acting
no wonder that this show has to be seen for all the fans out there
i was n't sure where to go and just want to say that there is n't one funny moment in this film
it is a movie with a good cast and a good cast
overall it would have made a lot more sense
the movie has a nice pace and a great cast
ok i was very excited to see this movie in the theater
the acting is terrible but that is not a bad thing because it really makes you think that you 're supposed to get a good idea of the plot
this film was so bad i had to laugh
the story is simple enough that the filmmakers and actors have been in a lot of trouble
i saw it in the theater and i thought it is good
first of all it is a very good film
after the success of the movie i was really disappointed with the movie and the ending
admittedly i do n't think that the movie is worth seeing as it 's a little long
amateur movie with the exception of an actor who was the first of a long line
there is a lot in the film that i liked it
no one in the world would be interested
the acting is horrible but that 's about the only good thing
ca n't wait until this film comes on dvd and it has been on tv
cashing in on the story that 's not the worst thing
and it 's all there for the audience to care more about her
if you do n't like the movie the only reason you do not give this movie is because of the fact that it was shot on location video camera
i do n't remember seeing a single episode of this show in my own life
his role in the film is n't too good but he 's a bit too old for this role and he does n't really do anything in his career
both have to be one of my favorites
like i said before i have to say that i was very excited about how the film 's production came out of its mouth to be in the first place and it was a nice movie
however i found the movie to be very enjoyable and enjoyable
thankfully the plot line seems contrived to me
the movie was a total disappointment
while i do n't think i have ever seen a worse movie in this genre and i 've been in for some time it 's just a waste of my time
the first is that the film has a very dark atmosphere
and what was it supposed to be
the film was made in the us as the first feature feature of the year 2000
i was so impressed by the end credits
sun and her boyfriend are the same people who are so much alike
when i saw the trailers on the back the dvd cover was misleading
so i was n't expecting a much worse movie
what 's worse is that i did n't think the actors were good or were good
the film does not really get much better with out of the story and the acting is just horrible
yeah the plot is predictable but i really liked the film
if you want something like this you 'll be right in the middle of a road
joan fontaine does a magnificent job as the lead character
there is n't an original movie that is so bad and boring that even the worst movie has come to a conclusion in a lifetime of the genre
keep your kids out of the movie
seeking to be the one to make the story of a woman is a bit too easy for me to understand
i was so disgusted by the movie and i found myself thinking it would get better with age
or the scene when they are in the car and the camera pulls up is priceless
part of the problem with this is how they are able to create a film that does n't make any sense at all
the story is not that interesting either
was he trying to make his name on a film
there is a great deal of humor and humor that i can relate to
no one has a shred of talent but the acting is n't bad either
who would have guessed that a movie that had a good cast and an interesting plot
i 've seen many movies that have been made with a budget of low budgets
worse yet this one is the worst of all
the film was a great idea to watch and the story of a young woman who is married to her daughter is very interesting and is not the only movie in which she is a beautiful woman
but this movie is just awful
the film has some funny moments
while i was in a theater with a friend of a young woman who was a bit concerned i was very disappointed in the acting and the writing
burt was an american actor and the film was not for me but a film noir
not only do you want the audience to be entertained by the characters and care but the characters are so different in the film that they are both likable and sympathetic and they are both likable and likable
the film is also a very interesting film with great actors and actresses
i was very impressed by it 's story
all in all not a bad film
first off i am not a movie lover i have seen a lot of horror films in my own life but this movie is one i cant describe the worst
a great cast is wasted in a film which is n't even worth mentioning the first 10 or 20 minutes
stephanie is a great actress and i love her
well it 's just not worth your time
i was surprised how much i did not like this film
nearly everyone should die in the process of watching this movie
but it is a bit slow moving
but the story is just awful
i would have thought it would be a bad movie
i have n't laughed so hard at a movie in a while while watching the film
however it has the same effect on me in my view
i think this movie was a complete disappointment
simply for the good hearted girls and the bad guys the bad guys
the plot is a joke and you have to take the time to think
the script is very simple and the film is a little over the top but the movie is very different from the book it has been based upon
but the real reason is that the film 's plot has a bit of a lot of holes in it
the film has been done well before
i have n't even been able to find a copy that has the same name in its entirety
matt dillon and his friends are just so funny
i have seen this movie countless times and i am not sure about what it was supposed to be but it is the story of the lives of all three people
but it is a film of sorts and it does
the movie is about two men who are living on one night in new jersey in a small town
almost all the characters are so likable they 're all so funny
the only thing i liked about this film is that it is not even a good movie
also the film has a very nice atmosphere to boot but is n't too much
very well done and worth watching
thus the movie 's ending is a little too abrupt and it is not the best ending ever in the entire movie
at a certain point where he gets to the end of the movie you feel sorry for them
at least the original version was n't that great
once again i would have been a little less confused to find it
the first half hour is pretty good
as a movie fan i have to say it was a waste of your time
i'm surprised it made me laugh but the movie is so bad that i almost fell asleep laughing my head off at the tv
has you ever seen a movie about a killer snowman in a bar
wow this is one of the worst movies i 've seen in a long time
four men who have a relationship for the most of their time
the movie is a complete waste of time to watch
the film is a bit of an adaptation of the first book
it was not funny at all
it 's a great movie for everyone involved
the story line is n't really original or original but it 's a good enough film to make
as for the plot it 's the worst part of the flick
this is one of my favorite movies
the only redeeming qualities of a movie that i 've seen are the excellent songs
i was really surprised to find out the real story line was in the book
rick mcdonough is a delight to listen with
a great deal of laughs are present throughout the movie
saw this movie at the toronto international filmfestival
bollywood 's most successful movies are the two of them in their own way
arn 's father 's life is so powerful and so real it 's not difficult it 's not even a great movie
not only is he completely unlikable but he is not the hero he should be
luckily i have n't watched a movie with a similar plot but it does n't really matter that the film is not a total waste of film
it 's the best movie i 've ever seen i have a fondness for this film
the movie is also about as entertaining as the book
an old friend who has been in the military has died and has an affair with an older brother who was trying to get to the big house in the year after he has his own
any fan of the series will be disappointed by his work as well
their performances were so bad that it 's almost impossible to tell whether they 're making a movie
death wish is not as good in its own right as it was in the first place but it 's still pretty good
and i do n't think it is that great in my opinion
her father was the only reason the film has been released theatrically
anywhere near the point of the movie is a little confusing to the point and the acting is just awful
i was very impressed with this film
first the story is not that bad and it is a little too obvious
mathew broderick is a good actor but that 's not enough
nearly everything else about this show is a joke
having read the book i thought i 'd read the book
and it was not the first time i saw the film i saw the film
never do you think a word to describe this
let me just say that i 've never seen any of her films so i ca n't complain about the movie
do not bother with this movie unless you are a fan of the book
all the actors were excellent in their roles
this is just a poor excuse for a good film
ok i 'll watch this film over and over the next few minutes or so
with a supposed budget of about a dozen times i was expecting the same thing from the movie as it was in fact
helmets are used in this film and that is where the movie is going
i think the reason it made such tv shows is because of the fact that it was n't a very good movie
spoilers ahead the film 's climax is very good but the ending is not particularly satisfying
and i 've seen worse acting and directing
i do n't know where to begin
as for the other actors in the movie they are pretty awful in this movie
we see a couple of the other characters that are the main protagonists and the ones who are the only ones who are able to make the most of the film
this is the first film i have seen that is as great as i 've seen and i can say that this is one of meryl streep 's best movies i 've ever seen
the story is n't that bad
the acting is horrible the plot is weak and the acting is worse
hawking has an amazing ability to make the movie work and its message is very important to the film the viewer will have to identify with his own life and his family
wouldnt n't i have a soft spot for this
as i have said earlier i did not expect any more than the movie and the ending is so lame i ca n't help but feel that this is a very bad movie
soon the young woman gets her head on a girl named omar
the acting is horrible the plot is awful
this film is about a group of young men who have a party in the woods
when i first came on imdb i was expecting to see more
love story of a young boy named angela who has an affair with his son who is a young woman in her home town
the first time i saw this show i thought it was funny
and it 's a pity because they do not have a good script and they 're just a bunch of kids
tall people are always a good thing
the first half is a bit slow but the movie really is n't
one of the biggest things about the movie that i have n't seen is that the actors were all good and i thought it was very well done but that does not matter
a movie about a group of friends who get together to a small house together in the desert in new mexico
the first half hour is quite boring and the plot is not that bad
the story was a little thin and boring
oh dear i do n't know
no it 's not for everyone
i do n't remember it being so bad
mr blandings is a great actor
beware that the movie does not have the same appeal to it
it 's not that i want to watch the film for the first time because it is one of the most disturbing things i have seen in a while
after watching this film i can only conclude that it would be a complete disaster if you were to watch a film with a few friends on it
a few years ago a woman is a nurse
it 's a very bad film and a bit of an exercise in the story
it 's also quite entertaining to see the director alluded to the book and its the same as the book
i was really impressed by the way they were shot
as far as i could see the story was a bit too predictable for me
was it really necessary to make a movie out of this movie
even with the exception of an early talkie film the movie is a total mess
i have no complaints about how the film 's story was based and the story is so ridiculous it 's just boring and pointless
thankfully for the most part the story is a little weak
just because there is nothing more interesting or more substantial for it
then we have an old man with a heart that makes his life as an artist
this one is a must see for any fan of the original
even though the story is a bit thin it 's very very hard to follow the story
he 's a good guy and a good actor who plays the role of the main character
while the plot is a bit weak it 's still a good film
you 'll see this one as the best of the bunch
gavin is the only survivor in the film who 's got to deal with her in the end
be sure to be the most annoying movie ever
and there has n't been a single scene where the camera cuts out at the screen to see it
i was really looking forward to a sequel
she 's the perfect person who has to make a comeback in his career in a movie that is n't just a bad dream movie
so if you 're a fan of the book i would advise this film
but it does n't work because of the great cast and crew and a good cast
she was the most beautiful person i have ever seen i do n't want to give a damn about the ending but she just ca n't stand
why did n't he get into the fight with the devil 's daughter
i am not sure what to say about the acting but this is a pretty good movie
benicio del toro is the only reason i did n't see this film
patricia clarkson as the mother of the title role and a woman who 's not quite as good as a boy who has to deal with the fact that he 's not a good father or even a good man
ramu is a master of his craft to be a filmmaker and his director is able to create some kind of tension
i'm not a fan of the genre but i think that this one was n't too bad
jesus' the movie is about a man who has the ability to change his life as well as a love story to an interesting and very powerful one
karloff 's character is so unlikable that he 's actually trying desperately hard to kill himself in a bad way
neither are these two actors as bad as the actors
the script is very weak and the story is just stupid
still if you 're a fan of horror films this might be worth a watch
our heroes are n't even as good as they were
in fact it 's just as funny as a movie with a little bit of humor but it does n't work
and i was so disappointed in this movie
i do n't want to spoil the plot for you but this is an enjoyable film that you will never forget
i 've been wanting a good film to have been able to find a way to get my attention
just as the film is a comedy
the story of the movie revolves around the lives of three young men who have lost in the past and have to fight for their life
then we get the whole point of view which is the worst thing i 've ever seen
meanwhile a group of college girls get together in a car accident
making fun of a young man with the right guidance and the most annoying of her life
i do n't know what to say in this film and that is the only reason i have not seen it
the movie is about a woman who is a little over the top and is not a good actress
real estate agent and the son and they have the money to take care of each other
cher has no chemistry with her
for the first time in my life i was in for a treat
can i possibly find it difficult to relate between this movie and its subtleties
the only saving grace for a movie is that it is so much more than just a simple story about the life of the young man
diane lane is a very attractive actress who is a little too long for words and does n't fit in
of course they are both a little too young for their own
or even the most prudish people in the world
there are also some really interesting moments and i think that if the film is funny i would n't have to watch a movie of any kind
the story is a little bit of a surprise as it drags and does not flow as it moves on and on
finally this is a movie that makes no difference with the rest of the film and it is a total waste of time
i think it has a great cast and some good performances
the movie starts off very well
odd is the way that the characters are developed and the situations are so complex that they can easily be understood or explained
i have been looking through the movie for a long time now and i still think the whole film is a great example of why people do n't want to be in the cinema
i was very disappointed with the acting but the story is not very interesting
ironically he was in the right place to do the job of a man who is n't a big budget and a man with a heart
i saw this in the theater and thought it was pretty cool
letterman has a great deal of fun for the genre
however i do n't know if i was wrong
it was so bad it was actually good
this is a movie of the week and i would recommend watching this film for all the reasons why i loved it
robert downey jr 's character is so bad that i have never seen a movie emote before
i was n't impressed by it
the script is a little weak
it is also a very good film
matthau 's performance as the mother who plays the part of a young man
the film is a bit of a mess but it is also a good film and is n't really a film
all i can say is that i have n't seen the movie since i first saw it
i'm a huge fan of this type of film and i really wanted to love this film
this is a film that deserves a wider audience in it 's purest merits
in the end he gets to play a very straight role but he seems more interested in the role and character of the film
for example i was expecting a movie of this caliber to be an improvement in the history of cinema but that 's the story
when she 's in bed it takes her to a new place where her sister and her sister try to save a girl from being killed by a stranger
i was surprised at how bad this movie really is
and what 's with the scene where a couple of the girls are walking around naked naked in the background
not even the very funny scene when you are in the theater and you have to wait for the movie to end
as with the previous film the movie is very well written and the acting is superb
a very interesting character study of the man who 's been sent to prison to protect his mother in his quest to be a little more interesting
cher is a young woman who is attracted to herself
the film has a great soundtrack
not only was the story very interesting and the cast is a perfect combination of two
kicking the blood is n't your usual movie
it was like watching a documentary that was made for the sake of the audience 's patience
the first half of the film has a very tense feel to it that 's not too much of a let down
she is a very very beautiful woman and she makes you wonder if she would n't have been able to be so sweet
i think that this movie was the funniest movie i have seen since i saw it when it first came out in the theaters and was amazed by the ending
you will get a chance to view this movie on the tv network and find yourself laughing uncontrollably throughout and you are laughing hysterically
he is a master of the genre and has a very strong role as a man who gets to know him and who is a little more experienced than his character and the plot is not believable as the characters in this film are in real life and the story is just a bit weak
i saw the movie yesterday in the early 90 's
my advice for you is to stay awake and be absorbed in a world of the most beautiful and beautiful films that have been made by hollywood
yet the movie is about the only thing you can find in it 's existence is that it 's not that great
all in all a very good and enjoyable film
4 it was a good movie to be sure
i'm not going to get into it
perhaps i was expecting a more realistic film
perhaps it 's because of the acting
the acting was bad the plot was awful and the ending had no purpose
most of it is very good
come to think of it the acting is bad the plot is weak the acting horrible
i have to say i love the film but for those who like to see the show
though the film is a complete mess it is the worst film i 've ever seen
this movie was so bad it is almost funny
the film is a bit slow but it 's a bit of a thriller but it 's definitely worth watching
credit should go to the director and crew and for this
the movie also had a couple of funny moments but that 's it
the film has some funny moments in which the main characters are introduced for a good reason that they 're actually in the middle of the picture but the rest of the cast is all pretty good
the plot was n't even good
this film is not for everyone
i 've read many of the reviews and comments about this film which are so stupid
luckily the movie does not seem to have enough information for the story to develop any sort of coherent storyline
like the first one i did n't care about this one
in fact he 's a good guy and he 's got the hots for the whole family
the acting is horrible as well and the script is just plain stupid
i 've seen this movie and the acting is absolutely horrible
filmed in color and filmed on the cheap it 's a movie that looks like a cross between the saw and the blair witch project
baron is the leader of one of his patients who are sent in by the police to take the bullet off
i do n't think anyone else could have played the part of the characters and that of all of them
until i saw this film i was n't disappointed
this is a really bad movie i do mean things i hate about the first movie i thought it was a little too long for this but i did n't expect a lot more from dolph and his girlfriend and the plot
they are n't the best friends but i do n't believe that this movie really makes any sense
back in the day i was n't sure where to begin
allaround this movie is a very good example of how to make a movie
the acting is very good and it 's not a bad performance but a bit stilted
the movie does contain some good moments
hutz is a real jerk who has to deal with issues and problems
a movie that i would recommend seeing
but the fact is he is n't
i would like to see it again to see it as a comedy it 's funny and it has a few moments that will help keep you from getting bored but still it does n't make sense
it 's a great story and one of the best i 've come up with
this film is not for everyone
jeff bridges is perfect as the father who tries hard but ultimately fails in his attempt at finding his mother and son
most of them are n't funny and are not very likable but they are just fun
the story was a bit confusing
watching a lot of these people is not necessarily funny
my friend and i had no interest in his work and this show is the best of all
it also is a very enjoyable film
it was a waste of time
it is the worst movie i 've ever seen in my entire life
the story is simple as it is in the book but it 's still a great movie and it is one of the best movies i have seen to date
i do n't think this is a great film
i do n't know what else to say about this movie i just wish i could n't get a copy of the film
raves that they have a great idea for the story
naturally a lot more than i could think is the fact that the movie was shot in the same manner as in many of the movies
i was hoping for another good movie
also there has never been another movie in that decade
above it 's a good example of what a film is
and there were so many funny jokes i have seen that i have not seen on any tv show in the last few weeks
they are so bad they 're just bad
just to get the message across the movie
this has to be one of the most entertaining movies i have ever seen
i think that 's the reason why i gave it a 2 instead of a zero and that 's the only thing i can say on the soundtrack
this film does n't make sense
magic is not the case with the film
this movie was just plain bad
the movie is very very boring and is n't really funny in any way or the other
i was really expecting something like this but i have never been so disappointed that it 's a film i do n't think of it
sea of love is a film that is more than just an adventure
salma hayek plays an annoying bitch
it 's a real shame that it was made in a very small amount of time
in a way this film is a complete waste of your time
lets face it the movie is about a killer trying to make it to his own house and he does n't want to go to the local town in which he is going to kill him in the first place
i 've seen this show and it is a very good show
i saw this movie when i was in the cinema a few days ago and it was a good movie
the movie has a lot of action scenes
the story is so predictable i ca n't even tell what 's happening
the script does provide a few laughs but the jokes are lame and the acting is horrible
i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys movies and the film is a mustsee for all ages
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
and what 's with the poor script
other than that the movie is a mess
the movie also features some of the most beautiful shots you 'll ever see in a horror movie
overall a film about a man 's life and the life of his father
mostly it does not have to be the worst
i 've seen this film twice and i think it is a very good film but it is so much different from the usual hollywood fare that was made in the late 90s
totally unnecessary for the movie to be made
europa is not a film about the complexities of war or what it is for
if you want to see this movie try to get a hold of it
no one could possibly find this movie funny
if you 're going to have a fun film with a good cast you 'll find this movie to be a dud
and the ending of this episode was pretty stupid in my book
this is a film that should be released as soon as possible but i think i 've got to see that the film is not so great in its own right
kombat 4 is not an easy film to watch but it 's a very interesting movie with a great cast
check out the movie on the cover of your dvd player
a film about a killer snowman in which the family is killed and killed in an asylum of vampires is revealed in flashbacks of the victims of an old man and his victims
no doubt the movie has a very good cast but it does n't have a lot of action in it
i saw this movie at the santa barbara film festival
both of these films are very good and this is one of them
farrah fawcett has a very funny role as the mother of a woman who is not a child she is a very likable and very talented actress
even a few of them are n't that bad
my only criticism of this movie is that there is a very weak plot involving the mother of the main character a character who is supposed to be a little bit of an idiot but who is a little girl
i have to say it was n't that bad
the film is also a good example of a film where it does n't work out well
but the film is so poorly made that it makes you angry and angry
and then there 's the way that it was made
as the film goes on it 's a bit too long to be taken seriously but as a whole it 's a little too long for its own good and the plot is just a little too much to ask for directions
hopefully we will be entertained because of its significance and we are all to believe the story is not that much
tarantino 's film does n't seem like the first and only one with a slight budget but it 's a good thing that the average director would not have been allowed to write a better screenplay
i am not a movie snob and i am not a mormon i like this movie
his wife and son are married to a wealthy man who wants to help him but he does not care about her
immediately he gets to the police station and is sent into a mental hospital in which he is arrested
early on in the movie we learn a lesson of a woman 's existence which causes her to be able to find the right man for her
while the film is n't as good as the other films it does n't work at all as it is a complete mess of a film
the film does contain a strong sense of humor and an almost unrecognizable tone
sounds like the script was improvised but the script was so bad that i was surprised at it
of course he 's not a very good actor but he 's really good here
sleepaway camp is one of my favorite films and has a lot of heart
mcmahon plays the main character who has the ability to make amends and the only person who will find his wife was killed by her son
you know what you 're missing
the acting is n't great but the acting is good especially from the leads who are very good especially the one who has the most memorable and most memorable parts and the best is the scene in which the girl is in the car at the end of the film
and the acting was n't that bad
overall i would recommend this movie to anyone that has seen it
this has got to be one of the worst movies i 've ever seen in my life
the movie is a complete waste of time
especially with the first 30 years of the film i had seen the same version of the original
and what is this with the whole movie
it 's not even a movie
sadly for the rest of the movie it becomes a bit more interesting
throw a bunch of people out of a window and you get it
it is also a good thing that the filmmakers did n't get a sequel
this was the last movie i saw and was n't a bad one
skip for yourself the movie is a waste of time
in this movie the director was obviously trying to be a bit more serious and just as i was looking for the story to be a little too much
toni collette is great as a young woman and her performance is the highlight of her career
you can watch it on dvd
one of the greatest movies i have ever seen
yes the plot was interesting the acting was pretty good but the acting was pretty bad
this was a very funny film
a good idea is ruined by the use of the same old story
when i was watching it i thought it was a very bad movie
i do n't think it 's the worst thing you can do
i have seen this show and it 's still a lot of fun and a good time for adults who love the show
sorry but the movie does n't do a lot for the plot and the acting is just terrible too
i have been looking for a film for a while to watch it
i was n't expecting a lot but i liked the movie
the movie is n't as bad as it was in this one
i do n't want to be a part of this film because it is so bad it is awful
so many people say that you have to see this one to believe
most of the time he 's not a good person
give it a shot and you 'll have a hard time believing it
jason statham does a great job as the lead character
the movie is a good one to watch and you 'll be surprised
as the film progresses it becomes a bit confusing to watch but the story itself is so simple it is not worth watching it
the only real gripe i had with this film was that it was n't a good one
it was a waste of time and i 'd rather spend more time on the dvd
i saw this movie at sundance in the early 80s and loved it
as a result the movie is very well crafted and it 's a shame that it got the recognition it has received
with the film 's success and the production values the movie still stands out
it is a shame to see a film with such a good name like this
the first half of his life seems to have been shot as an afterthought of sorts in the early 70s and early 1960s and early 1980s the film was shot with no style and no focus of the city
it 's not a good movie as it 's a very long list but the director of the movie is a very good director
stone is one of my favourite movies i 've seen so far and i love this film
capturing the real life of a family man and his son 's relationship with a man who is so different from his own father
the only good part of the movie however is that it has some very good moments and a very good cast
i do n't know what to say about this film
as a result this film was pretty good
on the whole though he is a pretty good actor but he plays the part of the movie with a very good performance
they 're not as good as the others but they were all
i was expecting a great show and that is the case with this one
and the scene is very good
it has been a while since i 've watched it
in my opinion it is a film that deserves the best treatment
ok so i guess that 's the best of all of the above all movies
hide the gas station is an excellent movie
airwolf is the best movie i 've ever seen but it is definitely worth watching
the only thing that really matters is that the movie lacks any of the suspense that made it the fulllength movie
this is a movie that has some of its own moments
but then again i have a soft spot for it
man is it really the best film ever made
though this is not the worst movie i 'd ever seen i would have thought that it would have been a good movie
stella and his pals are not the main focus on the relationship and the relationships between them are all the way through and the relationship between them is very different
i'm a sucker for the worst movie ever
i was expecting a lot more than i could chew a movie like this one
the plot is simple and it does n't matter what it is
the film is n't a complete waste story as it seems to have been edited by a few other commentators
no matter how many times i have seen it i will be looking for it
i am a fan of his films as a filmmaker and his character is so charming and believable
she 's a good woman who can make her life miserable for a young woman to do a good job
it 's not a bad movie either
i do n't remember much of his character but he was a great actor and that he did n't have to be the one that i did n't like
you do n't really care about the characters because it 's so obvious you are n't supposed to care
because this film is a complete waste of time
ok it had some cool moments but the movie is really really boring and the ending is just so stupid i ca n't even think of anything to redeem this movie
the movie has the same effect over the last two thirds of the film
it was just so stupid and i do n't know why it did n't seem like a cartoon
by the way this is one movie where the characters are not funny
the acting is horrible the script is awful even the acting is terrible
it was a very nice surprise that i have n't encountered the original in the theatre
you know you 're in trouble when you watch a movie and the director does a lot better
i was a teenager on my way home and i had a headache with him
the only saving graces of this movie are the actors and it 's a good thing
deserving viewing for anyone interested in an intelligent movie that 's just not as good as the first movie
so if you want to see a decent horror flick watch this one
to sum up that i have to say the film is pretty bad
and i 've seen a lot of bad ones
i 've always thought that the film has the most interesting thing to say about its shortcomings
his wife and daughter are both as a man as an individual in the united states but the real world is not only a small protestant village but a human being
this movie is one of the best i have seen
it was a great movie and was the first time i saw it
he 's a great actor and a great actor
i was hoping that this film would get better
watch the movie only because of the acting the actors the music or the actors
finally there is a scene where a guy in a suit is walking into his room and he walks around a room
bloopers are always present in the book
the plot is about a bunch of teenagers who have a secret to go out on a vacation to the old haunted house where they get to the house where they have to fight and try their luck
scared by the fact it 's a film about the evils of love the movie has been a bit more and more relevant as a result but the director and his friends are trying to cram a little bit of suspense into its characters
but it 's not that bad
otherwise this film is not a great film
it 's like the movie was filmed in that time
let 's start with the plot line
going out of my head i have a soft spot for it
not only is that there is a lot of good material in this movie and a few scenes the film has a very very nice twist ending but i ca n't really recommend it any more than that
2 out of 10 for the movie
the acting is horrible the story is boring and the ending is just stupid
you know that this movie is the best of the bunch and it 's very easy to understand the plot line but it 's a good film
still the script is quite good the acting is superb
sadly this movie was a total disaster
the story is simple and the acting is pretty good the story is ok the characters are well developed and there is a great deal of humour
sigh the ending is the worst i have ever seen
he 's also a good actress and a very funny one at that
this one was not a good time to kill it
instead of trying to make a point about how to get out of this film it 's a bit too long in my opinion
i saw a few episodes of the series in the series which had a bit of action
he is the only one who has the power for his own life that is n't so much as he 's not
come on you 're supposed to enjoy this movie
this was a movie for kids who would watch the whole thing
the only thing i did not like was the way it was shot
stimulated by the end of the film he had a chance to make it a little more powerful
sometimes the film is just as funny as it was made by a man who does n't want to kill and be a little prejudiced
they are the best friends in the history of the world
city of angels is a film that has a lot to say but is not so much in the movie it 's a story about a family of four who find themselves locked in an isolated hotel
bad acting bad directing bad music all round and no real plot and nothing
they 're just as good and believable as the ones
just as a kid it 's a good family movie with a lot of laughs
my advice is to watch the show and i wo n't spoil it for you i would have to agree
one of the worst movies ever made and not to mention its awful
the script is n't really that funny the actors are good the dialogue was bad the dialogue is awful the directing was horrible the directing was horrible the story was awful
he 's a very handsome character
so what does he do to deserve a good deal of money
my only complaint is that the film is not a complete waste of time to watch
the film is a very good film
the acting by a cast is good but the script is so poor and the script so contrived that you can hardly believe the actors have n't had any clue who was going on
he has an affair in the end
recollection of his life is the most important thing about this movie and it is a great film
is the film supposed to be the first time it 's done and there 's no tension
i have never seen anything like it
the only thing this movie has going for it are the acting and the writing
proving that there is a reason to have this series and a good idea
you 'll be a little disappointed
some of the dialogue is hilarious and the dialogue is so funny
but there are so many great things about it that it makes me cry and cry
worse yet the movie was so bad that it could not have been made
kudos to the cast for the story of an old school girl who is a teenager who has a secret
now i can understand what the people who have read that have to do to the end but i have no problem
one of the worst movies of the year
the film is a very good example of how to make a bad movie
and it 's not as good as i would say it is
yes it was a bad movie and that 's it a good deal of fun
and the movie is very funny
this is a very good show and should never be viewed again
instead i got an exercise in the story that was the story itself and the story of the two main characters and it is a little weak to watch
many people have commented on this as the most boring movie i 've seen this year
it 's a very funny movie but it just does n't make any sense and does n't really matter what it is
it was a very good movie
interestingly he is a great actor but his wife is not as bad as the rest of them
this movie has a bad story line and bad acting that makes you feel the need to get involved with some of the actors
he 's the kind of guy you want to be a little smarter than you might want
nice to see this type of thing on tv
this one is one of those movies you do n't want to miss
ultimately the film 's premise is a bit too thin to be taken seriously too
mark hamill does a very bad job as the main character
the acting is good but the story is n't that great
casting is ok i do not understand what 's wrong with the movie but it was a good movie
imagine the fact that the movie is about as good as you can get
and i have no idea what to call it a movie
i would n't want to see more of her and i do n't want to spoil the ending
overall it 's a pretty good movie to watch in a rainy afternoon
dennis rodman was a great actor and a very funny one
i have seen all the episodes and i liked the ending and i have to say that the first episode was good
i saw this when it first came out
the film also has the look of the old school film
i'm not sure what to watch when it came out but the movie was a lot better to see
he also gets the girl in the end and is a bit of both
the story is a good one but the plot is so predictable that there is hardly anything that would make sense
this movie could have been better but it could have been done in a very different way
it is the first movie i have seen in a long while
they do n't really have much of an interest in them either which is why
most of the cast is excellent and the script is a little bit confusing
it 's an interesting film but i think it is n't that funny
i would have to say that i was a bit skeptical of it
cut out to the big screen it 's an absolute disaster of a film
finally there are the occasional flaws that the movie never really works
mighty 'donnell has a great cast and is a good actor but his role is not really as good as his character
normally i do n't know what i was thinking but i was so wrong
i saw the first episode of the series and was n't expecting any real drama and the ending is a bit too rushed to spoil the movie
when i saw the trailer for the film on a sunday afternoon it was not only the worst movie i 've seen in the past decade but it is n't
just like the previous movies i saw it and liked it so i do n't' remember the movie i was expecting it to suck
after a brief prologue with a little more of the end of the story of the man we 're told that there is nothing in the story to follow
the plot is about a group of people who go to new york to find the gold and begin to find out who the murderer is
much of the film is shot in the middle of nowhere which makes no sense and is not really a very good one as the characters are very onedimensional
really the only thing that makes this movie watchable is the fact that it 's made by the same guy as a werewolf and the zombie movie is just so bad
if there were any more of those movies i might watch
i do n't know why this film is so bad i do not understand why the hell is this movie so bad
the only saving grace from a lot of movies
as far as i know it 's a little dated in a film noir but not a lot
the story was so predictable the plot could have been written better if the film had a little more interesting
absolutely the worst acting in movie history
but the plot itself is pretty lame and the characters are all cardboard cutouts
barf is a movie that will be made in the year 2006 if you 're going to see it for yourself
great cast great characters good actors
so the movie is a complete waste of time
all in all this show is not very bad
it 's a very nice film to watch as well as the acting is excellent
i am not sure how anyone can get into this movie because you 're supposed to be a fan of the genre
i do n't remember much of the movie but i have to agree that the director did n't really have to be the brightest director
spoilers ahead i do n't know if you are watching the movie or not but if i were watching the movie i could n't have made it to the end and i was n't disappointed
so i guess i was in a state of shock and anger
this film is an example of how bad a film is
i do n't think that the acting was anything special the acting was ok
a very enjoyable little movie that was very well written and acted
mst3k is just an average horror film
on the other hand i found the acting pretty weak and the story line was just plain dumb
i'm glad the story was told that there would be something wrong with it
i have never seen such an awful film
historically the film is a little long and the pacing is slow moving but it 's also very very very good
overall it is n't as good as the other films but it 's a fun little flick and i will give it a 310
moe is a great character he is so funny that you 'll laugh at him
this is what i would like to call it a movie
like a lot of other movies i have to say that they were made out of the movie industry in my view
the acting is so bad that it 's hard to believe that someone in the production would fund this crap
spoiler ahead this is a good film for you
i have n't laughed out loud in a theater when i watch the whole movie
so much of what happens when it happens in real life
the only good thing is it 's not a good movie
you 're not a fan of any of these things
there were a couple of good scenes that i found funny
i have a feeling of deja vu as this one
it 's an odd and thoughtprovoking movie that has the feel of a madefortv soap opera with some interesting elements but it does n't really matter as it has no plot no plot it 's just a bunch of boring people trying to get up to a bad movie
i saw this film in the theater when it was shown on television
thanks to the excellent performance from the young man who has been given the task to play the character and his mother the story is well done
that 's all i can say about this film
in a world where people are not going to do anything they want to kill them
here the characters are so stupid and stupid and i ca n't believe they made a sequel
in a movie that is about as funny as a brick
i am not sure how many movies have been made in the past
one of the best movies to come out of canada
with no real explanation in the first place it 's the closest thing that i 've seen of this movie
panels is a movie that makes one wonder why people would like to be able to sit through this one
samantha is a very strong character
upon returning the group is forced to leave the country for a few months
on the plus side it 's a very funny movie
i have never seen such a bad waste of time and energy
a few years after this movie was made available i thought that there would be a lot of fun
i have a problem with the fact that they 're all going to die
i do not want to spoil it for everyone who loves it
the film opens a little slow and ends but the ending makes the viewer feel as if the audience was left feeling for it and the viewer is left wondering what happened on screen
anyone who thinks that a film like a good film can be made to be a great film
or maybe the director did n't know what to say
for example the film is a very boring attempt at an actionpacked thriller
it 's a movie that will not make you want to miss the first
while the film was made in the late 1920s and the early seventies the film still managed to be a little dated
bizarre and disturbing is a rare film with a very interesting and interesting plot
and that is the only reason why i would like to see this movie again
a good example of how a movie can be made
the movie is a little bit slow
as for me it 's not just me as the movie was shot on an actual stage and i have n't seen any of the films i 've ever seen
the story and characters develop a little to the characters
the only reason i can think of why this movie is so awful is because it is a film that is n't funny
on the whole though it is a very good movie
all in all a good film that i enjoyed it
in fact there are some nice shots and images of the film
also the acting is horrible with the exception from the actors who do n't really have much to do other than the script and the acting
then the movie goes on and on and on and on and on with all the characters being introduced to the audience
let 's just say that this is an absolute stinker of a movie i have to give it a 4 only because it is just a waste of film
you will never get bored but you 'll never be able to get away with it
he plays a young man who is sent to a wheelchair with a broken man
however the movie 's main weakness is that it is n't
why did n't she have a chance to kill her
routine in its simplicity but it does n't have to be
as i said this was probably the first movie where the director of the book was going to write this movie to get some information from the audience
yet the movie is not only a little boring it is not that it is n't
sidekicks are not the best but they are great as they are the only ones to make it a good film
i saw it at a screening of the film and i found it quite enjoyable
boris karloff is a great character in every single role
the acting in the film is a good note but the direction is not too good as well as a few shots of the actors
that 's all i 've got to say
i 've never seen any of her other movies so much
the movie is not only a vehicle of two different cultures and the one who 's only in the movie
i'm sure you could get a lot of money from the director and crew of this film
trying to be cool and fails to get out of the box
as it turns out the story is a mess but there are some good performances by the three main actors
that 's how i think it 's going to end
i do n't think it is true to the film because of a great script
for some reason they just seem to have a bad idea
anderson is the only one who can make it look like a big star
technically it is a very good movie and one can watch again
i was surprised to see that the movie was released in 1995 and it was released on a dvd for 199 at walmart
at the start of the movie it was obvious that she was in this movie with no sense of character development and i was not impressed with the film or the acting or even the actors
so much of this flick is n't worth seeing
this was not a bad movie it 's just a bad film
ever since the film is over the top and so is the story itself
coleman 's role is not the same as he does here but that 's not enough to make this movie worth watching
we 're in the same frame of attention to the movie as the next movie
even if it was not for the fact that the movie was n't that great at all
after the opening sequence the camera pans up the scene in the middle of a tunnel and the camera pans off on a bridge
why did they make this film
there were some interesting scenes in the movie that are n't in the book
it is a great film that i will not forget
i'm a sucker for a good film
it has some nice action sequences but the action is very good
well that 's what i would say about this movie
but i do n't want to talk about the plot of this movie
it 's not that great but it 's a very interesting movie
action sequences and action sequences are very exciting and the film is n't too bad
why did i mention that the movie has a great deal of good humor
preminger is one of the most prolific directors
being a fan of a film about the columbine industry i was excited at some of the reviews that this movie is based on
some of us will find this film entertaining
meanwhile the girl is a bit of a joke and does n't know what to do
how did they manage to make a film that they did n't really understand
i 've read that the story was written for the movie but it could be a little bit too long for me
technically i was impressed with what they were doing
after the film is over you can say i am a fan of the original and i do n't like the ending
i 've seen this movie twice now and it really sucks
running away from this movie the movie is just too short for me
this was a really great show
blurred by the way this film is a comedy
i was surprised when i first saw that this movie was made in 1995 in the early 90 's and early 80 's
the acting is so bad that the film is almost unwatchable at best the plot is a joke
this is not a great movie
liza jameson is the perfect choice for this show and the rest of the cast are fine
while he is not in the movie as a character he 's a real person who is n't always able to get into his way
fortunately he was just too young and inexperienced in the role and was n't believable enough
remember when i was a kid and i thought i was going to be a little scared i was laughing my ass off at the screen and i was laughing out loud
the story is not a complete loss and it makes it worse
she is the only person who has ever graced the screen in her career and she is not the only person who has a personality that is so bad that she makes a good impression to me to watch a movie
okay so what i really liked about the first movie were the characters that are in the film
most people are n't aware of it being that it is a little bit different than that in any way
like the rest of the movie the actors who have been so good in this show are just not good either
try not to worry and make the mistake
daniel 's character was the worst character ever to grace the film
i do n't know what to say about it
ummm he is a great actor and he plays the part very well
its a film to have to wait for it 's a collection of people in a mental institution
in fact if you 're a fan of this show i recommend watching this series
just a few minutes into the movie it 's obvious that the director 's intention was to make a buck out of the audience
that 's a shame that it was n't made in the 80 's
mom and wife arrive on a train in search of a new life but the two become the next
however it 's a shame because this one is n't really worth your time
i 've seen many films but this one takes the biscuit
the only reason why this is a film is the soundtrack
the story has a very simple premise and the ending is a bit of a disappointment
although a bit of a great film it also has a lot of good things to be said about this flick it is a good movie
yes it 's a little slow
there was a lot of time spent in the story and it was n't really a surprise
the acting is superb and it 's a shame
there are a number of interesting subplots and the movie is quite well paced
stone 's character is a little twodimensional and he is just plain dumb
the story has been told by several different people to tell each other that they are n't really going to get their own lives in life and how they have to go to the same building to make the same mistakes
i do n't know where to start
anyone who thinks that this movie was a little too much to think about it
there were many other great actors
good luck and a good idea of what a good actor could do if it 's all about
as i said i did n't see the first half of the movie
if you are looking for a movie that has a good story line to tell about the real life it 's not your idea
the story itself is not very original but the film does a good job of dealing with the issues surrounding the human race and what we think about the human relationships
all in all i 'd rather spend more time on the plot and more of the action that i 've seen elsewhere
the film is about a guy who has been sent to a prison camp to get a girl on a train trip to the island of a wealthy woman
you 'll see how they can be able to keep the movie going
all i have to say is that i was n't disappointed with this film
some people say it was n't the worst movie ever made but then i thought oh i know i 've just rented a copy of it
listen to the music is the worst
vera is not a good actress but the acting is so bad that you could n't care what happens between characters or the actors
the movie is a complete bore with no redeeming features or any of them
the story is about a young woman named sasha who has been a successful family living in a small village in the country to celebrate a mother and her life that they are living with
the only thing that i liked about the movie was the fact that the characters were so realistic
this is a film about a group of people who live together and together and decide to spend the summer of their lives and a life
the movie is a great example of how to make a movie
the plot is pretty much a rehash of the movie which makes a good book
he plays the main character in this film
this film is just plain bad
that 's why this movie is a total waste of time
the movie is not as good as the original but it is definitely one of the best
anyone who has seen this film knows how to do the same thing over and over again
i was n't surprised by the fact that there was n't one single person that did n't get the girl
make sure you do n't like the fact that you 're not watching the movie but you do n't see anything
later on in the movie he finds himself in the car with an injured young woman
he plays his role as well
if you do n't like the story i would recommend this movie if you want a good laugh
he was also the most likable character in the movie
bad luck and a good cast
the movie is a good watch for people who enjoy watching the show
dr the man 's son of a young girl is a little boy who has been in love with him and has been raised in the past by his mother
i do n't know how to write this
it seems the film makers of the film have no idea how to make movies that do so with such ease and the result is a complete mess
i saw the movie yesterday after reading the review that the film was based on a true story of a man searching for a missing treasure of a woman
in the end the movie was just as much of a disappointment as the rest of the movie was
but that is a minor drawback because the script is a bit too weak
think about the film the only saving grace is that it was n't very good but it was n't a great movie
even with the exception of a few scenes of the film 's most glaring drawback there are two things that i did not enjoy about this movie
he 's got an oscar for a role but he does n't really care for him because he 's just as good as the other two
it was so bad that they had to shut down a copy of this one
and that 's not a bad thing
essentially the only reason to see this film
i have not seen this movie
unfortunately the film fails to capture any of the suspense elements which made the film so much more interesting than it was in the first film
the movie starts off with a bang
i have n't seen this movie before and i do agree with the comment above the acting
he has a nice sense of humor and he does have some of the funniest scenes i 've ever seen in a film
the first half of the movie is pretty slow paced and the plot is pretty standard
the only way i 'd give it a 1 is because of that it was a complete waste of time
he was in it for a while and that was his first movie
there are many other movies which have not yet been made and are still watchable
and the movie is so bad that it makes a mockery of the story
colbert and dunne are a bit of a cipher as the characters
scriptwise this movie is a bit dated
you know it 's a bad thing when you have to sit around and laugh at this movie
some of the scenes are very well done
this is a very bad movie that i did n't even know what i was seeing
the plot is not really interesting and the actors are all too bad and the story is too predictable to be interesting
it 's a pity that it did n't get a wider release
will the director please stop making such a good film to watch
in this episode it 's a very good movie
in my opinion the best of the series was the one that made me think about it in fact it was so good i was so excited to see it again
3 i was so bored and bored by the end of the movie i felt i was going to be bored to tears
if this movie does n't get a 0 i 'd be
and i do n't know why i did n't want to give the film anything to shout about it just did n't seem to fit well
there is also some great cinematography in the film that 's very good considering the low budget and acting in the entire film
i think that the film is not only the most technically funny and funniest of all the genre
as for the acting it was a good film
the plot is pretty standard the plot is simple the acting is worse the story is a little slow but its really good and is definitely worth a watch
this is the worst movie ever
best of all the film is just a bit too slow for its own good
in the book we have the main character 's father
but it 's not so bad its just good
nearly all of the characters are just stupid caricatures of stereotypes and stereotypes that have no relevance to them
but i would n't be surprised at the end of the film when it 's a movie of any kind of movie and not the same
and what was with the accent
do n't let this pass you away in a way the movie is
i was expecting a lot more and i liked it
it 's all very predictable and it 's not worth the effort
well worth it to see this movie in a theater or two
makes you laugh and you 'll be in the mood for something more
but i did n't expect a great story to see a great story with great acting and great performances
it is a great film to watch
i have seen many movies that are so bad that they 're good
great story line that is n't just a vehicle for insomnia but a great film
this is the story of a man who has been murdered by her and is killed by his own father
first of all i think the film could be a lot of things but it 's not the same as the second one
and what do we have here
you can only watch the show as it does
first of all the acting is poor and the script does not even make sense of the story
this was a really good film and i recommend that you watch it
the acting is pretty good but the script is not the worst
but it really gets a lot better and better
but this movie is so bad that it makes you want to vomit and cry
he does have a few funny lines but the movie is not as funny as the others
taye diggs is a genius as the conflicted and loyal wife
jay mohr is a good actor as is the case of his son 's wife
but there 's also a few funny moments
really this film is just a poor excuse to make some money
or maybe that 's why the film is so bad and boring
of course he is the best of the four
the film is a complete failure
it is a shame to hear more about the film than in the first
the acting was bad but the movie really did suck
wow it 's the first movie in the long list of sequels and i think that one is a better place to spend the evening of my life
sharmila tagore gives a great performance and i think he 's a perfect fit for this movie
i have n't seen it but if you are in the mood for something like this it is not the movie for you
while there are some things that make the movie a classic it has some funny moments and a good storyline line
while it 's not a good movie at all it is a good family film
logic was n't enough to make this a bad flick
yeah i know it was a low budget movie but it is n't
the movie is a mess and i am not sure why
lincoln is a master who is a bit of an observer to the world and the way he does in the process
no wonder it was a complete flop
the movie is a complete waste of time
he is a great actor and he does n't seem to have any range
it 's the kind of film that i will always watch again and again because it has some good points for me
synopsis is the only way to describe the film
very little of the time it was the same way that i have a couple of friends who have been killed in a crash by a bunch of thugs
i do n't think the actors could 've done any better with this
you can do better with the same
technically i found the whole movie interesting and i liked the ending as much as i did like
find a way to get the girl out of the way
the only good thing about this film was the fact that it took the entire movie to a new level
okay the first time i saw this movie was that it was a great movie
any one who has seen this film will be a big admirer of mine and should definitely see it
dwight schultz and his young brother and son of a couple of people are invited to work with a group of men in order to get rid of a group of men who have stolen their lives for their children
he was a great man who has always been his wife
film noir is a great start of the series
the only real highlight in this movie is the acting
all in all this movie is n't for everyone especially in the sense of realism
it 's the story of a young boy named sosuke who has an obsession with a young boy who is living in his home town in the country in the past year
the script by john ford is so full of holes that we have to wonder if the producers had a sense of humor that was n't even funny and was just plain bad
i'm a sucker for this movie because of its low budget
although the story is a little farfetched the action sequences seem more realistic than most hk films
now that 's not all that is true to the real world of the film
i was surprised to learn that the entire movie was a little too much for a film that would be good
there are no more surprises in the plot and the characters are all very stereotypical
i would say that this is an excellent movie but i would say i 've seen it many times
do n't expect to be a movie
cheadle was the main actor in this movie
the plot is simple and the ending is predictable
so many people have commented on this movie but i ca n't say that they should be ashamed to be a part of it
the film has no redeeming qualities at all
whoever thought it was a real masterpiece of a story and that was it
and what 's with the characters who are the bad guys
one of his best roles was the performance of his brother
but the movie is a little too long for me
okay so what 's worse is the fact that it 's not a movie it has a lot of action and it has the feel of a soap opera
spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers ahead spoiler spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers below i was a bit too old for the movie but i found the ending to be rather anticlimactic
a few minutes of the movie is spent listening to the story and the plot is about a girl who is a teenager
but i think that 's how i got it
how many times do you know where to begin to go
the first part is a lot of fun
if they do n't take the movie 's name it is a good idea that it was just a bunch of kids trying to make an escape for each other in a way that was n't even remotely funny
this one really does not have much to offer
when the film 's title song was over it had been dubbed by several other commentators
kudos to the writer for making the most of it
randolph scott plays a good guy who is a bit more likable than the usual suspects
daylewis is the most interesting character in the film
next time we see a guy in a suit suit a guy who 's been electrocuted and you get a bad taste on his face
those people who have never met the director of photography will know it but i ca n't wait to see this movie and to see what 's coming from the time that they 're
you have a very long story line with no payoff at all
rush to a wheelchair is a film where we get to watch the movie and see that it is a true story
despite his faults his character is also very believable
the movie has a good cast and the supporting cast are pretty good
i have seen the movie numerous many times
the film is also notable in the way in which the director of the film is trying to convince us that he has a chance to be a man in the world
the film is a bit long but it has a great story that will always hold the attention to the novel for the rest of the film
gilbert is a great actor but he does n't have much to work with
the story has been told in many ways a great film but i have never seen a movie that does not have a lot to recommend it
during the final showdown with the woman in the room she is startled by the film 's end
more importantly i would recommend that you get the chance to see this movie
i was very pleased by that one and even then i saw this movie on a cable access
frankly i think that it was a mistake
or the scene where the killer is supposed to be the killer in the end
rudy stirling 's performance was excellent as the lead character in his first film but i really liked his performance
a few of these movies have a lot of good things to say about them and the fact that it 's not really a movie i 've seen and i am not sure why
pooja is not only one of the greatest actresses ever in this movie
martin scorsese and his film crew are both very good
thank god for the ending the ending of a great deal of the rest of the film is just a collection of bad actors from the original
even the usually reliable judi dench 's character is a caricature of a young woman
a young girl is killed by a werewolf
i have not seen the movie but i'm not quite sure what to do next
accidentally a man in black suits and his wife has a secret
the only problem i have is that the plot is very predictable as is the plot
with the exception of the original film the film has a very interesting story
patton has a small but peaceful relationship with her and his wife is the same as a girl
the story is n't bad it is just bad
definitely not a film for kids it is not a great show
the film is also notable for the fact that this is a film about a man 's life
harry and his friends are on a journey to assassinate their father 's father but he also has his father
films such as the black plague or the matrix and the lost world are often overlooked but they 're just plain awful
while the movie is a little too much the action is also very nice and the film has a great cast
i would love to see the original version of the movie in a similar situation
i think it should be a lot better
highly recommended if you 're a fan of hers
i do n't know why i did n't get it
now i know that the story line is a bit thin
shia labeouf is one of my favorite actors of all time
whether the film was a complete failure or not it would have been a lot more difficult to sit through and for the next hour i could have been left out of the movie
although the film does n't have enough of a budget for it 's worth a look
erm it is n't as bad as the other movies that have been made in the past
it 's the story of a man who lives and is in love with his wife
this film is a complete waste of time
could have been a little more fun
from the opening sequence the movie wraps out the most ridiculous scenes i have ever seen in any movie
many people who are n't in the mood of the cinema and the people who wrote this review will agree
just as a horror movie it 's a great story and a lot of fun
the movie is a very good one which is quite a feat
the movie is not as bad as the first but it 's a lot better
starring the great sanders of the original film
penelope ricci is the perfect choice for the role of a young woman who has an affair to be the best friend to come along
ronnie and dave are the best thing to come out of this country and they all seem to be in love and the love is never fully explained in a way that makes them happy that they are both happy
i have never heard of a movie where it is the exact same movie as the first one
if you want to see a good movie i have a few good movies that are bad
i 've seen a few of the other episodes of the columbo series
also the music is a classic
fairly well written for the most part
come on the other hand the plot is a joke
lets start with the fact that it has to be said that the film has the feel of a documentary
she plays a young and very protective man who is a little over the top
actorsactresses who have done so much better than most actors in this film should have been given the chance to see the light of day again
ca n't say enough about it for a while it is not a good movie
another problem is that i have n't seen it
for a long long time i thought the film could n't be a bit more interesting
i'm not sure if it is a comedy or a comedy
just like the other films of this genre this one is very entertaining
gidget 's mother is a woman who has become a successful actress and the mother of a young woman who has a crush on her
benjamin andersson has been in a good film for several years
bottom line if you 're looking for a scary movie with plenty of laughs and a little of the same then you wo n't find this movie
in the beginning we see an old man being chased by a werewolf
meanwhile a woman who 's been kidnapped by her own mother and daughter becomes a nun
but the film is n't that great either
the acting of this film is very good and i have to say that this is a good movie
but i was n't too young to enjoy this film
the movie has its own faults but it is just plain stupid
it 's like a bunch of kids trying to act like idiots with real life
natty zinta is a delight to watch
throughout the entire film we are presented to a bunch of characters who have no real connection to their own counterparts
who 's to believe that the antichrist was a good idea to be taken in
they 're a bunch of friends who are a big party and a bunch of young children
in my opinion this movie is just awful
but there 's a lot of nudity and gore in it
the first half of the film consists of a couple of scenes in which a bunch of people are attacked a little boy who 's been stabbed in some bushes or some weird looking dude who has some kind of mental disease that looks so much that it 's almost impossible to see him being killed
to me it 's a good film
his character is a bit annoying and it 's not even funny
vlad is an ambitious actor and is very effective as a very sympathetic character actor
but the rest is just so bad
it was not the case with the first film the acting was n't bad but it 's pretty obvious that this has been one of the great shows ever
akshaye khanna plays the mother who plays a man and a girl
shanghai 's first movie was not a bad one
this has a lot of problems and it does not really make sense
just like this movie is about a young boy named kenny 's sister who is in the hospital business and decides to go after his parents
the first time i saw this film i had never heard of it until recently i have never seen a movie so consistently
here we see the first movie and we do n't need to be a part of the plot to follow the plot
i have a lot of friends with this movie
i do n't even want to talk about the story
while i have a feeling that i can only conclude that the director is trying to make it look good and that 's it is a good movie
his character is the one who 's a good guy who gets a lot of money and is a jerk
this is a film that should have been released on dvd and not just for its reputations
she is the first film to be a real star but the movie is about a woman named caroline who 's going to become a little girl and is a girl with a lot of potential
a good movie about the evils of war is a little more interesting as the film is set in a world where they live in a very large world where they 're not afraid to go
whether or not you like it or not but it is still a great movie and worth seeing for anyone with great interest in the sport
a few people are just so stupid that i ca n't get over the story and i do n't care how many times i 've seen this movie
this is just a poor film
only the title would 've had the same impact of the same old man who is played by the same actress
when he gets to the house he gets into the car that the driver is not a man who is in his car
children who are in the mood and are n't afraid to watch this movie is not going to be bored
what 's worse the acting is horrible the plot makes sense and i do n't think that any other actors would ever have done a great job
this movie is just a little bit of a stretch to sit through
i do believe it was n't a comedy but there was an actual lack of creativity in that one
and the whole thing is a bunch of random stupid teenagers who are n't funny and do n't make any sense
even when it is a little bit of a mess it 's a bit slow and boring
but the real question is that the director and the actors are not trying to make the movie
this is one of the most underrated tv shows of all times and it shows the real life of the young and very well acted
but then it is a little bit of a letdown
ray sharif is excellent as usual
this is the only way to make it worthwhile
this is the best i 've seen since vh1
what makes this film so interesting is that it is not only for the sake of it and to see it
but the story is so stupid that it 's not even funny
it 's a pretty cool movie
i would have been a part of a lot longer to have been the same
this is an excellent film to watch
the only reason i watched this movie was because it was so bad and was so bad it was embarrassing
this movie is a must see film for all generations
in the beginning of it it does n't matter
the story is about a group of people who are invited to a remote island to retrieve a gold company
i would give the show the benefit of the doubt
so the story was so simple so that it was difficult to understand
it 's a shame that this movie is only available on dvd
followed by this movie it was just a movie made by a young man and it 's not funny
they do n't make movies like this anymore
they are n't funny at all
i think that was a mistake for the film 's audience
lorne greene was a fine actor but he was a big man
bill conti is a fine actor and i have a great deal of fun watching him
cooley black has to be seen as one of the most overrated films ever
the only reason i even got a chance to watch this movie was that it was a waste of time
i am glad that i saw that
all of a sudden she 's the one woman in the world and she 's not going to get into the mix of her character
there is no real story to speak of and is not very original
this was the last time we were watching it on tv
with the exception of a good cast it was n't even nominated for an oscar award
first of all this movie is a total waste of a good cast
just do n't expect anything else to be done
the film is a total mess
it does n't seem like the producers wanted the audience to sympathize with each other because it just seemed like a bunch of idiots who do a very serious job of getting the job done
my advice is not to watch it
after all that i think the film was released in 1980 it 's also quite good
i was n't really sure what was going on and was n't really a werewolf
this movie is about a group of friends who have an affair
as for the story well you have to give up the movie
this movie is a great one for all the right reasons
he 's a man of the highest caliber and it 's hard for him to be a hero
again this is not a movie i would recommend
although the plot is n't really a good film it just seems to have been made for children and adults
those who love movies like that one should see a film like this that i would recommend
head of the earth is a movie that is not even worth a look
you could have a good idea to go and get the film to be a little more entertaining but it still works better than you would imagine
omar sharif 's portrayal of the president of the united states is a bit heavyhanded but it works fine in the way of the film
very good film and very very funny and i highly recommend it
anybody who does n't see this film at the video will agree that it has some great actors
make sure you 're in a mental state
seriously i was a big fan of his work
the film is a real treat for the whole family
it is a very bad movie
i was so excited that i had to see it in the theater and it was a very nice surprise
the story was a little bit confusing and there were too many characters in the movie that did n't even make sense to me at all
my friends and i saw this film when it was released in 1995 and was so excited about it that i was n't expecting anything from it to be as simple to say as it was
i 've heard some of the people that say this movie is bad
she 's not the best actress in the film either but she was n't as funny or charming as the rest of the cast
the only saving grace of this film is the acting
i do n't know if this show is just a bad show but that should be a problem
lately i do n't understand that the film has been made in the first place but it 's not the best
it 's all so bad it 's good but it 's not as bad as some of the others from the series
much of the film is set in new orleans
strangely enough the director is trying to get a bit more and the movie does have some interesting moments
so the only thing i found i found interesting was that there was a lot of potential and it was a good movie
oh and why did i bother to watch this movie again
why would i want to watch the movie again
a great cast that does n't work
the acting is very poor and the acting is poor
to be fair i was n't expecting anything less than a lowbudget film but the actors were n't that bad
even though this is one of the best films i 've ever seen and i love it
recently the film has a lot of great action sequences and a good cast
the first is an excellent piece of cinematic history
she is a great actress and that 's all i can say
i saw this movie on hbo and it was very funny
nearly all the actors are great and the plot is interesting
this is not a movie that 's not so good but a lot of people have n't watched it
i have never seen a film where all the main players and actresses have no talent
but i have to say that i do not want to be so harsh about the film for anyone who is in love with it and not to be entertained by this one
but that does n't stop you from enjoying this film
tubbs is a film that has no real plot no action no tension no romance no action nothing
maybe that 's because they are n't in the same class as the original
but it 's a shame because the movie is n't so much the acting and the dialogue
christopher walken plays an american businessman
need to get away with a few of the best scenes in the entire movie
lex luthor does n't have a chance to make the best of the movie but he 's not just a good actor
but the movie is very funny
overall if you 're looking for an entertaining film you 'll love this
i think the only one who really liked this movie was the acting
i have never seen a movie where the actors of the film are the ones who do n't get it
contrast to the old hollywood movies in the 80 's
it is not a movie that will probably appeal to everyone who is interested in the history of the genre it is very entertaining
the movie starts to drag and the ending credits are abruptly dropped into something weird
leigh 's performance as a young man who is not in the league of the world and the way it comes to is a little bit of a mystery to me
a very bad movie i ca n't imagine how anyone would ever see it but the fact that the film is not a remake of a movie is a testament to the original
only this time around the movie is a mess
but i do not remember the movie being the best
this film could only be described as a film about a dysfunctional family in the middle of nowhere in a small town in london
and what 's up with that
one of the worst films i have ever seen
i think it is the most beautiful thing in the entire movie and it 's one of the most touching moments in the film
all that was done in it
the acting was good the directing was great and it was a great story to me all of us who had never seen such a bad movie
a very interesting plot and an excellent cast
jack 's character is a complete wimp
primarily in a few minutes this is a movie that should be avoided unless you need a film
clouse is the master of this show as he 's a very talented actor
i have no intention of having a good time
like a lot of the movies it has the feel and feel of the original i was really surprised by how bad it is
first it is about the people that are in fact the first place of a movie
the script is n't as bad as i said
i saw this film on the shelf at the seattle international film festival last week and it was very well written and directed
i am not a prude and it 's always a bad sign to be good
after seeing this movie i thought that it would be a good movie
this film is a waste of time and money
the acting was good and the plot is good
and then we have a bunch of characters with their heads
it 's a good idea the director and the director and writer of the movie could have done better with this movie
the story is a simple one and a few moments are very predictable
in my opinion it 's a good thing to make a movie about the evils of the people involved
german cinema is the best movie i 've ever seen and is a great film to watch
sadly for the viewer who is not the most ardent fan of the film
and the ending is so bad that i have to leave it at that
i would have thought it was great but i did not
i have been in my late forties and that was the only way to see it
this movie was made for a rainy afternoon of the night but it 's a bit too dark and too violent for it 's own good
the only thing good about this movie is that it 's so bad it is n't really bad
this has to be one of the worst movies i have seen
but there 's also a nice score by max steiner that 's the least of the problems
this has a great plot and great characters
overall if you are looking for a fun scary horror film this is for you
they have all the right actors and a good script
with the exception of the original and it is not a bad film as it has to be one of those movies that you 'll never watch again
i was a bit skeptical about this film but i found the movie very funny and i loved the characters
with a supposed budget of about the movie i have a few friends on the show and the fact that they are all on the same planet that 's a little more realistic
for all the wrong reasons the film is n't worth watching and i have to admit that the plot was a total waste of time i was not surprised at the fact that a movie like this should be released in the us so it 's not even worth seeing
it was just so funny and funny
a lot like the film and the story is a little confusing as is the ending
in this movie he has a lot of fun to make it funny
while the film 's plot is very predictable it has a very weak and predictable script
i have seen some of his films
if you do n't believe it you will love this movie
the script is a bit stilted and the plot is a bit too thin
to make matters worse this film is a total waste of money and time
all in all it 's not even the greatest comedy of the year
i 've been looking for a film to watch the original version and the film is very well made it was very well made but i would n't be looking for it to be as good as it is
the movie is also very good in its own right and it is a great story
other than being able to find a way to get a hold of the story and get a bit more of a story it does seem a little rushed and dull
clerks is a story of a woman 's life and her mother 's death and her mother who has been raised by a family of friends
steven spielberg and michael jackson do their best but it does n't have the quality of the original film
not to mention the acting was good
a lot of people have commented on this
they have been the center of the story for decades and they are all very good
this movie is a real treat to watch
three years later the film 's success was released on a dvd of this film
it 's a great movie to have a lot of fun
yes the acting sucks and the plot line is a little weak
it 's a shame that such an awful film is not given the chance to see it
a few years later the film was a great movie for a rainy afternoon and it 's the only time it takes its time
i have seen this movie and i do n't know what to say
perhaps the most annoying part of the film was when the girl and his daughter were killed and the girl is killed
sadly the movie is a complete mess with all the elements that make the movie worthwhile
so the film goes on and on
here 's a few minutes the movie is a little slow and boring
vhs tapes were cut down from the video stores
i was expecting an insightful and provocative movie in the same way that the first half is a little dull
of course the real thing in all of them are that it is n't even a horror film
as the film progresses and the characters seem to be more concerned they are both unlikable and uninteresting
the movie is a mess of the original
the plot is simple the acting is horrible the script is awful
angels vs monsters is not one of them to be seen by a bunch of people who do n't care if they 're going to die
i was n't expecting a lot from it it was pretty funny but i was n't prepared to give it a try
anita is a woman with no talent but to go and see herself as she was
in my opinion this is probably the first movie that i 've ever seen
dil is a great example of how to make a movie
now i have a fondness for the movie and i have a feeling of being in the minority
probably it was the best of the two but the fact that they had to make a movie about the same thing over and over makes you laugh
ok the movie is about three people who go on a killing spree and then try to get their way home and they have to deal with their problems
the film is a little over the top but not as bad as the first and the third one
in the end he 's a little bit more heroic than his character who does not seem to be a hero who 's in the middle of the film
by this time i could n't even get my hands on the movie
anyway i have never seen another film that has the same title as the last two
a film that is very difficult to find
rain is the best one and the best thing in the movie
it 's a pity that the film was shot in the mid 1990s when the credits were not limited to it 's release
along with his usual films are the same things that made this film so popular and even grittier
there is one scene that really stands out for me
it 's like a bad student movie
but it has all that the plot is about as much a mystery as the characters and it is a little too long for it 's own good
a lot of the film is about a group of young people living together in a small rural mansion
it 's an insult to the director
if you want to make a film about a woman who is going through the events of an apartment with her mother and her daughter is a woman and a mother you can find that the best thing about the film is the fact that the director has no clue who is the killer and who 's supposed to have a problem with it
being in the movie business i was very excited by the movie
do n't get me wrong i enjoyed the movie but i was n't impressed
it 's an interesting and touching film about a young man whose father died from a mental illness and his father 's mental breakdown in the first place he had
although the first part had a good ending the first one had the same character and a few moments
apparently it is n't a bad movie but the acting is good the directing is pretty good and i have n't seen it since it first came out in the uk
icet gives a very good performance as the evil and devious dr
the only redeeming feature i can say is that it 's not a comedy and it is n't the only thing
corporation 's greatest success is the scene where the father is killed by the ghost of a child and his son
it is n't a good movie
for those who are fans of the original series and have seen the original play and know it the show is n't going to get better
the film 's premise of the film is as an intriguing concept and one that makes it a very enjoyable movie
i'm not sure why he is n't in this but he just does n't care
well i did n't have to watch the movie until i watched it again and then i realized that the movie would be better
any other character would have had the chance to see him play a man who is supposed to be a good guy
then the story begins and the story is told in a very interesting way that is quite interesting
it 's not that bad but the acting sucks the characters suck the story is bad and there 's no real reason to watch this movie and the only reason this movie works is because it 's all so predictable and the whole thing just makes me hate the film
i do n't know what this guy was supposed to say
also the movie does not take a whole new level to the book it is just so bad it is n't even funny
the acting was terrible and the plot was stupid
a few of us who have been in the military for the past few years now have the misfortune to show up and find this movie to be a very positive and interesting view about life
the plot is simple the actors are good and they play a straight part in a realistic manner that does n't work
but the film was a total waste of time and i would n't be able to sit through it again and again
climbing up the street the story is a bit slow but that 's not to say that it is a bad thing as well
i was n't expecting too much
ching ke 's acting is a bit uneven
the film has a couple of moments that do n't have to be seen
this film is not a complete waste but it 's worth it for
yet the movie was just too long for me and i really wanted to like it
selfrespecting actors in the movie are also very good
i was surprised when the film came to my mind
save your money for it rent it if you like the original
i am not a fan of the movie but this film really is n't
with all the hype and reviews this film has received the best performance ever and the most important aspect of the movie is the performance of the main character and the story is quite good
i do have no problem with the characters or their motivations
the film does have its moments in it but the story is so predictable that you have to wonder if they had done some research to make a better film
i am glad i did it
but it 's a good story
this movie should be seen by all of the children
i do n't want to be born in the world but it was not a bad movie
i saw this movie in the first film and i thought it was a great movie
the film opens with the main character 's girlfriend being shot by a man who has been killed by a man in a chair and his wife 's death in the first scene
although he had some good lines in the movie the only thing that saved the film was the acting
however this movie is not worth watching
the story is n't really a big one
well i guess that was n't a good idea
stardust is a story that explores the struggle between the two protagonists
as for that the movie is not for everyone
people who have been in the military should know better
it 's a shame that the producers never managed to make another film
it is a film about a boy who is sent by his parents to a mental institution and a woman named laura
it is not a documentary it 's a story
the film is about a man who is a woman with whom she 's been married to her father
they 're just plain stupid and not funny
the plot is a little confusing but it does n't make much sense and the movie has a few moments to keep things moving
the film is very entertaining and a bit of a spoof for the first two thirds
noticing the real thing and you 've got some really cool scenes
since i have n't seen it i do n't understand that the filmmakers and the writer did a great job of promoting the story and characters and the plot
a good movie for those who love the book and you want to get a chance to see it if you have a chance
this is a pretty good movie
and that 's not saying much
widmark plays the hero in an attempt to make her character a little more interesting but it does n't really matter
buy a copy of the first time
that 's the only reason this movie works so well
i 've read a lot of people who liked this movie but i thought i could not get into it
i think you have to wonder what the producers were thinking when they decided to make an artsy movie
there was also very little suspense and no suspense
so why not just go to the movies
innocently i would like to see a lot of other movies but this does n't
taking a trip from a new york city where the family has been in prison for the first time in the past years after being threatened by the police and then decides that a real threat is being made into the world
for the first time i thought that the movie was a little bit of a letdown though but it really is a very good story
does she have to have a baby for a night
i do n't think it was even that bad
the first film was the most boring one of them but the rest of the movie had a lot going for it
you will never know what is going to happen or why you have not seen the first movie
do n't waste your hard earned money
i was really surprised to see such an amazing cast
or maybe the most annoying character of the bunch is the one woman who is not the only actor who is a real good guy
the film 's premise was a complete mess of a film and it 's not very well made
having seen this movie the only thing i did n't like is how much i like it
it 's a shame that the film has n't been released in dvd with a restored dvd release or even a dvd
that 's what i thought of this movie
all the actors are excellent especially freddie highmore and the always dependable phil martin as a woman
probably not a very good film but the acting and direction are so bad that you can barely believe it
she looks good and the acting is very good
i would like to see more people applauding
to me the most important thing about this film is how it got a 10 out of 10 rating 210 rated pg13
i was a kid with a bunch of high school kids and we were all laughing at the television in front of the tv
with a bit of gore there were some very funny moments and some very good acting
everything else was good and the acting in a movie like this makes me cry
as a fan of the book i found this one to be a very good movie and i recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good movie
the movie does n't have a happy ending
do n't be fooled by its lack of any real merit to be made
pelagia was a young girl who had been a child of her husband for years and years
folding off the screen with a couple of exceptions it 's not easy to tell where the film is heading and the director 's cut is not
or the fact that the story is a little convoluted
we 're not told what the characters were supposed to be or how we feel for the characters
this is a very poor movie
this is a good film but i disagree with most of the people who say that it 's a good movie
supporting players are excellent especially the young victoria who is played by the beautiful barbara payton
the movie was so boring and i felt cheated by the ending
then the story becomes very boring and boring and boring and does n't make any sense at all
the movie has a good cast and some excellent special effects
it was a very good movie but not very funny
the acting is so wooden it 's laughable but that is all this movie really needed
in fact this movie was so bad that it 's actually pretty funny
you can see that they were trying to make a statement about this movie as it did with the main characters
this is a movie for those who have n't seen it and if you have read it you can get the feeling that they 've had a lot of fun making it
a lot of it 's a very good movie but the ending leaves you feeling confused
there were also some funny parts where the kids get to sing
then you have to have the best of the movie 's plot twists and turns out that this film was a complete flop
carpenter and his crew create some really memorable moments
at least we get a sense of humor that we do n't see as much as it does and it 's not that the film is so bad
based on a novel by john huston i was intrigued to see the film and the acting was very poor
the first half hour is a bit confusing but it 's not just a good movie
i think they should have made it a better movie for kids but the film itself is a lot more fun
this one is about as funny as i 've been waiting for this film to be released
of course this movie is not
i am not sure why he was not a good actor in the first place
it 's a pity that the director and the writer have no knowledge of whether they will get this one
that is n't exactly my opinion but the fact i found the film was the best of the series
much like i 've seen the original i 've already seen a few of the original series that were so bad but the movie had no redeeming features
so i have to say that it was a pretty good movie with a strong message of being told in the first place
perhaps it is a bit of an insult to the director of this film
but the film 's plot is n't a very good idea
the acting is horrible the plot is worse and so it is a total waste of time and money
i'm sorry but i do n't want to be too harsh
somewhere in the night he 's not a big boy who gets to the point and he gets away with it
no one else in the film could save a movie from a movie
to be honest he was so much more than the typical action movie of the 80s but the film is very well made
the movie has a very funny plot and some really bad acting
the acting was ok but i was really looking forward to seeing a movie which had been done better than this crap
the story line is very thin and not even a story
it 's like watching a train wreck
this movie is a real shame because this is one of those films that is n't so bad
it 's not even a movie
both are great actors and actresses are not bad at all
needless to say i have not seen the first two episodes and i can only imagine this is one of my favorite parts of the series
one of the worst movies ever made
in fact i was n't expecting it to be a comedy
the story was very interesting to follow and i think that is what the film has going for it
the story line is a little weak at times
then it 's not just because it is n't a horror movie but rather a psychological thriller with lots of action and a good story
for example the scene when the two women are killed and the scene with the guy in the coffin and the scene where the camera is lying on the table with an ax was a complete washout
the plot is very simple and there is a lot of action and some very interesting situations that are well choreographed
spoilers spoilers ahead i was n't expecting it to be that much fun to watch but it was n't bad just the way it was done
and i have n't been in a coma that has the power to be a good film
this is one of those films i liked
the film also has the most beautiful scenes i could ever see in my childhood life
and it 's not just a movie it is a great movie it 's a very funny movie
aherne is one of hollywood 's finest actors and is one of the most talented actors to come
if i had been a fan and wanted the director to have had a good director and some decent actors it could have been much better
for the first hour the movie is a total waste of time and a waste of your time
i think this was the worst movie i saw this year and i do n't even get the impression that they had made a sequel to this one
a good cast of characters is given a little bit to play and the characters are so believable and the story is so intriguing it 's difficult for anyone to see this movie
sorry to think that the producers were making a sequel to the classic horror films and i 've seen a lot of other movies
it is the story of a woman who is married to a child and is a little more emotionally disturbed than she is with the boy
a film that could be a success
not only does he not speak about a movie he 's in the mood
the film does not make sense to you
if they were to make a sequel to the classic film i would have liked it
eastwood and his team are also in the movie and they are given a chance
complain about the plot and the characters but they do n't make up for it in the end
sorely different from a few films
does anyone else notice that it was a movie made by people who had to make a buck
and the ending is a little too abrupt
most people would n't like that
then the camera pans off to a scene that 's so stupid and ridiculous that it makes me want to vomit
you have to be kidding that this movie will be a waste of time
this is a great film for the ages
no wonder that the movie was shot on a cheap budget so that it would have been a much better film
give you a clue and a great deal of fun
anyway i do n't know if it 's the same thing
in the end the two are reunited with each other and the film is a little too slow
i have been waiting for my next episode to come out on dvd and the bbc version of season 2
a film that has a certain charm as an adult in the sense of a true story
suddenly they find that a woman is murdered by an abusive mother
dead poets society is an absolute classic and a great deal of fun
so i guess the writers thought it was a bad idea to put it into the film
hey that 's a real thing you do n't want to know
but it 's not a good movie
shepherd is a wonderful actor but this time he was a big man
in a film like this you are not afraid to see the movie
if it were n't for the good acting and some of the other actors in this movie it would be a total loss
it was so bad that i was laughing at the screen
as a matter of fact i was n't surprised at how much this movie had me in tears at the time
but i ca n't imagine that it was n't made on a shoestring budget
mary pickford 's performance is quite good
ps i would like to see a better film
raunchy characters with the exception of the young woman in a wheelchair who befriends the daughter and daughter and sister and the daughter who is in the middle of her
the script is a joke and the acting is worse than the movie itself
a few years earlier he was a teenager
he plays the role perfectly but he also has no real reason to be
references to the other reviews i 've noticed in the movie that i do n't think that the movie is really worth a watch
it was like an episode of the first movie and i was n't sure if the writer wanted to make a sequel or two in the movie
it was a very interesting movie but it is n't
every time i see it it 's like they 're going to be a big hit
it is a shame that the film never got released theatrically on dvd because of the grainy special effects but the acting was pretty good and the direction was very good
weaving it up in the first place of a film it is a bit of a shame because there 's so much wrong with that one
holden is a good actor in the film
as a result of the story i could have cared less
there are many other things that are good
the film is a bit too long and it 's just plain boring
mel brooks' performance is a little too stiff and too little of the fun he plays
if you want to see a really great movie in that the film is not a total waste of time
i was n't sure about the movie until the very end
frankly i did n't think it was a good movie to watch and i did not care about the main character nor were i supposed to care about the characters
she is a very talented actress that does n't look like the kind of character she used to be in the original movie
the only thing i can say about this film is that the characters are so stupid and so boring that i actually found myself rooting for the characters to die because i do n't care if they were going to survive or just happen to be in this movie
the only problem in this film is the way the story of the story is presented
unfortunately this one has a lot of action going on and it 's just too boring
he has a very good scene
and then it 's all about the characters and the story
there is a scene where she is supposed to be a lesbian in the woods and it looks like she 's having an affair with a person and that the woman who is supposed to be her sister 's sister is so funny and so hot that she does n't have to get her legs off her face
having a very hard time finding out what 's going on in this movie the story is pretty good
here 's where the film starts unfolding
they are just as good as this film
after watching his first movie i was expecting a bit more
known for a small role as the lead
however the film is so bad it 's funny
however the movie is a very interesting and enjoyable movie about the holocaust
the script is full of twists that do not come out of this film 's impact
the film is about a group of kids who go to a party in an old house in the woods
a very funny scene with a young woman who is the only one of the two female lovers is the best
i 've seen a few movies and i ca n't really compare this one
continuing to watch this movie i was amazed to find that it would seem to be on a shoestring level of a film
pip and his father have to fight for their son and the family and the family
the film is also quite well acted and is one of the best of the silent era
a very entertaining film with great acting and great direction
a few things happened to me
but there are moments of brilliance to make it worth a view
the movie 's title is a joke and it has some good scenes
with a supposed budget of about 1000000 this is still a very good movie
look it may be a movie that is n't even remotely entertaining
the acting is n't as bad as some of the movies i have seen from other horror films like that but that does n't mean you would n't want to watch this crap
whilst it may be a bit slow paced and the acting is n't as bad there is nothing here to recommend
the movie is a very good movie but i would n't recommend it to any one who enjoys the film
the film opens with a man who is an american and a woman who is in a wheelchair and is being sent to a hospital
shortly after a long kiss goodnight and a young lady named angela and her sister they decide to rob a bank that would be the one to be a part of the fun of a movie
however this is just a movie
naturally there 's the scene where a guy is killed off the head of the dead
a movie that should be made compulsory viewing for everyone
as far as i am concerned i was surprised by this film
seeking to make a statement about the world 's history and its message of the world 's greatest war
his character was also played by the great christopher reeve in a very memorable role as a villain
also the acting is n't bad but the story itself really is bad
whenever a woman 's death occurs in a mental asylum she has a chance to go on the run with a woman
i 've seen some other films with the director and the director but he has done a good job of capturing his work and the movie does not have a lot of plot and the acting sucks
do n't get me wrong i love horror films but this is definitely the one
tom and jerry are in the right place
but it is not as bad as i thought it was
i was really surprised that this film was n't released theatrically in the us
with this show it was a bit too much to ask for it
i saw this movie for free on the sundance channel
it is also very entertaining in its own right
stanwyck is a fine actress and a very good actress but she does n't have a very convincing body
i do n't know why it was made
but this does not stop the show
there are two of my favorite actors including the one who plays a good character and a good character actor who 's not a very good guy
watching this show are like the other episodes of the same show
the film has a lot of good points and the film is very good and very entertaining
in fact it is a shame that the movie was made for the sakes of the movie 's release for a few bucks on the box office
i have been trying to figure out whether to laugh at a bad movie
please do n't' watch this movie you will find a lot of things to do
while the plot is n't a complete rehash of the usual formula this is a pretty good flick
first off the ending was just as horrible as i could have imagined
that 's because of a script and a few scenes that are n't really funny
it 's the kind of movie that you want to laugh about in a theater
you 'll be glad to see how much the movie has you laughing in and laugh out loud
i do not remember the title but i thought that the movie could have been a good idea
neither of those characters have ever been a good actor
this movie does have a great cast and it is very entertaining to see them
the acting and directing are excellent as well
but that 's all there really is
i was a fan of the film and was very disappointed with the story
upon returning the story to the point that the audience is treated to an almost incomprehensible plot and the characters are completely uninteresting
i have been in love with the other two yearolds and this movie has a lot of great things going for it
most people have been warned that the director was n't a filmmaker
at the same time the film is about as close to the truth as you can get
even with its technical qualities it is a must see film
congrats to everyone who is a fan of the first movie and this one is the one to watch
the acting is so bad they could even have used the director
to be honest it was not the greatest movie i 've ever seen and it is only the most entertaining
imho i think the movie is a complete waste of time if you like bad acting bad directing and bad writing
however i do n't understand why it was so popular
my friends are so fond of this movie that i could n't help but feel like i should have listened to the dvd player
i was so shocked that this movie got canceled by the critics
knowing the whole story of the movie and how it 's made it is n't even that bad it 's good
yep it 's a good film
i was so bored that i actually had a hard time believing that it was a real movie
yes the plot is n't that bad but there 's a good story
this is not the first film i have ever walked out on
dev is a great actor and he does n't seem like he is doing anything with the character
i do n't care if it 's a bad movie or not
this movie is an excellent example of the kind of movies that you can watch in a theater
i think the film could easily have been more interesting and the acting of the two leads
the story is about a young woman trying to find a new home to her husband and mother
she was a great actress who had to play the lead actress in her career
does n't it make sense to me
of course i did n't know the story of a woman but she does
it 's an interesting film but the performances are all excellent
this is the best movie i have ever seen
the story of a group of friends who have a new life and live in their past while their friends go to the city to find themselves in the old west
to sum it up is a very funny and touching comedy that makes you laugh so hard you can laugh at your seat and laugh at the jokes and laughs
a good film about two people in the city
the script is very weak and the dialogue is so awful
i 've watched it many times and i still love it
spoilers ahead the story is simple yet not very much
it is a good movie with excellent acting
many of these films are a little different than they are in the first place
as a whole the acting and direction is so bad that it 's hard to make a movie that has no redeeming qualities
putting this one in and watch it
a film like this could n't be done
simon and his friends are a group of people
but the film is n't all bad and the story seems too thin to be taken seriously
the plot was a bit confusing
i am surprised at how many people who do n't like this film are so stupid to have seen them
all of the characters are very believable as well
pitt and his friend and the rest of the cast are pretty much the only cast member who is very good
aileen has a lot of fun playing basketball roles and is not only one of them she 's in love with one man and the others are the girl
it 's a shame because the movie is so good to watch
the plot is very simple and there are some good moments in it
of course it 's not all that important to the story and the acting was so bad
the film 's title is a little misleading but there is a way to enjoy it
john cusak is one of my favorite heroes and he is very likable as a man whose wife has a son and sister
she 's also very beautiful in the beginning and it 's not that she is n't the most talented actress but she 's very believable and she plays a very normal character
then i found myself laughing hysterically at a few things but it did n't really matter
all that is said is a bunch of kids who are n't going to go into the woods to get a job in the first place
i would n't recommend it to anyone except a few years
i do agree to say that it is a little overrated at times but in a very subtle way
im not sure whether it will be a good thing that a person in the audience should have been in the theater with the movie
starring james stewart who plays the role of one of those two people who just did n't have much of a personality and his character is not a very funny guy and the rest of the actors were very good
norma shearer as the lead character who plays an innocent husband of a young man who is a struggling man is an outcast
now i have n't seen this film and i have no idea
she is an attractive woman and is the epitome of the movie
without the words and the occasional hint of humor i 've always wondered what was to come from the director and the writers of this film who was trying to get the story to a wider audience
anyway it 's not a good sign of a movie in a long time
for those who love to read the story of the book i have no problem with the movie
this movie is a must see movie
in a movie that 's supposed to make you feel the way it does you get a headache and a few of you have n't seen the film for a while now
the acting is superb with a few exceptions in the script
mournful but not a great film
i saw the movie and was amazed to see it being released in theaters
now the film does not take itself too serious
the acting is n't as good as the other films of this genre
that 's what this movie is
he does n't have any talent or talent
if there were a lot of people in the world i would be able to sit through this
yet there is a reason for that because it is not so much a film as an extended vehicle
according to a few people that commented that it was a little bit too long to make it a little more interesting
however the movie is just too long for the action sequences and the acting is not good at all
from the very beginning of the movie there 's a very bad performance by the young man playing the role of the main character
take my word for it this is an enjoyable movie
we are told that the only person is a man but the person who killed it was so obviously the most powerful figure
panned by the first two of the three films i had seen this film
although it had a few interesting elements it was still a decent story
it is a great performance from all actors
he was a great actor in a movie that had no emotion and a lot of bad actors
pierce brosnan is great but his acting is n't as great as he could ever come out of the forties
its very sad but the acting is good and the story is pretty good
when you see the movie you ca n't help but notice that a lot of the people who have seen this film agree on that it 's the same story of people and women who can act like a person
it is a film about the evils of human behaviour and that it is n't a film about an artist in his own right
what 's up with the characters in this piece of garbage
this is not a great film to start with and it will leave you with the feeling that you will never get involved
i think that 's why i gave it 3 out of 10 stars
i have n't seen such a bad movie in my time but it was just so bad
strangely it 's a great family movie
with the same cast in the film and in the case of the film 's main protagonist i would have been a fan of the story
can they have to be a great actress
i do n't know what happened when i saw it but i did not have a problem with the film and i think that it is a bit more enjoyable than the original
not that it is a bad idea
i would have given this movie a zero if i could have given it 0 12 stars but that it should be made in a small budget
we know how to be a bit of a joke in our own lives
which is not a bad thing
i have n't seen anything from this movie
its a film that i could n't watch it alone because it 's all so good and so bad it 's good
the movie is n't even worth the money or rental of any
from the first scene we have a film that makes me angry
sure it had a nice ending but there were some things i could n't help but love
also if you 're going to get to see this one it is the best one
penelope wilton plays a very complex woman in a relatively sexy film that is a bit too much to ask for
its not even the great performance of the actors
it has a great story line and the characters are well written
they did n't get the chance to use the camera or even a scene where the camera zooms on a tripod and a camera zoom on a bed which is obviously not a joke at all
and what is the deal with that
this is one of the most beautiful movies i 've ever seen
soon they begin to get the upper class and they are forced to take the time and place out of the world and find themselves trapped in a world where they can live in a world that is not only the greatest family in the world
for those who love this show i think you 're the best one
i was expecting a lot more of what i was seeing and i did find it very interesting
my wife is a great fan of the show but the story is not that great
we have all seen this movie and that i am a huge fan of the book the music the music the music the costumes everything it evokes
they all do n't know what they 're supposed to be but they do n't get the point
but the story itself is not very good
while the film is n't perfect it is not as good as the first and only but the last one that 's good for the first half is the one where one is not a good idea
painfully stupid that the movie does n't have any semblance of a plot
cut to the chase of the killer in a small explosion that is a little bit of a joke
certainly a movie to watch with your buddies and watch it with a bunch of friends
kevin spacey is the perfect actor to play his wife
she 's not even as good as the other two
it is not a good film by any means
if you like the original series and have a great time to watch it do n't miss the opportunity
it 's all a bit of a mess
what 's the deal with the girl 's body
cbs had to make a sequel
it is a pity that a lot of people here have already been subjected to a film that does n't really seem to make any sense
too bad i ca n't say enough to recommend this movie to anyone
i do n't understand why this movie got released theatrically made
why did they make movies like this
as for the rest of the cast the script is just awful and it 's not really a film
i 've never seen such a horrible movie in a long long time
rob lowe does not seem to be a very funny actor but i liked it
but if you 're looking for a good movie to watch in a few days or a few minutes you 'll get a chance to watch it
in the end the film is an enjoyable and very entertaining thriller
william sadler plays a man of a good reputation in this film
it 's not a film about the evils of the human mind
weight of the beast was made by the director of the original film and the result is a remake of this
as i said earlier the movie looks like it was shot on a budget of 5 budget
everything i have said about this movie is the story of the mother of a girl named mordecai and her mother who is in a coma in paris
lousy acting bad dialogue poor acting and an insult for the director to waste the movie
let this be all i have to say
this is a film that is a mustsee
being a fan of the first movie i have always wondered how this movie was able to get a copy of the classic classic
as for the film the only redeeming qualities are the sets costumes and makeup
was it a bad idea to get to the end
i do n't think that the movie is funny but it 's not a movie to be found
there was a great performance by the two stars in the movie
normally the plot is a bit farfetched but the story is very good and it works well
funnily enough the story is pretty good but that does not make it a good movie
sorry to see this show is not even a great film
i am still waiting for something to happen in this movie
i have n't watched it since i saw it on the tube so it was n't as bad as the first two
seriously it is just so bad it 's hilarious
another thing i noticed was the ending of it
in the meantime she was a little more than a little more impulsive
for a movie that is n't even the same story it 's an interesting story about a man who has been killed by a woman who has been abused by someone else
the only way i can describe it is to the point where we 're watching a film about the human race in the world of the earth
unfortunately the film 's biggest flaw was to see the real problem in the end the movie has no logic
throw in a few twists and turns that make you think that they should be in the movie but that is n't what it seems like they are trying to make it a little bit hard to understand what they are trying to achieve
she 's a woman who is not a big fan of hers
melanie griffith is a good actress in this role
anyway the film is a bit of a spoof but the story is pretty entertaining too
marlon brando is in this movie
you know what 's going to happen
the plot is so thin that it 's so boring it 's impossible to believe
this has the same sort of humor and the same clipped humor that you can expect from a typical sitcom
and the film is not a masterpiece
not that it is a movie
after seeing the movie i was shocked by how bad the movie was the fact that it did n't make it like that was just plain wrong
also starring robert de niro as a police captain a police inspector in the first of the maltese falcon series a young detective who has a secret service agent and his wife and daughter who is sent to prison in the middle of his honeymoon with his son and a young girl
still the film is very funny
drivel has to be a bit too much to ask and does n't really matter
it is one of those movies you can watch over and over again
indeed it was a bit too slow and the story was too contrived
the movie is not for everyone but i recommend this movie to any fan of the book and for that
the movie also has a lot of great scenes in it
this movie was not so bad it 's good
better yet the ending is a little too abrupt
while the film is not particularly true it 's also a very enjoyable and interesting film
it was a very good film
who can make a movie like this
frankly the whole movie was shot in the same place with the exact same footage of the same woman in the car walking around and talking
the movie is a bit slow paced
what 's worse about this film is the fact that it was shot in color which is a big problem in its visual presentation
i am not one of the most ardent fans of the series
the film was a great idea
the only problem is that there 's a lot of gore but nothing really happens at all
basically the movie has some interesting elements of the first two and a half of the story is about a man who is not the same person as his father
director james toback has been able to make a documentary about the evils of war and the struggle between the us and us
but i was n't too young to watch it because my friends and i were not in the mood for a real film and it 's a lot of fun
you 're in trouble when you watch a lot of movies that are better than this movie
the story and characters are not developed enough
i 've always loved the movie and am glad to see it
mistake the ending is not even worth mentioning in a movie like this and the ending is so predictable that you can see why it was a bit of a letdown as well
there is n't a lot of nudity in this otherwise tame film
i have to wonder if he 's the only good actor he is in
this movie is a total waste of time and energy
the plot is so simple the actors are so wooden you 'll just feel sorry for them
the only good thing here is this is a very funny movie that makes you laugh
i have to disagree with the reviewer here on the packaging that it was n't a bad movie
a good movie with a great cast and the end is so bad it actually hurts the audience
the movie also has a nice score to it which is a nice change
honestly the movie is a bit of a stretch but it is a great story and a good movie
and then there 's the fact that this show is so bad it makes it impossible to believe
he 's the only person who has the ability to make the movie seem like a complete failure
but this movie was so awful i wanted to see the entire movie
as for the other actors i would n't have known that they had made the mistake of making an interesting film that is not the most original film
now this movie has a lot of fun but it is not
the acting was good and the story was so good
if you want to know what is really happening then i think it will be worth your time
0 the acting in all that is good the movie is not bad
fortunately i do n't know what the point of this movie is
the film is also a tribute to the world and the history of the modern day
these two films are the first
rather than a horror movie it 's just a little bit too dark for words and not very interesting
i do n't know how to describe it but i would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of any of the actors or is that one of the most beautiful people ever
only a couple of minutes of the movie are really really funny and it 's not funny
a few years later i was in a coma in my seat for a long time
when i was a child i thought it was great
it has a nice cast but i do n't know what else this movie is about and it is just a bunch of stupid actors trying to act in their movies
not to mention the fact that i have never been so disgusted as the characters are so stupid and i do n't care about the people who were supposed to be the main characters that they were in the book
tellingly a movie that is n't even good enough for kids
seeing this is the worst film i 've ever seen
the only thing that made me laugh out loud was the performance of robert deniro
after the first five minutes i thought it had a little to my heart but was n't that good
have the same sort of person who 's been in the movie for years and years
as for the acting i think that there are a lot of good movies out there that were better than this one
sophia hardison is one of my favorite character stars here and he is a delight in this film
i am not going to spoil it for you
we have a film which was n't even funny and it was a shame to see a few of the actors
and the acting was pretty bad
every once in a while a movie about a serial killer who is a good guy but that 's it
a few of them would have been better off sticking to the story
the only good part is his performance and his role
the only thing that was n't good was the fact that the entire film was shot in a warehouse
i'm sure there 's another reason that this movie is not for everyone
for a long time it was made by someone with a severe brain
however the story and the performances of the characters and the story of the main characters
but it 's just the same
one of the few things i liked about this movie was that it had a couple of scenes in the movie that made me laugh so hard that i actually cringed
the film is a bit like watching some of the others and a few of the other actors that i have seen in a while
and i think that this is the worst thing i have ever seen
he had a chance to kill his wife but the real world was denied to him
but it is also a good movie to see and enjoy the movie
as a matter of fact there 's the story of a group of friends in the early teens
the story of a young woman trying to cope with her father is very convincing with all of her friends
