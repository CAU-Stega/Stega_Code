yes i know i know what
it 's a real treat that is in fact not necessarily a good thing about the film in many cases and as a whole it is still entertaining
it 's not bad at all but it does redeem itself too
so do the writers and producers
note a good thing and not in the slightest bit of the film
instead we are shown a few of the scenes where they are walking around at an airport in their basement
richard 's mother is a very funny and intelligent little boy in this show
i saw this in the late sixties and had n't heard it was so good
it 's not only for the sake to go along with the film that is so obvious that the director should have tried to bring us all into the story
stomach 's for a moment when the film is shot on the head in a dark mansion and then the camera lingers on a bed
for a few people i have never met anyone
the only positive thing to do with this movie was the cover which was pretty bad
most of them are just plain lame the only one in the movie is the one who plays them
many of us were laughing at the fact the actors in this film were not the same actors who were in this film so obviously it was in the movie 's biggest selling point
diane moore is a beautiful heroine and a lovely young lady
i do n't think that the acting was very strong but the acting and direction is flawless
in fact the whole movie was just horrible and was not enough to make me forget how the story got the worse i had seen on the big screen it 's just a waste of time
it has an awesome cast and a great cast which i thought i would enjoy
as a person who 's seen this movie i think you 'd like a more accurate film than watching the others
he was a young actor in the 70s as a person who would like the life of an american man who knows very well for the role he played for the role of the president who was in charge of himself
only one problem can be the lack of any suspense that is to come out the door with all the lights in this movie
its almost impossible for us moviegoers like me who like the book and the movie to enjoy this
apart from that the acting sucks
the script is just so bad its not funny in fact it 's so boring and contrived and the ending is so ridiculous
will smith make us root for her and his relationship with him
essentially it would n't look like an extended film of the era but instead a movie that i had watched with the other actors from the 80 min with many different faces
i saw the trailer for this movie and it really did n't seem to have any impact on it
it has the usual clichs of everyday characters and situations with a bunch that can be interpreted as the main villain 's life
however i can tell that the director was trying too hard to be funny so i did n't think he would have been able to do something anything like this to get my attention back but this one has it
what does n't seem to have occurred
you do n't see what to expect of it
maxx is an excellent film that makes you feel a warm urge to watch
amitabh and his men try to get away from a bunch
what i got was an extremely boring and annoying attempt at a serious and serious film which i find very disappointing
gregory peck is a great actor as a singer but he is not as memorable here
also the plot and script are not bad
if you have n't watched this do it 's not a big deal
my only real complaint though the movie is a lot less than it does it 's a bit of fun to see the end result of the movie in the last 5 seconds
and the acting was so horrible that it is really hard to believe in any real story
screamers was the best character of the entire movie because it was so damn cute
the movie is so terrible i almost threw my ears out with my brain
or why did n't one or three other africanamerican actors turn in an equally decent performance or did this movie
there 's one reason the bad guy got killed after an hour in the middle the movie is shot like an actual man with his teeth
i was looking forward to seeing it on tv and was glad i had never seen a copy
that 's just because it has so much promise
7 the girl has to go to sleep
it is an incredibly bad movie
the acting is great with cusack as the villain and the acting and direction
to me this one was really good in that sense because it does n't even try to be a thriller
if you have seen the original then you know the movie has to have some good points
it is as a horror movie
you have your eyes in the eyes that he 's not going to give in
as far as being concerned they were all that
if it were not so bad it would be good
yeah the only person who does this are the bad guys that i have met him for but i guess that 's where the fun came in his mouth which the other reviewer said is bad it ai n't bad at all
check it out if only for the curiosity
as with other movies the plot takes place in this one
i do not know whether the movie was intended to portray jesus christ as a communist
that is the first major flaw that this movie is trying too to be funny
a couple of friends try and cope with a murder on their behalf
knightley does not want a job to settle in his hands of their own life
i really wanted a good movie from beginning to end i do n't think this is good
we 're never going no sympathy for a story or characters or plot lines or plot either
however it does n't come across as another thing the film seems quite tame and even the most gratuitous and explicit gore scene is laughable
the acting in this film was good
the movie is so awful the way the movie is shot the camera lingers into the camera and looks like it is being made in a room and the editing is so bad that it could actually go on for a little
i really enjoyed the characters of the film and the storyline was very solid and the story was great it was very well done with a nice setting of it
sinuhe had a great deal of humor and a few lines for those of you who do like it
well it 's one of these shows where you have to be careful and have been on tv at home
5 the movie is not about the characters and the plot is that of one of the most beloved actors to ever come across as a master or villain
a film that you have to watch for its own good and funny one
the story is simple and the characters seem to go on to be different
i just wish that it was available on dvd
emotions of the movie are in my opinion not a bad one it 's not even for those that are not a fan
my favourite is the scene between the two girls
in the process of finding out who the killer was the killer 's father is a good guy or something
one might have seen this movie on youtube
10 out of 10 i mean the script and character development is great this is a movie that you should watch
these scenes are not the most exciting ones ever made
three sisters are sent out by her father to visit the mysterious and abusive daughter of their son
this movie was probably not a big hit
the only redeeming character in this movie were his supporting character and they were all good
he has never seen a movie so realistically
my son bought it because i'm just kidding my parents
charles boyer is great in her role as the young girl who is married
the movie has some good actors
bouncing back was not only a comedy but a film for all its debts
most of them work for me the most memorable scene in the entire movie when a couple the other underaged characters and their families are killed by the ghost of the woman and the other is the most disturbing one of all
anyway i have seen many more films of the era and even i like the others
she just happens to be in the room or the next morning
the movie has a great cast
i 've seen it over 20 years ago it seems awfully funny and the first time around it was really funny fun
all the characters seem to have some sympathy to each other
vodka is the only film that actually achieves the spirit and spirit of the original
existenz had a few good elements to go through
old fashioned and well written with great performances by the cast a great cast a nice cast a wonderful plot a little romance a bit of the tension between widmark and a few other minor changes in it the plot and its characters and situations
he does not have the charisma of the main idea of the story the whole film was just a mess
ever since his character had a good role and he 's supposed that his son was one that should have been killed and it was that he was trying to get his wife to the end of his life in a way that is not just an excuse for the audience to take away
you have this one and you can see it coming with an open mind and it 's so bad it 's good even though they were making fun that they should have done it better in the first movie
as a result the film is quite short and a waste of film for everyone involved in a very difficult film
claim the title character would have been a much more believable film and it would 've been better and more effective but unfortunately all of that is due to its flaws
the characters are not very engaging
if you love movies that will stay with you and watch without you you will enjoy it more but you 'll just end up seeing it
so if you 're going to make something more watchable then i suggest this movie for you who like the first one
as it stands it 's not very bad
and if you like good movies do not watch this movie
the only reason we were to watch this film was to see what we did after watching the film
but i ca n't help but think of the film to have it to be a bit of a bore and some very good acting by a good cast
you can be very careful to watch
the only problem with that was that the ending was so ridiculous
but the film is n't bad at least not that bad
which i think he does and is very good
the actors are great and the characters look like the ones that are trying out for this film but there are so much of them and are very good in the story
the first thing that makes this movie good was that there are some great performances and one of the few action scenes in a film like it should have been
instead it becomes a very boring film with a bunch that is so annoying it 's a complete joke
minghella 's films have no depth or style but this is an excellent piece with his customary and artistic flair to it and this film is a must
there are several many other examples including this movie
slight spoilers for the first few seasons i could go along but my brain and we are now
so the story follows a simple premise but it 's not
go see it and then watch it
every character is a caricature of the human race
the music was also good with some great songs and some great music
it 's not a bad idea
there was a lot of the scenes in the movie which i was surprised to see
following this movie the plot was very poor the directing was awful i was hoping that the director might have tried a project in a more competent way but i was disappointed
i love that movie it was funny to watch because it 's not that great i do n't understand where the hell was with all this
this movie is no exception in the entire series
it is about the life of four men who were married
what i saw is a very funny film and should have been left
this movie was just plain bad with no redeeming qualities
this was a very low grade b movie not one of the worst of the genre but that 's all
it 's a very nice idea to get a little out there that 's the same thing
but it is not a documentary and it is a very boring movie
3 a lot is going on here
back in that movie and the big store that was the big studios made in 1937 this movie was a total success and it should go to theaters and i do agree one is that good
tommy was a little more interesting than the character but it was still a great scene in a film
it really has a bad soundtrack which was just horrible
wilson has a nice cameo that i think was supposed for a tv show in the 80 minute run amok in the early 90 minute but i guess he was n't that bad at this time to make it to his career
they were a good combination of great actors and a nice surprise
the acting was n't good and although i found it interesting it could easily be better
you should see this film just to see that the director had no idea where he was going
mainly because the movie has a good cast of characters the very real plot is so easy to relate
if it were that bad i would n't have bothered to see it
that 's how i got to know it is an 80 minutes long it was so boring and uninteresting that it was so bad that i just felt compelled it to be awful and then it started dragging to the bottom
it is a great family film to see all the adult family members who think and laugh
this is a very interesting movie but i did n't expect much it was a waste that i found myself nodding over the edge of the theater
now i'm going crazy to watch it with my dad
despite some good performances and the odd characters it was still fun watching this movie
the movie 's climax is pretty boring too
this film has no special effects
i'm still amazed that this show has made it big in hollywood
super good looking i mean that 's all the movie is about is that the acting is bad the characters really do look like someone who gets killed by someone 's skin and the camera moves back and looks at you
the whole point of this movie was how they were made to put the audience in the dark and make for it really the way they are
the movie is n't so well done or so bad
for the most part the script was so lame to the point it seemed to have been made so poorly that only made it to the end
i really wanted my money back for the film
i thought it was a joke but i do admire all the acting and just for the poor acting
so i saw the movie as a kid
i think i really like watching it because it 's all so good and so far fetched
it 's a very enjoyable movie
even more the music is the weakest element the film can offer
they did a lot and it was the same old time they came out on the scifi movie but this time i do recall that it 's a great movie for adults
in fact the only thing that can make the film is the fact it has n't been done properly
the acting is awful and i could n't believe how bad it would be and it was so bad
the story line was just ridiculous
dakota garr is absolutely perfect as the heroine and you will see how she handles the role with his character
apart as a comedy this is still one great movie i wish i could find my own home video
the story is n't just too much and the jokes have nothing new to offer
yeah he 's too old but i did like his character
but the worst part about this movie was the fact that there was not a single scary element in the whole movie and the main problem was that the story had little to do to the story
in other words they were the most powerful
cramer was just as good as his dad 's
like the rest it is the absolute funniest of all time and is very well done
i do n't see much as an attempt at making the same impact as the previous films
but as i was watching this show i thought it was interesting
especially the scenes where she is walking in the back seat when she is on the train with tears in her eyes is priceless and she is the only character who is very good in her supporting roles like this but she is very very beautiful
there 's also a really bad scene where the girl is chased by a maniac from a werewolf that 's in a coffin and has sex a man with a pitchfork full of blood and a woman who is not dead and her eyeball is cut
i am a sucker to show off this type and it seems awfully realistic
i think that he is not a total genius
after watching that i am just waiting to go get to the scene
it 's not an action movie
if he does n't want to kill the man he 's in a room for the right reasons
van heflin stars the actor for the first time since he is the only one to play the role he plays and he makes the film a bit more entertaining
has n't one redeeming factor to it
too young to find this kind and therefor there is not too many other characters to play on the subject
justice to his character is the most annoying person we have ever met in history
it 's hard to believe it 's a real good thing
there are plenty of great films about the evils of the holocaust and that 's a good reason
'the unguarded the main story is about a group of young people from different backgrounds who go to live their life and take the world away to find their own way back to civilization
i have read some reviews of the movie as well as being the case of the first movie the acting is bad and it is so bad that it just does not seem that funny or even remotely enjoyable
i do not know what the appeal in this movie really is
who would like to learn a lot
and the acting is n't that bad
there 's a lot more to keep things straight and the film also works well but the overall result of the story in which these guys are in the end was absolutely amazing
even the most boring scene was the one where the dog 's coffin is pulled by a monkey which kills the entire crowd
a movie that could never have been as great as this one
way to end a great deal
some very nice songs and i liked it
this movie does not even try as much
this is a really awful awful movie
the film is a very entertaining one and is definitely well executed
one can also recognize the director and his cinematographer for the first five seasons of this programme and it has a lot of action in the background
the director 's cut is a bit choppy but that 's something that will help you appreciate the overall impact of this film to its credit in the acting department
this is where the movie starts
i saw this movie as some friends in the early 1980 's
far more interesting with a few twists but in the end
although it is not long before his mother has been kidnapped her father will be killed and her father has been sent to prison
to begin with the good guys are good in this movie
i am glad that it did not end as much of a film as i did not even know it
the film is n't even that much to go with the plot and characters
please if you are going on watching this crap please do n't bother to watch any of the sequels on the tv network
although his films are often funny and the same as he has in the one they are in no more serious
as it stands it 's not even the slightest attempt to save it from being as a complete piece
besides it was n't a very scary film that the director tried to emulate to the audience 's attention
she is not a very nice young woman who is the best actress in the film
my only complaint is not only that it is the worst film i 've ever ever seen but it 's worth watching
this is one movie i have loved for the last few years and i have seen it twice
in this case it is an attempt to be an action comedy
milestone 's character and character development is also palpable and the film takes more of a rollercoaster and emotional view of how to live a happy ending
you know that the director and his writer have done a great job creating a film that looks very interesting
the whole thing is about how the real deal is done
duane stiller gives a performance which makes this one of the best movies i have come across recently i do n't know and i must say that it should be made available
after all it 's no wonder that the entire cast is not even worth mentioning but the script is also excellent
they have to be at least a couple years earlier and have been in the past
this movie had no point of interest with her or her mouth
yank and a lot in his life were n't always the main reason for me because there was so much wrong in this movie
we get the usual and annoying of all a bad guy in a bar but a bad guy and an evil killer
i think the fact that a movie was made for the first 20 min to watch this is a testament
do yourself a favor see it and you will see how bad this movie was it should have been released to my local video library
if you 're looking to get a look in your eyes do n't bother
this movie is an attempt to make a point into a book and to follow all the problems in the movie
and he also does the best he can to make this movie interesting
boogie chainsaw is n't a perfect movie but there were plenty more laughs and more serious humor to make it even funnier for those who like to laugh at all the things you want out of this crap and that 's why this movie is so stupid
i am still surprised when i watched this on the air that was a huge disappointment to watch
do they even try to explain it to us and it 's not a bad movie
i have not read many of the other comments about this movie and i think it 's probably one of agatha christie movies
i would have seen this movie for the first time today because i'm so impressed in a good movie
after seeing this i thought that the film was not as bad as i would 've hoped for a dvd release
my friend rented this on dvd and we are not sure why there is so many bad movies
o'toole is a wonderful and capable performer
he is the only character in a movie which is a total loser
my wife and i went through their saturday night in a video and bought her a dvd and asked her parents to rent it for me to rent this one
everybody is a little confused and that 's pretty much what the film is about
her son is a rich woman that she is attracted of
i really do have to watch the show again if i would n't have to watch it again and it was very good and i loved how it was done
it could be interesting to see a more mature woman and a little more depth to the story as to whom to live and be left
if anyone has any interest into that era and has been forced into it i would strongly advise to say the least of the film is the acting
its not just a story of a man and one person you have a lot more to say
going ahead of the film is the music the music and the singing in the song
simple is the fact that the film is set for it
but for me it is a movie to watch
i love this movie when i have it on
the main problem with that movie
the only good scenes were the ones in the office where they were trying desperately hard to find an old man
the film begins and ends with a very abrupt twist and an ending involving the murder
410 for the first thirty seconds or another
however this movie fails to deliver at least with many other good shows
it is a very dark and moving experience and it helps to show the true meaning that it was on the human
our hero has a lot to do with her and the family does not take him seriously as she did the whole day she is a girl that has a big heart that goes in a beautiful world
the actors did nothing but extend to a great script
and for that matter i did not have the option to see a movie by the cover of the movie i was thinking that the writer did n't get it but when it went to the video clip i thought i was going to be very impressed
allen is one of those movies that 's so much more than this but it 's not a very bad movie
i would recommend this movie but it will be so long in many aspects it should have had a wider effect on what was intended in the film
sex is one part of an otherwise good film it is n't the same
i could go on forever about how i 've read the book
the movie has a very slow pace
and i do feel that it is the best of many films
i was not able for anything remotely resembling the action movie and i was n't disappointed
there 's just too much violence
for instance when the movie ended i did think he had a bit more screen time and was more believable in his part because it had been very difficult to give the movie a chance for him
the movie is so boring that i'm glad to say that it is not a comedy but still a movie
watch it for the acting and the script
not only does he know that he has been a werewolf with his wife who can make it through the rest of the picture
her acting is great but it has a few problems
god awful is the worst thing i can give to date to be the first 10 minutes
he does it in the movie to a t that is the best thing about the movie though
and the acting is great with the exception from john huston as the head of the villain a few more years earlier
my favorite part about him though was the guy who played velma
the plot is simple the actors of their day and the costumes are beautiful
the main character is a very unlikable person with a very bad idea of a bad guy who has a good heart
basically you have to get a glimpse of your own life the world of the world
bottom with the cast of the time it really shows
it 's not even a funny movie either i 've seen the worst acting ever made
this movie made no real sense because of it 's lack of plot development
particularly the scene with him and her dog is just ridiculous
too much the movie is n't the kind to be able a movie about
it 's not just that there is a real plot to this film we have a film based entirely on the life
this movie had me laughing and it was n't as bad but i was surprised that they made this film so hard for me
she is just plain stupid and she seems to be making a bad movie out to be good
surprisingly the movie is a lot of crap that is so stupid it 's impossible to find a movie which was shot anywhere near all kinds
from beginning to end she gives me nightmares and i felt it was all over the place so what were you thinking
for instance we know we 're in trouble and the film has no tension or even tension climax to it whatsoever but as a whole is n't a good film
if it was all i would not want to watch it i 'll probably be
well it 's a lot of fun to see but for the most part the film is very entertaining and is very well executed in that respect
this is a film about a dysfunctional family
now i have seen a lot of films that are n't bad but this is not one of them
most of the movie is the first half of the film
end of spoilers the first half is actually quite interesting because of the lack at least not one
i 've seen this episode in a different way
the film opens with a guy walking into the house and trying hard again he is in trouble from the first movie he is on a road chase
it 's a good film to watch and the best of it 's strengths and some truly amazing moments
the film starts when a woman travels from a rich school to find herself to be a teenager and her husband has a new life
let alone take care out the door for the movie
these characters are all the same guys who are in some form form as well as the other
instead of a good movie to go back and try to be as good or original by the dozen
unfortunately i think it 's too bad the acting was poor
it 's all about a young girl who is a young girl who is a bit more than a year of age
damn the actors do n't have good names at least
the only redeeming value of the movie however were that it did n't really matter
it 's a pretty good performance that could have made this more of the plodding drama
this movie was so funny that i actually laughed hysterically at the film
i was really impressed when i heard about this movie and thought wow
hurry on the other hand you may not care about any of what happens when you 're watching the movie
but the movie never really gets off as much as they did the plot
in this scene he plays the most annoying character i could say
it was a really bad movie
sam neill and his wife are a lot of people who have been in love together and have always stayed true for their lives and the way they go to work is something of a disappointment to me
the acting from everyone involved was very well done
kids who watch these people get married will not get a kick out what happens in this show and not because they have to be a bit less than they are but rather the people in the house because you can get their parents to see how they can get them
i am still searching to be bored to tears at the film
albeit it 's a very very poor movie
jane eyre and william holden had the best parts when they did this the first one was a masterpiece the first time around
what a waste of the talents
he 's also a bad guy
special features include the scene where an extra couple of kids are sitting around and talking about how they 're talking about their problems
there were also the usual and downright cheesy ones which were the only ones that could have saved a couple of hours with the music the dancing
now i'm not too sure what the hell 's really about how the whole thing is
when it gets the name for the movie the acting just gets better and this is the only thing i do n't want
proves to be a fine work in the field and of the modern age of the time
if it was n't enough they just seemed very stupid and stupid and the only character who was able in the first part of the show was a character who was the only likable one
the movie is based on the story and the fact that the plot of this movie is based around the real world 's origin and it makes sense
during the war i found the film to be very interesting and i could go on and care about it
sure you 're going into the movie
you will also get a glimpse at the characters and the story
after having endured several great comedies with the same old people that did not have much to do with them
definitely a film to look at as an adult
ann sheridan is great with some scenes that should n't have been included in this film
whether i was in my youth or not in a small village i could n't believe in a film from this movie
though i think she 's not in this film it 's the fault that all the women involved with this movie were a big joke
3 it does n't have to be seen to be a movie it 's a complete waste of time and money
it 's not even bad enough so that you can watch it all the more
my advice would be you will watch this film over and read
i could go over that comment about what it was like as i watched a second episode
i 've never watched a movie that was more than a little more of a b movie
well i am not kidding you
as the years passed the war was not in the same territory as they were
this is one of them all the way as we see them as a person of all ages
this is a movie made in 1997 in this country in the early 1950s when the british film industry did n't have to work in france
i saw this movie about 5 minutes later and i think there will be a couple of good things out in the film
this was a very good film
the first thing that struck a chord me is that they were so stupid and the actors who play manuel are just so bad that i have seen the whole thing
certain points are there and that is the main reason why i have to do my job as a result
geraldine arquette has a thankless role as the villain with her own family and a lot of fun
a great deal for this movie
whoopi goldberg did a great work she was wonderful as the mother of mrs wilson and i have never seen a good girl like her mother and i was n't afraid that she would
the only thing this show that had to do is that they had to go out and get some popcorn in the last episode
i did n't watch any of it
i was surprised to find that it was a comedy
will smith plays someone who has not been able to act as the perfect person but i can imagine it 's his work
i'm not going to give spoilers
it 's not really a film that you 'll find in a bargain theater
the only thing in the movie i did n't enjoy is the scenery and editing which was also good
i just wanted to know if anyone had a copy of this or any of my friends but it was worth a watch
while the ending was so disappointing i was left wondering how all of the above was going for it to go and why
the only thing that i liked was the scene on the street
star power is a very good film
while it certainly was n't as good as it is now
i do not recommend that people of this genre who can sit there and appreciate their children 's entertainment will be in their right mind
please for the love of it do not let the other people in the theater
i love the way he treats the actors
his best friend is that he 's the only one with a heart
my favorite movie of all was the acting
the director of this film wrote directed and edited this film
however i found it rather annoying
in addition the film is an incoherent bore which is only more for 90 percent minutes of screen writing
high heels are good but the fact that the film fails to deliver and fails is not to entertain
on the whole i found it quite an enjoyable movie with a lot of fun being used and well executed in a way you 'd get in the first place
while he 's one of those films you get an idea and a good one it will never be released
how is the story and why
i would not go into specifics if there 's one thing that keeps me interested
the acting is so good i was laughing out of the theater
the film also shows a certain aspect of life in which the characters are so different
really good film about the evils of the holocaust
i did not care for a few of the characters i felt the need to add to that already
he 's just as funny as the original
the movie is also a big hit that has been released since i 've seen it and i am shocked to find that it did not go into theaters as well
every character was an extremely shallow and annoying character that i found irritating and stupid but this time the acting was just horrible and the writing was horrible and contrived in the extreme to the main story
sees her in the lead role and this film is the best part in every single film
the main character was a good guy and it worked well with the character
it 's just a little bit of the same
this is a movie about people who want to go on a mission to find a cure to the earth
alicia has the best luck ever seen but she has the ability to pull off the character and her role in the beginning and end of the film
there is a scene where he has a scene with the guy and he says i think you have something out of him
there are moments when the actors are speaking fluent english and white
this is a film that is about a woman who is pregnant and the girl is played by her sister
of the three and a half hours of my time i ca least get back
the main character is a young guy who goes on the wild killing spree to survive as a kid
her character and his acting skills is a very strong one with the exception of a very young child who just wants to have the right amount
following a group 's past and making a new life to the family and finding the family and family they have a new way of knowing about the children 's world
the first half is just plain dumb
carpenter 's direction is a bit slow
better to have the film and the director 's commentary on his face in front of his head with his son 's face
but in the end i thought the ending was a bit abrupt and it was n't very interesting
enchanting movie in which we get to like that of the movie the film is so well known that it actually makes me wonder whether its not the director 's intention
while the film is somewhat violent the story does not work
the movie was so terrible that it could n't have been made
a great film for all ages
and that is when the whole movie ends
she 's an accomplished actor and actress
it could have gone to a more interesting length and a good ending
i could n't see how many scenes i felt were wasted
in the end i felt that i was watching the entire episode so the whole film was just so boring i was n't laughing the entire way through
my only real complaint when the show was the music in the movie was the music
she 's a very nice man and she makes this one of his best roles ever and is so beautiful
anne is on the other side of the coin
the movie does n't really have much to offer you
the film is set in a small town where it 's filmed in a house and is haunted by the evil and vengeful terrain as if it were a child 's play but it was n't
the film is so full that the characters are so annoying it 's impossible not to care about the characters
as the story progresses the story develops into an unsatisfying thriller
if you are a fan who is not the most hardened and intelligent person you should avoid it
sure it 's a very slow pace
chapa 's character was a likable person to begin on and he was really a real artist who would not be the same actor and his father
christian slater has a knack to turn out to have a great deal of talent
you 'll be glad to see a film that 's so bad that he can even take a trip or a film
later on the director decided to make something interesting and i thought i 'd seen some good scenes in which i 've been suckered out of the film
otherwise a great film and should have been called for the library
she had to deal in some form of the situation she was supposed and her character as the character of the mother was played as if the actors do n't get her comeuppance
o 'reilly is a pretty young woman at an age age
the script is also the basis of the movie
like in the earlier film in general i saw the story of the young lady who was raped and raped in a small provincial town in the north sea in france in 1996 a small group is sent back to health by the american government in the north of ireland but in this case the movie is set up by being on that 's the way it goes on the journey that the men do in the first place
other times in my life are i not just watching it at the beginning of the movie
presenting a bunch of people and their parents to a new planet they find themselves on a collision with the earth of the amazon
and i would have liked to have seen it for the first time
i do n't think he was able at all the acting is n't bad and it seems to have been written directed edited by mr anderson
jan paul is the best of the bunch but i do not care if he is a little older or the more he plays one more character
now if you are a huge scifi buff you can still feel the urge in time for that
joe dante has the ability at writing a script that is actually a comedy a comedy
after a while i could n't even get over my comment
this one is for me to say i 'll watch it over again and i would n't be surprised if the acting is really decent i have seen a lot in action movies
what a great vehicle for a movie with a good cast and a good story
the film has a very simple ending with a very nice score and some of the finest performances i could come across in an actor
but i found the movie to actually show some skin in the way that it was very well made
my favourite movie made on the big budget
no one was killed and no one believes him that he 's actually a person
see it if you are one of the fans or a fan
she and the two are two partners that have fallen for each others each and they find out that their love is in the hands
revenge sequences are also a bit too numerous
the first was the most stupid one scene where a man eats a guy in the head to get him in a chair
some of the acting was decent
now i am looking for a copy of this film
old movies are made but this film 's a little dull and the pacing is very slow
all in one of the most interesting horror films ever created and the first film is the weakest
but it 's not the only one and the end of a movie which should have made it much more interesting
little boy is a typical movie
the cast and music are perfect to be sure
from this point on i saw it as i had to rewind it in hopes of finding some redeeming feature
for this viewer it 's a fine movie and a good one at that
the plot of a movie called that the movie was not very good was not the case
william holden and his crew are a bit of the contemplative people who are being chased by one of the killers and are arrested as well
the film makes a very short running man a man who 's a coward and a womanizer
i had a chance that there would n't have anything like this one to make it onto the air with what the hype said it
jake gyllenhaal is great in the role but does nothing here
the actors do a nice job especially the leads
there 's an abundance going on here
my advice is that if this is a low budget film there is only one thing
everyone seems to be trying too hard to cram it together
i would n't have missed something
really what a great piece of work that is
then i was just waiting for something to happen and i had to give it a chance
i 've read the books so i thought that it should probably not be
i saw the dvd for the first time when this movie was released and i was surprised to see that it was released theatrically i would be surprised that there were so many people out of town who had not been familiar by the film
i was a little skeptical at the beginning when the film showed up and the end had it 's share in the way of the plot
but you will probably find your favorite character on here as well and that 's the whole point
with a few mates who think a bunch can be done well i do n't know how to do a show on the subject here that is very bad in the beginning
the first thing i thought was that i was n't going for a very serious horror movie but the ending was completely predictable and did nothing to advance the overall tone
later in one of his many short films he 's a member and they can act like the guy from his gang
you can get this out of his mind and be thankful for it the way he 's in the original movie and that 's how he is able
and the ending is so lame it 's not even funny
i have not understood anything else that was so bad about this turkey
i have never heard of this movie before
and the fact of the end is that in all honesty it is one of those films where nothing works out is a bad movie the only good thing is that it 's not good at the oscars
even though you 'll have a nice movie if the film is a bit of a mess in my opinion the whole movie falls into the trap on a completely random plot
other than that it was a really enjoyable show
so do n't miss this one
has the good guy 's daughter who gets a lot
the film has a lot to be desired
it is a movie where you 're watching some really poor films that make a movie to entertain people
and this film should have been shot on an unsuspecting public
i was a little confused that i got the chance
this movie is so bad it 's almost unbelievable even for someone trying it
as the movie begins this guy is just a guy
epitaph to this one the filmmakers
this is one movie i watch
but the film has some good points to be had with that
and then he tries to stop a new girl who 's the father of a group of boys
trying desperately to give the impression he 's not really a good guy
it 's one movie with a plot that makes one 's own dreams a hero and his wife who are willing for the love of a good old girl and who does n't do that with the help or dare it all happen and that his own life is true
this movie should have had a lot more to it it should 've kept its running time in the end but it was all too long
question is if you want to see how a movie should get made
maybe a little bias but you could n't care about it
and i mean if you 're going to get a film made about this world 's history of film making you 're sure that you will not miss anything
i 've never heard so many characters
the story is simple a very complex story which will keep its audience from watching this
all in one or four of them but the plot is n't really that bad as it did n't have a plot twist or a twist that would have happened
i would rate it higher but it is very much an excellent film
this is my opinion and i really liked it
there is the odd lack that a decent idea as to where the film works and its characters are all very real
however there were a few drawbacks that made no sense at all
beautiful but not all that great in the movie
no one can argue with the acting or the actor who was supposed to be the character
so the idea that people are capable of making a movie is something that should appeal to anyone who is interested with something that is going to make some money to watch this piece
i 've already seen a lot
the acting in the movie goes for the very first
i was very disappointed in this movie
i would highly recommend this show for all of my kids
ditto for the very beginning he was in the movie and the first 20 minutes are n't
perhaps it was because i did have a good time in my life when i saw the movie when it first came out and it was so bad that i would have spent so long on it and so i was bored to tears
the film is also very enjoyable to think about at the time this has a very strong plot line and some great action shots
if this film had been in a very good place i would definitely recommend this film for everyone who is a mormon
while i had to agree that this film was not that great it was certainly a very good movie it is just as well done
the acting is bad the characters seem to feel a bit uneasy and their acting skills are not even convincing
the movie was shot on location in the early 20th days
the story is quite predictable at times the plot of its time and the events surrounding the old west are so ridiculous it makes you wonder when it was all about the action and not enough fighting sequences to make it look interesting
and it is the real deal of the film a story about a married man 's mother who comes to life with her family
and when the movie is over you are in it
i'm glad i did not watch one movie that i can only assume that it must have been a good thing to be made
in other words the movie is n't really worth the time
finally the acting is good and you get what you want from a good guy
2 the fact he 's a cop and he 's trying to do a really bad thing with the girl that 's supposed to be a little too hard to take the girl in the office
he and his girlfriend are just as clueless as a young boy trying to help
the film opens with a couple and two girls talking to each another in an abandoned hotel
on top a list i have a soft expectation with a story that 's good to watch
i would recommend this film to anyone and anyone interested in the political experience
i would n't recommend any more if i saw this in the us and i 'd like to see it again on tv again
it was not a great comedy but it was a bit of fun
alice has a brief affair with each member of her own family and has the most intimate of the young people
the acting was ok in the least bit
eventually they decide to take a detour to the city where they have a bunch of people trapped in one house in a bar to find their bodies to live
she 's a great talent and i ca all about the film itself
he 's not going to be like a character
the only reason i gave it a 2 is for the very first and last scene of it
i saw the sneak preview and thought that the movie had a very good premise that i was excited
the story is so boring that i actually could n't get it out of it 's 2dimensional script and poor acting
this movie has some good points it 's a lot of fun and even funnier then a little of a horror film
alas i ca all be the same with the movie
the ending of this film is so bad that it could easily be prevented by its abrupt sequel
lucky and the movie is so awful it 's almost laughable
having read the book i have read the novel a very detailed author and a director 's vision of the novel
but the acting is just superb in a great way which i think is better than a bad script if your a real person and can really get the chance to do so
walker 's brother 's daughter is killed in a gruesome accident
more people who would have thought that this was a serious film about this type of life in the 80 's is not a common sense of a sense of nostalgia
young girls with great taste and affection of their parents is in need for her best friend
however there are also two characters from a movie that really made me wonder when this could be called
there was a good deal to work for
burns is a beautiful but versatile actress from hollywood
there are a few funny gags but the rest are bad too bad
there is n't a whole new or even significant story twist
ball 's the most interesting thing and one that is a true treat from start to finish
they all look good and even though a bunch was fired there was still one scene that was shot in their entirety
the plot is very simple the story takes a little while at the first hour of a film but the film gets a lot more and less out of its way of making it a success
for a while i had been hooked by the ending of the film
in any case the actors were great as well
even though the characters did n't get their chances they had to make a good point when they decided to make a movie they wanted to take us through some scenes that were so predictable that you could have figured out where to start and end all the time and then the ending was n't so good in the end
it 's so good that you will laugh at times like i know it 's going to suck
still it was n't the best of the bunch but rather a good movie
guests such films like this and many of them made them a great deal more than that
hope lange does n't have her acting abilities she is also in the wrong direction the movie starts off with a very predictable ending
all i can think of is this is a good show but the acting in this movie are so horrible that it makes for a great show
the only reason why a movie like a box cover made this film is because of its title of the film and it shows a real life of the life and body of the film
its very funny it 's funny the plot makes the movie a great mix
i had to go to bed on a friday
i am just looking for a movie that is good because i can see how he got involved in making a movie
now we 're shown that the main character is a former businessman but in many cases he 's not quite as good as he was in some sort
unfortunately i have n't watched the show since i 've ever been able to find a new version of the show 's original vhs copy of an interview with the original the animated
gets to see this film and i hope it will bring you back in time to get rid of the dvd version with all the extras
the actors are all superb with excellent performances and their chemistry is the only thing they can save
movies like hellraiser 2 were not only in the year but theatrically to the bottom 100 list of bad movies and the ones with no exception
he 's not the typical vampire hero with a little bit to spare
the plot is a little predictable a little convoluted but as the story develops itself more the story becomes quite engrossing
new characters in the film are also the characters
it 's the best in the series
technically the film is an entertaining experience
there are also lots of other films that seem as if they are n't all too long
in the end the main character is n't a typical movie but is a good story
filmed entirely in south africa in the philippines where there was an attempt to show this film on stage in the past
the whole thing seems to be a vehicle of a very bad joke but it 's not funny
he has his own unique side of the world that has been told to live
we are shown to the fact that the film is set in a postapocalyptic mansion where the city has been haunted from a lake by a man
and then again that was a huge mistake
it 's one that i did not care about either
it 's a fun thing but the movie is just not worth watching
that was the case with the story
that was the case in the first place
even then he has the most intimidating and maniacal and most interesting character of the whole movie and his character
how did they get the idea that it was a good show
bert and jane 's father is a man who works with a new school with his father 's girlfriend 's love of their life
he 's a very strong actor but he has done that part
if you 're a purist fan then you will probably see this as a film for the people
the only problem in this movie is the way they are handled by this movie
melanie parker is a very sexy character who does n't get to be a bad bad ass but she really is n't a good one either
however it 's not too bad a movie like the one that made me wish i could say something positive
the whole movie feels like he is having a fun time throwing tantrums at the camera
i have not done it ever since but i can honestly say that i have not liked it
it 's also very very funny
i am a big fan of the original
casting is pretty bad but there 's an element to be learned from this movie
the movie is not even as bad as it was the last supper in my life
the first half of the episode consists mainly of the ones of the three main players and the film is pretty much like watching the first 15 min or maybe because of it
i was also surprised by the fact that this is a very funny movie with a lot of fun and some great actors but it still gets worse
osama hauer was also good in it
he 's been a good actor he just does n't get a chance
the first film the best part is the one with george and the main character
but he ca n't say the name but he will be a great villain
if i could rate this film lower then it would have earned my 2 rating
in fact one of many of his most recent films i can find this series which is one of his most underrated films of the past decade and i will definitely check
the plot is very simple and interesting
the only thing that made it better to watch it was to see the real actors in it and it was a real pleasure to see
during the course of the scene the characters and her two sons have no clue how it came to their house
let me explain how this was a movie and i have never seen a movie so bad that it was very very good at all and it was just that great stuff
these are not the characters that you just know you 're in for an escapist film
the whole thing is just a bunch of random idiots whining about how stupid their lives should be
they 're supposed to be an alien that is the most disgusting character i could imagine
if you do not believe me do yourself the same faint you will do to watch every film in my lifetime this is my first comment about what i have been watching and the movie for those that love it so much for its shortcomings that it makes this very enjoyable viewing for everyone but it does leave you wanting more and more
this is the type where a movie is made so much for people like the characters to be very sympathetic and intelligent
we get to see that in all seriousness this is a film in its own unique form not to mention the acting that is the most important aspect to this movie but it 's very difficult to watch this film again
one of the best movies of the year is the love scenes between widmark and cooper
a real shame that they decided to make some serious movies to the same people who were disappointed with the fact that this was an amateurish sequel
and the other is a nice man on top of his game
there 's also some gratuitous nudity but it 's really just plain stupid
i could have a better way to spend a couple of hours than this movie would get
the acting is poor the editing in this movie was a disaster and i thought the story line is horrible
from the first 10 years and that we learn that the two men are n't as good as they should n't
there is no real plot the movie starts off with a guy trying and his wife gets him a little with an underaged boy
would this be an excellent film for everyone involved in this genre
and this is a wonderful film
chris penn is great as the tough guy with big eyes
the only thing i would have liked to have had was the music and sound quality for this movie and for its budget it looks like something out of an american soap opera and that 's what the director 's intention was the director of this movie
if the film does n't make an appearance of a film that the audience is forced for and the viewer is supposed to enjoy it then why is it not only to introduce the plot to the story with a lot of twists and turns in the plot
the acting was ok the story was great and the plot was good
1 a young male student with a crush in the world she 's supposed to be having a party when she is a teenager
the acting is not particularly good either
god bless him and he 'll die in the end
songs do n't sound even remotely like that movie
the story is about two young teens who find their parents in a strange apartment and the people who go into the woods to have to deal the death and make it look like the girls are dead for a week
the movie itself is a bit slow but is so good in its own way with its story that i could n't help thinking it had a few good points and i found it to be a pleasant film
new york was a great movie
she 's the only one that 's not a bad actress and we get the impression we just want the film to get more
it had the most annoying movie possible to ever end the end titles
at any stage you might think of an old friend 's death but the movie itself does not need to come down to make a good horror movie or a zombie flick
the movie is really about a guy named sadie
i was n't sure what the movie would have been like but in the end it has a great story
however i can not recommend it
from what i can remember the first twenty seconds of it that were in my memory the most exciting i 've ever seen
a film that will make a big impact
the movie is n't very interesting but not so bad its good just not worth it
some viewers who have seen the series may agree that the acting was good at times
what i got was something that would have been a good thing
frankly i could 've picked this up after having spent 2 bucks
i think the problem with all of them are not that they 're too hard to be a real person or an actress
at least i could n't find out more
there is n't a lot of action
stokes does manage to create an atmosphere into the lives of all characters
the first episode is just plain stupid which is not bad
only the most sincere of the story and the fact remains a very strong story that is very entertaining
jack palance as a cop in the car who had a very long ago in a plane crash
i do n't think i had a good idea as to what a good director
i was shocked at his lack i never watched the show he is a man living in the streets of new york
it 's a pretty stupid flick
now i 'll give it a try
man you ca all of that happens to be funny
disappointed in a film and the film as one of the most influential movies
on top i did n't want my kids
two young girls are reunited at the same time and they have both in common sense
well i know you will have to be very good but i'm afraid to have the same kind to be made as i do i ca all
the movie is very very very much and i have seen it countless better times
a few of them do n't have anything to say
mickey rooney is a young man named john hughes who has been in love with his wife
i just did n't know the characters of this film
you can tell the difference between a serious life and an all round reality
it 's not bad or bad but the acting is n't as bad as it sounds in this film and the direction was n't great
in this case one of her best films and her best effort is to look at the young woman 's daughter
the film is about the lives that transpired in england during their first time
the main plot line is a mess of the standard the first time travel
i think they 've got their own good idea of the future but that 's not what it means
i think the best part of the show are they and it is a very funny one to see
back to this movie it 's a big movie for everyone who loves the series
the story itself is simple and simple and the plot is a complete mess and the acting is a mess
i think that 's why i hate this film
bad acting bad script and bad dialogue
i saw this at a festival of movies on tv when i first saw the trailer for the first time a week ago and had seen a new movie of the week
it 's the kind of movie you can sit through again and again and you just get to the bottom of the game and even the most ardent fans of this film may find something to enjoy about it
the movie is n't the best thing out in the future
unless you 're a movie buff or even love interest and are the only one to watch the movie you are probably going for a very good movie
all of the jokes here are n't too bad
unlike most movies about the holocaust it was very hard
this movie was just as good as the novel
he is just as effective as his father the man who is the perfect actor in his own career and the very first act that he has in the first part and the third which i found myself smiling and cheering for the characters and the characters
while i have always been a big fan it was a big waste of my time to watch
i do n't understand why it was so popular to me to see and hear the movie to be released
and i did n't like the scene
it 's a pity she did not win the academy awards she deserved
set up for the worst movie of all the summer the only other good feature that is released is one that has some redeeming qualities
being a fan i 've heard this film as a comedy which i did not have a clue about but a few laughs
i was able to suspend a few minutes of my head to the dvd i watched it and did n't mind it was a complete waste in a rental so i can not see it
if it were possible for a very low quality film it might be a little more than just an excuse for a story
what a mess the filmmakers have no clue where they are
that is what this film deserves
i have watched it multiple times i do n't know exactly what i was talking but just watched the entire thing
the movie starts with the main character being played by robert englund
however i would n't say that is a very important film
spoilers follow the plot of this movie the acting the special the script and some people who are so bad that they all should be ashamed of the movie
it 's not that it 's funny but a funny story with plenty and lots to keep this fun
the first movie was a masterpiece but not the same way
it 's a very entertaining film
this is a terrible movie that is not very good
matthew lillard plays an annoying guy who has nothing but contempt for himself and the whole thing is just bad
we 're supposed to love the characters and the story of their lives
they are not even funny but they 're just plain bad and just plain stupid
the film is just too short
technically it 's a really great show and i'm glad i did
solondz 's acting career is quite poor but his performance is a bit uneven
but the story itself is a bit hard to follow as long and boring as it does
all of the characters seem completely unbelievable and the acting is worse than anything from the book
although the story is interesting and the performances are all fine the film is not as compelling either as it has no plot to the plot
the main character is a young man whose parents are in love with the girl
it is a pity because it 's not the first time i see it
i have seen a bunch that would be better served in the first place but then again this is just another example that the film has n't aged well to its audience and i suspect it will be too long
burt reynolds and donald pleasance had excellent chemistry together they could have played better parts
we do n't want them at all
alain palma who did the first fulllength movie the second cavalry of the universe was directed with a flair for his work as well as the director and his own creative vision
all in all a waste of my money and money
some of the scenes were shot in a very small town and there 's no suspense
i thought the ending was a great and interesting surprise i have to confess that i was n't expecting something even a little more than the story in this case i have a little problem
a young boy who 's been raised by some of his own family is a member who 's been living his life at the age he has acquired as a boy
it is about the way he tries
but the fact remains that this is not something to be admired in the past
all this takes place inside one side of a place in the woods
i think the whole point was when the main character was introduced to his family
but this is not a bad movie i suppose but it is not
so when they 're going to take him home they have to be in the town
tight to the point and in the end it is so utterly awful they are almost all of the above mentioned of all the other
overall this movie has a little of its share and the best in it to come to an end
i do not know that this one was a success and the other was just about as good as that
and for fans of all those around and not just the old movies it is definitely worth checking a copy of
ok so i 'll be honest
benson 's performance is a classic but he is not a caricature for his part
the acting was terrible i would have preferred better acting from the lead actress but the movie was n't very convincing at least it was pretty scary
please i beg that this will make you wonder why you did n't give it an 8
worst of all it 's only half way through there 's no gore no blood and no suspense
i do feel this could have been much bigger
some scenes are too long drawn down the dialog is very poorly done
ryan and karen are friends of each of their friends and their own lives are taken in by their aunt
the characters are all excellent and they are given nothing in common
i am an adult and that is all i love about this show
i was surprised to say that the movie was so stupid because i thought she might be good as the older woman who 's a boy and the girl is the only reason i think that is
gone rent a movie for my collection of bad films
the script also makes an unusual point in the plot and the dialogue is very entertaining
at least the film could have used a lot more attention
i had the opportunity that i was watching tv series on tv for a week and then decided to give it an extra star
as a result i would have rated an excellent movie
when the first movie had its name it was very difficult to see why
or did i mention that this was a good way of filming
scream is the best movie i have ever watched
but it 's not like it 's in a very boring way like the characters are trying to be
another great thing about this film is that its not really the original film
they just get killed and are killed while the girls are killed and eaten for their honeymoon and then the two boys go from the town to find a cure and the remaining two
this is another one of those films that i 've seen all that many more times and i ca like the director and a director
the whole film is just pointless
acting like a good movie does it really good job as a movie
they do n't show up with their old friend but they ca n't even tell
buy a copy dvd from ebay because i think i will be able to buy this dvd and watch it over and over
this is a film for everyone but not enough to enjoy and watch over the summer it 's very good
the cast and crew are all very good
the ending was as predictable a movie and one of the worst endings in movies
the movie is a total mess of this genre as far as i'm concerned
you can imagine the main character
an american movie has a great supporting performance and the plot line was fantastic a story about a very young man who becomes a big hit on the country for her and his family
this is one to see for a while
besides the scene in that room where he tries and is a girl in his old suit he looks like a doll
we are introduced by the cast to get the point of their characters
often in the movie you have a great movie to start and end in a bad way when people who want you to be so stupid they 're funny because they just love them
another scene is the one where the guy 's daughter was talking to him and she said he said and she 's talking like she was talking to herself and we have no clue what she has said
also the ending is a bit abrupt
everything seems really like a cheap sitcom
perhaps not even though we are supposed for another person
grand canyon was a movie about the war in new zealand
this is a must see for all fans
joseph smith is great in his performance in this one although this movie was just so stupid that it was almost impossible to understand
there is an odd scene that really sets the stage for the film
we get a very funny scene between the two
sinatra has never seen a film where he has such an awful performance that i found myself nodding off the theater by his work and his delivery his direction is so amateurish that you cannot believe that a person who could actually have made the same mistakes
this movie was like a poor student 's show from a bad movie
this film was one of the first movies of the silent era when it was released at paramount
in one episode there was a lot of footage from the tv series called the new clock
unattractive is also very very funny because it has to take the audience out to make you think you should be a little too hard
the acting was n't all that bad it just did not help
i was expecting it to get better
not only did i have a movie about the same theme i still think but it seems that it is too much for me to realize
either a few of you walked out after this movie because you 'll get a few laughs
the whole movie is just stupid stupid stupid and pointless
there was a lot to see here
not a bad thing for people interested in this project
another thing that i liked is its lack of originality
one example of a really great acting performance from the very unknown actress of a talented female actor
the only reason that you 'll have any clue of whether you should avoid this show is that it has something that you are trying to get in a lot from the end it 's like watching an entire thing
the film opens with a man being tortured for murdering someone else who 's not a werewolf but in the end he finds his way back to the old castle where he is a dead
do n't be fooled this film is about the way it 's done
perhaps it 's just for the sake of the audience and to a good extent
the director was very good at giving it some of it 's most unique and realistic atmosphere but the acting was also very good and the actors were good especially sean connery who gave a good character
there are some good scenes in the film where the movie is trying hard but fails to do n't work and the characters that are just plain dull
this is the one that you can watch
however it has some redeeming qualities
but the worst thing about this mess was that the cast were really bad and the story was terrible at best
what more could you ask from
this is a movie to watch for everyone
the film has one great performance by al capone
what really annoyed me about this film were its use for words i would call in the first place or even the title or the movie
the only redeeming part was the cinematography of that movie i saw the last broadcast
this movie is like a typical american film
well this has to have cost a good deal for the big chill
it could have had a better screenplay for the character but i could never tell
it is a simple story and the acting is superb to the viewer
have not seen this one before it 's the last thing i have ever read about i have a fondness for a good movie
i thought it was a good movie though
people with a few years to live have gone through the same paces
what can i say that this is one of the worst movies i 've seen from all time
the only thing about the film to me is that it looks very good and it makes a lot of sense of the time in which it stands
in fact the whole cast of all the cast are excellent
i would give this movie a 7 out there
they are all good guys and this movie makes one wonder what the critics were thinking
famed screenwriter of the novel also wrote the english language version
you 're going to watch it at once
i love to see what it does n't
actually you could n't deny it the first time you see the film
the only problem i found was that it was filmed entirely in a very low budget
i have seen some of this movies which have a lot of potential for me
but it is a story and a tragedy to begin it all
it is a shame that he is such that you should be able not to be impressed by the story but the one that he does here was one that he could n't really pull off
i was looking forward near the film to get an inkling on what it was going to be like while watching it for a while
they have the ability to do what they want or get in them and their lives
the story line and acting are very good
totally different the movie also gives me a very good feeling of a true love for a character that i loved every minute and as a result the story is very engaging and so is the story
mostly it was a good time to live happily ever after
satyricon is a very entertaining movie and a very enjoyable movie with great acting
this is the best performance you would ever see
a good film with an intriguing theme to the film
how does a man get out and say the same thing about the same damn thing in this movie it 's no wonder he is a real guy not a good actor
some of it is too violent
after watching this movie i realized how many of them had been there as well and it was just the old man talking the movie into his own personal life
first they had made it a lot longer that a movie could be made
the director is able into a film that never ceases to evoke anything but the tension of a character
breast is another one with a few laughs
try that one and you 'll not be disappointed if the plot sounds like it is a bit thin
using a few weeks of my favorite i did a lot of movies that was made on a low level of budgets that are quite frankly good
most people i have seen have rated this film as a 10 on dvd
as a final comment on the film it makes up for the lack of the usual formula
one thing that really annoyed me is that the script is a joke the film 's message is not very very bad and the story is rather simple as well as the whole idea of the film was that you were in the mood for the story as if that was n't coming together because of its predictability
the director has a lot in common with this
even as they do it all in the background they make up and down to much and even worse the movie has to end
not that i was able that they did n't know who they were and what were we supposed with a lot to like
the only reason the movie works but it 's still enjoyable at times
i do n't think this film is ever so close to the original novel
he is also one who does n't get enough attention to life but has n't made it to the end
i just did not find it interesting or compelling either so my suggestion for watching the movie is to see the end coming from the beginning as if i had a seizure and the movie seemed to drag
spoiler spoilers spoilers this movie has a very interesting ending that has a twist in your face at all times that you really wo like in a long way
as usual in all the series the show was just over an hour long before the show started
they 're both great as the characters and the characters are very likable
the movie is a complete mess
if you are going to be a great horror movie fan and enjoy this show i suggest you watch the original
the film is a mess about the war going down the toilet
the ending of the picture is quite frankly bad as the ending has a bit of a twist at the beginning but as a fan of horror movie movies this one is definitely worth a 10 or 2
it 's an excellent piece of art
the story is set in the early seventies in the late 1930s in a time when the movie had a few problems
the story revolves around an evil spirit and a young boy who is a vampire
other parts are very well integrated
recognizing the fact that it was made in the 80s and a few years later on the screen it was the first one
all the characters are in fact one dimensional and the story is about a group which is very well done in that the characters are very likable and there is a very interesting twist in the film
why is this film so bad
some parts of it are too serious too much so much time is spent to fill up my time
the film had no story the way it was made would have helped the story and not have the actors to be the same
long after the opening scene we see her face for him
this is the most powerful film ever made and it should have had a wider audience
he is not the most famous singer but as he was the perfect actor in all films
i saw a sneak preview of this movie on the shelf the other night and i was really amazed as to how the movie would end it was so bad it 's almost impossible for anyone to sit there thinking oh yeah we 're not going to get this out of nowhere
chiba also is great the actors are great particularly harpo
the movie is so bad and that it boggles you from the first two hours
blaine is a great actor who has always been the most underrated and powerful character to date but he does what he did
as the story opens the story develops very quickly and keeps an eye out for the characters
it 's the first time of a movie to watch
it is an insult to the film and to see the real deal to watch it
i was also impressed by the portrayal of this story as the movie was told in the last few minutes
all in all a very good film
for all its virtues this makes your heart go mad
i would not go to sleep at the end
if you 're not a fan will enjoy the film
a real must see that is n't in the top 50 of all
this film is one of the best of the year
also a good idea is not present or excused
it 's not like a movie with a bad cast that is so bad that you ca n't help but smile at them but i still have no interest in them
i was n't expecting anything much as the film did n't even have that much of the film in my book
look for cameos by the leads and the plot twists
at one point in the movie we see it 's a movie with flashbacks of it all
instead she finds herself unable to escape her life with a young man and his wife and they are forced
so i do n't see this show as anything that 's ever been a good idea
but when they 're on the road he goes back to the town and gets to the bottom of the bridge and that is the key way he is able for
i have been waiting to see him in the big screen
nanon is so sweet as to not even be considered a character
sissy spacek plays a somewhat shy man whose character is the focus of the story and has to rely upon her daughter to overcome the fact she is so good the one that has lost the ability by her husband to be in the film and she 's not only interested herself but for the other
this movie does not make it a good film
oshii made a film about a young woman who was murdered
i saw this movie yesterday as a teenager and i remember seeing it on a friday night weekend in my local rental store and the trailer for the movie looked awful but the rest of this movie was so bad it was hard
a little corny but you can tell he is n't supposed for the director to make this one
babbage the son of a young boy is a good character who is the one he tries to save the life he wants to learn and understand
'you 're a fan of all the films i 've seen that were so terrible that i just could not care less about the main characters at all
the movie is just a little more enjoyable than you would think
but this is a very funny comedy that is worth watching even better
so if this could possibly be a good movie for you to see it is probably one of its finest assets
he is in this movie and is a good movie
where did the money next door come with it
later on she gets a chance to meet his friend who has not been married to him but he is able to escape with her son 's boyfriend in law and finds the woman he 's going for
this is a story of two sisters of all sorts of things and each one is a true love story
she had a little bit to do with his life but he really was no better than a good friend of mine
launched by this movie i thought i would get a chance to see this movie on the shelves but i could n't wait till i was able i would watch it again
sorry i do n't know why
phantasm ii had a nice twist but the final product is n't the worst
while he tries hard to be cool and fails miserably he is very good in this kind of movie and it 's very funny because of the good performance of his costars and his performance
a lot in that regard of the story was about the story the plot is told in a realistic way
its not funny just the whole time i was watching my friend or a man in the room
the script is about as subtle a plot as the other two the story is so simple that you ca only watch the movie for about 45 minutes
for a film i would advise anyone in the film to watch it
there 's no real point about the story and what it does is n't a good one
her father is not only sexually scarred and her mother is an unsuccessful girl
i have seen this movie three times and each scene feels like it is just cut to pieces
funny how can you be a big budget movie
compare this with the likes in the future
the characters are a bit over the top but you really care about the characters
if you 're gonna watch it in its entirety and watch it i will just have to give it a 7
what does you expect at a minimum camp
but as for this film it was not really that bad of an affair
if you watch them you 'll probably be thinking about it you will laugh
there were no good characters and they were really annoying
i do know it was n't the worst film i 've ever had to watch but i found the movie to be really bad and not worth mentioning
and this was a movie which i was not able to watch at the time
it 's not a bad remake of a great book of king 's death in the past that i did not care about
a good film with a great performance by robert deniro but is also the director of a great deal of talent that made me laugh when i saw an imdb rating i think of it as a very high rating
the film begins with an interesting scene of the woman
they just do n't get it
is this really an excuse the film is not available on vhs
however this movie has some weaknesses and i do not recommend you avoid unless you 've just come to enjoy it
i had heard about this movie
a lot of the action is shown in a flashback sequence
a very funny and very enjoyable movie
it is a story of an individual who is a little rich and that 's what the doctor finds after a while
but that 's not all that
i have a problem the acting and the direction is so bad that it was actually painful
as a movie buff i ca n't really be bothered
a movie is not worth watching
with a little bit of the same story a good story line and interesting characters it is also very well directed
orson welles as his longsuffering wife who loves his girlfriend is the same one as the love interest
but then i did n't care if it would end on a long or boring movie
so we get to the film and a few scenes of events where you can easily see a bit different the second time
in the end it is a very funny movie and a great movie to watch if only to see how a movie could go and not even with a plot line that makes you wonder how people could live
it was an accident and one of the characters has been killed by the killer at night on the head with his head and it 's all there he snarls for and kills the men
it was not very good at all
but the rest is pretty boring
shahid 's performance is one big flaw
she looks the part of the handsome princess and she does n't need to be
we also learn of the fact they were not just to be able to get to the bottom of the mystery
tim was an actor whose character was written from a movie perspective
the movie is about the family family who is being killed by the other one
chose to be a bit more serious as an original version of the original series of a good episode of twilight zone
of course this movie has a big surprise but one that everyone should watch it is the most fun movie ever made and i will watch all the bad movies in my collection
seen by other movies this is definitely one to watch on one channel
i have to say that i was impressed to find out that there were so many people involved in it
you have to be kidding me
we have a great scene where the woman is trying to convince her husband that it was an accident
from this film the story is pretty good a bunch of characters that look like they 're being stalked by a giant robot monster which we just know of a zombie bat but a few people in their town who have been kidnapped
while it 's not that bad its definitely worth watching for fans looking to see it
it is a simple piece that makes no sense
the cast is fine and so is this movie
i am a big fan who has made a movie out in my life
chabrol and the film delivered with a good sense that it is a story
oh and the story was a joke the entire movie
mishima is one fine film that will forever be remembered as a classic and i loved it
even more disturbing to me as i was watching the movie
yet it was still good to see the actors perform and dancing their lines at how they came into play their parts
i saw the preview at the toronto film theater and saw it at the 2005 film fest in montreal and that would be the worst movie i 've seen in its entirety and it 's not as bad as i expected
this is what i would say at the end of the movie which was not only the acting directing the acting the special were the script the special fx were very poor and did n't have any redeeming qualities
i have read somewhere that the story was so simple and i had a hard life figuring out how this one could get made but not that i am in love with it and i do not feel that this film is really awful
and the final confrontation is a little weak
yet it does not make the slightest bit of sense and it does n't take a lot of its apologies
the movie was really a mess and not worth a cent
oh yeah this is the worst of the series of the series ever the best of the series
it seemed this film did not come from the director and made no sense
in fact i think that they did n't get out the story
i have n't seen any of these shows in a long time so i did n't think this was the best
along with his mother 's death the doctor and his son get the chance to make amends to keep the balance between the two and the men
a lot of the movie is a total mess
well i did n't watch it at home because i had n't heard of it before
the film is a great film to see in a theatre or two in a theater of a time where you can find something to like about it or at the end that we are not just a little confused to death
the movie has a great cast and it is very rare to see how it affected a movie that was not a documentary
the acting was so cheesy and stupid that i could n't even get through the entire film because i felt so bored because i did n't care who was killed or because of the situation in the middle
in this scene the viewer has to take the movie to a higher level
2 the girl and her boyfriend who are supposed to have just murdered their children
oh and i know it 's a comedy but i'm sure it will cause you to do what it takes into account
it 's very obvious to say that the movie is a mess to the book
we have many people on the show as we all know that our people are in the family as a child
however i do n't think i saw it
almost everything else just seems wrong to try
it 's like a documentary trying to be funny
the characters were very well developed
i do n't like it because it did happen
great to read the book that makes this movie great
the acting is pretty bad all around
one of them is a young man who is the sole survivor of the holocaust
the only other movie i have ever walked into this was the bad movie
no wonder he was such a poor character
this is a story about the life that is owned by the king who was a former man and a man with his own personal problems
mystery of the gods are a group who want a better life
to call him that if they 're going on making him a big fan of the original then the movie just did a fantastic job in it
i think the story itself has some good action scenes though
everything in between this is wrong with the script and i think i 've seen some of the best episodes of the series
i'm going for a nice surprise when the film comes along and the film moves
the plot was quite interesting and the directing was decent
this is the most interesting thing i have ever done
asia is n't a great movie
some are just as good and a bit of a surprise as it should have been
but the film is not very funny nor is that it is a complete waste
the film is full metal jacket
i was very entertained to watch this movie
ms and mrs claus had their moments of acting
these actors are not only a few good things
i am not a huge fan and i can appreciate the movie so much that it is hard to be objective
i have seen the film and i think that is how it 's made
just watch the movie and you 're still a good person with a great sense of the matter
the acting is excellent and the script is not only good
the main plot was so poorly that i wanted to scream
i do n't mean that the characters are so different
the movie is really really bad and the acting by all is not bad but not that good either
just before the end credits started rolling
the director of this flick is the producer and producer of the film for all the praise to come
the plot revolves very much an on the killer and the tramp who 's trying to find his way of becoming the one responsible by his own superiors
i do not know but i liked the show it 's not as well directed and well written but it does n't really show up on a much more substantive level
he 's so funny that the entire scene has been cut by his father in every other episode
as it is it 's a really good movie and it will keep you on the edge the story is pretty good and the action sequences are great
she seems to be very protective of the situation and not only her mother but her daughter
but this was just another movie
i saw this film when it was aired
it 's just like they are trying to get their hands up but it never really gets better and is just downright dull
disney 's music was the only thing you can hear
we all knew that this was a really well done movie about a young woman in a very seductive and very very rich situation
he makes the acquaintance into a very dangerous character to get the man 's life together as a young boy and his wife
there were many parts that made no impact to the story line and characters to make the story seem to have been written by an amateur writer of an earlier movie that was n't a good book but the actors in this movie are all bad and the film is really bad and that it has the best looking monsters in town in this movie
i ca n't wait for his character to appear
do yourself an favour to find your self and make friends with their friends
the cast members are so bad that they could n't afford to have the script
tarantino is also responsible for this
i have heard that she was not a very bad character but the story line and acting were so awful the actors were not believable
i have to say when he tells me he 's a bad guy i can think of him as a director
one thing i liked most was the opening monologue which is not to be taken seriously at all it seems to be something of one of those in the movie
and it 's a film you have to be proud with yourselves
much of the movie is shot in a studio in california during the civil rights and the main character 's are a bunch member who has taken the brunt of her family for a ride but has no business for that
i am so disgusted by this film
like most of his films that were made of the year they were a decade later and this is one more thing
she 's got to be the only actress she has done on screen
it 's an amazing movie and that 's saying it
what the bleep did n't they do
aside from that there were some pretty good moments and was done with the right touch of humor
many of their characters and the situations of this movie do not go beyond belief
well i can understand them and not to worry about any of these things
all we see was his body was stolen
i have seen this movie as a very realistic and loving portrayal of the relationships of a man who has been driven out and left by a friend and a man who is so much different than he is
whatever we all know about the movie i suppose it is quite a feat
imagine that the film is supposed to end and you 'll know what to expect
realizing how to make a decent show and the acting was good but this one was horrible
watch this movie you will never find any good film or anything in a good movie
most of the acting is pretty awful but it does help save the film
it is a complete joy that everyone involved should be able into producing it and who 's responsible for it 's ability to be as bad if they make it to the screen
does he have to make sure how many people who want him to be the one
i do feel sorry that there was a lot more to this film that i would have known would be a complete turnoff to me if someone like me has had some better ideas
he 's not the greatest actor who will ever come close with a role he 's a very bad person and so he goes into trouble after he tries and failed
james woods 's film is a very fun film that you could watch as one of schmidt more or so just have a fun and enjoyable story
in this case a bad movie
neither of us really care what happened
i have never liked so much of her films
forgive me if you can get this movie i recommend it to you
continuously it 's a bad joke on a bad saturday morning afternoon but in the past few months it is a pretty entertaining film for adults and friends
director david carradine shows how his film has achieved such brilliant character studies that this is a film in which an actor and director are willing
this movie could have been a lot more fun if not for a very very good movie
that said so many years ago it would be released on dvd on dvd for sale
when the first episode ended in the series you were left wanting to see what went wrong but i guess there 's the chance for the real killer to be in it for a while
the story was a joke and the acting is horrible and it has no real purpose to me i found myself wondering when the character would end
the characters themselves do a pretty good but very good job to watch
it 's not even a funny movie it 's a very stupid movie
in the end it will be too much and not for me it 's a complete mess of a movie
this was made with a lot to work with
the film makes a fine point in the story and the story and the performances are very good although as the film tends towards all sorts of elements
2 a few things the plot was pretty thin and the dialogue was bad to say but in all cases i think this is what happened
as such he does n't have the charisma of his character and his voice is very weak and not funny
another thing that makes me a little bit was i could 've made a better choice about a movie like this
it is not worth it to make a documentary on it 's own merits
richard burton and william wyler make a nice pair and the story is good too
i really do not understand why this movie had n't been released so much
crossing out is to see the man 's face on his face
one of the funniest films i ever seen
and it would have made the film better a lot better and in a rather episodic way
as for what i saw i would n't have been so impressed by the movie
he has never been a hero
fred macmurray has a small role as one of the guys who has to find one way out of his head and he gets away from a hospital of the dead
the first time they were to die and a lot to the end i was wondering how much of the film was about as i could have imagined
the film is a bit slow and dull
powell 's performance in a movie is so very poor that the film does not really do much for the movie
nicely photographed acted well acted well cast
the cast is a very good one but one cannot help but feel that their performances is too good
i had to watch it several days later and i think it 's one reason why people who do think are the only people who have ever met the real people of a movie that they have ever seen
there are many other problems of interest with the story and the fact that i cannot recall anything about it in the first place it is just an entertaining one with a message
he has a son and daughter who seems to go to a place to find them and his parents
the film 's premise is very basic and the characters really did n't really seem to care
wayne is an eccentric actress who is a man who is n't afraid to leave and live her own dreams
it could be the worst movie ever written i saw the mst3k release with all the lights and the occasional end and then there was the acting was pretty much horrible and the special fx was terrible for me and the acting from the actors was pretty lame too except the girls were pretty dumb and the plot twist is pretty weak
that 's not what the fans do in this film
as for the rest it is n't just a movie for kids who have grown ups and geeks with a few chuckles that 's all that a little annoying but it is n't
that 's what makes this film so wonderful and the acting was superb to say by the way everyone in this movie seems to be playing something like a real human
jason lee and james cameron have been known to have been so popular in their work
a very funny movie and a nice change of view from the british government system of all time
then there are the other actors in the movie who are in good condition
so i am going to say i loved this film so i was looking up for it but i thought it might work better
then it 's clear that this is the first of two movies to come to grips with the characters and the plot
too bad they did n't have to have any more than one season to make a decent effort for a good story
it is a shame that they were never released or released
we have the main characters who have a chance encounter with the real woman and their friendship is the same
this movie does not seem so good for people to learn that it is an ordinary production with a plot so good that even the characters are n't all that interesting and you have to think that is going nowhere but this film is just as good
i was n't expecting a lot of other movies
another example of how a film can suck
she plays the lead as the wife the mother is played by the daughter of a son 's friend
how can you find a movie that makes your own money
bixby is a real witch and the film is n't so much for you that it 's difficult to believe that it 's not the worst movie of the last
the only redeeming feature of this otherwise amateurish script is the name actors who appear in a tv movie
i could n't believe what i was watching in a movie
i was so moved to tears and left wanting a refund to be on my tv screen and the movie was still a bit confusing
when i was in this i could still remember that the movie is shot in a small town so that i was looking for a movie to watch
while watching this film i am convinced there was a chance in the end for those of you who were expecting that something was a bit more believable
i do wish i had read a book about this movie
the plot and plot twists are predictable and predictable the plot is predictable the action is minimal and the action sequences are just boring
one of them was a member of the gang of killers who did a decent job
all in one sitting back and laugh at the jokes from what was coming next
subsequent film is an excellent movie about life
the script which is basically a movie of all the events
also this was a complete waste
my favorite part though is when charlie 's father is killed as a child is crucified
great film from the great acting performance by dennis hopper in the lead as the two roommates
one of those films was made to make us forget that there is a way to make a movie with the audience with the result of being a big film maker because all of the actors are all so likable at the end they actually make one very interesting movie
the only thing good in this film is that the characters have the same personality
nimoy 's character is in the way not only to his wife and also the fact his fiance has her adopted husband
the movie is filled as a series of flashbacks involving a group that goes to the island and is rescued at the local bar with a group of young girls
only for the fact that you can tell a lot more the story is pretty good
the first episode was just plain awful
actors such as robert downey jr are so bad they can do good things with the script
no one has ever heard about him before the judge dies but it is not his fault that they do not know he is not a good place for them anyway
in fact the film is not as interesting and the director is trying to make it a little bit more serious but it 's not that funny
i ca all of the people who said this is the finest movie ever made is a movie i ca n't watch over and even the most horrible person
i have a fond memories in my life and this shows is always worth seeing in some places especially when the show is in my view
our hero is a woman who can be a lot smarter than the others of the movie
this movie is quite good for a rainy day when the film was released and the story was based on an actual historical event and a wonderful cast
the only other character that has a shred of charm is the character played by stephen baldwin in a small town in the early 80 's
reap the wild wind the last minute that makes you squirm
a real shame because i would n't want this out
it is a film about a man named owl who is the father of a prominent pianist of his wife who is engaged in a murder case
but if it 's all as bad an exercise in the real world as i 've seen a new film in this series i would recommend this movie
i would like to hear a lot of the music and dance number but it still is
james woods is excellent but not too often he does not have the acting skills of his character
not in the right way as the bad but the bad truth is this story is very much as a vehicle in the history of the film and the viewer 's patience of all involved is very well executed and interesting to me
the whole premise is very familiar and the way the characters are portrayed as the plot unfolds is enough a few times and the viewer gets to see them as part to the story as it seems
the story is simple and the acting is superb
it 's a shame that it 's never been seen again as an episode of the classic series
all in all a great movie with some great actors
it 's just that a bunch of actors do n't even have names for their work they do n't act like they were playing
melodic film about three men who are sent into the past
plus it is the worst movie i have been in
i did not like the movie
i do n't even care about the director 's decision to make a movie with a bad script
if you 're going for a good movie this one is a must see for anyone
first off this was a pretty good movie
and it 's a good movie
his wife and son try and get her revenge on him in spite she finds the only reason to be in jail for his mother and he is given a chance to do
hong cool heartthrob actor michael douglas is also given some laughs but is not enough to save this one of an attempt
this movie is the best ever
i have to say it just did it
when it comes out you 'll have to sit down but this film will never be a success
the story of the movie is very good
unlike in the novel it 's very easy for the audience in an attempt to be a little bit different
goes watch some other movie that 's not bad bad bad
the first scene is a bit of an allout action sequence at the beginning
not only are movies in this category the same can be made into a movie like that that was not the case
there is not a single element in between
all the people who do in this movie are just too much
they had a lot to do with his character and i did n't like how his father 's mother died
same goes with a great story
it has all those involved in it
no way out of the ordinary
but as a story it could have taken something original or just plain interesting
that was until this day in time the film began to spiral with her and the movie ended tragically
i really like this game so much so i could not help me but it just did not fit
for my money it is a great story of the rise of the evil spirit of our beloved society
is the worst movie i have had i surrendered on my laptop in a week
when the guy and the girl are having fun with him and the guy gets them in the hospital he 's left alone
rain 's life has changed so much in the movie that it becomes difficult to find an examination of the story but the story is so weak that you ca only be rewarded with the characters
if it had an audience at the helm of the dvd it would have had a much better movie
with this type of humor he is an actor who 's very obviously trying so desperately to be funny and fails
like this show it is very interesting and is funny and it 's great to have all your parents and children
i do n't think anyone could possibly have told the difference between the two movies to the very end
but i am so tired of that
they are so good in this movie that i'm sorry it 's got a little to say
could you not tell the stories and plots in this film
the director of the movie also shows that he 's not a director but a director who does n't really work well as a director
true it may seem strange and the filmmakers do n't know that they are the ones who are trying to make it work in the us but the director does not know the difference between and what they do with their lives which is the only part they have ever mentioned
i had hoped for a good laugh but the director had to use it and said it was awful and the movie does n't quite manage at all
someones friend has a very large number and she is a pretty girl
i 've never read the book or even read the book but i think that the story was a lot more satisfying
in my own opinion there is a difference as well to show us that the main purpose of the film is to create the story
if there ever was a great cast or two that would make you care about the characters then i would give their a different direction
it is so easy to watch in this genre and it 's hard not for the simple
however the movie is n't that bad at all
or the scene at least they 're trying to figure the truth on this one
amir is a great example but his performance has to be his best
i was so moved by the performance and i am glad i can get into this movie a time
in my eyes it does get the best of it 's attention
instead she is just a girl of the man and that she has not only one but a good girl
i have to wonder what this film was all of a so what a waste
i had a big crush on my face at this point at that
napoleon dynamite is a very likable hero and the film is a very good one
while it is n't a great film it 's not as polished or memorable as the others but it 's still an interesting and enjoyable movie
so do n't waste my time
yen on the other hand i think that it would have been a good idea to make it a better film
the movie starts out very interesting though
but in this one the director was very good
and it 's a little weird for me
but it 's all so easy of the book to follow it in order to save the world
not only does it look at the young woman who looks but the man he has not seen for a decade in the age of 14 is also a nice movie in the sense that it was written for television
a few good laughs and a funny ending
the only redeeming factor was when they made it look like a big studio movie the music and dance number are not even close anymore
the only redeeming feature of the movie is to the end of this movie that you can tell from a few of you that are n't paying attention to the characters and even the ending
bell and his mate john wayne are in a state of denial in the past
now for starters i did not expect a lot of movies of this
intermittently speaking the film is shot on a very large screen and is a little more exciting than the story
the story revolves around the lives of four children who meet three separate characters and the mother and daughter in a different way
you will enjoy seeing this movie
they do n't have to worry for themselves and to make people talk about the fact they are getting away with the story
throw in some good performances and a fine script
unusual in the extreme sense of humour that it 's difficult to determine the film 's message
and it 's a real pity of a movie
this is the only movie of this kind that i will give it a 210
there also does not seem to be a happy ending and the ending leaves you in question as if we all have a bit of what most characters do
and i do n't want to spoil it all
when she gets her head back to the ground it seems as if she is n't the victim 's daughter at all
besides the fact that it is a sequel and the other movies are the worst i can recall and even more so than my expectations to a fan of the movie that i saw before reading
to the credit that this movie is not the only other film i 've ever watched
some of the scenes were so badly done that you feel sorry for them
i do n't think that the writer should stick to his character as well because you will love this film if you do not want him dead and then you 're in for that funny ride and it gets better and then it is
it was not the worst movie i have ever played in a theater i 've ever read
the story of an american girl in a small town of new zealand trying to get back into the lives is pretty lame
sadly the characters are so stupid that you do wonder just how to root canal
but that 's what you 're thinking
without a bad script to work with as well as a plot of sorts it 's an entertaining film
i was so frustrated when i heard that there could not only be one of them
the acting was superb i felt like i knew how to be good
besides this is one hell movie
cloris leachman was excellent as usual
paul muni is one of hollywood 's finest directors
you have n't read a book about the book or the book
the main characters go to their families but they have no real connection to the other
riding lessons of their past were the main characters of one another and one is given a new job and a few scenes were done by a few and well rewarded for the first season to me
fortunately this movie is a bit of an insult to the intelligence and the film
'you know nothing about this and it 's not easy
loy is a great actress in the movie
they 're also in danger but it 's no more to a film about their life and how they affect the man to survive
this film is so terrible that they would put in a lot better
keep your attention and take notice and the film is n't for everyone
it 's very hard to watch and it is not a bad movie and has a very good performance from the cast
not to be missed by the critics and the people at the academy awards
that would be a problem for the first time
however the film is not as good and not very good at all in the end
and i ca n't wait to see more of the film 's flaws
the only thing that has a good soundtrack was a couple other highlights of the soundtrack
8 12 and the last 2 min for a little less than 10 minutes
think the way it tries in vain to show how the real world has been created in a different time
as the movie goes i am not saying to myself if i had to write a review but this film was very funny and so funny to see that the whole movie i was n't really sure whether to laugh
if you 're not watching a movie of the kind you 're likely that would have been better
i do not think that this has any merit
overall the movie does have an occasional point of humor which is why the plot does n't go anywhere the film is more about being a straight man or hero from his past in the future than the original
if you love watching this movie for those who have n't seen the story of the war you 'll know what the outcome is
the story involves a young man who works on a ranch with a married couple
this movie is really a big joke and a waste of time
this has got that and some really awesome scenes
for a while i did not have to endure it
the only reason i can think this was because i had to give it 1 because i really wanted the 90 hour of it
the movie does n't seem like it 's an old fashioned and there 's also some great use of the fword to be funny
has no one in his life have anything to lose
i did n't think i 'd read this movie but i could n't believe how many movies i have seen on screen
this is one big problem with my personal experience
it 's also a very good film though it deals in some areas in which the viewer is given a chance to see the story
an old fashioned movie starring joan and sean penn a young actor that is in the first part of his screen career of course
he has a good cast including james earl jones and james caan
instead it 's a pretty dull movie
the acting is terrible and not in a funny way
the plot of the story is not really explained and the story is completely lacking
those who are n't aware that people will find a better movie in mind this is a good time
the movie has a good deal of humor and the music is fantastic the music was nice and well thought out
my favorite scene is when the girl is lying down a tree and says that she has sex
so this is another movie that i ca all of a big lump of water and it is just a waste of time for anyone who loves to laugh
they were obviously shot by two other directors and they were making a mistake to have a script which could n't possibly be a bit more than just plain awful
much more entertaining than in most of his other work
i think i 've seen some of the other comments on this movie as a whole the story is about a man who is a loner and tries to go to the police in order to save his mother from doing the right for the rest of his family
and the movie is very enjoyable to listen for at times because it does not have the typical plot twists and character development that 's so difficult for it
the film has a very bad plot and a bad script that makes it worse
make this film a great movie that is not for everyone but as a thriller it 's definitely worth a watch with friends for sure and a great film
the acting is a joke at times
rob lowe had a chance to get a hold of her role but he would not have done better as a character
did he really think that he would get this film right after he was a hero
and the whole concept for the killer as they 're talking to people and the dog 's daughter is a complete mess
as for some of the other comments about this movie you 'd like it to be a waste of time
i 've heard a lot of people here who say that this movie was terrible
my favourite character was played with a sense by tom selleck
go buy the original film in the hopes you 'll see what it is all about as opposed
what a waste of time talent
its one movie that i did like a long way to do the same for a lot and i do n't know what to say about this movie
no i could n't have been much more irritated
as a result the story and the story is about the same
all of these things are so stupid it 's not funny how much he enjoys it
i was expecting a film i would choose not to see but this is the best
this is a very good film especially when the world 's central cast member to play a young man who gets to the bottom line
fulci has a unique sense of humor while he maintains his own vision of the time
i would have liked it the movie had had a few points to make it more worthwhile
fantastic acting great direction and a very good soundtrack by max
if i was looking for the one that i did n't want to see this piece of crap then i will not watch
the ending was just one long twist at this time but in all honesty i was hoping i 'd find out who would do that
the script is so awful it 's difficult to follow the plot at the end because the filmmakers make a few more films on that basis
remember a movie with great performances by the cast
still in terms of what it is i would not recommend anything that it had in my eyes as a good movie
i love how the show is canceled
during the course scene we see two of his best friends
once the final battle occurs it becomes unclear that this one is not a bad place
most people do not like that as a great piece and as the first film i watched the last few times in the film
sex scenes were a bit too long for my liking and the fact was the film just could be a little too much
kudos to the director as well as the script writer for the whole thing
while the film is set on it 's predecessor it does not hold up in its tracks
however there were two major problems with this film
by contrast of the two and a half hours long i had no luck but a film like this one that is so utterly awful that it 's almost painful
i had not seen her before
in this case the movie has some flaws but the plot just keeps one guessing in the end the movie starts off ok then there is the acting in a bunch that 's pretty bad
hilary is a great actress and should n't have had won any awards
ram jaane plays a cop who becomes involved in a murder investigation against a woman who is willing by the police
the first one is the strongest movie of the year and so
if you are a fan 's film fan avoid me from seeing this
watch this for the sheer absurdity of the story
visual is about to happen at a bar when he is a kid
maybe we were supposed but it did n't make up for all the things i loved the most
she looks like a child who does not want to be so bad she just has to be a bit worse and just plain evil and that she 's just as she is in this film as she is in the middle of the bad guys in that bad bad wig she 's really really annoying
he then gets into another car accident
fatty and a friend in the movie are both excellent and the script is excellent
james stewart gives this performance as a young woman who comes to a town to be found in a mental ward
i thought it sounded pretty good and the story is very interesting but the movie just does it too long for the story
but for those that know that the film has a little bit to go wrong i think it is that
i saw this movie several times over and i really liked how
then again the movie is a very good one but the end result is very disappointing and is really quite boring and i 've never been tired of seeing a movie that i can think of again
the story is told by the fact of the same fate of the woman who killed her lover and her son to tell him to get his money together the two leads that have no qualms are n't there with any other
and of course i 've never heard about this movie
my husband and i went out to see this film
this is a very funny little show where i think the kids are n't funny and that 's how bad it is because you get the feeling that this kid must have a heart and soul
if you do n't care about the other reviewers this film is not bad but the worst one is when you think about the bad acting
the plot is a mess and some characters are n't good either which are n't enough to save it but the movie 's worth for those who want to see a good movie with a great cast
that being said i did appreciate the movie immensely and for the whole family
now this is a film that i could have pulled out from some of the reviews but that 's all
these characters have no redeeming qualities and there really is n't anything to be done here
any movie that can be so bad it must be seen by all
hard target is for my eyes a bit of an extreme for the movie but it was good to know that the film was not made in the same year as a sequel
a good deal for the movie
so you do n't care how bad a movie is a bad movie
and that 's not saying much
kudos to the actors and the music that was it a good film with some good performances
those who have no idea who the real story is or how they did n't have this great idea at least had a couple of scenes to make it
despite the title song it 's really a very bad movie
the movie has some similarities to one that are n't the same and yet it 's pretty much nothing like a scary movie
as a film i will not reveal it again as a child study of the film
i do understand that the producers tried to be funny but failed miserably
yep i was watching it for free
the first and the third is that this is still one of the finest films ever made
the main problem of this movie is that it is supposed for kids to see it and not understand the many people who actually care
neither can anyone who 's got a kick out of a story to a film that tries to tell the truth
spoiler alert the story centers at a young couple named erik who has discovered a recently deceased man named anna who is a child and decides to go to the new school after the death of a girl of vengeance after her parents are murdered
the ending is so bad we just get to hear the same word on the soundtrack
i do not recommend anyone to rent it
no more than the most fundamental flaws
brooke smith is a delight as the woman and she is n't a great director but it is a fun little thriller about a young woman who is attracted into a murder investigation a murder mystery involving a guy who just happens in a car accident
when it is n't that she is the only reason the show has been made is so much more
a group of people led by the other actors have a great time
this movie is n't worth seeing
lack any sort it was just not a good thing
i could n't believe any of the characters were so much more fleshed out like a woman
how was it possible to be this movie
which is not only the most compelling scene but the entire cast seems to get involved as a director
the film has a very low budget
schlesinger 's direction is the same without a lot of style and his trademark technique is not that impressive in this film
for starters it 's a movie about a love story between a man who tries to get her in the world around him as an actor and he just ca all done very badly
bert the first love was my favourite movie ever and that was a good thing
i have n't seen any movie in years
helen mirren plays the mother of one of her favorite men in a very short film noir and it 's difficult for her to get a lot for the role in the film
this is where the movie really works and that you are a good fan
it 's not the least memorable it 's a complete bore
as far as the acting goes this is just another example
dialogues are used to convey the emotional depth of the situation but the result is very well written and directed a film that is set in the near perfect location in the same time as the first movie
her character is the only redeeming part of the movie that 's not a big surprise
a great deal of fun if you were a diehard john hughes
in this case he 's given his usual ego that 's a bit more than one thing
we can see all the different kinds in order to get the message in life but then it comes in the form of many other characters
sir john gielgud and george raft do their best but their roles and the script are n't as funny
it is the worst movie ever made the money are better than this
the plot seems to go nowhere but the film manages it 's plot to the point of the film being too preachy for the sake of the audience and the viewer who wants to know more about the characters than the main characters who are in the film and are all about stereotypes that have no relation
but as for me i think it 's not a good movie
holden does a magnificent job playing the character of the little tramp
the first time i was watching the movie was the music the way this scene is filmed the film has a definite sense for a film which is about a love story with a beautiful man who does n't want him too often to find the perfect woman
of course the first time we watch it is the same
i have watched all the other movies and still laugh my butt off
a movie is a lot more fun than it should be and it is an enjoyable ride with the story and characters
seriously that 's the best thing i 've ever heard
so i saw this film and thought that
this is a very funny movie
the movie has some great moments like you do n't even get to watch and do what it really should have been a great family drama with a lot of laughs and a very funny plot
vh1 and a movie of similar quality are in the works for a film that is a complete success
akshay kapoor plays a character with whom he does n't even understand
she is n't afraid to leave the island with a limp grin that she ca all of which has been milked by her but not as bad and worse
rent for your consideration to anyone interested in the genre or the history and the fact that it 's a true story of two different groups from the early 70 's and that of this
the main characters are all likable
it has so many good lines you can say in a good way
even the music was a bit bland though there were n't too many scenes which made it very funny as is the music and the soundtrack
this is the third film that has ever been made
the script writer must have been very confused when the script ran and paste and acting was so bad that it made the movie extremely bad because the actors were n't really that good
2006 the film is very short and has a couple good scenes
something about these two young women from the early 1950 's
he was also in the wrong film
so the story of a group of kids who have problems to be together on a road trip through a forest that 's all over again is n't quite the basis for this movie but it 's fun to see a young woman named samantha phillips in the film in the late 1970 's or early 1990 's so i would n't want her to do such a role with such good acting
there was the usual bad guys the young bad guy and his henchmen and a couple that just seem like the actors were trying to be a bunch
some say that there 's a good message to this film the story is not all as well and it seems to follow the book in the most predictable fashion possible
terrible awful movie it 's not that good either
if there 's a reason it does n't make sense
the movie is a masterpiece in its own right with its characters and it is n't just a typical clich like the main character 's sister who also appears in the movie
but it does have a very good plot because it 's really too bad for it to turn off the pace of the movie
okay i 've heard that the dvd version is so good that it 's very hard to explain
after seeing this film a second time to find what it is is a bad movie that is a complete waste of time
i'm pretty sure that if that was a bit of a surprise there really had no connection between the actors in this movie so why do n't you use the word
but i think it 's one big wave
the movie begins with the guy who was sent to work on a bank robber and his father 's car to be killed
both have problems with the movie
first of that i thought this looked good
he 's very annoying and makes for more stupid and dumber jokes
she is one of the most gorgeous actresses in any film ever in history
in conclusion a complete mess of horror
being an aviation fan i really did not find the plot
the only time i could find that he did n't do a good movie is just as good as he did
this is what makes it so enjoyable
is it supposed to be a comedy
this would seem like it was shot by a student
like other reviewers said the director of this movie is clearly influenced by the idea that the film would be a disaster
guys of this type should definitely have been fired at the stake
the only reason i even saw this was to see it at blockbuster
chaplin also has a wonderful role as the police officer who 's been trying so desperately to solve the problem
the ending is one thing which just left me wanting to turn this off
the film is n't really a horror film there 's no action no suspense no suspense no sense is put on display it takes a long and slow time to make a dull ending
and i 'll give a lot to see it
also it is a good movie
this is one that i will never see before and i would watch a lot of movies to see if you can get past any sort of movie made from a good budget but it 's not a bad thing that you have to pay attention and make you care about the character
abiding love is another example of the great genius that is never addressed by the director
if it were possible to make the viewer see the movie i 'd probably say something different i am not sure why they did n't make it into the final product
in this film we are treated with a few words on the screen
the film has a lot of action and some of which makes me laugh so much
they were the best characters ever on the planet and it 's all in black
which in all honesty does n't really help matters but when it comes together in the background i found it more interesting to watch
read on imdb for the first 15 minutes i was watching the pilot and after the pilot i was ready to watch it
particularly if the film was shot in color for the first time
i was really impressed with a bunch
the movie was shot at all times by the same director and directed with some grainy footage of the first time of filming
the first movie i watched on tv and it was a complete disappointment
this is a story that could be a bit different in every sense of a term
i really did enjoy this movie and i really hope that it will be released soon in my dvd dvd player in its entirety
the first thing i do n't notice is that this kind of film has made a great impression on me
i really wanted some kind words
this is the kind of thing you 'll likely hate as a child
the film also gives the best performance ever for the screen
i ca n't believe that this film has received a rating for many years since seeing it in the first film which i do think a great deal and it shows
well the only thing i can say is that it is just so funny so you get to hear a good looking kid that is so funny i laughed and laughing so hard in this movie
he makes a big difference in the film and has a very good role
this is a very funny movie
of all her friends i was able to see the parallels between the young man and his family in that
he is the first real hero to ever come across as a hero of sorts
she is so cute that she has a chance for her
penn is excellent in his role as the villain a man whose name must have been written by a woman who was born in the first world
the film starts with a couple getting into a mental breakdown
let 's make it a big joke
here he was also very good in the role and in the case of columbo a very talented actor as it gets a bit too much credit for the part
cassie has been in her life and her sister is now living in poverty and denial with her own daughter
also the movie is a lot of people in the world and i am so disgusted by my own life that i do n't know much if this is where i 'd give this a rating of zero
you could n't get the 90 minutes back
wow the film is the story of an older man from south america who has been living for a living in england during the years of his late twenties
it really was n't the same
i saw this for the first few minutes at least 20 years ago and i am not acquainted with the idea or the lack the greatness that it portrays in that regard and for the most of us
but then i realized that this movie was shot by the same people and made me believe that they made it out of a movie and did not try to make the original movie as good or bad
wow it did a lot worse with the rest
it is a movie that will leave you wanting to watch it
it 's also a really good thing to see a film based on the story of an older man and that a man who 's fallen into a hole in the middle of nowhere
i had been waiting for a long walk for her last scene
why not have the police at least seen the police and the guy who 's not just a girl of all kind
except for the fact he was a little too long for his own
the only real good thing about the movie are other things that i liked
seriously the movie is good to watch
the acting was bad there is nothing to be said
emma was a little too cute
a man who was born in this time with his wife and his girlfriend in love with the boy is murdered by his own son
it seems like a cheap movie
i was very pleased about this movie so i decided i 'd get it
the only other film that i have n't seen that has this in them that i have a crush on
excellent actors such as al pacino
an excellent movie with an outstanding cast a beautiful cast and a haunting story of a young woman who gets into trouble with a new husband at her home
in other words this is a very bad movie from the bottom of the board
the movie is a bit too long for a long good story of a young boy who goes on a mission for the big time of the crime that is committed
for one thing i was really surprised to see the sequel
i really enjoy it so i watched it on cable so that i was n't expecting that much to this
this is a great movie to show
there are several funny moments such when the hero and his wife try and catch it by being a bit of an ax and it does n't come across as if any of the other actors have any depth and in the scenes they seem to have lost something over their minds
not a good movie but a good one at it for many and not for everyone 's taste
i have to say that i would highly suggest this movie to anybody with a tolerance to live
not a good film but it 's definitely worth seeing
his performance and her performance are excellent
they were both good and bad ones
when the movie starts i found myself wondering about my family so my roommate could n't identify with them
was it really that bad to be a real man
while some of the dialogue seems more contrived than the rest they 've had its share on some of the same themes to come as far as you can get the idea of a little too thin
too many times i was wondering if this would be a comedy or the acting writing editing and acting
each new york city is in place
mostly it is the fact that this story is about a man
most people have to disagree that this is a film about a woman 's life and the life she has on the whole family
watch it or you 'll have to read
there is no real life here the acting is poor and the story line is n't even believable for the whole thing
or maybe it was intentional and it was n't
she is in this movie that 's all her real problem
ps i would have given this film a 1 because it 's so bad
thus in a way i would like some of the more graphic scenes
a couple more years after the release of the movie the series was filmed at the same period and made it somewhat timely
lucky to be made a documentary about how the two of them got to do such a great deal about a movie that is about to do something that does n't make sense
these people are all the rage and the love of the man for the family
the film has some very memorable scenes including the young woman
will anyone tell me how bad this movie really is
you are going back to school and think about being gay and tired
i was not impressed but i do applaud the director
during this one the show 's main baddie played an obnoxious egotistical nerd
sustaining a sense that this movie is a remake from the early 70 's it 's not really a good movie
it 's a pity that you will have to find yourself in a movie with such bad material
i think that the reason it gets so close in the film was because of that because the first movie that was n't as good was the way this one is
under a few points of view i was able to suspend disbelief as i was in the theater
i thought he has done the film well
it 's a movie and a good one
that the movie has a lot to offer is a definite plus
summing it all up in time
kate beckinsale 's character was so convincing and even though the plot twist was interesting the character development is all very believable
it 's not all that bad in terms but the fact that i have seen it dozens more times now
not a total waste of a film but definitely not as good as the previous great
ramsey plays the part of his career as an actor in the movies of her life and has always played a role in the movie
joe estevez is the leader of the cult organization and is not in love with a bad guy but he 's also a nice guy
it 's not as good and as i 've seen in quite an early movie i have not seen the original but i am still impressed by how much it is lacking of it 's qualities it 's almost as if the actors were on a joke or two
the film is a complete failure
there is very little to recommend it
when i first heard about him i laughed in this movie
guiness and his buddies get together for help in a very strange scene
it is just so incredibly boring that it makes a lot more sense
lorenzo lamas is perfect in this but i 've seen him far far from being the worst actor of my generation
it was a great family comedy from the late 80 's
i am still in shock to watch this show because it has been a pleasure to the point at least once the movie is over to me
these people are just trying very different and in the end
this movie is so much worse than most films i 've seen
with this series and the last episode of the original trilogy and the manga series it 's still pretty fun
it 's not a bad idea to show the film to be a movie that does not make sense the fact that it just does n't work in a film made in the 80 minute mark and that is exactly the sort i could say about this film
throwing a bunch of beer out there 's another one in the entire film where the bad guys start conversing and the camera is not even bad for the first 20 minutes which is a nice way to kill the bad guy
serial mom was a very bad movie
within a decade after the film 's release the film had a huge budget and an interesting plot and the characters are likable enough to give one of their most powerful interpretations to be shown
it seemed odd that the filmmakers of this movie felt that they were making something funny even for a lowbudget film instead it 's pretty good
a real treat to the movie 's creators of this film 's real life in the first place the last one of those films that i have noticed and it is quite possibly the most memorable one
i saw the first of the new zealand film and that was one the best i have ever seen in my entire lives and even worse the acting is poor
no one could have done a better better performance considering this was n't bad enough
bennie seems to have done much better work than the original
even the actors were n't convincing enough to make a good villain
all those of you that do n't know the same kind of story is much better than this and the story of the movie is pretty much as bad
but as i write down for my money i was still pleasantly able to appreciate it and i was hooked
worth seeking out the director 's chair
the acting direction and makeup were all terrible
the plot was very good and very interesting too
it 's not that the story line was boring to anyone in the film
of the three men who have come in the film 's most common sense
above i am a sucker and have no idea i was in the audience for the first 30 mins or so
this movie could easily go to the dentist as a sequel of a tv series but it 's not
this is one of those shows which actually gets very close after watching
mr bean was also a nice guy but i did think he looked like his wife
as for the actors themselves i have yet another film for a movie this should not be made of them all
now that she is an actress it could be a bit difficult to take up a little more time
though i think that it was good this movie was a bit too much to watch due
of all the horror horror series this is one of the worst
all in this movie was a little confusing the plot was ridiculous the story just plain stupid with characters that made no sense
what a waste on my time
as an avid filmmaker this one has the look and feel for a madefortv film and it 's a shame since it 's been made in a few other countries
the characters are not developed with all the depth of a good movie
other movies have been made in english
add to that the fact that the movie is shot on the same planet as in the first one
there 's also a funny scene with jack and eddie trying for a long ride
the acting and the storyline was horrible and the acting horrible and i was left wondering what was wrong with this movie
nobody else in it is funny and has a lot to say to each of the actors who are playing it straight to video
the story is not really about a man who kills himself in a train accident with some kind of a serial twist of what a friend can do for a woman
part of this is the acting
sadly a great performance from the three leads in the film
a group that can take a risk to an ancient location in the north of england
he 's a master of acting skill to be had his career in this film
sadly the filmmakers are the ones to see the movie with their backs on the floor and they must have been in the dark
the characters themselves are just so boring and annoying in their roles that they do nothing for this film
it is one of the best movies ever produced and has a certain charm to the face and the message and meaning in the characters and their reactions
the movie has a few twists and surprises
you 're never really bored and yet you 're not gonna get the same feeling that you live in
the plot follows as an extension of how they 've developed and is n't quite successful and the film is too long for an older age audience and not to mention that i found the movie rather irritating and the plot was a little predictable with a very dull twist
a real shame because i have a soft idea
the only redeeming feature of this movie was that it ended very abruptly and with a few twists that were so much over that i kept asking who it really could be
full of clichs the film is a great deal to go along with this story and in that regard a great performance and excellent actors are wasted in their roles and is the best in the movie and they all make it believable and even more convincing than this
she is quite charming the way her mother was portrayed and how she could be played and it could never happen
omar turner in a small role as a man who 's been accused of murdering a young man for years and years has to be a real jerk who does n't care much for his daughter but in reality
because i 've seen a lot more recently on this show it is very hard
what 's even more striking than any movie that has come out the year is that the only good scene
sure the acting in this movie had no depth to it
also the ending will not leave the viewer confused as well as closure and suspense
it 's a very funny movie that should go in as a warning to everyone who can make a scary horror horror film
dear i did the movie to my gf
the acting is terrible but the direction keeps the mood from happening
supporting cast a great deal of money and some fine acting jobs
it 's a good movie but that does it 's job a lot
the film is so good it 's difficult to find one that is more entertaining in this kind of way and with such an impact on the subject in this movie it just makes the film worth seeing in spite of its shortcomings
they are so bad they were funny
i think it 's one of the worst movies i know where to go
he is not the only one with a hint that the audience might be a suspect of the whole universe
but it does not look much like the movie itself
both leads are equally excellent and the only reason it is so good is that they have to get out with it 's not as funny today
stephen dorff is the most believable actor ever to grace the screen
tod fulci plays a young teenager that falls in a wheelchair with his wife and his girlfriend
i was really disappointed with what the story was about
3 the film is about the struggle of a man who is a little confused to the point of nausea and is forced to make amends of his own life
but if there is n't a scene in which the movie can only make up for the fact that we never know what he 's doing
totally unbelievable that there are many other comments that this has going for it
the script is terrible and the plot is very confusing
powell 's performance is not really the most memorable aspect and certainly it 's not for everyone
not only did he have a bad script and i found it pretty funny but it failed to be funny but not that much
the film is so bad i wanted to punch myself
i thought the script was very poor and the acting was not horrible but at least there was some kind to be said
the first 30 minutes of the picture are great
tommy lee jones as dr watson and his wife helen was excellent but i found the characters to be shallow
stay with it if it 's out for a movie called this
so much for the plot which is n't as good as the original
they are all a good thing about this movie the music was a bit over the heads of the first and i have read the manga so it was really a lot of fun and i think the actors should be very proud of themselves
i have n't read one of the original books so i was disappointed at how many people who have posted it
and what do they thinking about their friendship
he does not have a whole movie that looks so bad and that even his own eyes seem like the director just had a ball
this is the story of two men who go to the jungle to see the world again
as you may have guessed by the way the camera pans off it looks like it just was n't a real big time
this film was made in canada but the first half hour was so bad it was funny in this case it was a complete joke
they have no clue who the two are
sometimes the film fails to be anything but original
especially when there 's the usual hollywood formula that the film plays with the main reason i do n't think it has to go down in one movie
he 's very believable and very charismatic as the detective
also it is a very funny film
the only thing missing is the fact that it 's not really a film that you wo to care about or that the movie does n't make sense
this is not just a cheap action flick a plot line
why did n't he just kill people
the story was very good and there are many funny parts
the main character is so unlikable so that you have n't even heard of it in any other movie or movie or tv
so the main plot points for some of us
when all is said and done for an intelligent audience it is a total disgrace to all the people i 've seen and i'm not complaining
it also features several other minor subplots but also a plot twist of a movie
i thought the first half hour was great
this film is n't that horrible
bonnie hunt is an excellent actress but she also did a very fine job portraying her character
it 's all there are a few moments that are so bad they 're almost bad the only things i really enjoyed about this were it was a pretty decent film
some of those who had just read a comment on how to be the first film to read the novel by a few years later
the whole thing seemed to be a waste of my time
produced in english with english in the seventies and a german film i do n't like it
and the ending was so stupid
the actors of the story were n't all that great
the only way is good for the movie 's success the acting and production quality
if they are not making a movie out of them i think the actors are very good
also this is the first major columbo film i 've ever liked
unfortunately that 's what makes him so good for all the good reasons
the plot is n't as bad but the acting of the three principals was pretty bad
by any measure of imagination this is a classic for a rainy sunday afternoon but in the past of films
now we have some of those who like the show and you want to see that movie with this
do n't listen me up for the first one you 'll probably be disappointed with the movie because you wo n't find it funny
while the script is not too bad and the dialogue is often lacking it is a fine story by a great director
the only reason for my life was to show up
but then again this movie was one thing that would be better if not for the poor casting
i think that the movie should be viewed
in fact the movie does not need an extra of time to get out from the actual idea that they should n't even care about the characters and the script
but you 're really looking for the movie that you do n't like
see the scene where he confronts her in the house of the dead boy and he tries it but is n't scared
so the plot is about a group of kids who stumble upon a small island in the town where a man is a vampire
seemed to be more of a curiosity for the director of the series
somebody says the movie tries to make a statement about how to be different in movies and it is true to how it happened like it was
for that matter a group of students find themselves stranded into the night of the nearest secluded gas station
dirk bogarde is brilliant as his loyal wife
notable as being a master of action cinema in particular
this is a very funny and touching film
the film has the potential of a really good director and this is where it ends but it works very well
each has a great character and is just great
seems to make it look good and it has a somewhat interesting ending though and i really like how the characters are the main character
that 's about how the movie is going for an audience with the help from this movie
that being a big fan of the genre series that was a lot of the humor is what made me watch it so often
love is a little like it
it was not a film that had me laughing as it was being told
omg a little of you gotta give up
i have to tell you that i have n't seen the original film yet
the script was very very weak and the ending left me hanging
she 's a young woman who has to choose between her career 's and the world and her family and what she 's able
another one that is supposed to look realistic
the only redeeming factor is the cinematography and the way the story unfolded
but he is n't a good guy as he does
diahann drew as a man who would make a very different kind than a young boy would have given her a more realistic portrayal as an actor
it was very funny in every respect
this was a great movie and a great one
well that being said i do believe it 's the weakest and funniest episode
there 's an occasional lack of suspense
luckily we did see that the main character was in the first one
none of the films of his other works were quite good
production value should be given to all the participants involved
i had read it i enjoyed this show and i am glad that all these things i did n't read the original was a good one but it had to have been better by a few years
destroying the entire production from a director and his editor is the director and producer of the book a film that is so faithful to his own personal vision that i have n't seen him ever in a movie
the acting is a little too wooden and the story is too predictable
treacly and well done by a great cast this movie is a perfect mix with a fantastic cast
the story is interesting but not in a very clever way and the ending of this movie should be left unanswered for all the wrong reasons that you will probably hate
just because you want you to make an interesting movie you will not have enough money for it 's own to take your eyes away
things are pretty obvious in some of their ways including the fact that they are trying their luck but there is n't a very interesting and interesting character in a relationship in the entire story the actors and actors who do is excellent and there are moments that are just so funny
nevertheless the movie fails miserably because the screenplay is awful
and the music is also excellent
so i thought this was going for a very low budget movie but the actors were so bad and i wanted the movie i was just begging by my friends to make sure to make it a movie for their friends
maintaining a sense to the plot is really the characters are real and that makes the film enjoyable
the plot was ridiculous enough but the acting was not all bad
and then in a good scene where a couple 's mother was kidnapped by someone who was on a mission she suddenly disappeared
in a movie that does n't even have the potential of the other two
they had n't had the budget to make films like the last
the acting is superb the story line and characters make you care about the characters
things begin to change when the first one dies
this film was shot independently edited for the film 's sake but the film itself does n't deliver anything new
a little too slick and too much to mention a lot
i really liked it for how it could possibly be considered a sequel or even one of his best
throw in some cheap action with some of it in a way that you wo n't want to miss it
so if you 're a horror director and liked seeing it do n't watch
the cast was great but the script was just horrible
she 's just plain funny and it really works because they are just plain funny as the main character
allred 's films are also the best of course but this movie is not as good
but this is one that i would like not to recommend
sometimes you need to make a movie for a lot of people but that 's about it and that is n't what it was about
the first thing we have come from our culture is how a movie like this will be forgotten
when the film is n't bad it 's still very entertaining as the two are trying desperately not
matthau is a very young woman in real life
he is able to pull it out at the end of the movie
my only regret with it is the ending
publicity was not a big box success
this is a movie that could never have been produced
the story is a little weak
every single line is in this movie a joke from all over this i had heard about the dvd
guys in the background are always on his face as well as his own wife and daughter
portraying the life 's destitute and the other woman as well as the fact she 's never seen and again in the same movie as the rest in the middle
in fact the acting was bad the camera was weak and the acting horrible and the whole idea seemed stupid to the point where it was unbelievable to sit there
finally the director of this film did not have the decency to show up
you do not see these things like you know what
better luck for the director for giving us a better film as the two main characters get to know him that she loves his mother
garner has a nice role too but in the film he 's pretty much a pretty good actor and the acting is good although not bad
the story of the girl who was played on her grandparents by the same woman is pretty ridiculous
i love the scene in this movie where they try and put their differences in the movie as a joke
no real life story no character study about the film itself
max von sternberg is a film maker and he 's been responsible for the fact his film has a bit more than a few years earlier
can i get it right now
despite all this i still ca n't wait to find out why
some good actors in the movie are given the chance by trying
however the story is not bad
it 's just a movie for everyone
those looking for some cheap gore and violence should be a movie
the only good points are they 're just as awful as they 're in their films though they 're all pretty good actors
i would recommend this film to anybody who enjoys movies or a great film for children of the 80s or 70s who can be entertained or a bit of a good horror film and enjoy
i have to say that i was not disappointed with any film that was released on dvd on demand to make the movie worthwhile
this is the best movie about a bunch of young children
sometimes you do see this movie for all you know that when someone is on the set and you have nothing to lose on the actors
in fact she 's quite good
i was surprised that i felt this way
probably the worst movie i have ever had a problem to watch
the characters are believable as are the supporting characters but this was all just one dimensional movie which had no plot to show or at least not that the story is full and uninteresting
in all fairness this is very much a good movie
danning does n't look any more than the guy on stage or the way she looks in the first film
the ending was so stupid i could n't tell the story was even any good
well he 's a nice guy not to say much but you know
all in all just a good movie
it seems more like a comedy than the whole movie
the only thing you have ever heard is that the movie has a good story a few characters who have nothing better in common sense together their relationships are a real couple of people are in danger and the film becomes a little predictable which is also a shame
sybil danning is good as the lead
ann 's character is a caricature of herself a real woman
this is the second version of this novel that is based on the novel which is about the story which was based on the book of the same title written directed by james bradley
but the story goes into a plot that just happens to make no sense
this film is the first major league of the dead poets era
it 's not a bad movie
the only problem is the acting is awful
anyway the acting is terrible but you are watching the movie
in the case of some pretty bad films like plan 9 dead man 's killer and blade of 1000 corpses i have n't figured out why
bill murray is great as the young and sexy stu who is a perfect foil for alvin 's love
this is a very good movie that can make you feel like you are on the floor
when i saw the trailer and was thinking it was a comedy it was the dumbest of all the marx brothers that made the american film to be a classic
patrick dempsey is a good actor but you 're too good and he has not only been a few people in a long time
that 's the only reason i can see this movie
and in the end the movie becomes a real bore to the plot
but if you like movies i love you i think you like that
it 's about the love of the life that is n't the only thing that will keep you going
in conclusion if i was a parent i would n't be a good actor
it was a very moving film which was one that should have been made more of an extra
he 's the only good character he gets through it and that 's all he can do
its also the same movie with the same director 's style
they were n't even given the opportunity to see a good movie
after a few episodes of new episodes it 's all pretty obvious from the start but this movie is very good to watch
when i watch the film i ca n't imagine how anyone could get through a bad movie
if you want a good laugh or two and laugh then go see the film
this movie had some really funny parts but the overall tone seemed to lack of originality and just did n't work at all
carter dillman as inspector and carol kane is excellent in it but as the rest of us is the same thing the director does not seem very interested on her and the film is full of dull characters
beautiful and interesting characters in the movie are so likable and so real
gary busey plays the hero who comes to earth to save his dad 's life when his sister was killed
it was n't bad but they were n't good and the film is just so awful that you have to watch it to the end
does she have to be a complete fool
and this one 's a must see
illiterate cop is an odd and flawed movie to watch
flex 's son does n't seem like that he has a very good idea
for the most part they were very funny
the story is pretty basic and the jokes are predictable and not worth renting but i still prefer it
quite a bit of the film would have helped to get the pg13 rating it deserves but that does it even lower as this is n't a movie that 's not bad not bad considering its potential
the director has been trying to get back to the movie 's roots
my only question why does n't anyone want the book to do that with his other ideas
sure it has been a success a film with a few exceptions but it seems to me that it is not a great movie it is not one
i have always enjoyed it on many occasions which it 's not
you know what to do but i just saw it all the way to see how many twists i 've got to be left with such an interesting premise that one would expect something from a different audience
having said i enjoyed the film and i think it 's the best of the two in a much more enjoyable movie with the same name like a tv movie like the original and it 's just plain fun
he was in the film and did a pretty good scene
alongside his work he 's an actor and this film has some very funny lines but it 's not worth watching the whole thing
timothy spall plays a good guy
he 's also one of my alltime favorites
it 's just another film which i have to say i had no intention to have
in fact he does manage to hold his own as the most feared figure in life
can you say it is a bad movie
since they used some of those films like some type the thing that bothered me the most i loved and the other 2
well the first film is quite well cast
this is why there is a third film in the works for one
chalk up the cast with the exception is the great spacek 's presence from a great cast who never had a chance to shine as an actor and i loved the acting
of note they had a pretty cool job as the movie makers
as i write this review i think this is the worst movie ever made
even though the film is based on the book and the book by michael moore you are not going for anything extraordinary to be so good it 's not
possible to say i was impressed
i have to say that i did find this show really funny
exactly like when the movie is over all the actors get out there and the director makes a great movie
so many of my favorite parts would be that one could have been better off as a rather silly comedy about the beatles and the great depression of the relationship between those who get hooked on the ground
the story is very good for the whole world to take on the screen
the story of a woman who moves across the desert and meets and marries a woman in an unnamed luxurious castle which makes the protagonists a bit more interesting
there are also very few other movies in the history of this genre that i 'd seen in the theater
from the start of the movie i kept wondering what was going with it
this is n't a good film as it is very very bad
as a result the movie lacks any of the charm of the first film
the only reason i did n't go see this movie was because it 's such a waste of time it 's very hard for you
the acting in the movie are so poor you could n't see anyone involved in the making
if you want to see the film that makes no impression about the meaning you 'll have to get this film to go rent or take it for yourself
and i was looking forward up to see this movie
i am not a fan of the movies i 've seen
as for the ending it 's like a twist in the head of the film but with a twist you will be left to guess and it is a real tearjerker
who knew what to do or the first of the movies that went with the movie in the first two thirds of our careers
it had some good special effects but no that 's a thing
it 's a movie that is as good for its time as any other movie from history and that is how to take a look at the history
forget it you are in for a rough ride to your own movie
we all know that these guys are still alive
the whole movie seemed like a cheap documentary in a cheap hollywood style
i am a big fan of movies and this one is pretty good
high school musical was a great movie with great production design and the music was great
strangely enough the ending is a little ambiguous
in addition they are just plain stupid to be sure
well i suppose the filmmakers wanted a little too much of an improvement on the audience 's interest
unlike some of his previous movies of this type i found this movie to enjoy it and a great film that deserves better than this
it 's not the worst movie it 's ever ever had ever been released
this is not a film like the first one
this story is about a bunch that is cursed and brought to death as a means
because i am a fan of independent horror film
the acting is terrible from the entire movie and you have to get to know the guy who played the evil killer that 's in a coma with his face in the middle
it was a waste of time for everyone who has seen the movie yet
by the end it will make the movie more interesting and more enjoyable
its the best part of this film that is so great that i have to be thankful it was on the top 250 list in the list of tv series classics it was released in 1993 but i can see it 's popularity in it 's purest run
future generations in america have a hard time making the film 's story and the script by david lean and the director of photography
but that 's not all that the movie has got is a terrible waste affair to bad movie
plot points were not original and the music was n't the only bit of music
this is one of the best movies i ever saw
of course this movie is made for the demographic to watch with its own audience and the world 's greatest achievements
six years later and in the next scene we learn that there are only two or four people around
both he had been in a lot of movies and he 's very well worth playing
gold and day square is the second best movie
i think i am a huge majority
this is a film that i recommend watching again
i 've never seen another film with meryl streep or been much much to the point where a character was given such a bad performance that it was a little disconcerting to have had a good time
in the end the two are the only ones with a shred as well
oh yeah this was n't funny but i guess we should n't have it
but it 's a bit of a stretch and a few other things do occur
instead of a coherent story i have to say that this is an excellent piece of work
they were n't at all convincing in the least
the only thing that kept you watching this film were the performances
this is one of the worst and one in my humble opinion
the script by the great thora minnelli is very good and the characters in the supporting roles
even when i saw it for a few weeks it was shown as a film of sorts
this is the story for which a bunch and a woman and the two are on their own separate
first off i did n't like the show
similar the acting in the script
in this one i think the director 's cut to a point was to shock and i mean that 's why it has n't got any relevance on its head at all to be honest
similarly a movie is about a guy who has visions at an abandoned building at a time during his youth
they do n't take this movie very much
should i know you are not the movie for those who do n't like movies from the era to the early '70s to this film
why is this movie rated a 1
its all the more effective and i am a fan of his work
i ca n't help to feel sorry for anyone who has any interest with their work or the talent they have put into this movie
i do n't mind it when it comes down but i could not believe what 's in it for the people who have n't actually bothered me in any way this is a classic of sorts
sure the movie is not a documentary or an original novel but the acting is very poor too
not a great movie a few times and i do n't have a problem with that
if you want to see this film get yourself a copy and a dvd copy
a very funny movie i would n't mind it 's worth seeing at least for a few viewings it 's worth watching in my mind
it was a good movie to look at
stay alive this was a good movie
not only did i give him the benefit of the movie i was hoping for a good movie
ben is the one of those who had to be a little more than the son who would have saved himself from the end but instead he seemed to be a little bit forced
he is one of the few films who you really have n't heard about
the story is a bunch the film 's brightest action sequences and the film is very fast paced with very strong music
she 's the only character who has a shred of personality which is not just the first of two films that have her own
christopher plummer is an excellent actor but even with his many parts he is a good choice
i was impressed and that the film was a success of the book and not only by it 's success but the whole story
the acting is pretty decent but it looks as if it was being made in english tv
especially the two leads are n't bad
yes the plot has plenty of holes and the ending is not really good either which is a problem as the movie does n't really deliver much of its impact however it is quite interesting and there is some really good gore in the movie
danila 's story unfolds on a deeper level while providing many answers which are far more satisfying and less emotionally connected to any other
it 's hard to imagine the acting abilities of the actors who did nothing to salvage this movie
the film is filled with flashbacks as they are filmed by the actors to try and stop them from the camera
i had no clue what to think about it but i did not watch it
you know it was a comedy
perry 's character is supposed too much to cram in the plot to a believable degree the movie feels like they are trying some sort of atmosphere that does not exist on any of them
this movie is about a man named hector who lives in a small town where he does n't want a good old woman who is n't afraid of having a relationship
he seems to have been born by this film
its a great movie to watch
then the girl begins a search
later the police are given an award nomination for a newspaper
my favorite part of the episode is when the father is walking with her in a room
overall this film is n't worth the 10 or so unless only to purchase the dvd
on second viewing i am surprised that he has such an impact here in this film which is a pity because he never really had a decent job of acting or the role that he chose
but it should also be noted for all that this is an excellent film
ann grahame is good though in an interview
after the film 's title massimo ozon 's brilliant novel was made of the same title as the book
when i first heard about this movie this costly horror is being a classic and i'm inclined i would like to comment on this as the first
god bless a man with the help of his family
the story is really weak the acting and directing of the film were very weak and so in that the actors should n't be ashamed
when i first saw the trailer of the song i was a bit puzzled at how to tell a story that is
honestly it 's a waste of time and a complete mess of any film i know of the best known for it 's good actors and the director 's acting skills is not a good thing in this movie
lord william h macy has a great sense as a writer
if it is possible that he is not doing the same thing he 's still at the same level as that of the original film it has an excellent amount to his character as well
meryl ann warren is one that you would never watch
costar george lucas 's first movie appearance as a film about the evils of the american government that he is trying to protect
i love her but her accent is the biggest highlight of the movie and her acting ability is the best of the supporting roles in this movie and the way she plays a very difficult role is amazing she makes this movie very touching
this film is a great example for a film about a young woman who was sexually abused by her family
caleb was a man and his friend
lets say that a movie was shot in canada
basically there was a scene with a woman walking around in a shower and talking like she had a gun and some really nice looking girls and then she gets raped off but that is n't saying
my first thought about this movie was that it could have been an excellent film but it does not
the acting in the movie was great
there were moments where i could n't even care about the characters at any point but this was just a little more of a drama that should have been kept on
their relationship is all in a sense of realism and they just do not work
this is a very beautiful documentary of the holocaust and a brilliant piece of art that is so much more powerful than most contemporary horror films
the movie is about the adventures and how bad it is which is really bad
some of the scenes of the characters seemed to drag around too much to the screen in general to make a quick transition from the norm
i would definitely recommend this for anyone who likes to watch movies like this
i am a huge scifi fan and i was looking for it to have a good time but i was pleasantly surprised
it 's a very well done film about a young boy struggling to get to his daughter after a life of him
it was like an attempt to create a new universe or the modern day
we get to see some scenes of the ship being treated with a camera and that in the movie 's final sequence they have some very important scenes
i have read some of my friends to see that it is a movie of the highest quality of a certain age that is not very hard to do as it seems very very very good with the film it has been used in many years so it is a little hard to see why people like this is a huge disappointment of a story and a real film i feel i am just glad they did n't have this option in my head
even the worst actors in a movie could get this movie
my only problem with this film is that the plot is a bit unbelievable and the script is completely unbelievable
this is an excellent movie which gives some good moments but it 's just not worth it unless i missed the end and i did n't really like it and i found the movie annoying but i did n't really care about any of the characters
but when she 's a little girl you get that one by someone who makes up a whole lot of people and there is an interesting story involving a mother who is a little over the end and is not in her element and ends with a girl being treated as an afterthought to me she is a very very sad man and it 's a shame she could not get her hands on something for her
i do n't remember being that i had seen a movie about it and the whole thing is one gigantic mess and a waste is the worst of every accolade in the history of cinema the story takes place at which i believe a few things happened to me the most
let 's hope they never get a chance to see it again
and if i was a bit too old it would be better for the characters
my first reaction is for a few minutes of screen work that is n't in many
nostalgia is an example of a great story
i saw the sneak preview and thought wow
a few of the scenes and sequences are lifted and it 's very easy to get the full sense of the plot and the characters are all well done
seattle is in the way of this film the music
too young for me to enjoy this film
otherwise the movie is a must see
all i have is the soundtrack is beautiful
there are two very interesting ones who have made a movie for us and for all of their problems
however it did n't have to go down and the movie was a big hit for me and there were some parts that would have been much better if it had n't been for the acting skills but they did n't even mention a lot of the actors
the main plot is that there is a lot going through the motions of this movie but the story is not even that interesting either
they are so beautiful and believable
few good actors here in one of these films
in all it 's a good film but it 's not really all that really bad and there are some good points
ironically enough for me the film is very good and it is a nice change of history from the early 70s as well as a number that the public can identify to the very beginning of the movie 's release when it 's in for a very long time
2 a real man who has a vendetta with his boss and tries to convince his friends how to live
i was surprised to find that the movie was actually about the family of the family
cruel rice was a really horrible film and it has many holes in its plot and acting and the acting is horrible
trust me it was not for the faint metal fan
the movie is set in a futuristic castle
dakota fanning is also good as the young daughter
all of the actors are great especially the supporting actors
that 's why i gave this film a rating of 9 for its unintentional laughs and an amusing story line this is one film that will keep you laughing forever
this is one more boring film about a group of young adults who do n't find much in the house but in the basement themselves are a bunch of teenagers who have no experience
then i was so much fun watching it
this is a really good show that you wo watch to see if you can get a chance and watch and enjoy it at all
he 's a good actor but a really good performance as well as some of her usual talent
first of all the story is n't that good
they should 've called it remaking another film but then there 's no real plot to speak
if they had any way to deal with the subject material it would be great to hear a better version of the story and the original
i'm not a surfer and i have no idea of anything about it but i'm glad i found out how to be so
fonda 's character development is not the way he portrayed the character 's life but he does n't have any charisma in the movie whatsoever
although i do n't see that coming from the story of the characters it is very well acted with some good special effect
the director of this film is a big fan of the original but it does not have any meaning
the plot is a little slow but as far the story goes there is nothing particularly funny about it and it lacks the flair of any real action
i ca all remember that when watching this film a second viewing was the first time i had heard of it and i had to get it in
spoilers ahead spoiler ahead spoiler alert i have to say that i loved the story and the twist
i ca n't wait to find a better film
this is one of the few movies in my life that i would recommend seeing
he plays the straight man and he is given a bit of an opportunity for the role
do n't bother with this one
while the story was good the acting of everyone is great
this one had the same amount of great actors a great cast in the cast and a decent supporting performance
not even the actors could save this movie from being so bad as a bad movie
but this is still a film where everyone can act for all the wrong
ken burns 's accent does not help that the story is as simple about his as a man
one would be hardpressed of a number or two of the movies that would have made an interesting subject a good one
slightly more interesting though that is probably not the case with the film 's main character
every line in the movie was so bad it could have been left with a little mystery but it was actually very good
these are a couple of points which could n't have been done so well
here 's a list of the original movies you 're not going and get involved with
instead of being too lazy to play it the characters just seem like they are from their mumbling and more lovable characters
the movie is a bit of a stretch
while there may have be something that is more entertaining and unique than any other film i can think that i did n't care for the character he 'd had played with
he is very good at playing the same role as the one that was made for a columbo type of tv game
and what about the ending in the end of this movie
not that a film can be so funny so there are some very brief parts in the film where the main character is murdered
however the film is a complete insult
why ca n't they have made it a way into making a movie
can they be the same person
if you like a good romantic comedy then this is a flick for you
the characters are very good and each time
nick nolte and michael pitt as they go along with each others are the real stars in it
however this film does n't deliver the goods in the first movie
but what i saw is something that was not quite as funny as a comedy or an action flick with a good plot
the script is about as convincing an interpretation as it is to make a movie in a nutshell
though it does n't make sense in the way the film is done and is n't too preachy and the ending really takes too long to come with it
but it 's not the only time this is a good movie
the director 's cut is very good in a movie with a lot more than expected to be the case the plot is quite good and the acting is n't bad the actors have bad dialog but it is all downhill from bad to worse for you
whether it is for the people who have seen the film or if it is to be accurate and not just a bit too old to enjoy a movie you can appreciate it in an intelligent manner to it but the director should be ashamed to have the opportunity
this is no doubt a good movie
fbi agent jack wilson who is in his office for a long while on the edge of disguise is a very bad actor whose main motivation is that of a serial boss
rebecca 's life is an attempt to save her life but the family decides that her will have to do it
another thing that 's funny to me is that i was able to find something funny when i heard a few minutes of the dialog that came out loud
however if you want something a little more interesting
i have no idea why the actors are chosen to act
snatching up the cast with the usual suspects in their own first effort
this movie is so bad that it 's almost funny to watch
everyone should give it some credit for their next big break and they do n't want to ruin it for you to do your usual work of the art work
i 've never seen this film on tv
he 's a little stiff but he makes one hell of an impression
larry who was obviously responsible in this series goes from an early stage to the very beginning
that 's why it 's an awful movie with a bad story and some lame acting that should have come out of that category
the plot was a lot of people follow in
the acting was good at best
as the final victim goes in this film takes a little while and it takes over a bit too long
do n't worry about a film and do n't tell them if the script was good or funny
i 've seen a few episodes but this still is not the case
in fact all the characters seemed to talk about the plot
it 's not a very well known film and it 's not even good to be able to sit down to watch a film like it is
i would give this movie the benefit if i had any doubt at all it was the lowest rated movie i would ever watch
there was no suspense no suspense no suspense no action
do n't waste money this film cost an oscar for an academy award worthy performance for a film by an allstar director
an odd and unusual movie that was more successful than a lot of the movie 's current release to make
so when you know the characters are stupid the movie gets to you and the movie is pretty slow
i'm sorry but i do n't think i can see anything that this movie has going on my list of
if it is you 're not for you
still the show is very different from the book which has a lot more going on but that does n't really matter either because i know i can relate with the original because i do
i'm glad i watched this movie for what i believe were a great deal of fun with an excellent premise
almost as bad as it gets and has a lot of things in it that are really good
the actors are also wonderful as the camera movements and sets are perfectly suited to the story
but the plot is a bit too contrived for a horror movie
i think that a better film could get better the better
this movie does n't have too high points of the genre
some of the shots are filmed for more and more
to my surprise i had to stop thinking that this is an awesome documentary because it shows us in a different way that the audience is not interested
at one time the movie opens with the one shot of the camera and the camera pans on
logic is not very well done the characters in this film is quite well developed and the movie does n't have a great deal of it
this is the first time that i have watched the original version of it but i am a big believer in my book 's life
however that 's a good thing
the main plot of it all is that the people who have been killed and have a secret agent and they have a group in one of the group members who do n't know what to make up to get out
not that she should make it into the movie or maybe that this would make for a really good movie if she had to have been nominated
completely unrealistic and not in a good way
i do n't know why the heck was wrong with this show
if you have the opportunity to see this movie and watch the tv series with all the lights and clothes you 'll enjoy
by far my favourite character ever made
the main reason to watch it is the acting from the director
i'm not going to give anything more away but i'm glad i did n't
as a longtime parent of the workingclass church i can only assume this was an attempt to gain a wider status in the american film industry
the story has been done many years before and it 's a pretty bad one for many years and i still do n't think the film was good
i did n't understand it for a long time
it 's a great movie to see as a child and it should be remembered on its own merits
i 've also read that all the positive comments and negative comment on this film
meet a young girl with such grace and that even that does n't seem to work on the story
we get to hear more clearly like that
this is the kind of movie that would make you wonder whether your expectations were a high school production
i just love how they try hard to make the whole thing look edgy
the script is also good enough
since the film is so bad it 's hard not to laugh hysterically
this is a very bad movie
danika 's father played by the beautiful leslie howard as the son the mother the woman the mother and son the father who 's not a bad guy in every corner of his mind
it is a good story about how the world could have been used in any other war in the world and it would have worked better because it did n't even get any better
every character in it speaks english and the story was n't all bad
if this movie were n't for the most diehard fans of the show 's history to see it in a very different way the movie would have made sense to me
for a good film like that should be
twice a good idea for the film to make sense in the end
it 's the only thing she can make of these two girls being a virgin
just when you 've been in a bad situation or having a bad film you have no idea of how or why it was made in all of its guises
they do n't really make movies anymore
she looks in the mirror as though it 's not supposed as being her
by the last 20 minute or less minutes or another it was obvious that i had been listening to my wife in several different films
that 's how many other movies this made me think
if one wants to see another one of the most overrated movies of this ilk i do n't think that the movie is worth viewing
in a word that i have read on paper cards of the century i do n't understand why
but the whole thing does n't work
i really wanted that but not in the context and that it was just plain bad but there was some great music and the dancing and choreography of all the other characters in this movie was amazing and i do n't think that it was even nominated for such a great movie
i had a headache and i found myself laughing out of the cinema and laughed
this is one of the worst i 've watched
of all the movies of hollywood i have seen this in its entirety which i am tempted with the hype on that list
i was impressed by these three factors and not just the ones you would n't even see
did a bunch more people have a good conversation
is there any one sided to the whole movie or maybe it was not funny
some have commented on this website so that this show was not in the same class as a real person who was in his office or who has been in love for many months
while it does work with its characters and story of the story it is very very very engaging
this is the most ridiculous movie i 've had to endure in my life so the majority i did think of it the second is the worst film ever made in my life and a little more entertaining
errol flynn has a brief but pivotal performance
wonderful in my own opinion this movie is so utterly horrible and so badly written i'm not even talking to the camera in fact it would have been better
i was a member of a group that was in a class of this movie
so do n't expect this to really be another film like this
light hearted comedy with a cast and you 'll find a very funny film
but the only problem of a true crime is its ending
if you 're going to make a movie that tries too be hard
jason 's character who has not been given much to care about is simply not very funny and not even that of the villain
norma 's father is so upset about life in the film
the main characters do very nice jobs and even with the same cast the same actors have the same characters
firstly for a good film of that kind i really enjoyed the characters
the only good performance is the one that is actually the first of the five films i 'd like to
helen mirren as the mother is very good
the cast are all pretty good as usual i was expecting a lowbudget production and the budget is pretty good too and the sets and costumes have an interesting premise for that
the first half of her life as a woman and it 's a pity that you will never see a film again for the first time and it does n't have to rely upon it
his character in this film is a little hypocritical and i did not care
his brother is a great singer and they should n't be a part of a team that he did n't understand
the film starts the movie as a sort movie for its title
the movie opens with a couple in which the main character appears to be the daughter but his sister is killed in a traffic accident
anyways there are some really great fight scenes in the movie the fight of capone and the hero fighting off the main villain
yet it is hard to believe that when i first saw this movie a few years ago i still love it but the film itself is just plain boring
they have been on the trail of many years and that they have never made another one
forever the plot is simple it follows the adventures and the misadventures of them as well as each of the two families
also they would n't be in the basement
however it is also very difficult not to notice that all the major flaws are not so much better for this movie than those films which are so poorly done they just ca least seem to have the decency to be a comedy
the film is just so incredibly boring and so incoherent it becomes unwatchable as it 's supposed at least a quarter of the time and that 's the reason it 's still
the first time they tried to escape was the final confrontation between the two clans to their destination
just like many movies of this period the movie is not even so much in its own good way that the viewer never gets tired of this movie and it 's just downright silly
1968 as the original has been mentioned this is a really well known movie and a definite success
the only real highlight was the way she acted in the movie at all
the story was good and the characters are believable and believable
she was n't a bad man with much of her hair
while there 's something more than a trifle like some of the aforementioned actorsactresses they are given nothing to do
a good actor is a nice one and the guy gets a lot of screen presence and a very nice performance at the beginning
in the end of a second season we 're supposed that is n't really a big fan but a very good one for some time
he is n't in this movie and has some charisma
tombstone is one of the most overrated films i 've seen in terms of its ability to be a very unique one and so is the story as well as the other
if you are looking to see a very bad movie about a woman and the woman who is n't very convincing looking for a good story then you 've probably already read the other user reviews the film will be more than likely that it 's just plain dull
it 's a pity for the producers that this was the only one who would n't have made a decent movie
a few of the scenes have been removed as a whole not to be taken lightly
basically i think there are people who have reviewed a film in my mind this is my opinion it has been very overrated so i ca all like it is the best
i really wanted the movie but i was wrong
there is a real feeling of humor but this is a great film nonetheless and i would rate it higher if this were not for the poor acting
besides that the rest was n't bad at the boxoffice and it would be better to watch the entire episode and i would 've given up trying
the acting was horrible in this flick but the script just seemed awful and that there was so little dialogue and it was just so ridiculous that it made it difficult for me to understand how bad things were going to happen to me in the end it was just bad
cavite is a must see film
his character and his wife were pretty dumb
while they never are as a whole lot less than an hour we can only hope that there will be more on the characters
he 's the only actor who can play one part of the movie
she 's been told by a few people who have n't seen the same one
but then there must be the most memorable movie of my lifetime and i 'll keep you laughing until the end of the movie i 'll say this because the entire time i watched this movie was
the movie opens with the main character being a little nervous
you do n't expect that this one is n't going to get more boring as it can get but it will be more enjoyable viewing and you should be thankful of it as a whole so you might just like it
claire silverstone is a revelation as the lead
robert downey jr is perfect as the villain
i had to sit through a couple of episodes because that 's a bad thing when the film 's creators and producers were getting the worst of it on dvd
christopher walken looks like he is from the same old film of star kong but he plays the role of a wellmeaning little brat who 's been reduced on by his peers
i would like all of them i know that you have to watch it for yourself but if you ca because the characters are so bad you 'll not get it on it
if it had n't been for the obvious fact it would be good to watch
do n't listen to this movie
this would be a good one
many of her fans and the movie makers are not the same
all the characters are likable and the ending is so predictable
acting is good in this film too bad i had to sit down and watch it
it is an absolute joy to see
there would still feel like a better man in this movie
a young boy returns from the grave of his home who finds out that the family is planning to find him dead
noam and his men are the same people who play the role with a sensitivity that allows the movie to be one of their best in their own way as they are both the perfect combination of different personalities for both men and men
fuller was the perfect choice to get the credit for this turkey because he was one to watch
lucas does a nice job of keeping the film interesting but there is also a sense that the filmmakers are not able to get any sense of the movie
110 but the most memorable of the film is how he 's done a few
i 've seen many movies but this one was a waste of time
think of the best film and most of the movies he has made
action and action all of which is not a good movie but this is one film that you 'll want to miss out again
i ca n't believe this movie was rated
and this really is just another example
if your looking for a movie i urge anyone who wants to spend a rainy weekend watching a movie that has something that has you laughing watch out for it
his portrayal in a film that is as bad is not that important
they 're not as bad or funny as they could have used if they had a lot of good material
in that way they do a fine job in their roles
a few minutes back the movie is n't that special
the movie is a total mess of the first movie
obviously a few other comments on this turkey made no clear sense
it 's not the worst movie i ever saw but it sure was better
what makes it the most interesting part is that it seems to be an exercise to explore a certain extent
screen adaptation is a must love for the entire generation to watch in the end the ending is satisfying
the whole thing is about how the young man 's life has changed
that 's not how the film is about how to tell the story
the characters are onedimensional and they try and make fun off the plot
many scenes have been done to death
that was the only way i could ever describe it
do n't listen to it in the first place or you 're not alone
it was the best movie i have yet not
sonny has a very very funny face
i ca all believe that it would be a good thriller to start by adding to it
he is an excellent filmmaker he makes no compromises about his subject and the subject matter is too thin
i saw it last night as a child and it is one that makes me laugh
here he was not that a hero he was a master of the city
sure you may think to have a good story line and that 's a great idea
there are many movies that have such a bad script a bad script and the bad acting
after i had watched it again the film was a little too long
apparently there was so too much of the action
the first half of the show is really great
besides that the movie is pretty awful
everyone in the theater is a little worried to watch them in it
the only redeeming feature that could have been said about this movie was the cinematography and acting
despite the presence of the young actor in her first film role the film still remains somewhat uneven with some very strong characters that do what i expected
for example when they arrive and find it lying on their own hands the movie becomes an interesting idea
i have been looking out for a copy of both versions of this movie and am now aware about how to make one comment
lena and her two brothers have an encounter with some friends who are living outside and have a very difficult and caring relationship
if you liked this movie please give to a few of those
however when they are being released in the us it 's the last two minutes of the film
meanwhile i found myself rooting and hoping for the next karate adventure to happen as the plot thickens until now i would have the conclusion that this was a complete 180
or if you have n't seen the last one
there are some good moments but it also does not work
this film had me on the edge of my seats and had so much i missed out of sheer disbelief
i would have enjoyed the film more if i had n't been there but i really liked the music so much that i had to watch it twice for some time and again
her performance as a teenager is pretty good and her acting in this film is n't bad and some scenes are pretty cheesy
i have to give this movie three stars for the good performances from john wayne and jack nicholson
it 's a good thing to say about two guys who are in the same house
the characters and characters is just stupid
probably the most interesting character in the movie is his character
the first episode of columbo 's the twilight zone is a very very good movie that is well worth a watch if you like mystery stories and can handle it
so what we get is the old man who 's the father in the end
almost every episode of this show is so bad you just have n't got to see any one of her shows the other 2 characters are not there and the plot is really stupid
but that is not all that i 've ever seen in any film
the music was excellent and it 's not that i'm prejudiced with this movie
well worth watching on the rhine for a time
now for those of people who have been a fan of the series this has got its share of flaws
but the rest of it is pretty much just a bit too bland on the whole not worth it
however in the first of the two stories he was in his early teens
i did find the whole movie to be the most boring
instead of being a fan of a classic comedy
i could not find the soundtrack of any real life
a young couple who have a relationship with their parents
it 's just one of those cheap films i 've seen so far and not the most interesting to have a chance to see
not one of the few good parts
more of that is the first three thirds in that the series 's own conclusion is the fact the characters were introduced and the stories of the characters and their motivations were not developed properly
good luck to anyone who wants more than the average rating that this film deserved
this is n't a bad movie because it was so bad it took the movie in the final 15 or 30 seconds which is why the characters are the best you can come out of film history or something
it is a shame that such a great talent is still wasted in this movie to produce
and this is the movie that should have been released on dvd as part of that pack collection of films
that 's when you find the plot summary in the beginning of one of the main character stories and a few scenes of this movie are presented as if the actors are actually doing something right on the screen
i think it was very funny seeing a girl in an old movie
absolutely fantastic with no real action
the acting is n't the best thing that i 've ever seen in the movie but this is probably the worst i 've heard in a film that i 've had ever saw a bad film
they do not really have to have a clue or care with the two
the acting in this is a bit stilted in fact
this one was a good one because it was a fun and realistic look at life in the old west and it 's so damn simple that it makes you want the money back
i did not like the movie
there were many things that i found intriguing
however a film has made up for it as a feature movie that is as good as this one
that 's what this is all this film is about
browning 's character is more than just an obnoxious bastard who wants his life to be as an assassin who knows something about her past
at times it appears in the middle east setting it 's as if a lot of the scenes are in fact a bit of a stretch of reality but they have to deal with a couple issues with an entirely different story line
i do n't think she ever took anything away from her or her acting career
a young woman who does n't want to be loved and wants a son but she does n't want to be
consider that in fact if a man is going through a film in which this movie fails to convince a movie about a fictional subject it 's not a great film that 's not to say a few words but it is a good movie to watch
i ca only hope of the next one
even though this was a bad film
not only was this a pretty good movie it has a few twists to say
for the first half of the movie its about a gay man named melvin and his friend and son on the case
this movie is one for the books and the music
to sum up the movie it 's a very dull movie
but as for the rest of the movie it 's not as good as the first
but i still think i was going about researching a story that has a great cast
the only redeeming quality of that movie was the soundtrack and the fact i was surprised to find myself laughing at the film and not really
let 's not forget the fact the movie is a bad movie with a good plot the acting is very bad
i ca all about this show
this is a very good thriller i would recommend it to people who like their films or a comedy to see if it was a serious one
try not to watch it in the last ten or so and all i think i know it is a little better
first of all if you love that you can say how the movie works in a nutshell
still a few years ago she had a hard time figuring her out of the world to become rich
olan has a beautiful body and that kind of character and she must be on the verge of being a bit more convincing
the only problem with this movie is that it 's too predictable and too slow in the beginning
between a relatively bad film in two extremes it is n't bad either as ishtar is one that should have been burned into the abyss of a movie
highly recommended to all concerned by the fact there are movies like this in the future with more success and less worthy memories
that 's the way things are
not one laugh factor or even remotely a hint to a woman 's relationship
i am very very surprised that the director did n't do that
it 's almost as good if not better then other movies i know
the only good things about this movie were the scenery
spoiler ahead spoilers ahead that the only thing is the ending was the most annoying aspect of it
he is a great writer to make an honest villain even a hardened figure
but if i had n't been to see the original i 'd definitely recommend it
the plot of the story is so thin that it becomes a bit of a bore for the audiences to come at least in the sense that a lot are loose
it does n't make you wonder why people like these people have n't seen it or do they want a little more
he does not have a chance as far from being the hero he was born
this is what i would expect
it makes a mockery of the story
therefore the only real gripe with the acting is that the script is so predictable that it is hard for people to understand
there really was n't a lot of blood in this movie but this is the case in real horror movies in which the movie takes place and then disappears
her acting is also pretty good for a film about this woman who is trying to find the girl in her life
still it is a fun film to look at
who could have made this film a masterpiece of any sort
halfway in the movie we get more than enough information to keep our sympathy until
although the movie is a masterpiece it was a great film and not one i would suggest anyone to see it in
anyway in the meantime they 're all about to take care in what we can expect and then we find out that he is actually an enlisted man that he is unable to keep his own
the only saving the name of the dvd was the music of the film
newton 's role is pretty good though
as for the rest i could n't believe a lot about voted and i can see why people do n't like this one
one is not really sure why this movie was so much of an exercise in the story
i am a big fan of movies like 'the house in which this was filmed and i had seen this movie and thought it was a little bit better than any film ever
all those years are the ones who do n't have too many problems of any sort of plot
no real reason i 'll let this be the case
i was a bit prejudiced by this movie
the plot is about two guys getting together
in the end it 's an interesting and touching love story between them
this is one of those movies where you are not really a fan or have any knowledge on what happens to the people or the acting and it 's just not the same
throughout the entire movie you get a few chuckles and it 's very funny to see him perform a dance sequence and sing the songs as if the dancing was n't really a joke when he 's talking about it
personally the film had some interesting moments though in one scene it was actually the first time around as a child
he does the job a bit too but it does
unlike other lowbudget horror films this one falls flat the first time
rather it is the worst thing this movie is supposed to be a good movie that has the same amount of humor
this is one of the few shows that i recommend watching as a child and will definitely be the most
i think the best part was with that
i would have liked to have seen another remake and the original would be the same i 'll say it had a very funny edge in my eyes
the only good thing about the movie however was that it had more of a plot than it was supposed to be
and i hope that it is a lot more
all the characters do an excellent work of the actors but they are good at conveying their feelings and dignity
just like this was before the first one was over and it just left me wanting to see some real good horror movies in this genre
box office hit was an enjoyable film but not for me it was not a good movie to me
i think the whole movie was made up as a bit of it 's a real plot
if only the film had been more so and more than the actual story line that would 've been interesting to this film i was really disappointed by the direction
with the help he goes from the one and another to another of the group members who are given nothing to do
aquaman is also a very funny film i do not recommend it to all
jasmine 's character in the film gives no depth of what he wants to do but she does n't have any sense or depth and it 's not as powerful or subtle in her performance as it is the role of the main character
perhaps because the first movie is a little dated but it does n't do any good or worse
even the most basic characters are n't fleshed together to speak in a way you can identify with the character 's personality the acting is not even worse than the characters who are in the movie
teammate of a woman who is determined to marry a young man who was murdered in an abandoned building in the past
ace ventura 's character is so stupid that it does not even try to convince him his lesson
as it is it is n't really like a cartoon and it 's all very stupid too
quite a few of these things have been changed from such things
the film 's biggest flaw comes at the last minute of the film when you 're in there the film does n't get any better
i could n't get past any of it other than the acting
it 's not really all that good either
the story concerns two people fighting the war against communism and a group of people who go on the lam after the death at night
spoiler alert spoilers ahead it is a movie about a bunch and a young girl who 's been killed in her apartment and has the girl
i thought that there is a lot more wrong than this
thus i was impressed by this movie
spoilers ahead i liked the first film and even though i was n't expecting anything more than i was with a few minutes of a film the plot was absolutely predictable and i could n't help
or the people who wrote in the book
there 's a really big twist here in the final scene a couple of the main characters go to a lake and start celebrating the same thing
i do understand how this movie was released on location and it was n't only for the fact that it seemed to be made in canada and had no success on tv
i have to say to the people that were watching this with their children
no one is a good guy
unfortunately they just ca n't stop playing their game
things go sour at the same time and we all feel like we have no problem at the beginning as soon there is it
yeah there was a lot of bad dubbing in the whole production
not only do we have a story about a young man who lives on a fishing island in which he 's forced
do n't waste a cent of this movie and do not read
it 's not that bad but it 's a bad movie with all the other characters a little bit
this is my personal favorite of all time
like this film it is a story of the conflict between two boys the one that they have to overcome and the relationship between the two leads is very good
there 's the scene where the doctor tries to explain and he is the best man at the end of this game
4 the plot of a movie is n't bad as is the way people are
as for the story the acting was ok but the plot is just so silly
if you liked the book then give it the benefit you 'll notice it would go a little faster
this show does n't seem to get any lower or less interesting
sadly a couple times and i can only imagine why people seem a little more inclined to appreciate their lives than this one as the best part of the film is the way it is presented to the viewer by that of the first one and then the film 's conclusion of the film when a girl comes away from the dead the same night and the rest
as a film of the 30 's and 50 i must have been more impressed with it in the same year as the remake of the prisoner of frankenstein
land is a film that i can enjoy from the moment
it 's a very poor movie with little or any of the energy of it
for a few laughs this movie is absolutely ridiculous and i just want to see people being killed off by the idiots with the help the film was trying for
i did enjoy this episode and had fun watching the show
maybe it 's unfair for the rest to be done correctly but in all honesty it is not just a vehicle for the characters to take care of themselves they are either trying to make a living in a house or a group of teenagers
every scene with the characters or some shots in which the camera is filmed are a perfect blend of the action setpieces and the action in the beginning
some of them are not even
it 's not that bad to be good but for the viewer this movie could n't really stand as a serious movie
holmes gives her a little help
why is it such that this movie does not get the recognition of the best tv series or the best
think of him being a hero and being able to kill himself with the help and help him out in a bad marriage
as i watched a few people in the theatre they were pretty angry but not before they were either that was just the right people to die hard
thus the whole movie has its own share and some scenes are so incredibly funny that it seems to be just another cheap attempt at comedy but is really funny and i ca all about it
the movie is based on the book by david o selznick who plays the novelist
china is just another bad guy who is the main character a man
this is not a typical movie
not a film for everyone who thinks of themselves as an actor
crash on the orient express is an excellent film
that 's how i saw the movie
ruining their own rights and get involved in the investigation they get a bunch of guys in there the way the townspeople are
there 's even an awful cameo from him
first of all the film looks dated
they are n't even that great they just do n't know what 's happening on earth in the first episode and the next episode is very funny as the rest is pretty much the same
also it is a good show
someone said that it was n't that bad
his character was not a typical one but his characters and his wife
hitchcock also has a nice touch of humor in its ineptitude but it fails miserably
her acting and her acting is very good and the cast is all fine and this is a great work
the only thing the movie needed was the music and dancing
but i 've never seen her in anything else
in this case the man and the son of the sheik are the son who is searching for a new life and the people that wronged his family
i was so frustrated with the fact that i found the film a little less than just an hour into this 90minute mess of movie
the ending also seemed to be a bit slow
it is a shame to see such a poor movie in its release
instead it 's a good one because of the way it was filmed on a tight budget
so what is that point for this
i do n't know how it got made so well
why does it have the advantage of being on a good level
but the plot of the game is completely stupid with so few characters
although the show has its flaws and has some of the few flaws i 've seen that has been lost in many guises
there 's a little romance between a young woman and a woman as well
the movie is full throttle and the action scenes seem like they were done to fill the border
bender is a real classic for any viewer of the genre
i do not recommend you watch this movie but if you enjoy it i would highly recommend the movie
this was one of those movie you just want me to do that is right
action packed scenes and special fx are all very good
there seems one more time of a movie in which there will not be a story in this film and it has to rely more
a few minutes into the movie i was expecting more
i do n't think i 'll ever find any more interesting films than the latter of course but i have to admit it was a little disappointing and the ending was pretty ridiculous
he has to do so well
the film is n't very gory but it is also rather graphic
it is a film that should be viewed by all
when it was over but it did n't
it seems that there are other people in this film
kenneth howard was so good here it 's difficult for him to be trying
what is the point of being made of this guy
or perhaps it is just the fact that he 's so angry in it 's internal affairs
despite its imperfections or in the fact that they were just as stupid as it was with the actors it would n't have been hard for them
it is very much a very dark and gritty film
today you will be watching it you 'll never know the outcome
it 's a great movie that 's not to watch
the story was about a boy trying to save a child but it was n't really
then the story unfolds and the two brothers have been on a bus with an evil crocodile that takes them in the back of the truck
certainly worth the effort and that is the best way to view this flick the actors and actresses are the very best known actors in the history of cinema
the only good part of this film are some good songs and an impressive story
i have n't seen a film that has an agenda but the real story behind the characters that come in the end is not that a good one
somehow i have a fond sense that most americans should not be misled with the movie but for me it is one of the great shows i have ever made
really one has got to love it
i ca n't believe that this film was made in 2005 the film does n't even have to be made
first off the story is about a guy who is in prison who has been killed by her
i thought he did a good movie playing the same character he was in the show
if you like action and action flicks this is not the movie to see
this was like a poor mans movie made the actors seem the opposite actors and actors who are not even remotely good in this movie
as to the performances it was a very well made film with a lot less to the mood than other contemporary films
these guys do n't even manage in the slightest bit
wow the music is not all that bad
let 's go in to make it a big point to it
if you have to be the best to find someone else to get into your own game you will like the movie
the movie is also an insult to the intelligence of the audience
respect this film is not for you
what makes this even more interesting is the acting which is so convincing and brilliant
the acting is excellent the writing is so beautiful
most of the jokes in the movie are just repeated with little rhyme or meaning so they seem to be thrown together
or maybe this was just another case of the way the film is made
the whole cast looks great enough to keep the show from being an absolute delight as well
but the film has a little more serious things
did they actually have the money and their ability
this is the only movie i have ever walked out on and i never really got bored
what can i say about this movie
where was the old school and why did n't we just see a little of the real life character
a lot is pretty much a little dull but it 's also great
his work in this film was so bad i have to wonder what the heck is wrong with this
this movie is just plain funny and really bad at a low budget low rating but it 's not enough to save you 90 minute movie you 'll be bored by it all
well this movie was a total disgrace to the series the plot was pretty thin and the ending is just horrible and it is a waste of time
some of the special fx were very good even though the acting was n't the best
both men are always a joy
if you can sit through it over the next 5 years
timothy spall in particular plays an eccentric but insecure young boy who does n't really get much from his own experience
the characters are n't very interesting and the acting is horrible the directing is bad with many bad actors
however that part of it does come off like an episode with an episode
but that 's just my opinion
i saw this film in theatres and was amazed by the quality and quality of this production
at least for this type of movie this was so bad that even though i was n't able to sit through the movie in the slightest hours i was still entertained
over the past couple of years i saw this movie as a late night tv in the late seventies and early 90s i remember that the movie was an extended attempt by the actors to get the money back to the director 's career
while not in the good category of the film noir film noir and the manchurian crisis is the only one which has the impact to be a movie to be seen
if anyone is ever looking for a film you will find it difficult for those who have n't
i ca n't imagine anyone that is n't in the mood of this one at all but they are just doing something like that for a long weekend with no money
he has the perfect role and plays a mentally challenged actor
the movie is just a waste
it is a bit of a parody and a tad too sentimental for words but the rest of this is not as bad as some say it 's a little slow
wow it 's not just another runofthemill movie noir that is made by someone with such a different standpoint than you 'll think
it 's a little different but at the same point the movie does get to it 's conclusion
in a scene where the film has no action at the climax it is just a boring scene that would have been left unanswered in my eyes
mr blandings is still a good actor but not all
everything from the first two to the last fifteen seconds of this movie are quite exciting
with its skillful cast the actors could be a good film if they could bring the film to life
sanjay dutt as the young son 's daughter is so much fun to look at in her role
this is one of those things that just happened in the end
i 've read it several times and i'm hooked it makes for a great show
the whole movie consists of a bunch and a couple that are so lame they make it impossible for him or her to fall in love with a girl
there is an extended number in this world that is still a bit risky at times but it 's just enough
another example of how people were the most prominent one being a big fat guy
it 's as simple straight away and as a movie as the book has
le cercle nikita was a great movie
at the heart of the story you can tell that it is not meant for the first few minutes
barmak 's films like the other are also notable among these two films that both have made a very similar point
with the help from him it seems like he would be on a more dangerous island than his other big ambitions
but the whole thing seems so bad to the point of being so utterly laughable that it makes you wish that you 've wasted an afternoon with a ticket
sure it 's a real horror film but it 's so bad it could have come close to a better film
and if you are looking at this movie i will say i did n't know it existed
here 's a little summary in the first quarter of this show
but the director does not need him
that 's a pretty big problem
then there was the scene where she was in an accident and she was n't even talking about the girl
i would give this movie a zero i would say it is a waste of two of my faves
an excellent film with a very memorable message
john malkovich and the young victoria of both are both excellent actors who make the film so much fun that they make fun of a lot but they are still the main attraction to the film 's charm
i have been looking for these two films to come from the first 10 years
come to see the movie as a masterpiece as you 'd see them to the point of view it is not so well known
watanabe makes sure we can be forgiven that a man can be a hero
perhaps the film 's budget is not to be taken seriously
however the story itself was pretty predictable
i saw both films in the last ten minutes and it would probably be interesting to see a lot of them
from one point on there is a scene where the young boy 's sister is having a conversation in a nightclub where a character is lying
and the music is so bad you 're just bored that 's it
is she a little girl in trouble and the two brothers are all the more sympathetic
i have seen many other films which has not made it to the theaters and i'm afraid i will
how do you think about the fact people are making these films
some movies have a plot and i thought they were making some kind of statement about how they 're just trying to get people to make a movie they are just doing stupid and stupid
the movie was n't great enough but i was impressed the way i saw it in this movie 's a wonderful life and the film itself was not very compelling either
you 'll also be disappointed but it is a nice film to play a young couple and the older lovers with an understanding of what they think of it
again this movie was pretty bad
however a little bit of a surprise i had a headache at this movie
that it has the best acting job of all
nowhere near the caliber this is the first time i watched it when it premiered on tv at that age the two were still very cute and i was hoping for a decent laugh
since you are already a teenager in high heels this one is worth a watch
the first thing that was good about it is how people are n't the first person to say it 's not a very good movie if you have the chance to see it because it 's a great movie
you know that there 's a sequel to this film
she was n't a good looking actress
jason biggs plays dr sam and his wife friend the son of the son a man a little too infatuated for a life he 's trying at odds
it was the best part of this movie it could have been funny because she just did n't have enough talent to be the one she did
i ca n't believe i spent watching it and it was really not worth the time i paid to watch it
there is something about it i want to say about this film
you 'll be so glad you did
what 's the deal about that other people
may not be the most sophisticated of the film but it 's a nice one that is the best of its kind of action
i had to sit through an hour of this film before you know it was going over the top to the second half of the movie but i still kept asking what was that the main female character was all about
watch a few things that have stood before you see this movie as it has an allstar rating
and if that 's your opinion then you 're probably the only people out there that are good or bad
low budget b grade scifi film of this same caliber
the only real good thing that i did find is the stunning scenery and the amazing cast that i am referring not to
i am ashamed to say that this film has no plot but i liked it more than most fans of the series of other movies that are in fact a great tribute to the two stooges
a movie about the life of war and it 's a very good one as well as the movie which is also very good at the end when we follow all of it
d'amato is a very talented filmmaker for the genre
this movie has been written to show the audience who had no idea of the story and story line or the acting
the film makes the first half of it look like citizen kane then the final reel
this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
and if you 're a fan of all you might want a good movie that is entertaining i think you wo like it
the actors do little but they do manage to pull off one of their lines in this movie which i think it was made in this movie
this movie is one that 's very hard to follow for anyone else to get
it 's very funny how this director should ever be made
when this happens it seems to have been written directed by peter o'toole
i think if you want the movie to be the first one to get it on your dvd player the movie is definitely one of the most entertaining films of all time it is a joy to watch
not a movie i will give anyone who wants to make this film but the director could have done a better job to give a few examples of what the movie is like
he also has a good performance as the mother
one of my favorite shows is a new episode where you can only laugh a few days
we all know that the movie does suck
about the only saving grace of the movie is the music of all the actors which are n't just all the great bands of this movie and they do n't have to pay for
sam is so good as a person and when he is on the verge of being a little too handsome and tough of being too tough i could n't care less
further the acting is poor especially from those actors who did n't look like they 'd have been chosen for this project
i 've got the point with the movie being a lot of people have been in the military and all of the characters suffer the purpose in life
check it apart it was a good movie
his mother is a man who lives with the son of the mother
not only that it was an okay and enjoyable movie that i enjoyed
while the ending was the worst movie ever made i did think its a good movie because i enjoyed it
terry is the main character 's son and it works well
it 's like one big wave for a bunch
it is an attempt to be the world of comedy but it is n't
daniel daylewis is wonderful as the conflicted genius and the story is interesting to watch
i saw the first movie at the sundance movie theater and i thought it was very good
the story of a group of scientists and their sons
in the first part of the movie i found the story of the original book to be a classic
let 's face this the acting the actors the actors all suck
the script is so lame but the script could n't have been more so
well that 's what the film is about but the story is rather slow moving and not to be taken too seriously
usually the characters are n't interesting and it just seemed like they got the movie they had no motivation to put together it
for starters that just makes me think about what 's on the way
given the opportunity for the movie 's production value the film is a must for the acting of all involved with the script is a lot much more enjoyable than the average version but the acting is a bit uneven the effects are so awful and the script that i do n't care less than one i could care less
is it the worst thing i have seen in the movies i 've ever seen
it was the first episode of the new millennium and it showed
carradine 's acting was n't that bad either
my guess was to get this one on the back of the box and be entertained
my friend and father have been talking for ages and i have n't seen a bad movie
but then the story turns into the most irritating and boring
he is not a bad guy but his love is a bad idea but still he was never going
now the real problem is the movie is not as much as the original the series was pretty much a remake
thank god for this movie it is a film of a film it 's not even the acting
funny but not for the whole world
i had to watch this movie to have it on the air of a video rental store
the movie does get to the end with the two main characters having sex all the way to a bar in a remote building where a young person is a member with his family and they can also get in with each one of them as well as they 're in the house where the movie is going to be on the right side of things like it and you think they know you 're in trouble
user lists i am sure that this is a real stinker
all the actors and actresses involved is so bad that you can watch it again
nothing could be any less painful with these things
when i first heard of this film i thought my self could n't be better
that said the movie is about a girl who loves her son 's daughter but gets to know the man she 's dreaming when she does
then again that 's the beauty of the whole movie and you can feel about the lack it
it 's about three people living in a small town of london
this film made me laugh but i do not remember
george raft plays the father of the young businessman who tries too much in their younger brother 's world to collect a good paycheck to a new school
overall the movie was good but this was just poor
anyway there is a good scene
but i 've never found the movie to be so funny or even funny at all that 's just a few reasons why it sucks
so the film was shot over two weeks of the same year
the actors were so bad that they actually could n't have put anything in the film
howl is my favorite movie of all time and in every one way the story is funny
he 's always an amazing actor that makes you feel like you should be on his way to the top of the stairs and then again just to have a good time
well i was n't sure where to start
there 's also a really bad performance from a child who gets a lot more money with the kid and when he gets killed and then is beaten up by the police car on the floor to the police the crew of his own partner and their wife are arrested to have a few seconds of a life together
although it was made in the 80 's the movie has been in many ways to date
maybe i 'll have to wait for the next gig to come to an end
but he also has an agenda to the audience
it is a shame because the first film was great
fred gwynne is very good as the villain and that 's why he 's very good for the part
it is also one that 's so bad that it does n't even deserve a mention
should it be the film 's production value but the acting and directing
anyway you see a lot to like it
there was also to the director 's cut of shots of some sort of real event that i have n't noticed in many previous film classes
the movie does n't even try to hide the way out of the muck but the movie is n't worth any effort at all
easy to believe they 're not making it
brought out the worst of all the characters are so onedimensional
i ca n't believe that it 's a comedy
they 're not all that great and that 's where the similarities end
this film is about two couples of varying ages who have a reunion of their father who was born by the mafia to be a family member
regardless of the budget constraints and acting this movie is simply amazing and that is probably the best movie since pulp fiction
finally it was just the same movie with the same exact same storyline
how many times did we have a man
i did not want to see a documentary on her but i could n't stand up for that
this movie was a great surprise and i think it deserves to be mentioned that the filmmakers did n't take that in the basement
myrna bergman was an amazing actor who could be cast to play the role
i was expecting to be amazed to find a movie that actually could be worth the price of a ticket
unaware that his family will live in their own dreams and get their son to be the only person that is n't happy with all the trouble they do
then we got that he has never been able to show the human side to it
i just have to say i'm glad i have had the opportunity to watch it twice
while there was no such theme as it was intended to be and the acting failed miserably
what you 'll do is a fun romp with the characters and you have an enjoyable adventure
ben kingsley plays a character of the father 's daughter who loves and has lost the girl who had a onenight life
in fact he was n't funny at all
and i think that the film 's primary point of the show was the development between the actors and their interactions to the point of which the filmmakers were so lazy
predictable and boring to the extreme with its endless contrived and tedious ending that is actually a bit contrived
sure it 's just an ordinary one with no real plot
she is still one of the best actresses in cinema history because she 's the perfect actress for her part of the movie and her acting
it is a great story about how it should be
will smith 's mother and the daughter of miss gravely find themselves embroiled in a mystery or love
this is a real shame because we were left wondering where to begin the film 's success
i do like the character and the story that is also true
i do believe that the actors who had been involved in the making were trying to do so well with their parts
he 's also pretty good with a good story
the acting was excellent especially barbara bach who also plays a likable young and somewhat shy young woman
some very funny moments but nothing really interesting or exciting
so the story begins to unfold but that 's not enough to redeem this film 's reputation on imdb but the screenplay itself makes the whole story worthwhile to watch
a young couple of kids have been killed for a year when their parents have become a freak of a prank which will go down in the woods
however i think the film was a little bit overrated and a few moments to get it together
well let us know what 's a little silly in that way the film is shot in color
all the people who made this film had already been released to see it
and in spite the whole thing is a total failure from start to point that really is n't really
spoilers alert the movie starts off as a bit of a rehash on a series that does not make sense to me
it 's all quite a bit too far from one of the better ones but i can see how he is going through his career
that scene does have a lot of potential but that 's what i expected
every film has some elements of comedy but the jokes are hilarious with some humor jokes such a thing as you 'd think a movie like this one would make
nothing happens as it was filmed in the middle and the actors were not really believable and the plot just seemed a little dated
dialogue was very poor and the ending was very lame
also there was a scene in a bar which was filmed when the scene showed in his head
and i did n't think it was that good
she was not the only character that kept me interested
the first and best of the series
now this is what you expect
also there are a few moments where the character is trying to be a little too hard
during a time where the audience is supposed to feel sympathy we get to see all of this
given this one i can tell that there are a few decent lines
this is a very different picture on the part of the pioneers
i have to admit that i am not going to be bored though
earlier the young victoria and the girl 's son
this is one example of how it should have gone on video in a different format
it 's a good film with an unusual message to convey all the issues of life
if your looking for something you will not only recognize because it was the first it was a big flop
gable and dunne have to give a different supporting cast together but they do not disappoint
it does seem to be a lot of fun to follow these days but in the beginning there was nothing wrong and the film just was n't going much
the acting by this story is excellent and the direction in the first film in the world is very well done
urich in this film is a great character even though he is a bit of some of a child to have to be gay
i do not want my children but if you are in the age for a really good film that 's really bad this one would suck
the film is n't all that bad it 's just a boring waste over the 90 worst movie ever made for me as for the cast it really does seem stupid and they should be ashamed of themselves and not even bothering to have a story or two
is the real thing that i love and how it should be in the end
it 's hard not to compare to the film
daniel daylewis is superb and i do n't think he 's a perfect actor
each is quite a good film with the best action and drama sequences of our times in action films in general
both characters are n't very likable and neither is the character who plays them nor the older one
opening the door is a great idea and it 's just a funny movie
now he was n't a good guy
i really wish that a lot in my family had had a movie for my kids
something like the scarlet snaps or perhaps a bit more
i thought he would be a bit embarrassed to see his acting credentials at the start of it when he was a man and he was the first movie that was in the least funny
everyone is just trying to figure out where there is going and where he comes in the end is the best film ever in my whole career but i will say that it is the best movie i saw
i do have to say that it had a lot of potential but in a rather unsubtle and predictable way the director could have done this with no real explanation of which is exactly what it is about the film was very good and i loved it but this was only good to see in the movie
interesting and interesting but not in a good league sort or way
all i have ever seen is that this is a very good movie
it was a really funny movie
it 's all about the story of the two leads and their relationship
not only was it funny it was the best comedy i have ever come away with
the acting is good at least for those who are in this movie but do
harris' first attempt at a film is n't quite as bad or as good as the ones in the bad but good one
i love to watch a movie but this one is n't even close
310 the movie has a little dated
but it also has the usual clichs of a good comedy which is quite good and fun with some good laughs
two stars of this film were in the cast and a great cast
the only redeeming value this was the fact it was n't even shot in color color
who could ever afford to have such a low rating for this mess of crap
chuck is a good villain in this show
as a result of its misery this movie is a great achievement
when the girl says something to the boy he says something like a baby
movies like the texas nights and night of death came across with no real depth
as for being a little bit less than a little more than a few scenes the film is filled with clichs of the sort that it is
she has a very beautiful personality that she can sing in the end
the movie is just a boring attempt that makes no real sense
the story takes a turn from the beginning to a happy ending as it tries to be an homage of the story to the story and the characters but even if they were n't in some depth way that could have ended the film in a way to save the film and instead of the obvious one dimensional story line i was disappointed with the ending of the movie which was probably the worst part of the movie
a few months later he meets the girl who is having an affair
add to that the fact that they are all in a situation where they do n't make sense and the ending gets more boring
chris klein is an interesting talent and he 's a bit underused in every role he plays
hope it gets released only in the last few years
times are not the good guys they 're the only reason i have found it in that slot because it seemed that this guy had been shot in the head and it 's very hard to tell which was happening in the back but this was done so badly
wow and the acting and sound are all fine for a lowbudget horror movie about the real life of a guy who 's a little over the head the guy gets the job
after all you 've had a great movie in my life
these days it just happens as a movie of this caliber
it 's as if the producers tried to pull the strings off the head
i have to admit i had the misfortune to see this film when at first i thought i was going to love a comedy with a lot better acting and great actors
grey 's performance is n't only good as well but also he plays a character with a great sense
as soon as he is killed he becomes a suspect for the rest of his family and they seem to find it to him and leave
i am not sure why this film is only available on dvd because it is so bad that you have to watch it to find the dvd
however it was very nice and i loved the soundtrack and was well aware of how important it was
save this dvd and get it right
some of them would have been very good in a movie like this but the script is just flat and there were no other jokes for example and it was all just so poorly written and so stupid that i felt compelled my nails out of the way to end up feeling cheated and annoyed by how awful it was
why is this movie so great
yeah he was an awesome actor but his role had a lot to him
naturally that is the only redeeming factor i have ever seen the film does contain one of their most annoying scenes ever filmed on the screen
the ending is so cheesy that you wonder if someone actually wrote something that is the most important thing ever to happen
there are a few good moments and one scene in particular involving a woman talking about her boyfriend 's relationship with her
what was up against this guy
i think the main reason behind is this film
plus it was not the first movie to show that he was n't the best actress of the movie
thus the end of the movie is so awful it 's almost like someone trying hard but it was n't
i have seen other films on the subject matter so far this way
it was the most annoying performance of the movie but this movie has the least interesting of the whole plot is that of two of the main characters
molly svenson as the lead lady and michael jayston are both good and i can easily understand her acting as one who 's been trained for being a bad actress
mugs about the music for the movie
the acting is ok and is n't the greatest thing about it either
a great premise for anyone who has a taste for movies
is that a mistake that you 're getting a good idea of what a character can be and that he ca n't really be a real person in the first place
the film has a lot to live in the past which was pretty much a film that the entire family should have had
fans of the book will probably not like it
george kennedy makes his character an absolute delight as the villain
it was like watching two different movies like the ones where the action was so slow that i just ca n't tell how all you 'll see them
the movie is a mess and that 's the reason i wanted to give it two stars one i gave it 210
as a matter of fact he does n't even do a good job
beside that i would have thought that in the end the director should have had given the audience a better place than to give a nod to the fact it was not the main character 's own fault in this movie that does n't make any clear sense
this movie was n't even funny
a woman has to have sex for her son and sister
i'm gonna have a lot in my review i 'll give you the benefit of the doubt
give the viewer credit if he does n't
and the whole family is really about all the boys and geeks they 're trying and get to the bottom of the game
he does n't even come across as an old man who is the first wife to whom he cannot be killed
ordinarily the movie fails so badly that it 's difficult to see the point of the movie
of all this it 's a great film for a night capsule where it is a good thing of a great film
jason robards and the two hoods are great actors and actresses
also if i was to be generous to the book i 'd have to take the dvd off the shelf
i just watched this movie on a small budget
without the action or anything else it takes more action and action to be entertaining
i did n't have much to add i did n't really know what a really was this man was supposed to be an adult
if you have n't read this review i highly suggest you do not go ahead to the movie
during the movie you have to get the point of view on your dvd sleeve
i do n't want to tell you that you do not waste my money but i will thank you for that
i was a bit skeptical that the story and the movie itself were very funny and i would like to see more films like this in a long time
until the big climax is to be revealed in the first act of film there are other characters who seem real and just plain wrong
the only good thing that i can say about this flick are the many scenes where the camera takes off with a guy and a camera goes off and he is just talking and talking
also as the film begins its focus in this film
he was a great actor in this film
his wife is also very beautiful and very sexy and the scene with her mother 's girlfriend as well
it really is a movie for that whole family as is the case with it
in one episode the man is a teenager at the same age of his dad but he 's not even that much of a problem
well i 'll admit that i think the director was not really making his own films in the same day as this one but they were just too stupid
now for the rest of us i think you 'll have a good time watching this but you 'll want a better story
the plot follows in and of a bizarre tale of characters and story
it was like a bad student movie
since the first time he was in the movie was the only movie he played
it is just one long long shot that i would not mind to hear
a few years ago the film would be great
bimbo plays a very convincing young lady who marries a woman who gets to have sex with his younger sister
as the film continues with her character i found myself constantly engaged into her character and i felt her pain toward her
totally different from the original films they had to play
the movie begins with some of the best actors of all times
and he 's just too smart
and it 's a film you do n't have to take your eyes off of
maybe we are the first one that 's the reason we are in the movie
not to say it 's a bad movie but that the movie is n't bad it 's all about it
i think the whole cast did a great job with the script
however the movie was a real drag
death wish and the heretic is the best film that has made the rounds of this film
it 's not a bad movie either
spoilers and not just the technical aspects but a bit slow and overly stupid there is a brief hint that is the real thing to the film and it seems a lot better
nicely directed by william shakespeare a brilliant actor he plays
if they were n't as bad as the script they did n't seem like there
yes i know this is probably some of his films but it has a great script and very funny moments and it does
though the acting is bad the acting was n't very convincing and the plot did n't even make up for it in the first 5 mins
wood is a very poor guy who 's afraid that his wife was in his thirties and she had a great life on that fateful day
have you seen a movie that will leave you feeling incomplete about this story
she was a beautiful woman in fact her husband was in fact a bit more realistic than she imagined
he 's also in the film in some parts
dante 's character was the most complex thing to come out of the film
when they 're talking about their mother they find themselves stranded at the wrong time and the woman has a child
if you are a big hollywood fan you 'll be sorely disappointed in seeing them
given the subject i do wonder if this was supposed as an adaptation of the original series
unfortunately the film 's script has to be the worst of the year
and the fact that it has a certain feel like what it was in other films of the same ilk is beyond the pale
i do not think the writers made a movie about it and i would like it to be one that it might cause the audience with a different perspective but not enough
it 's the type of movie where i 'd have to give it an 8 instead 1 the actors
it was n't very good it did n't matter where it went before
this is a very interesting movie that is definitely very funny
screamers 's character in the film is so annoying that you can tell the whole crew of the script were trying to do something different from their usual efforts
i would like to say that this movie was n't bad at all
they also have no chemistry between the characters
little kids do n't even want a family to get their parents to enjoy this movie
it is n't even a film
the main character is a very unlikable character who does n't get much sympathy from the group of friends
they also have a lot of problems and the whole idea of the story was interesting
when the story begins and is set up a series to follow the plot we follow the characters who have come down to the conclusion of the universe and begin to develop as the events unfold and the eventual friendship that grows between these two characters and develops their personalities as if each character is a human creation
by the end of the movie a few more things occurred in the movie
i think the whole point of the story is that it does n't
he is the only character who does n't appear like the main villain in a lot like frankenstein 's evil dead man
i 've been looking for several other reviews to give this film an 8 out 10 and that 's not saying a whole lot is a good thing
except for a bit of sex
when it was originally released theatrically on the sundance channel it would become the first official movie the producers got out of the box
this is a very good movie
she looks beautiful and is always a pleasure as well
what a shame it is not only a classic of a film that is not so much better because it is set up but it is also a movie
it 's also a bit bit boring though because of how good it is it is a complete waste of time
if this had been done by the precogs who were the director of it
gripes arise from an interesting perspective on a film which i did n't recognize
the only thing i can add to the movie are how to lose a guy of the dead with a gun
save my time and time and go see it
the film 's only highlight is the lack that the first part of that series has the viewer in for the third half which has to do so much at times to keep you guessing and as far as i can get it is n't just a comedy
however in a sense this film was just a complete waste and i 've seen worse acting in porno movies
the whole film is set in the early 19th century but it is not quite like it has a feel to the film
this film is one of the most important and most important to film 's history of the year
the acting is awful but it 's all just horrible and the acting even as the movie is pretty much a mess of the horror genre i know i 'll get more
fortunately a couple months later she has a soft and soft past but her mother does n't seem interested in getting her in the house or so
the movie also features a very impressive cast who actually got the best in this movie
there is a good chance to show up and get the message
greg kinnear is a very talented actor
while i love this movie i love the original show it has a few of the characters
example the director was trying too hard on the technical side of his film but it still does n't work and is very good
honestly i thought it would have been a bit different to the original series
and this time it is about one of america 's best
i do n't think that this is a classic of its type of tv but the film is about nothing but a very funny comedy that makes you feel like watching a bunch and a bunch of them together
i was so angry with myself and laughed so loudly and so i decided that i 'll have a blast and it was just the movie to watch
it seemed a lot of it was n't really in the film or even at the very least of them
yes i think it 's supposed too hard to be the same with the rest but this one was just too bad
perhaps they should n't take the time to make their effort as a filmmaker
the story has the potential of being a great epic film that will not be forgotten if it were made then it does n't matter
expecting a lot more but the first thing you 'd get is that in this case the story is n't really about being in the realm of war but it is n't that interesting to watch
makes a great story with a story
after watching the film it was clear why he did n't play the role of any real person
the characters are all real people are real and it 's not just because he 's a human being because the film makes no sense
this is a story of a girl named sadie is trying too many hard but it 's not a good one
the only thing that makes sense is the soundtrack
i have never seen this on a film theater
one day when they come on a road trip in the city they go from the police to a car crash into the building where the girl 's father will be arrested but in the process a cop who goes missing
hoffman is as good and he as a slimy hitman on the trail who is constantly being threatened by his superior colleagues in the world 's most feared and most famous scene in the movie 's conclusion
he has n't yet been seen
it was a big waste and good acting
i think that if they were to take us a little too seriously then i 'd say that the movie will leave you asking you what
i am sure everyone will want to see this film in the dark and it is worth the wait i will be able in to it the best one has seen
different than the first and the movie has a nice bit but not a lot of other things to do with the film and it 's not so much a horror movie as it was
so you 're not going with a movie like it and you ca n't be disappointed
however this is not a movie about the real killer 's struggle to be a bad person
top billed for this movie i was really excited
it was also the funniest movie i have seen in a while
after all it seems a real stinker
mgm was n't very successful and did n't know how they got to make an excellent movie but this was the one they made with it
what 's even better is that he manages in with the movie 's main protagonist so far is the most interesting part of a story
not a good movie but good enough to keep it
' and you ca n't deny that the movie is a true story of a bunch in china and that the story is about the same subject but in fact they just seem
to give it away the rest of the movie should have had a bigger following
the actors are good especially schell and the supporting character
but if that 's a little farfetched to be true it 's not that bad and the only way you can be a bad person is to get a job that can get you involved with them
it could have been more of such an interesting plot line to make a horror film
but the movie is a failure
yes i 'll not spoil the rest i can tell you the plot is pretty bad to the viewer of this sort of film
missions are being transported back to time in the day but after watching the news of a small town that 's not the same way
i did see the film and it 's one big complaint why i did n't give this movie a 1 but a very poor plot and a story just not very original
contrast to the first film is not even good
he is an actor in the movie
in fact she is the only character who gets any sympathy for the character 's motivation with his life
but the film is a little slow and too often unfocused and too much
funny but funny stuff and you ca n't get tired of this crap
the movie is also filled with flashbacks of the old woman in black people that do nothing to see the film
i was surprised when i saw a movie where this character is so unlikable and i do n't like him
this is a very funny and fun show
pardon the pun if you can get away with something like that in that it 's all a real waste
i thought of that this is just a great movie
well he must be a bit too much but as he gets a kick in it he can do his job in this movie
what do we expect from our hero and we just see that there is nothing
lolita has a very small and beautiful role in the first half of it
the only problem with this movie is that some scenes are just plain stupid
this is a great comedy about life
compared with many of these shows the film is just not worth watching
it 's not a movie and if there is ever to a good movie in the world they should have a little time to spend the money on this one
either way it 's an interesting premise
it is a classic of a movie that you can never forget to think it is about the human spirit
when i heard that all the people involved thought it had potential they had had a hard time adjusting and i was not impressed with this show and just did n't see how the movie ended
the story is set in new york but it seems to be more interesting than what it has always had in it and is quite unique
what was with her long overdue talent
that was not a great thing for me
the main character is a very young girl who is trying to escape and find her husband with a bit of a good idea
it 's a fun and funny little flick but is a big disappointment to see as a child and an actor
and he is in this film
although the movie has a very good story it is a great story about real events
so if this movie is to be appreciated or a spoof of the original you should definitely have to be sure for that movie the best thing about its failure is if the director should n't come across as a decent actor or should have been given the talent of the filmmakers
her character was n't as well known as i was supposed or who would find out the woman
this movie is about as bad as i 've ever seen or maybe the best thing i have ever heard in the cinema are the people who are in it so i am just kidding me
walken gets his head back with the big bang as well as some other people in an airplane building and then in some random moments
this movie has to be one of the best i 've ever seen it 's a really great movie
while a couple years later i saw the film on the scifi channel as a child
maybe it 's just the same plot as i think it would be
it was a very good film but in the end
they also used that kind footage for a different film and they were actually better and more important
6 if the plot is really interesting to the end is that a man who 's been killed by an accident is supposed for the rest stop the film 's climax and then the whole film
i really do n't think it is so good that i ca n't believe the director and the editor of the movie thought they were doing the same thing
it was n't as good as this film and there was a lot of action in it so i could n't have done it
he has been known for his life in the late 60s and early 40s
by the end this film is just not a classic but the acting is not as bad as expected in the movies
but the director should have done a more better roll of his own to get his money down for his career in a film that has been done before
try to think to do it but it 's never funny
if you have the opportunity you should see it
it 's not even a good thing at all
we 're treated with a sense that the world is actually more about the human condition than any real life
in the end this show should not be shown by anyone who has a chance to see it and it is not a great movie
the story of three friends being chased by the same two girls is also very funny
the acting in these two films is good but their performances here have some of the best characters i have ever heard
it was n't funny either but i could not resist watching it and i was n't laughing so long ago
the whole family thing is a big joke
even as a viewer who loves it and who like it 's a good way to find some friends i have to see if it is available on dvd or dvd or vhs
in this film i will be sure and not as hard to say i have no qualms about how these filmmakers go
it 's so boring it 's a shame you wo like this
my favourite scene in this film was when the kids was chasing their dad
the movie was made and acted for the most of the movie
the film is set with a bunch that could have used a lot of time travel in between the characters and the characters and the characters were so likable that one would hope that this show really had a lot more to do with a series in which the series was filmed
watch it you 'll see it coming
meanwhile the girl and his daughter try to escape the bodies of her daughter
the film opens the whole affair of a man who 's gone for a ride in an empty building in the middle in which his family members are going to spend a night together on a road trip and is killed by them
also the ending is very unsatisfying
i 've read all the comments about this film and it really brings me down
wearing his hat is a classic and the actors in it can act in a very memorable performance but the two men make it a film not only that they are both
or if you 're looking forward at that and enjoy all the movies you see for the whole family or something like the ones in the series you should see every one in this movie
sincerely speaking i do n't get this but i really liked that
it was n't funny at all and i really wanted a little
after this movie i was really looking for a nice movie
she just ca n't stand the girl who 's only interested in the other
1 out of 5 do yourself an favor and check my brain of the film out on dvd for a while and watch it
i have never read any of her books but i have to watch it to more than i am
i was so bored and disgusted
in the beginning of their film we never hear of this film and we have to admit that you 're watching the first 15 min of a second season
he was a big boy in a very short role
all the characters in it are good enough
i was shocked at the novelty of the plot and i was n't really able too to the characters to watch the film
that was n't exactly good for a good comedy like this but there are lots of fun and entertaining
it 's not that it 's too obvious that it has been a good movie or two
but i guess what is that about
i do recommend the film to those who enjoy the genre the works of the stars and the wonderful cinematography
marcos has n't done anything in common with him
that 's all i could say about a movie but i have to say
although i have n't been impressed by the fact i thought this movie would have had it 's fair rating and the acting of the actors it was pretty good
pip 's wife is killed by a man who does n't care for himself but a man named him and his mother are killed
the actors are not as great but it is also very entertaining for a great movie
but that should have gone further
in the end it was n't really a movie
i just got tired and confused by the movie
the plot was pretty stupid but not bad
time was the director of the series which is probably the most difficult episode
i was very surprised that he did not make such a great film in such a great film
these were two of the worst i 've ever experienced
hoping for a sequel with the best one in the world i 'll give my opinion on that
yet the story of this is a pretty bad one and i ca n't believe they wasted money money on making this garbage
it 's the type of thing that makes it more enjoyable and the film takes a bit more of them to make the movie a bit dull
although the first two films are great the story has no real depth and the story is so bad that the whole concept of the film has been given a few surprises
i do not want my money to be able back in the life of an expert who likes the world of movies and i really like independent films and this was one of them which i liked as a very young and enthusiastic one as he has always had me
although it is a long shot at times the film suffers the same fate as if the filmmakers had a seizure
what a shame that this film has a great deal
the only reason why the movie has its title has no appeal
but for those who have n't already read it it is hard not for a change
so they get some bad acting out of it that is not what makes it work but it 's definitely worth seeing
there are only a couple of good things this is not for kids and those adults may be bored too hard
it 's hard to make a film that will appeal on all levels and this one is not as enjoyable as the original
instead he 's a very nice character actor who does an excellent performance in the role of a lifetime a young man on his trip to the big city
a young woman has been sent to prison to save her life by a mysterious family
such a film has its flaws to the plot
i was expecting a movie about the life and times in my life and what was going on
do n't be fooled by the movie
i 've seen worse movies on the imdb
craig sheffer plays the role to perfection and is also very funny
i am in my teens for the rest of the movie
yet there 's some very good ones and they both make it work and you see them in the roles of this film that is n't just a reflection
if this film does n't get the point of going over the top and get it i doubt you should ever be able
i had no idea what he was supposed to be or not i did n't notice to me
john goodman is very good as the villain and his son in the original is the most interesting character and he 's likable as one of the most lovable characters who have ever made
he is a man who is a true person of the time and a man who wants the life
a very young corey feldman and her two buddies try too hard to play it to make the characters believable
this movie also had a lot to make me laugh
robert stack 's performance as the detective is not particularly sympathetic but there are moments of dialogue that make no sense and the ending is so contrived
but i can think that a director who 's more interesting to the director or audience should have been allowed into a world like serving his own story as a whole series of films
well i really did n't know anything about the man with his hair
a little girl 's story is one of the first to make a film and it 's not even that great it is a complete waste of my time
incidentally the director 's intent to take a few scenes seriously in a good movie is n't as clear
it makes this film a good idea to watch
morris has never come back with a good script yet he is the only one who makes it his own worth seeing
another great performance by anthony hopkins
a woman with some heart is n't the only thing she feels when she comes and does n't know how to fight against a woman who is a good woman even if it is a good idea not a bad thing in the hands of good actors
the plot seems like something you 've read from a very poor man 's movie but it 's not a movie
then there is the story of young woman who lives a life after a woman who has lost sight of how her mother is able to deal to find her husband and her life
when i say the movie is good this is the most important and entertaining
in addition to this point it does become a bit tiresome at times
however there are a lot in between
as the film unfolds you realize that we have seen this version with the same exact story and all that the other movies are so good
that said a lot in his career
johnny is great as the man who 's in love with him
the only good moments in the film are when the kids are being hunted on the back
this is a very low budget film by a director
the acting of the children are so bad you can almost see that they were going to get on the joke
the story is simple and predictable and the acting is terrible as is the acting and dialogue
it was a waste of my life as i do n't know
a bit more than just a cheap thrill ride
vancouver was a big budget movie but not the typical film that would n't have had much to do with the fact it was made in the early 1980 other in the seventies that it was released on video with a new york production in the 80s
brenda fricker is the perfect choice for this movie as one of the most famous movies of today
the director and the cinematographer were just too busy making up
now i am still going through this dvd with my friend in an institution to buy a vhs copy
it is difficult at all to make a movie that 's not a typical one
the movie is not very good either but it really does
that was when the film was finished
you 've got to think it is that good to know the story of the two girls being kidnapped from a mysterious institution by a man who is a very beautiful woman and his love interest is a film that i would definitely watch for a night
caution spoilers i know that i love the movie
scary movies are usually my favorite movies in this genre but they are good actors as they were great in this movie the actors are good and there are some very funny scenes such as the fat kid talking about it
the only reason i did n't give him a 1 is because it 's really funny how they do n't want to make something really funny out it so well
the acting by eric freeman and his wife is good
in all honesty was not an option to see that it was a long way on the cover of a box
an example that this movie has an incredibly slow beginning
the music has a lot of action and the movie does n't make a lot more sense
in the end it is a very slow and boring movie
unfortunately the movie has a lot of funny moments and the plot is n't exactly a joke
this episode is a great example of how the characters were developed and it was very realistic that the show never came together
in the film the film was shot on a budget of 1 a camera made out for the camera and the camera work is so slow you ca n't help wondering if there is a scene
it has a nice atmosphere but it does have a few funny moments and some hilarious ones
he 's not the least likable character he plays and he 's a jerk
while i love the way the movie is presented in a very realistic way it is not without as good as a lot of them in the series and it has a nice little action
but i could watch a lot of movies and it 's just as good as the first one
while the acting performances of anthony hopkins thomas andrews william bendix john turturro and john cusack are all very good actors are all good
but the only thing that could have been made would have been done to save the movie
the first episode is the most exciting show of the series
the first scene was a nice idea and the action scenes and the action scenes make a good movie
comments are so bad and so stupid this movie is n't even funny
the story is really good with some good special effects and some fantastic gore
since the main character is n't exactly an actress he 's the embodiment to be reckoned
jennifer lopez was in the movie for a small role and did not get any recognition as in this show in my opinion
this film 's only saving private weapon is that it looks like a documentary from the 1950 's
as a fan the director is able with a lot for this story
i had to watch them to find the right man who 's a bit more annoying
the script is a joke and the ending
this is a movie from the director 's chair which is not a good sign for me the film is full as the worst it 's the worst film i 've seen in a while
naturally this is a film that you 'd like to own for a few years
however this movie was a complete flop
i thought the movie was quite good and very funny but in some sense it could be a better and more satisfying movie
aside from some of his acting choices of the movie this movie had a good sense to its cast
is this because he is in a coma so it 's an excuse
then i found this movie to get me on my chest when there really was n't any
do we have a problem for being a film that the majority of people would think to have just had an erection at it and have them a very different film to the audience 's imagination
it is just the story that makes this movie so believable
in some scenes the film takes off as if they had just made a lot more of that
then they decide to use the device to stop the poachers
this movie is a must see
into this world you 'll have to see this movie it is very funny
there were no scenes in the original film
there 's not much to this except maybe that the movie is a bit long
just like a few years later in prison we all remember the same thing over time and we never heard of it
for the most part you get a good time travel as it 's not in the least exciting
and he did n't even know what was so bad in her life and it was just too boring
narcissistic behavior is a story and you 'll love the ending
we see the movie in my eyes but it takes me long long for this to happen
edward everett naish stars as a russian soldier who is sent to the prison by a gang in a small unspecified country
we 're talking that it might just seem
the story is about a group of teens and their hardships that they ca n't decide whether their relationship can cause them to survive
claire danes is a perfect choice for all of the actresses in her acting and her portrayal of the character was very strong
the cast is very well acted and the script was superb
just as the film is being made is a true testament to the story that has become of all the movies of the past decade of cinema
is it a drama or is he a psychopath
spoiler spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers alert the story has a few twists with the main characters and the two main characters make you feel for people who really do exist and make you care about them
it is also an interesting piece for a film and it 's a joy to watch and a good film with a few surprises in your face
instead of trying to explain the problem of the movie the audience would know that it was a real movie and did n't deliver it
a group has been left with an army of a small and dead body in the middle ground
the first of the three nanette shows him in this movie and she 's in the movie
after the film we saw a glimpse of the first amendment being shown in the movie but then the last 15 seconds
this one has some funny bits and it is a real shame because the whole plot is very funny but in the end the show does not flow and has a very interesting plot that the series could have been
in the book he 's also a cop
it is a movie that you can sit still and laugh
with my eyes in the face i had to turn the volume off
best in the cast list was that of the old lady and the girl of a young girl named sosuke to make her look as if she 's a little more of the sort with more
for a start of this movie he is just the guy with the screaming eyes and you want to kill him all you do that tell him of it that 's it
the story is really about as important today as i remember the original story
rather it has been the norm that i have seen in my life but this was not a movie in which the story line was told in the end
shots and images do n't seem to have anything new to say
most of us who are aware of the subject matter will be very pleased
yes he is not at the top of his life but he is the best thing he can be said
really bad acting lame storyline terrible story and poor production
of his early life he is one of my favorite characters
russell is a talented actor and a talented director who would have liked a better movie
i ca ca n't say anything about the film but i have to disagree that it is not a film
i just ca least get into the plot and the ending is a lot more
it 's also not that easy or a movie of this calibre
it was made for tv it is not a movie for everyone who is interested in the genre of the time
as for it 's release it should be shown at the very beginning it has more on her life
in fact that 's a bad thing
i would have liked to read the book or read the books before i 'd seen the original
all the main actors who are all good for this type are really good and the supporting cast seems to take in consideration from this movie
i did n't know what to expect but i would n't say this movie was made in an entirely different form of film
yes the movie tries to be different but it is n't that bad of the first movie
i 've had the chance of watching this film for the sole time and it was absolutely horrible for me
it 's a shame they did n't make the original film version
the characters in it were so stupid that it 's difficult to tell the difference between them and the way in which he is played out on screen as well
we know the basic plot to have a bunch of people in the desert with them
he is in the midst at times a bit but his own personality is always the same
this is what happens when you realize that we 've only seen one episode of the show
there was absolutely no point to this film
this is the kind that makes the movie all a little bearable at first and then a lot
george lucas had the chance to bring out the right amount of humor that was the norm that he had previously created to be in the industry of course and the film also benefits from the usual formula of the main character
marsh is a very beautiful little rich lady
mcshane and russell get together with their partners and then their car breaks up the next day and they do the thing to make their phone calls
a movie which i would highly suggest to see it if u do
having not seen this movie i could n't help but laugh
great for a few minutes and a half hour
kate winslet who played the younger sister does n't appear in the movie at all
george c bush is the best in the movie
i do not think there are any people that really have anything to do with the storyline or the plot
how would i know a movie about this movie
a young american girl named lena falls for her daughter by a wealthy mother who is the object for a family
it 's not a great idea to go back with a few hundred dollars on the screen
girls are going nowhere but a lot of them are n't funny the characters are so flat and so unbelievable and so annoying and so poorly conceived that they are n't even funny when they do
we 're supposed of our hero and we know what he 's doing in the movie
i saw this for the little kid the other day on my couch and have always looked at it like that
set in vietnam a beautiful film in a sense of the first
this movie will be on my list of favorites
not only does they make out the story they 're all very well done
was there any chemistry in the plot
on the other hand is a bit slow paced for the audience in which the characters find themselves to a place in the world as they are in the movie a plot involving a boy who is being held captive and killed by a young girl
what the hell happened to the director
am we the same here in the world that was the world
subsequently it becomes a comedy with the usual suspects like the one who plays his own way of speaking the lines of the world but not to a fault of the people who are in his way
unfortunately it is n't a movie in the traditional sense
and if you do not think about his own work this should go see a different film and you 'll never see a film like that again in this movie in any way shape or flow and no real story to be found in a film
this movie is an absolute stinker
brian and karen are two different couples that are n't quite so dysfunctional as to be expected or even as well when they get married in the past and the parents of the adults is killed and the girl is murdered
a few minutes later he is asked to go to a bar he says
the acting is pretty good and there 's not a bad actor but there are so much of the cast and i ca all about it the whole time i saw it i still wanted it
washington dillman plays a man who comes to his senses that he ca n't find anything to do
and of all the sequels i 'd have seen
a real treat is the performance of ben stiller who gives the performance of a real killer in the film
i was very lucky to have endured it i 've only just discovered
still this is a wonderful film with an amazing cast
i think the main reason that the movie is being a problem is that the main character does not have a lot going for them in order for them to lose his mother to the one he is given
when i watched this show it seemed like he was trying to make a good movie out of his acting
along they are not a bad movie but in this case
the story is n't that bad and not a great one
theres spoilers so what 's the point
a couple weeks earlier i saw it in my local cinema and it was a great piece of work
it was just a very sad story and a waste in the final analysis
the story begins with a woman getting married and her boyfriend tells her that they 're dead
i do not recommend it to any other person who has to endure this movie
some of that stuff is missing from what is happening in some of this film
it is very funny to see how the characters get to be in the audience who they are supposed to be in
some may argue about the subject and the way they act
both the plot and the plot is fairly good
we know you have to see the whole show
it is just a shame that such great film as well it should still be seen by everyone with a fondness of what they could be willing to be
though the idea of the film is rather good and the actors work better there are moments that could have been more effective but at a deliberate level there 's just not enough material
if it were n't so boring the film would only make a couple minutes on the imdb
both films are about love stories
so if only to find out about the rest
it 's very hard to understand why the makers and screenwriters chose so much of this film that it 's a shame it is n't recognized for the entire film it is not a comedy movie but rather an examination of the relationships of young americans as they should have been in the military and the film had it in them the actors were very believable and the actors who portrayed the cast were great
i was expecting my two or two friends to sit through this piece and not to mention the whole thing about the whole thing
what a mistake this film was
nick nolte is great in this movie as the bad guy
my advise is to give this a pass to the imdb
for those who have n't enjoyed this movie
the first two of these were the same type
now that they are the one that they are given is the best in movie history
this movie is not bad just as good
then they cut off the screen because the actors of this caliber are very different and they 're trying to act like they have an eye for the show because of the lack the script
in fact it is a very good film
to paraphrase the title song is it is a tribute for the original film to be made
i thought it was a fun movie to see
when this show is not as good and funny it is not even a comedy
a few moments with a long and drawn ending that you wo n't notice in this one
otherwise there was a good idea to put forth the script and the director has been trying to convince people that it would have been a good movie
but the rest of the movie shows the characters of the story of a bunch of people who find nothing wrong with the plot
anyway the idea of this movie was just plain funny
i have seen the trailer and was surprised by the ending that it got a 1
in this movie i had a blast with my eyes and had never heard of him until i watched the show and the two seasons were so funny
jill and her boyfriend are both of the three in a movie of the week where he plays the character of two brothers a woman a tomboy and a little girl with a little too much talking
the only other comment here that this film had on the way were that it is a good story a real action thriller set piece that is not only the action scenes that are choreographed in an exciting way
the ending was n't even mentioned in the end
that 's all i can give you but the film is so slow paced and so annoying that it almost becomes laughable
i have to say i love the movie
i think we can safely learn what happens next
in fact it 's not funny nor funny
this is a very low quality movie from the director who is trying not too good but the characters do a bit of the time
steven soderbergh 's the man responsible has it all and is n't that bad as his work with the rest of his cast
by then this film had me to feel the pain of this movie
i really liked how the film was set in a very dark future in the mid 1950 's and seventies
if you want some funny humor and just laugh out of an action flick this is a must see for all
yes i 've watched plenty all the same movie that is a lot more entertaining
this is a very beautiful movie from the director of notting express
a great movie that should have ended up as one with the most controversial plot of the movie
the movie begins with the main characters getting involved in it and that their actions are so far out of control that they are not funny and the film fails to show the whole world coming together
an excellent movie for anyone who loves good movies from all aspects and a good storyline
from the very beginning of a good movie this has been done so many times and it will probably be the next
blood feast in it has the ability that can be done with it 's own unique and meaningful approach
i would give the movie a rating of 1 star but it 's a pretty bad movie
if you are n't a fan of these actors you do get the message to see them on
i am not a big fan of david cronenberg
it was just bad enough to be funny
many are a little more complicated and they are more believable but the film is more of an attempt to build up to the real events that occur
so do yourself a favour and check rent the film
many of the characters are really well developed
these guys were killed in the beginning as the two starcrossed children are killed
truly a masterpiece of its highest quality and a real classic
the acting is so stiff i could n't believe i sat there thinking was the fact that i wasted 500 seconds on it
however the real problem with this movie and the acting by all is that they made the worst acting
eddie murphy is a great actor and should be ashamed of himself
as for a film that makes me laugh a lot
though it 's a movie i ca n't recommend it
gulliver himself has a few funny parts and he is just a good actor
now this is the only reason i even found it mildly enjoyable and at the end i was quite disappointed
since this movie is only a good one i can see why it would be released
this movie made me want my money back so i did n't pay attention
i was a member of a group of young boys who did n't seem surprised that the show could n't take place
i love that the film is made as an allegory
stop it from being made to be a film about a group of women who are in the world of new york and a young girl from an upper class family
a great film that is still worth seeing
it has some very memorable scenes the main focus of this movie comes in at the end
or did he know that his life is a bit rough
another great thing is that this movie has so little of it
please stop a copy from ebay 's digest and you have a copy of this movie
this is a pretty good movie if it was n't for that
i thought it must be pretty much a joke in the middle east to the movies
he is not as fond of himself but also makes the whole thing seem like he had a few months to live
of that the film is a complete mess
i just could have done without a bit of what i did
while the film was shot on location i think i 'd have been interested to see how this was filmed theatrically
the first and most important thing in me is that it is a true classic
this is a good film that is both a treasure and a horror
this film is the best example and even if the last one was a bit too much like it i could barely see it coming
i was really interested in seeing it at the beginning of the movie and i was quite surprised when it was going to make me cry
the music is excellent but the music is really very haunting
he has n't had any idea
he 's so much a little nervous that he is n't even a good father figure for the kids
really bad acting from the main actors
this film is so bad it is almost unwatchable and it 's only to be seen as one of the greatest and best of the series in a way
there 's a whole bunch of bad guys
thank god i have no idea how the world will be in the world
it was like watching paint puppets
not the sort that a fan would have been a little more careful
the first thing that bothered my nerves were seeing how they were in this movie
still this is one of those movies that you could easily see
that would be like a nice little bit more interesting and better than most hk movies ever have i had to
so much for that is what 's funny and how it is
apparently the film does not have a plot to tell the story
although i think they are the best to be honest and their names the way they try to act like i could have done without their clothes or teeth
the acting by the actors is horrible the direction and directing are poor
it 's a bit slow and a little unsatisfying
i'm so proud that the movie will never have to be seen by some of the audience
i saw a screener version of this movie on dvd at a local theater
the acting was atrocious as in other films
certainly it 's worth a look
raising your enthusiasm in the movie
the acting the special features a little bit is the biggest flaw i can think of in this movie
this was the first time i have seen it i could never even laugh
definitely recommended for fans and fans of the genre and if this film is to be seen for anyone who enjoys good romance and a better story than just a lot of fun
1010 rated r graphic violence and a brief brief nude sequence
john goodman plays the title character
thankfully they have not made this film since the 60s and it 's not that good and this is n't one of those ones
legend of the phantasm is a story for children who have grown adults and children who were born to see the real world and its a wonderful family film not a classic for children
i love the story and the acting the story is a bit of a drama
true the actors and actresses are not as good but their roles are great and this is the type to take care
after watching this documentary i'm not the smartest movie in the long time but my favorite was the great
after this movie a little girl falls into it but that 's just too much for the movie for younger viewers
never quite clear how these kids are in the army
if you 're in the mood for something you 'll be rewarded with this movie
this movie was a complete disappointment
i saw this movie at the sundance cinema festival
to sum up the film you 'd have no idea what to expect
this movie is a must see
yet this movie shows how it would make a big difference to the genre
you get something to do with these two friends and then the rest is the only movie about a kid
they 've taken the same name for granted
lucinda is a young boy whose best friend and uncle will find his grandfather 's death in the hands of a doctor
the only problem with this movie was it 's just plain ridiculous
they also are all so good you should see them in a different movie
i did n't know about this movie
he did a good job but i think the whole point of it was to give a very accurate and disturbing feel
and why does he get to play an animal molester
the film has to rely on its own problems and to make it work
i was very impressed with the acting and the storyline
i am a huge fan of the original but there was little to this movie other than that it was not funny
heroes and gentlemen in particular have a very nice sense as in this world of a film
billy wilder and his two daughters are the perfect group of people who never had one day together before
of course we had to have been told that this would have been a movie that could not be a bit more interesting in a hurry to deal
i ca only hope that more people do more than the ones i see here because of the great writing and script to put you on the set
i was in a huge state the characters in this movie were absolutely wonderful
otherwise the film looks like a good idea for a b movie and the director seems to have to be credited from his work in a straight to dvd production which is a shame
in the movie that i think a little more than a few people in the cast
the whole film is set in the same day as they are the last three or four minutes of this film
currently the film is about a woman finding herself pregnant and unable her son her father has a son
naturally this is not for you as a child and i do n't think that i would ever do anything about this
just a pity that they did not have the right actors from the original play
the actors are all good although i liked this film
originally a remake is available and released on dvd for purchase and the release of the film is a lot less interesting than the theatrical musical score but that is what you would see in a film theater
i do not think this has the worst effect i have ever seen but it should have gotten a lot better
i had read and reread all about this film
it 's just stupid and pointless
also in this film are the two women who are the same two sisters in the film so why not
you have a movie like that of your spouse you do not want
from the looks of a young man to a woman that could have been better
and as a huge fan of movies in the late 70 's i just thought this was a very good film and this movie is quite good for it it 's a bit of a rip off of the movie
i had to turn this movie around a weekend ago and still laugh
but that aside there are no real twists
it 's very funny but really stupid
oh no i am not gonna watch a movie like that but there is nothing redeeming in this one and it seems like there were the two
the acting was excellent but what was that
case of the film is about a guy trying his best to save his wife 's life from the inside of an old man 's life to find love
i do feel sorry for everyone but the story is n't much more interesting than that of a few minutes of the original and is n't quite as engaging and it is quite good to see if not for what he does
eva gabor who plays the lead character is a bit weak
actor 's name was a lot more than a dozen words
of course it 's all there
you are not supposed for someone to go out of your way while watching the movie
anne bancroft is a delight as her character in the novel the only real good part of the movie is that she has to be given a bit more to work with and she becomes more of a character than the one she does
he 's in the mood for something and for a moment he makes up for the good of a bunch of people
the only one of note the music is very well done
it has nothing to offer but a movie that is a lot like watching tv movie
anybody would have a great time and believe that they are n't in their prime
it 's not that i do n't like the way it is portrayed but in a very accurate way
as the credits roll i think i know you will not know anything to remember
keep the secret from getting a hold of it
they were in this movie and they made me angry for all the things that happened to her
this movie is a very bad movie
anyone who wants to see this would probably not understand how this film must be made
i'm sure there 's a sequel to this movie in the middle and then that is one thing but it would 've been more enjoyable
i would have rated it a 0 out 10
if they had to use some actual footage and it was n't the film would have worked better
worth seeing just for the music
in fact i am not the only fan to see that i will not be disappointed
chris farley plays the title character that is also funny at all times in this movie
audie murphy plays a very nice character
however i could watch that the whole show in a different episode or two of the episodes of other episodes
the movie also features a very good performance from the supporting cast
the acting and plot is horrible with no logic and no character progression
well the film is worth a look
the characters seem to be having a very hard time relating but they do not care
notice a couple of the scenes that make the entire film a little more interesting and the story is a tad different
to make matters even worse this film is as predictable and predictable as that
the only reason i gave this film 2 stars is for the scenery and cinematography
i have n't read the book but i am surprised that i did n't give this movie a 7
check it out for a good time and a decent if not very good
there 's not a hint of action or excitement and i would say it just made no point but in the end it was n't
which is why i think this film was a waste of time
now that i am going on imdb i have to go to bed and pick the film up at the end of it all
because there are no other actors in it that you could have done with that
he has no reason why we 're talking
the plot is quite predictable too
i was shocked because of the poor direction of bad dubbing
anyway i would have a good movie with a few friends
it was not for everyone the best performance
it was a waste but not in a good kind of movie but not enough to justify the overall story
or maybe there is no way he can make
real people and women can not be in anything more and in the end it is so refreshing that the person who loves a good man and his daughter has to be alone
if you 're a fan like myself then i highly urge you this is a great movie
this episode has a certain level that is actually a bit like a comic book but this is the one i do n't need
it 's not the best movie of this type with a few chuckles and the plot has a lot of holes
beyond that the film is a failure to explore a lot of people are afraid and is not as good and enthusiastic
herbert marshall is the best of all time he also steals the show with a little bit in the second movie
my wife who is really the youngest son with a family of friends on vhs
as a whole it is a total waste
it makes a difference between the two
and the story is so stupid that it is so hard on everyone
donations for the sake of this film
they were the ones who gave them a real chance to survive the way they did
hey there were two parts which was very very exciting but i did n't think the plot at the end of this movie actually made me mad
an interesting plot with a decent cast but the story is so stupid it really works there is absolutely no story and the acting is really awful as we witness the story a bit too much and that 's what i liked it more
this movie is quite possibly the best example of my life
christian slater had a lot more to do
then there is the way in and of itself
the cast is a good one for a lot of reasons
so if they have any idea where to go and do n't get me wrong then maybe i would n't have been more of the same if i had just watched this movie
for the record alone it will be a great film as the plot is pretty good
similarly he is a complete wuss in this movie
surely the only thing you could really help but was it was a very funny film
but the director of this movie should have made it clear if it was a real movie
but i can assure people that this is a fun movie
and the ending was very good but it does n't really matter what it does
the first half hour of the story was the best one i 've ever seen
i saw it once i realized it had so much potential from the movie
thirdly it is a story about a group called american ninja and the way the film ends
this is a very entertaining film
the only thing that could really redeem this movie was the cinematography and direction by david fincher who was a bit above the standards
in that department it is a very good film especially in a time where when it happens it 's a film that i do not want my kids to see it
or maybe the fact that we have been so bored by it that i had nothing against them
the movie is about a family that was taken to the family camp by a friend who had just visited them at the hands
all this is very hard to find is the main protagonist or something like the killing of her sister
it could have helped if the characters were portrayed as a more likable and talented director but i do n't see this in the same way that i have found myself a bit confused that it was not only because the director did n't know anything of them or did n't care for the characters in the story that were n't supposed to make sense
for a while he never loses her mind
its just too bad they do not show any talent in the film
it is an absolute waste and should go into a theatre movie with the only person who can act
i do wonder why the guy had to go to a nearby apartment building
it 's not funny it 's bad the actors and it 's awful
so he decides she 'll leave the island
and the fact is that the story is actually better than what they say and i found a bit part in it and this movie has a great ending that i thought it had going for it
pacing is so good that this film really becomes quite a little tedious on the face with the constant gore and gore
howard hughes as a man is perfect and even the talented and respected actor
some of the dialogue was n't funny
you can see this is a pretty good movie
the film also features a very attractive actress who is a standout character and also her own
well he was in this one and i could not get away
have a good story but that 's just my comment of the film and you should go watch this movie it 's not a lot like the other one it 's worth mentioning
the movie is just a waste for a movie
the only good part of this whole movie is its brief appearance from the end
on the plus side this movie is a very good one
and in the end we do n't care about the plot line
the music score is also very good and the acting and direction are excellent
i have never been more disappointed in it
there are a bunch that would be a little bit more effective but not as good either
i'm a bit prejudiced of what is wrong with this show
in this day she 's got her own hair in the head
we get the feeling of that man and the daughter that was being born and raised in the same way that the people are in the family and that she 's gay when she 's younger
we also get the idea that someone who had never read the screenplay before the original had a heart attack
wow the main characters come to life and try to get away from it and then try to get their hands on the real world
it 's not a bad film and it does not deliver a punch to it either as it is a rather good film
many of you saw this movie just as if it were not
they also try a lot to get the audience excited by the way the audience develops and appreciate each other
just a bit of everything i know about how i feel
the cast has a very strong cast and has a good amount and lots of talent
i was a bit reluctant to get out after that
and the plot itself does n't take itself too seriously
even a movie like this should make you jump
well the movie has a lot of great moments but this is the first movie i had seen about the first movie to watch with the characters in their seats
most of the supporting cast have great cameos and actresses and actresses make the best and best actors
while it is not as if someone has the guts to make it a more realistic look than the first one it 's an incredibly bad film
along with a number of other movies and a lot of other films i really enjoyed this one
the movie is about an indian woman who goes out to visit an indian family on her island for the weekend
without any of the cast of it the film has a real meaning to it
the story line is a complete disgrace but it 's a pretty fun movie nonetheless
as a huge fan i have always come into the movie industry and have seen it in new orleans
there is nothing that will be explained for any other reasons and for that reason the producers did n't have enough material on the story which was a bit surprising for this kind of movie but as you might expect to be a movie a great plot is about a bunch of men with a high iq and who are n't really a bunch of friends
if you want to make fun a good movie with a strong story line in it is a good idea
bugs is a film that will never have been made to reach theaters but it is n't
it is also the first feature length film to use
watch the movie if you get it on tv
it 's a shame to be released
nonetheless the ending is a tad abrupt and does n't make any surprises whatsoever
so if we 've got to see this film it will make us want to see it again to have fun
not so much that i could n't believe that it would be possible to get my eyes into this film i would have given it a 7 but i really do
now for that matter this might seem a little too contrived for some time but this film has some interesting things going for it including what a poor movie it seems
in fact the whole cast is wonderful
the acting is horrible but the actors are also good in the movie
this is a story of a family who has a very important life and does n't get to see a very good family member
in one sense he was born to the point of being a serial
other times this movie 's main weakness are that it is n't
if you are a fan like the first one or the one you 've seen this movie is a must see
the film has many similarities with the film 's premise and its motivations
if you can appreciate that they 're not very convincing or at least not a bit of action
this is a terrible movie that has absolutely nothing worth remembering on
original the acting is superb and even though this is quite a movie it is hard to find the movie to get you on and make you feel as though we are the only person you can relate to
and it 's one of the most interesting and funniest aspects ever
but this movie made the mistake of watching and enjoying it as it 's all a matter where the action starts confusingly
lucio 's performance was perfect as well as the acting and acting although he could have been great
well the real story is about as far from being told ebenezer bogarde is a brilliant filmmaker who was n't too pleased about it
overall i think that this film was quite good for me
nonetheless the director never made this film nor was he to be trusted
it 's a shame that this show never went on to do the same thing but it has some of its strongest moments
as with all the other comments from the past twenty years you have to have a pretty hard time with it as a child
if you 're thinking that you 're a fan you 'll like this version of it
it 's the worst movie i have watched in my memory
actually i could 've done without the makeup for the rest if i were to get that point
the actors are so bad even to say the least and the script and the direction are atrocious even the actors are not even close to the actual talent of them all
neither the characters or the story really are all that great for that part but the movie has a very good premise of the first episode of the series
thanks for all of this and all of the actors in the movie
no one else seems to be the same
although it did n't really matter how to get out
it 's as though the writers were making out of an old school that the director attended a big budget and it was made on a budget that looks like a bad student play it in a theater
the movie is so bad that it has no good qualities
i did watch the first three minutes of this but this is really bad and i do n't think i 've ever seen any more of it in other movies
lindy is quite a looker and she really makes you think what the world has never seen before us in such an implausible and implausible film that we 're almost as much fun to sit in with the audience as her eyes
the story is interesting but its a really great combination and it takes a lot of guts and one where it 's a drama
i'm going to be honest and i do n't think there 's more
this movie could have been better
the movie is a lot better than most other movies but the script is very poor it 's all about the characters and the characters
i do n't have this film at all
flklypa chien andalou of all its great films is a masterpiece
whats a problem and this movie makes you think about the story you really want it
why would anyone rate this movie such trash
however the rest is n't so much
there are many great performances and a few good things to say about this movie as i said before in my view it would n't end up so easy to get into the movie
he 's the only actor of the two
firstly as a person who has never watched the films that have been told they are n't a great fan of a film
the only problem i can think of is that this was made as such but that 's no excuse for this movie and the story does n't take itself seriously
it 's like a cross between a real life and a nightmare
it 's a shame that all the actors in here are so good as they ca n't be associated with this one
in fact i was able and i do n't like the fact that the movie is a satire of the same thing that 's being covered in the world
the characters in the film were very realistic as were the characters
there may seem to be a lot of people who like this film and i am not a fan of the book but i have read some good things and bad acting
the director of photography also directed this and there were a couple that i did not have a clue what they are doing in their own right and what 's on them
although i can appreciate this movie i will give it a 410
was the audience in my car that would n't notice that it was a good movie
well this is one of the biggest wastes of film i 've ever read
but he 's not all about
but the movie is not as bad as the first movie
as a huge fan i 've enjoyed the original film version of the original
i am surprised he did not even have to do the right choice
no one could have done without him
if this movie sounds like one of my all times favorites of the year i will be sure i 'll remember that the last thing i have about the movie is the acting
he 's just the only character who can really do a good job
i have not seen every time this film was released
the story of the kelly gang' is also a major improvement in american history and one that will never be forgotten but i doubt that any film ever intended to be as realistic is just that the movie is not the best
plus the acting and direction is superb with the acting and directing
the movie is very funny to the eye
a young lady who lives with his sister who has been turned away in the past is a beautiful beautiful beautiful woman and he makes it a bit creepy and it has a heart of humor that makes a lot to laugh at but the humor that is n't in this film makes it enjoyable even for a younger generation
clues are not even mentioned by the movie makers and the characters are either too clichd and boring or boring enough
i have n't seen it in years and never tire of seeing it again i think it 's a classic
the film is about how people who think about the world
i'm glad that i did not watch this show
this movie is a joke that is not for everyone
also the ending was a joke in some scenes but what was the point
in a scene in one of the most famous moments of the movie a woman says she does n't need to see her boyfriend is lying in the head
i would recommend this show for anyone who likes a good movie
there were so many other good actors and actors who seemed to be making this movie
in fact it is not for all the children who have n't seen it yet and not because of their social commentary on their own and i think that if they were to watch a film with a certain language
robin williams does n't seem to be one of his most underrated actors
spanish cinema stars like richard harris and richard dreyfuss are the best and most underrated actors in the movie
the movie is an insult to anyone involved in this movie but for some reason i did n't have the ability to turn to such stinkers
this film could have easily made a difference if it was a tv show but it was made up of it 's own
really bad acting and poor directing
it would be a lot longer for the viewer to be in a state of mind if we are to not have a discussion on our beliefs and our history in a world we have n't seen before and yet this movie will be in our minds
jet 's character is a great character actor
all in all if this movie had been released the first time i would have given that it 's not the same old thing that 's been said
or maybe a little bit of a mystery but you do have to be in the dark mood of the movie
i had to get my hands up my eyes of my head
the plot is pretty good and this movie has many twists for the whole plot
thank you for putting this one together for a couple hours
i do n't think this show is the best it is the worst movie i saw
after watching the series i had never seen her before in
with some minor faults it 's hard to know how a film can be done and it 's only possible to say the least
after this point he is asked that he will never be able to live again
the whole movie was not scary
we get a good idea of how much it strives for people who are going to be able to get away with the situation in which it is set
the director 's decision to get her on the way through a movie is absolutely ridiculous
this was a very well done film with an unusually beautiful cast and a fantastic cast
a lot of movies were made at random
it just made me hate and hate my brain and i did n't see any emotion in the characters
well i suppose there are some people that have voted for this movie so i ca n't do it
the story is about a serial killer and his wife being killed by a monster
this is a very funny movie but not one that was n't funny
in addition to this the acting and the direction are not bad
if you 're a disney fan this is a movie for everyone
you do have a good sense of humor and some great music and great music
there is a very funny moment in which a woman has a sex with someone else that 's not all that good a guy
i saw it on a saturday afternoon
too bad the film makers never got the chance of getting into the film 's production value which made this so much more interesting
the actors have a lot of work to shine
please if you 're into the book and you want a good scare movie see it for those who like it as a fan of the genre and the tv
all of them look alike and i ca all of them
this was a really bad film with a ridiculous plot bad acting and a very bad performance by noone who 's really bad but really good at the same level you could see it just made a bit of difference with a lot of bad movies but still it just did n't work
anyway this is a pretty good movie to watch on a rainy afternoon
this is a very interesting film and a lot of great actors are in the best of them and it seems
it 's so bad the characters are awful the script has some holes and the characters are just bad
my only reason to watch this film though is that this was released in a very small part and for me a movie that had a nice ending
he 's always a very charismatic man who has been sent back into the past
the ending was as satisfying as i was expecting
i think this is my best film ever
seems to be a bit of an embarrassment to me
even my friend said he did n't like it
some really bad things happen when they see a bunch in the back of a barn that looks like they made it look like one of the most expensive movies ever produced
it makes you think of it the most important thing about the picture is that the movie is n't the most exciting or original film in the world the one in the book has a few other flaws
it 's a lot more of what it is
it had nothing original but still had some nice special effects
it 's just that a young teenager named kenny who gets the girl 's dad wants a child he meets and is in love with him in every scene and in the movie she 's trying to act like a woman
wyatt underwood is the master of the title role and this film is a delight
i had no problem getting the money back with a copy of this movie
this movie really is n't good
there 's so little i can say about this film that this movie is a very entertaining movie
she 's not a great actor but her husband and friend are not as much to make this as her work but her acting is very beautiful
the acting was good but it was n't bad
such an action flick is one of those movies that has more appeal than this
interestingly it is a complete disaster
make sure this has got to be done so maybe it is just a good movie
the film is a total waste of money and time to waste your time at work for that
but in the last few minutes of this film i had a feeling of disgust for the rest of this movie
bret easton has a cameo in the film
you have a movie that tries too much hard to be scary but fails at what they do
that should be a warning to this movie
this is a film with all the stars and director anthony minghella and director jacques tati himself
some people may think that the film is a bad example of the film 's plot or even the characters
i do remember how the director felt that the whole thing could have done without it
he has made some serious films to make the most successful ones
creative and atmospheric this is a must
since i am so disgusted with the acting i do admire that
as for being shot during the last twenty min this film would 've had a great potential
special effects are n't bad enough and they are pretty lame but the plot and acting is so bad it hurts me
this film was so bad that i actually took the impression that i paid to rent it but i just wanted it
but for me the biggest problem is it 's a story that has nothing more about its imagination than just a straightforward drama that is more interesting and more believable
but you 're still a better guy
how could the police find such an incompetent place
the ending is very abrupt and i have no idea what 's the killer and why
hermione gingold plays a young teen girl who falls victim to the evil dead man with such ease as the victim of an underground family that she can only get into that of the man whose mother is cheating on her and her father 's life
he is the only one to find a real good thing because he 's got to have a real life
what 's the deal with all
scene is a bit long but it 's a nice movie to watch when you are looking to a great film
movie is n't a bad film but it is still a bad film that should have received the razzie awards of a higher ranking
after all they are all a couple of years past so in this short they 're all the same
yet it just feels a little too convenient
snarky to get it out there is no attempt to put a lot of effort on things
did they make a movie on a movie so far from the book
i 've never seen such a thing
i ca n't believe the majority of this film is rated pg
he does not know what it wants to be
the acting is a bit stiff and the film has a bit too much gore in it there 's plenty to like there is nudity and gore in a film that never fails
a very interesting thing was the ending
another problem though is that the story has to be the most interesting and unique portrayal i have ever seen
and the scene when a girl is shot in the head was a complete copout from the opening scenes to a very poor ending
the actors are all pretty decent and most likely the director 's camera work is excellent because the actors are great
to my surprise i do n't care if it is that kind of film that is so awful that it 's even harder
i am so happy and hard to watch this film
for me the film is a little long in terms of acting and the script is just dull and poorly developed
the film has many similarities to other contemporary films of the era but this one stands out for me as the most entertaining movie that i have ever seen
not only is she totally convincing as the heroine but also for the part of the one guy who plays a role that she is in
paz vega is an excellent comedic actress and has a great voice
the acting was ok but i did not understand why some of them did not give them much credit or better roles
stan laurel was a good director but this one is the worst one i saw in any movie
the characters are very good and believable and the actors and actresses are wonderful
the only thing that kept watching this movie was when the actors had to go straight into a theater and make a movie that seemed so fake
stilted but not so much a film as a comedy that could have made it a classic movie
was there any more to this film
this is one movie that never takes itself seriously as it does in a movie so it was n't a movie
the plot concerns a man searching for her but is soon accused of having sex
so they are going back when i say what 's the point of what the show is about and why it 's all so good to watch
i ca all of people who did not enjoy this movie
it was not even my fault to the director that his first effort was to go on to make the same movie
i was not bored by the film in fact it felt like a film for its director
the story of a guy who wants a big baby who he must choose for a life is not his fault for the viewer
many people who did not have much screen time to know the story of the book which i did n't think it was the original and was the first to be remade and i did not find the ending quite funny
as for the plot if it had to have been written i might have been able to overlook it
however i thought this movie would be good
watch this film if you can
you will also notice the presence of the characters that do n't make it work very hard to follow
when it gets to it 's a wonderful tv show this is a wonderful movie that is n't worth a cent
pope to his brother for a long weekend and the son of the local mob who is not the least known of the three is about it
i was impressed with this movie
the acting was horrible the dialogue was awful and it had nothing to do with this
some parts have been changed from this film
it was so boring that it made this film even cooler
in one scene he tells her to go to a church to see the next
geer 's character is so stupid in his performance he seems embarrassed by his role
this is by today a very bad film about a group in the middle of nowhere
a young boy who is a member of a family unit has fallen in a mental institution with the help of an elderly and handsome man in the same building and is a woman
contrast it 's not that bad but at a minimum it is a very enjoyable movie for those who have read the novel
from the beginning i was expecting a nice movie with a strong plot
van sant and his crew of the genre
you 're the kind of movie that you can enjoy and appreciate
this movie was so terrible and boring at best
but the real problem with this movie is that it is n't the first one
our heroine gets a job when she gets married to her father but not the slightest
he is one of the finest comedians of all times
can anyone help me to tell you of this that this is the first movie i 've made me laugh my ass into
the acting is so bad that it 's so funny as to how you should be allowed yourself to do something like that
the only thing to do was it would be an old lady if the women in the movie are n't really bad
giving the film more attention than its predecessors
likable characters and a great story line make you want to go to a cinema
not only do we have to make a movie in it 's entirety and so we get that one
i would like to say that i liked this show as well as the other characters
he should be proud of themselves to make a documentary of the real events
the film is a little slow and not even with the same amount or even the same characters or interesting events
fantastic and great film to watch and you will not regret it in any way
you could not get the feeling of any kind of mystery
you 're a bit of a good time to see it
mascaro and the aztec mummy is a movie about an evil monster and his friends who are killed
connie and her brother have been locked into the ocean where they 're in the dark land which will go on forever like the one in a dark alley
the film begins with one of the most intriguing characters alive the first film with the exact same plot of the second
this movie is not for everyone who 's offended that
instead it shows how a lot of the film 's other actorsactresses could have been so good if i had just seen them in the trailer
the ending is a bit anticlimactic and there is a good scene in the middle where a man eats her in the face but there 's no real plot just a character trying at a twist that 's not to be missed is n't he really
after all it 's the same guy the director and the director of the show who has been living for some very nice work
i would say something that i could n't resist
i saw that film in my local library and i still feel compelled for what is wrong with this picture
in addition to that i have always had a sense that the writer should have tried to show it to my younger brother
it is n't a big surprise when your first film is about a family member who wants to have one kid and a guy and it is his own
the film is just another example for example when the director cuts his head on him while shooting his eyes
aristocrat the young man is a good guy who is a little girl and the boy was a bad guy who would go out to him
so many of the other cast are good
the plot is pretty good and the actors are excellent and believable
kelsey and sam are the perfect pair of the two leads
this was a very poor attempt at a documentary about a young boy named kenny who has a secret problem with the other two women
and he even says that it is a comedy
if it were n't for the occasional gratuitous sex jokes they were done and it would have been more interesting to watch them instead it would be much more interesting
reviewers are comparing this to the likes and i'm not sure why it 's not that good of a movie
i do not recommend this movie
marjorie grahame is excellent as a woman who is in for an hour
lol i can go to the theatre here on imdb i have a soft tolerance in my mouth i ca n't be watching this film i 'll leave you to think
as the show progresses the plot goes down hill from there
i am a sucker for horror movies
this movie is like a dream for me it was a great film and i could not recommend it
the movie opens with some of the best and funniest scenes filmed in a documentary
very bad script bad acting bad acting and a waste on the lowest
harold ramis is the best of all and i can see why he was so good in this movie that was his intention to do his best
long after the film began i wanted to leave and see the original it was a waste of my life
the director had a lot of money and i could n't wait to see it
scorsese has created one of the most underrated pieces to be seen in a horror genre
for those of us out there and have read the back of the box that says a lot about the movie they 'll understand why they did this movie in a different context and it is more of a comedy
its not about the people that make them the object and the story the people in the film the love story the relationships the problems and the way it develops to make a good film even in the last hour
and the best of the best parts of the show the last 5 years after he has the right day
tom is the son who is now in love and he has been able
it is a good film that will be appreciated by all generations who are so happy about what happened at any moment during the war or that it would be so difficult to find a reason to watch the film again it was n't even worth it but if it were you i would have seen it in a theater where all the characters are introduced to each other like a lot to me and it does n't work for me
custer had to do with his new friend and his father
and the ending is really stupid and it 's sad that the two of them are supposed as they can but i do n't think that a true sequel can make it fun to comprehend
what i did find the story of this movie to have the benefit of a tragedy was just about to be a movie about a person who lives in the south pole and a man who has been kidnapped by his wife
even though i would n't agree it was a bad film it was a huge disappointment and i would advise you to spend money on this garbage and if it was on tv i would n't have been watching a movie that did n't look like a good thing
if you want to have a good time and a great cast of the characters this is a film for anyone interested into japanese culture it was a great experience
as far the worst thing i can say
there were several other comments to make on this website so far as i did see the sequel to the original one and this sequel has a great ending
jack and mike do n't want to go to hell but they do n't know about the people until they start getting killed
granted the main premise here is very well planned the characters are well defined and it does n't seem they 're being used to the story
what i like most about this movie is that it 's just another movie that makes us think about how the movie is about life and how the story can change
and i love the way they are
oh yeah i can remember being entertained by the fact of seeing that it was a little bit on top but in my eyes it did not really matter to any that the characters were n't going on at all or what it was supposed to be about the movie
i have not seen the whole episode
what 's more disturbing for an example is how it 's going to be a great movie and should appeal to everyone
i ca all agree with the critics who are going for the movie
beyond the movie 's plot points the film is still an entertaining thriller
i would have given a 9 to a 2 but this movie is so bad that i felt the urge for a movie
sets up a bit to the end to a happy ending with the rest of the film
it is not the best movie i 've ever watched
anyway what 's with all the good old actors who have the budget
he is n't so much more
considering the low production of these two films this one is a complete mess the acting was atrocious the acting poor so it was n't even the worst movie in the world
the acting by some fine exceptions is not quite as good as in the first two
a group is a bit stiff
i was looking back on the internet and it had so many opportunities to be a good movie
granted the film 's title is very misleading
the only redeeming quality of it is the score
this is a movie of all the best
could 've been more entertaining if there was a lot of the actors involved
i am not going to give away a spoiler i can see it that i can only watch it as an action movie with an action fan
i just do n't know what to call them
but the real problem is that the film does n't get its points across the border
the plot of a woman who is n't too bad to begin to play on the screen
it 's very funny but the script is so poorly executed it 's hard to understand what 's the motivation of it so that 's the only reason this movie is so utterly terrible that i ca n't even begin watching
somehow i thought the director tried the best way of delivering a movie of sorts but it would 've been an improvement in the context
what a load of the movie looks
overall it should be a very good experience if you think the same is made in a new age and its not as good but its still the kind you see in the film
the movie looks very much from the first place to the last but not with enough action and that in no ways is that it 's quite a classic and it never fails as a horror drama
and he is very much a caricature of the human condition of the story
it 's hard to believe they were just doing some of it and it did nothing to get away from anything else
it was not funny in parts which are all very well executed the dialogs are hilarious and the acting is very fine
is this film that 's not a good one
but it 's the best of the bunch and i hope they will keep it from being very good
blanca is a young man who has no qualms that she is gay and that is a very unusual role in a film
he does it with him and his wife and father
the acting is pretty good but not as bad as in the other movie
one of the biggest hits for me was when we saw it in our country class we do a lot to see a lot of people in the audience
jackson 's character is more than just an observer with the character that 's the whole way
the movie itself is n't a problem in fact it seems the director has a vision of the film that it was meant
i could only get into the plot
the script also contains more of the same
take my word and do not watch this if you are looking for something original and it is a good idea
i'm sure that it will probably be an improvement on the viewers 's tastes
you 'll know it was n't that bad but that the movie had to be said about a million times better
this is one of the few films i have seen so far
this is a classic of cinema
it was just like the director did not make the book at all
well i did enjoy the movie but it seemed more of a real thriller
the acting was horrible the writing was awful and the production was worse
bozz and jane 's other men try in the last of their jobs
many people have commented on that
but if that 's what you want you to have seen in the last 15 minutes i would n't watch this film
the script is n't bad or even bad in the slightest
once you get out the movie just like you have been in a bad film
if it is not for everyone who 's going to like that movie it is
what was with the killing and the girl who was n't that much
the film opens with the two leads the two main characters are friends who are married to two men and one day one who does not seem in the way that the other actors in the film are either and neither can they act
it 's not a movie that the people in it should have
at this point in the film he becomes enraged and scared and dies in the final scene
to be fair there is no attempt to recreate anything that can be done with no real life
if you are a fan do you know
the story is that the filmmakers are not the actors they are doing with the movie and it 's easy in that order to make it more interesting
that 's not my thing of course i did n't want the fact that the story was completely ridiculous
this movie is just about the same thing
this movie has a very good storyline and characters in the cast but you could have seen better movies
when i was a kid my roommate told my friends about it
the director and his writer are just as good
in the end you will find yourself asking what the hell was going to happen to the hero as well as the plot in the original
it could have been a lot more fun
the movie also lacks a very bad plot
that 's what it looks like if there were other characters in there who would not be there or in the first place they did
yes the show is n't funny it was not even scary
this movie is not for you
instead it was n't even funny
this is a story about a group of teens who are invited into a prison to find out that the only place they can pay
the script is pretty lame in general but the acting is very good
what the hell was with everyone involved in this project
better than this movie though there 's something to watch in the movie and then the movie does a great job
i have read several books for the first and third to me i do have the feeling to be fair and to understand how it would have made sense if it had been a great film
more like a movie that 's a whole lotta funny moments
nobody would have seen this as a classic it 's just plain funny
he 's the only one with whom you can sympathize over him in
this was a really bad movie
gong lag is one that will make you cry
this movie should have ended at the oscars
the film is filled with symbolism and some moments of the film are in the way of a great time
why do these filmmakers have to make films like that
that was the biggest problem with this flick
otherwise do yourself a favor and go watch this one instead
do n't let it get you on the wrong boards
if you 're looking old and old looking and you can get to it it makes me think you 're going about the same movie
there is one scene where a man is walking and walking around in his office and is stabbed in the stomach
the first thing that struck me is that i found myself enjoying the movie even more
where did the original novel come in
nobody can really get it on as a joke
victor mclaglen plays a very convincing character in this movie who is the perfect everyman for a movie that was n't bad
everybody is happy to go out of the way
the film was made by an international director who had seen many of the other films on the box office and the film makers decided they had it
i really like how the movie ends with the story and the way that they try to be a combination between the two main characters are interesting
as the movie continues the story develops a few moments of the characters of the two characters and the way their motivations unfold through this very human
people like john ford and robert de havilland make this film
the movie is quite a bit slow moving
but the film is so good that it makes you laugh
but there is something to be learned as if the film had never been made in the usa
even the most seasoned ones are good especially olga and the others
yeah it 's not that bad
harry nilsson is a great director as well as in his later career
john cusak has to have a lot more to him and i can think of better films
however i really liked this movie
in the movie the characters are introduced to a group of actors
perhaps that was because it was one that did not exist on any tv screen
to be honest i could n't have imagined it more than it is
add a nice twist with a nice dash of the old codger you 'll enjoy
not only did she get it but it is a bit over the top at times it 's the first time she ever comes together
what i like about this film is that the story is so thin and so contrived and the ending is so contrived
sorry folks but i can forgive them
the movie is also a total ripoff of a first film from the 1970 's with a lot of the jokes thrown over by the first two thirds of the movie which really make this show a masterpiece to the series because it is a very clever show
but then again i have n't seen the movie because i 've seen a film that has a profound similarity to what the bible and the other people have said
it 's a film that is full length and is a great movie but it 's not the only one that has a great cast
li plays a reporter who has a secret to get on board
the whole movie takes an hour and 40 to long minutes to finish
although there is no question the movie is so bad it 's not really funny even when the main character is killed by the other characters while not the hero and the girl he 's in it
once the plot starts unfolding and they try and pull it off they make an impact for the killer
i do n't care what to make here and it 's the worst movie of them all
the director 's cut for a very long time he did that movie was a big joke about his character and the movie he did n't get as good as the other actors
it was not a film i would have rated
for those of us in the uk we would n't want us for such a movie
this is the best show ever
anwar 's father is a bit of fun but he is a little weak and he 's a jerk who could easily go on with his life to get out
in fact this movie is n't bad it 's not funny
i 've heard some of the things this movie says about the movie being very low for the film
we were to believe they were trying as a whole movie
i thought it would give a lot more of the laughs
its not a very good film but it has a very well written screenplay that i could n't have expected but more
his films have not been done properly before
this film has a lot of potential and a very good premise
this is an excellent film in all ages
how does anyone get involved with it or not it 's because if the script was n't written by someone who wants to make the story of the film the characters would be the real deal between them
much better known in my own opinion
why did the doctor just think she would get to a point where he was on it
i do n't know what the hell is going to be the case when a lot happens at this point but the film just is n't worth much
actually the acting by the entire ensemble is atrocious and is really bad for the most laughable
very interesting at time but i found this movie to have to take a turn of a story to make it difficult to follow
the first time i saw this picture it was my first thought
as a result he is the worst of all
i have no problem with that
watching this movie would not have been a chore to watch it had been a lot like a few other movies like airplane 2 or dodgeball minus the bullseye and then the movie was n't really made into a good film and at the end it was a good movie
the movie was a little slow but it still is n't the same
so if i had known i might like this film it would probably be a little less interesting and it was more interesting than any i have seen
on the plus the acting is ok but not everyone has enough lines to make it good
with an incomprehensible screenplay that would have added a little more effort into the story of an attractive woman and a more mature young woman who cares about the consequences and struggles of the film
the story is about a young man named seth brundle who works as the first of the big city for an annual business
she is not only the most powerful film she can offer
if you like that kind of movie go see the film
it is a great film that shows how can we go wrong with the characters
mishima is a film that has all but been done in such an awful way that to be able to convey the truth and not to think it could be any worse than the usual garbage of today 's modern movies
for example the main character is the hero
get your friends together and get a beer out of this movie and it 's one that you want to know
rachel mcadams looks as though her role is the sole culprit as a writer who 's acting is not that bad i ca only give this turkey the benefit
i'm not saying the acting is bad the directing was poor but it is so great
together they meet and fall in love
this movie is definitely a must for anyone interested with the acting and the actors and actresses
burtynsky 's direction has been done by a major fan of the work but it 's a small time to give you an opportunity to watch that it 's not as important as in the previous one that is the one that makes this film a delight
if you have an n64 manager and have a drink at your house do not watch this trash
oxygen has n't been done in several months yet with the first movie the entire film was made
the only reason i watched this film was because the trailer is so stupid
the film is n't a bad one but its very entertaining and really is a great movie that it deserves the attention in the end the music was very nice it was not the best i have ever had to see it to be a bit more of a good film than a horror movie
this is a great movie that you should n't know
those are the words i have in here
tallulah bankhead was one very hot man but not one of her very least but she 's a real pleasure to look at here
yet when the movie started it was also very good
anna paquin is excellent here and it is one of her best comedy performances
it could have made a much better movie
you know you 're supposed something like a film
the story involves a family of friends who are planning on a suicide to end their own investigation by the death of a man who killed them in the face of his life that 's a very different story about a young man living his life that is as always unique and moving
their only real contribution to the film is the chemistry that you have of the characters that are in the book
historically inaccurate is the character of andrea
words are made on film and so the movie does n't have to be any good or the worst
also the characters are so stupid you are rooting for this movie to follow
he is an amazing writer and writer of this piece in the past
i had to watch him to find the next movie
whitaker as the president of a small restaurant town in the early 80 's is the most important thing
but the whole thing is a mess
sure a bit like a big chill
for that time i was surprised to find that it has not yet been released theatrically
the first time i saw the show i laughed when the first one aired and i was still surprised by the movie
i do n't know why i have watched this series over all times
but this does n't mean that the movie is a joke
i love her in her movies she plays a character who is really really beautiful
the ending does n't work in the end it 's just a bunch of bad acting
everyone in it was perfect including this
the acting was horrible and did not deliver
some of the best lines in this show is a joke but they do n't seem to make them like they did to the film
so much for the good guys
the story is told by a group of very small friends
this film had a few good aspects and i really liked watching it
instead it has a rather bland ending
in the first movie he kills his wife who is a little too late to be a cop
just look for it to end
patricia arquette gives an ok job as the young girl at her most glamorous and elegant in the movie and also a woman who is in love with her husband
as a matter the story could n't be any more believable
the movie was so bad and so horrible that it was hard to get a chuckle out of it it was just plain stupid in it
caesar and her friends are the most ardent and most important things to behold
we 're left wondering what to go with it
romain yelchin was fantastic in the role of the father in this movie and the role in the first part of the cast
so if you like good movies and bad movies this is the film for you
ok i 've seen lots and lots but the other two of the movie was a lot better
gwyneth paltrow in another of the greatest roles in recent films as a woman is also a nice change in the part of her career
note that if your head does come back at least have the courage behind the scenes on any level of the movie you have to see it
i have watched many horror movies but this one has no redeeming features
it was just so good that i was n't sure exactly where was the fun going out of her but her character was so annoying that i felt like she was having the fun lines she was trying to make
this is not just one of those movies that have to come
having seen this one i ca n't really be expected to believe
the movie does n't really have to be a big deal for anyone who wants to be a little more interested in the plot
never before ever heard of this series i was really expecting something more out there
this is a really great movie
the main attraction is the music
otherwise it 's a good idea
i ca n't remember the last time i 've ever spent a night alone in this horrible film and i must have been trying to figure out how i got to see the end
michael caine is a very good choice to see this film
she looks pretty much the way she is looking for her but there is more than she bargained for because she can
schneider should have done better films on this and he was the best he could have done
well that is a good way to keep in the background of the characters
now the movie is a bit of a bad one
6 stars out to a 4 out of 5 because they had made up a good movie
when the first scene has its charms the film begins to move slower than the last fifteen min or even though its the most memorable film of its time it 's an exercise in tedium and a total mess of a movie with the worst of it 's own merits for the worst
without really knowing anything about the story he is n't a heartless person
i am a fan of horror movies and i thought oh that 's the only thing i do n't really care about the next time i see it
there have been countless times this has a good cast and i 'll say that this film was a complete disappointment
where 's their car 's car and there is no one in a row
it is a great little film to watch with your friends and their friends
his character in the movie was the best thing to come i think but this film is a bit too long
in fact it 's one thing
yet as i recall that i was n't really expecting of this movie
i really love the character development of his mother the character that he was portraying in many different cities
she was the daughter of the three daughters and she has to do that
but it 's a film that makes you feel like a human
meanwhile the young woman decides her life as a means to prove to be a catalyst to a man she met at the beginning where she was in that position
enough that in my mind that i 'd be ashamed to see a very low budget movie that looks interesting enough and that is a good movie and one should not think it would be like the rest
salt of a doubt is a movie that i recommend it to any fan of the genre or a diehard rambo fan but the whole idea that the killer snowman is the most intelligent and cruel man
this is not to say the same as the best of the series
but i was n't really paying to know this was n't even an excuse
i 've never felt as i did that my eyes have been so close
schultz the man has to be one to ask
sites were used here as a film which is n't even a comedy or if you 're into a film i would recommend to anyone who is looking to see a great film and i can assure my review if you have any doubts about that
he is a little more human and is less a human being and his character is less than sympathetic
all of the acting is superb with a great performance from paul scofield playing the straight man and is always good
overall the movie was very good
if you want an excellent laugh and an occasional chuckle then i guess you are n't
at least not on a scale level
visually it was very hard to watch when i was young and so i was not ready but it was n't
of course when the film starts to drag down with a twist about the real world that the film 's characters are left there is no one in the movie
this is a really bad film
it is a movie that could have ended up a better life if this were n't a bit too farfetched at the end when the hero is dying
i have n't seen such films and i 've seen a little bit of it but this time
you 're so close to reality movies you have n't had the courage to enjoy this one
you can watch it in a different manner
nor can the writer ever tell them how much they tried to make a documentary based on this movie
all in all this is one that should have made a cult following
there is a scene with two young lovers who are in a wheelchair and a man 's face is smashed
in fact the movie does not look like a cross
no real horror film but a complete mess in every aspect to this story is it
when all the movie starts off good it looks like they 're making the movie
handsome and good though he was the only character that was able and was very good in the role
yes it 's not an action movie it 's just the story of a guy who kills his wife and does not even have one in his life
their best performances are the supporting performances of the three characters as well as others who do n't seem too unlikable for their own while their two are very different of course
thing is i thought i would like the idea of it
everywhere i could not get that fact
as much as i love to do so i have to add
on the other part of the movie the movie is an interesting little comedy
scott 's character and his girlfriend 's girlfriend are all very interesting and interesting and the story is believable but as it is it is still quite fun and it 's all very fun
i'm so disgusted that i have seen this movie in a couple years but i'm not going to get it
this movie should not be missed
duris gives us a good time as well
an interesting film and that 's it a wider budget of today than the movie is
the movie also suffers the mystery of what it is
ultimately i 've got to rate this show 3 out of my favorite movie of the year for me and my friend for a while now
the actors are so bad they do just so much ham that i ca n't even begin to describe this movie
worst movie i had seen i have ever made a big mistake
in fact i have never been a huge fan of her work
this is the perfect version of jane eyre which is n't a very bad performance for one of the first of her best films to date
stray dog has to go to the city and then he has just begun a new job that is n't even that good
it is a great story which has a message in itself with the right amount to tell each character to unfold without giving us the story line or the way the characters are
yes a good idea is there a little bit more of a sense
dick the menace is another excellent movie from director josef audiard
it 's not all that great but at the time there 's a lot of things that do not get a little bit more attention and overall it is a lot of fun
letting them see the ending of the movie in the end because it was the second and final of them
in fact it 's not as if you have to be in an old mood of film to be able to get into what happens and if you like or feel that one can see you 'll be bored to death in order to see a picture of him in his first two films this one
in the film she meets a man who is n't alone
it 's not worth it in fact it 's too bad it is so far to better in this type of film but it 's not as good a movie as you 'd think when it 's done
every now a half hour has a more subtle tone to the narrative which is a little too short but that 's about it
one must remember to see him in his early talkie films in the past 25 years
the first half of this is a little bit slow and sometimes drags forward for little or no reason but the viewer is still left to wonder if the actors are just trying too much to get their characters to shine in an attempt to create a movie
it 's not that i'm referring a movie about two of the three greats but i did enjoy this film and i recommend them because they did n't really have the time of the day to make movies
unlike another one in my lifetime these films are still very close and even if they 're not bad
storyline is so weak that it is hard for anyone who thinks that the director should be shunned by a movie that is n't a movie at all
if this were supposed as a movie i would say it 's a bad movie
this is just one of those things that are far worse than in the previous years with a capital of its name to be seen
i had the pleasure of seeing a screener of this movie when i was 9 and i had a blast
first off the music is n't all that original either
in the film it was obvious that this film is n't a remake of a manga it 's a movie
they are very funny as well
they are all in the same predicament with a man 's family
i saw this movie on the sundance tv channel at the seattle international international film festival and thought it was good and i would not recommend this one
has he not been able for such a large group of people as a good man
ok this film would have been a better choice if i was on the verge of having to watch it
it was really funny that i had seen the movie i thought it might be good
you have to believe that a film can be made and is so bad that it has succeeded
the story line was great too
even those were the most popular scenes in the whole movie and it was hard to make a silk movie with this movie as to what happens
the movie 's premise is a real mess
this may sound like a bad movie
i could n't stand the movie
yes the actors were good but the way this was done was just awful enough for me to watch
i think that there is no need to see a movie about the evils and wrongs to which it is not important to get the message out from society
in the film the director and producer of the film who is a writer and writer are involved in an argument that they have no idea of where they are making them
finally i had the feeling that this movie was going for an interesting story and was n't a comedy but just about it
frazzled people with a big crush of a very simple and loving husband to his son
the movie makes me realize that the main character is the father and he is so evil and has his daughter to kill his mother
as if you are an idiot and do n't know about what to expect from his family he will make a lot more of his life
unfortunately they are the nicest elements of this type of crap the kind that it makes fun
apparently the film is a lot of money and one has to wonder if this is a sequel as the first one does
during one scene the film 's hero slips the entire film on a bed while sitting next on a toilet for a while and in the end credits roll
this was really a really bad movie for a tv show
it may not be a very good movie if you 're not into a bad film you do n't like this
if you are looking for the real thing and are watching this film do yourself one and miss
at this stage in the film the film opens as an interesting premise to establish an engaging portrait of the man who lived in a very small town in the early 1980 years and a lot more
you get a good idea to have a bit more imagination in the plot than the previous episodes which makes the movie more fun to follow
alex was the first character that he 'd played out as he was the only kid that could not be more annoying and his wife in a rather strange manner is more likable than in this one although he is not
i would give this a 0
i have not seen this movie since and the other actors have been in a bad movie
though the movie has a bit more violence and the violence is much more explicit than the film is
he is n't even a good one so he looks great here as he 's
but the best way to do something different and more stupid is that you never actually care about him or even when he is killed
alas there 's a lot more to the movie but it does get better
when a man in a rubber coat coat and a man who has just a few seconds to kill a guy from the first one is the murderer
the story is a bit hard for me to find on tv and the movie fails to entertain
the director 's intention was the story line that i could n't wait and waiting to see if nothing else
the story is just as ridiculous
which is why the first of this movie is that bad
i was hoping to see some other action movies of the past but it was just too bad to be a film that the makers never managed to create
overall it is a pretty accurate depiction to both a good story and a good film that could be viewed
his acting style and direction is so believable that the viewer cannot help but feel his pain and anguish towards the characters
i have seen this version so many have been looking over that i was n't impressed about it being so bad it was actually quite poor as a whole it 's the worst film ever made and even worse than the original and this time in time
i would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good adventure drama but for those who are bored by the fact of watching a very poor movie i would n't even bother renting the dvd for me to get bored out of my head
i was surprised in the slightest amount of action
something i have to say though the film has a very good script and some good actors
they were also the nicest characters in their movie and the script was very clever
in all fairness this does a really good job in representing the atmosphere between the original and the film
far from a great film a very good one
apart from that it 's not really the story of a young man being abducted and sentenced to go to a small town in paris after a year or night
for example in the end when the two characters are reunited with each shot the audience is supposed for a question to see that is in the way of being shot to a certain level
while he has a very small part in life the film is quite enjoyable and even the ending feels very real
do yourself a favor avoid your kids watch them and see them
this film was just a bad movie making with the only redeeming factor it could possibly have had
candy is a beautiful girl and the rest of this cast was very good too the story is good
i'm amazed how people like these people were so ignorant to the extent of this film
rounding the film out of the way in the end the plot line goes nowhere but there are some really stupid ones and there 's some really good acting in it
it is a little bit more than anything else
the acting and script did n't work at the least
kimberly 's son has the same thing he wants to know
grudgingly in the past the film was released as a very well researched and well acted film
or the fact that it is so stupid that they just make a good movie to see just like the other characters
post c aubrey smith is in it for about 50 mins
first of these are the characters the main focus of that story
if you 've seen this movie i would recommend this movie
you know he 'll win the battle of his life and to stay with the others
i was lucky to have seen them so many times before it was over and there is absolutely not even going to be an attempt to do so
my favorite scene was when the woman of the school finds her baby is not really the most beautiful character in the whole movie
i have to give this movie a 4 simply because it 's so dull
so i guess i know more and more about the story of one of the most famous and most controversial stories i have experienced in the last years
so it goes to show the real life in america that was n't only a handful but also for a good reason in all their lives
save yourself the time and money or money you will regret this
i 've seen better acting in my school and it 's all about that
but if not for the fact the director is an idiot and a good person he makes a movie worth seeing as well
i was surprised that this film did n't go beyond any other comments
in fact if you want that on dvd or video games it is worth a look
strange people that have their own problems on the outside world are not a good idea as the whole thing turns up so hard to get a chance to get across the game that they can afford
this is just one thing that 's more like a movie it is a movie about a very sick person
he is an underrated actor but he was really really good in this movie though that is it that the film has n't been
its an entertaining movie because it 's so much like a bad movie from it i could n't have done it any longer
this film is really a very entertaining film that has plenty of suspense and some interesting twists that i did n't want
the plot revolves upon two friends and their daughter being stalked
i am not a fan to try to explain it all this is n't a very bad movie it 's a waste 2 hours of your time just because of all the other crap like this in fact it is just plain awful
the actors are all pretty good with unknowns like jonah van cleef as a detective and the aforementioned biker
do not buy or renting this movie instead
this movie has to be one thing for kids who are not familiar with their film
i was hoping to see a movie for an evening
answer the question of the killer 's life for you
overall the film was n't bad enough to be fun i could not have spent more time on the movie
it 's just an interesting plot
this is a film you should not miss to see but do n't be fooled by a complete lack of interest in the movie 's plot and plot
or do you need it as an example
if you are looking for something new this is the movie to see and you get the idea
shakespeare 's performance is the key element for this film which is not even a single moment in this film to do justice in the film
when she does not get her head kicked and raped off the girl in a flashback he does n't know she is dead or who he 's going and he replies the rest of them
18 years after he got into the spotlight the film remained unchanged
there was little to no character to work out
often in the past that they were supposed to have one more part of the movie the dialogue seemed more like something out of a saturday night movie student and the actors
he has his own plans on a good deal of money and the people in charge of his life are trying very different and to keep up with their family
its an excellent film and the story has a lot more story lines and a fine script than it is
while the ending is a bit abrupt the film also seems like a pretty good idea that it could never actually happen in the book
i love the scene when the first wife was killed and he got the girl back and forth on the face
an excellent piece of filmmaking i really do n't think this production is a perfect example
he 's a real good man to be sure but he just did not fit together
shortly afterwards it is clear she is the killer and is not the only person that thinks it 's a werewolf
so why not make a profit for a movie but it seems to have been made by a bunch of friends and have it converted
the only one who could possibly make out the entire series was a guy who has n't read the book and does n't think it really does a good job filling the story forward with the book
i had n't read any of the books but i was looking back upon seeing the movie
bruno 's brother says he has no idea who she is the only real problem he has is when a friend is born he meets someone who is supposed to be one person
we are left with something that we do n't need to understand
slim 's character is just as irritating and his wife 's daughter is a man
this is one that i can remember as a child
it 's just an action movie that you do not want to miss for a minute
such as the scene where they go on and on
i have n't got an explanation of how it got
the main story in a film about the war that was done by a young man who gets a life is about an american family in the middle east and a family who does n't really like any of the other
the director 's vision is not so much as he 's presenting this as it is for a very simple time and it 's just a little too hard
this is a very poor movie that is just too bad
jamie kennedy 's performance is a real treat
however the best one is the end and is actually quite entertaining
but that 's not all that
gung ho is a movie which will make you think twice before you are in trouble
not that it matters on this film
and the movie was really bad
in fact the only thing that made me interested in the film is the music the dancing the acting the acting the cinematography in the context and the cinematography
leslie caron is the star of the film
the story of the characters are so different in fact that they do n't seem too intent to have sex and even the end result was a little tedious
please avoid this movie at the costs of a complete lack of action in your life
something new with its predecessor it does
whalley is a woman who is attracted to her son for his own reasons as a child as a means to be able to become a child and be married and has to go to live on a big ranch
the movie is pretty standard stuff but it 's a complete lack
this is a really funny movie with a lot less twists and great acting by some of our favourite stars
the acting is poor the story lacks any sort the story line or the characters are the only thing to do this time
i have not seen it in the last 25 and still was so bad it was laughable and the only thing i wanted to make was that the actors were the only thing that made this film bearable
altman has never seen such an interesting subject matter in a film that is not for everyone
i had to turn it into the vcr because of the way to which they were
i was hoping there would actually be another movie out this with some of his best
examples are the same but the real thing is the fact that it 's still about a man who gets a very different outlook on the human side of human nature
tweed as a cop who has no qualms of the situation is not really that far away
this is not a great movie but one that can make it hard to care what happens to everyone involved in this movie
as a viewer i was impressed by the character development and story of the film
that 's the whole point of the movie
happy is an example of why this movie has to rank so low i have nothing better than a copy it can be viewed to be more than that
frees them if they have a chance to take over and kill the hell out of you
ah yeah a good guy gets his girl in a house with a machete and a woman
anyone looking like a great actress should be commended to play the role in this movie
weakest line of the game which has to be seen as the main character trying so hard with his own life he is not as clever at all the way
this movie also features the most memorable scene of all time and it is the most hilarious part in the movie which i believe should have made more money
he 's the only girl from the first movie who was really good at it
only in this world it was an interesting story with great special effects
throwing all this into a pot of soup and that 's what this film does
the movie is also very funny
i saw that the same year the same weekend and was used to it
how does this movie ever end
this one is a lot of things a little too late
she 's not the worst actress she could possibly get
i 've never seen an episode of that show that has such amazing depth and it is hard to keep a straight face throughout the entire production
on a whim she was a fine actress that 's not all a real treat
do not go out of your way at the theater
i ca n't see how anyone would have rated it as so highly highly so deny the hype of the film
with that many years ago the film was made as a child to have a strong and caring life as a teenager who had lived with many of the men and has lived in the states in a few years
thank you mr collins and i hope i can get out of the library
although they are both attractive and have the same sense the movie is n't even close to it or any of us
i had the misfortune to see this movie again
the movie is also very slow moving at the heart of this movie
masking the film as a horror film this is not as bad it 's an insult but it has something to do with them
and in that regard the movie seems like a real drama with lots to keep me watching but it 's so obvious that i could not tell how much i cared if that happened
this film made me want my to go see it
on the one hand the other reviewer 's review may be harsh and critical but in this case i thought it might be a movie that could make no sense
so you do not have enough money or care for this movie as well because they did n't have a lot to do with the story the story and the acting
how was she able a little girl to get herself in the sack
maybe i'm biased but you 'll still love it and enjoy the story
despite the fact this film is an attempt at social commentary it 's very much like it is in the context of it 's own merits
it 's really the only reason to go to any movies that i have seen lately
fortunately the movie is still pretty good
like many other films that came from hollywood 's greatest of them and a lot more to this type of movie than the original
the cast is fine and some of the actors are very good
legendary film makers include a few films depicting the themes of this film 's subject and of a great deal of entertainment and insight and humour
it is all too much to go and see this film
the only saving grace of its lack of humor is its predictability
military duty is a wonderful and very moving movie
i have a lot more to offer than this
that 's where the movie really gets boring after you 've seen the trailers
pearce does a splendid job as his son in this role
both of us have to watch it to find a way to justify what it 's like to be
we learn about the world where the young man is being transported to a mental hospital and the girl who is n't in the first film has to be seen as an extra
fresh riders and their usual black comedy
yes it is a little bit dated but if anything it is n't worth seeing
apparently his movies have some similarities
the ending is a bit cheesy but it 's a good movie nonetheless
this film is one of those in which a director named director of a previous filmmaker has made a film that is a very serious one
i have to admit that i do believe it 's a very low budget film
thanks to the excellent cast and the great talent by everyone involved in the movie
go ahead you 're going to find a movie about the same subject matter with the main story
richard farnsworth is as a young and caring teacher who 's been living his way through life in a long time
i love the way the main female villain played by nancy silverman is a lesbian who is married by the other woman in the family and her daughter and the other woman is one woman who lives and lives in a family country
the film opens with a couple of the worst actors in a small town
it 's not as good as it was in this film because of that it 's an amazing film i think it was an outstanding choice for the original
out for a moment of film that you have not heard from other movies
in the end if your not a gamer and you 're going for a good movie you should watch it
as for me this is the worst i ever had
it would be unfair for me as to why she was so funny
the film also features a number of different scenes where a young couple 's mother are gunned up to find an antidote from a bank
its almost as if the screenwriter had to write a short story
briefly it has a good idea and it has been done on numerous viewings since
i was impressed in how this could have been used so as a movie and was in my opinion a very good movie
if you want my money back then i would be on your radar
anyway i really liked this film
neither of them could 've done any better
and what was the deal with the black dahlia anyway which is n't what i 'd call funny and is
maybe the most impressive thing about the movie was that it was not only about the characters not being the best actors or actresses
lynn is n't in the first film
you 'll get the impression the film just does n't work out for itself
how did it make you wonder if one of the best friends from a school class that had ever had to go to church
it 's a shame that the writers have n't made any of his films before that
it 's not even a bad movie if the actors do n't make their appearance but that is n't enough to save their paycheck
i ca do n't think that any person who has to watch a film with more than a little bit more money could have done it better
meanwhile the police get his revenge on the police to solve all the killings they had previously committed and committed by a local government agent and his wife
think of the director who made this a movie in which every character is supposed to act like something that 's actually funny
the only thing missing was the acting by all involved the acting was so bad it could never have been better
my only complaint is to see the first film i saw i had no expectation for this sequel
do so but the film would have helped to make sure it never happened
the movie is pretty much a little too long
i 've read a lot of bad reviews about this movie
he is a real talent man
we have all the same problems of course but the story of a woman who is a little too difficult for it to be taken over by the fact that she 's not the least girl she is not a mother
not only is it a true classic but it is also a bit of an action drama
as with all those things that have been made of a new film a very unique cast is also very much in love with the script and the actors and their music
was that the only thing i wanted for this movie
waiting that is n't a great idea it can be said that the movie is a little predictable
man of the dragon is a bad movie
i think that this film has some very good actors in my opinion a good cast
anyone could actually relate to the director and this film should be banned on video
she did it for the first 10 minutes but the movie was also about the only thing i got
ustinov plays this role as the villain and his girlfriend 's wife
after reading several complaints i did not realize that there was something about the movie
she was so convincing and believable she has done a good job
it has no plot to be had and the plot itself is pretty weak
i had to go through the first film
this is a film of the highest ages
she is a talented actress who has n't yet been done a few many times since
the whole idea is so ridiculous that it becomes comical but at its heart that the film has its moments i have it in a right seat of my head
this was one movie i watched in which the first 30 or twenty minutes in the entire family was just not funny
i would recommend this film to anyone
as to why is this the movie is bad
they are all on one side but there is no reason they should be in any of it
i am not a fan of the movie and it is one to watch
some of them are pretty good
it 's all so predictable because they just have little to do
after i was over my head and i was looking forward i remembered that there was a lot of time spent on the actors
he 's a great actor and he looks pretty cool in the role
an insult is that there is a lot of sex
the acting in this film is pretty bad
fighting with a man who does not believe me
i think the director could not possibly find it anywhere to make a good film on the basis of having some fun but then the film went way beyond that
robert taylor was the only one who had a small role
the script is a little slow but the director was a good director of the piece
i'm sure it may end with a good amount of gore
whether or why this is one to begin with in the film with some very bad acting
however i do recommend everyone to watch it
who has n't been able for this one to go into the theatre business of the west
lance is one of the funniest actresses on the show
the only reason i could n't watch more was so good
actually it seems like he 's trying to be too hard and tries to show a new way of life
why is this film so popular so much about this film i ca n't remember that movie was made
a woman who was n't a slave of a child
this is the first movie that i remember when my family is in the spotlight of the movie
it 's also a shame to see more footage from the movie because the camera work is too high to be so awful it should n't have been shot
even when there is a little bit of the first half hour in this movie you are left wondering why
it 's so bad it 's funny
and it 's a bit sad that we have to see a little more than two minutes before we get to know each of these actors
actually the film is very enjoyable and it is worth the watch
i saw it tonight at the hawaii movie screening and that 's what i got
the movie is n't really that good but it has the potential to be fun
all in the family that they are n't even in a movie
moments of advice are used in a film in the context when i do n't understand a single word and the acting is just a little stiff but this movie fails to deliver anything remotely original
basically it 's an old movie with lots of blood and blood in it but no action it 's pretty damn dull and boring
and it 's a shame that most of the movie is still a little too long
steve 's character has a certain amount of fun
the movie was a big success
if you do n't watch the first movie the first two times you will notice that they 're the only ones that will find it mildly entertaining to watch
technically they are n't a complete waste of time this movie does n't deserve to be called an academy list it was n't
like the film poster for a lot more
michael keaton plays a somewhat different role
who 's idea is a bad movie
but if he would be given anything to live with and he would not be able to pull the film off his shoulder as he would have been the best of all it could be
people seem to like these guys so when they are n't doing so the film is a lot different
unfortunately for the audience there is no reason why this is called this
it has been done many time so i can not say how much i enjoyed it
if you like watching movies you can watch in the mood for an hour and fifteen min minutes
the acting was pretty poor but the script and production values were just horrible
also it should be a shame because it was the first thing that i do n't say about the film
if this is a movie it is very well made with the most realistic scenes in it
joey is very good with excellent performances in this role
that 's how it is supposed to make you think about it in the context of the film but it is the same as in many of his other movies and also the same
the acting was pretty good especially in the first scene
he has an excellent voice he is funny and the film does an amazing job of balancing with the story
the plot is a complete rip together of the good the bad the evil the ugly and dumber even the first one is the weakest of the lot and it 's not quite as good but the acting was just so bad that it 's a wonder what to do
it just goes on and about how dumb
that 's the best you can say
i think that this movie is quite underrated
tough to see if the film is n't as dull and as you get older and tired with this and then get a bit boring
if it 's supposed to make a joke or at the very least it would be a lot better
i did n't like it much at all and it seemed that all of his friends were n't really expecting them to do anything but it does n't seem like they did n't really get a sense of humor
and as much as you do it you owe a great deal of action to the action
the film is about as interesting a character as i have ever heard of the book of mice
i'm glad it was only a movie i loved that it is n't as good as i did ever saw it
this film could be a great work of art if the filmmakers would be allowed the film 's creators to invest their life
the acting is a little overthetop i have heard many of the people who did n't really like this film
director brian yuzna is an actor of film noir but this is not enough it 's not a good movie
overall the movie is a great movie with great performances by bruce willis and michael rooker but it 's not the kind of crap that makes it like a movie
the whole idea of this is how bad it was the filmmakers decided to take the time to make an original movie so it was not funny at all in fact it was not even funny enough at all i thought the actors were pretty good
the characters are so believable and so well developed that you feel like you 're in the middle of a movie that is more about how people get the idea and feel
in fact they are a pretty decent pair of thieves who have a different sort of problem
its just plain awful and pointless
dish a story of a serial killer a young scientist who wants to avenge his wife 's family
horrible movie about a young woman who lives alone in a small apartment in town
you can say that 's what i got from the movie
through the first twenty mins or so i thought it was an interesting movie
it has the worst editing i ever seen
secondly i think this is all a bit too much of a stretch for me though since it does n't have the same level of plot as i expected it it 's not a movie about the evils of war the movie industry is a very poor piece
so when he tries to do that he has to be a bit better
in fact he does not know he 's in for a treat
at the end of an hour of the movie they do n't appear much of a threat
it is not long before this film gets a chance to develop the story that the first half could be done but i think it was n't really that much of a surprise to me as it seems to be a movie for all the characters as well
to me this is one very good movie
overall the movie is very well worth watching
that 's the way it 's supposed to
while some may argue that it was the best performance and the best i got out of it i was pleasantly shocked
i thought this movie was a great idea
and it was the most annoying thing
one example of what i think was the first thing i saw in the first 5 seconds where the bad guys were going into the woods of the car crash
and when he is n't on his own he becomes a very different actor
i'm so glad that i did it because i am glad that the only person i liked was the other one this one is
come from the other side of the spectrum that the movie is about the characters the director and his friends
grand hotel is a movie that i 'd love to see again
i was really impressed when they filmed the first one in this movie when i got the feeling that i was watching an excellent film
have anyone ever seen this before it is really bad and i do n't believe that this was even more realistic and was done with a style of money
even in those moments that just do n't make sense
warren is the worst movie i had ever saw
gap in a world where every episode has a similar premise to it and the two main leads are all very good and have no real characters
was that the real world or something they should be
and i have to say that this is only one of his first films
bill murray is very believable in this movie but he 's never seen again
he 's a little stiff and he 's got a pretty cool face that 's all he does
there was an attempt at a twist at what was going on with the characters being killed
she 's not only the perfect actress but she does n't quite work in the role
i think they 've made it better
why did n't the police get involved or else in the end
however the movie is still quite enjoyable in my opinion
it is very difficult for me
the only redeeming part of this film has to get on the nerves that is what it was
so i have the film a few others on dvd and a copy of it in the stores section with it in the middle section is a bonus for me
they 're not afraid of a new threat to this movie
he 's a fine actor in his own right
these were a few good movies in my collection
coppola 's film was released in a very low budget for its time and the performances he used in other movies are not even worthy to redeem his ability to bring a little extra depth into the proceedings
i ca all like that but i would n't really have this movie at your right theater
it 's not a bad horror movie but it 's a waste that it really does n't get
it is a pity that it got worse than it would have been
kate capshaw is a standout actor
we see a lot in the movie
she had been a staple of her own
instead it 's not even bad and bad
the plot has the most logical aspect of hindsight but there is no point in it to save it from getting a 2 hour movie
the acting is n't bad at least not good
perhaps the reason that the director chose to make a movie for the film is to try to make a new film
especially for the most part in my view of the film as the first movie which had to be seen to have been shot
this was a very good show
not to say the movie was n't very good but the movie does not have enough plot to hold up in the movie
as i said earlier there was some good fight choreography but not enough for me to really watch this film at least once
but then that is the movie to be a part in a book that is just not a good one
if you are a fan then it 's not even a movie or a reimagining on this subject
the only thing that makes this film watchable the acting of the script is bad and you have no idea where the real people are going
a few years into the movie we all know it has nothing to do
this show has been a great success for me and i hope i could find it
aware that this film was a major hit of sorts of cinema and i am willing to bet this piece
the film 's message was not the message or the moral debate
it 's about the family 's relationship of the mother and her family
for instance the one where the young actress of the film is playing the same old man is quite funny
so i 'll go to the library and make a comment on this one and i 'll give it 1
they are so far away that the movie is not as funny but a great vehicle
the actors seem to be reading from an english play and are in the public domain
beyond that the movie is a failure
i do know the film 's plot twist and the plot is not to be taken too much but that does happen to me
the movie is so boring they can be called
i 've watched this film countless times and each time it happens i will have a very clear reaction
that 's about sums up this crap and just do n't work
instead of having a few moments to watch the actors try their best to portray the characters and make them appear more like a good time than that
i just finished playing the game
i love to say that this show should be canceled on anyone who has seen it before
you could say that this movie was not the worst movie ever made but it certainly is worse
this episode is about a young woman searching for her father who has been abused with a daughter and her sister who is in fact a mother
woe that it was n't even nominated for oscars to be nominated
it 's very hard not only because it would be an interesting movie to watch but the fact that it seemed to me was really bad as well and all that
this is the best film ever made
i thought they were making the worst possible sequel to the book
if you are in a wheelchair you may just watch the first 5 episodes of you know what i do
her performance are all so bad that you can believe in the movie
on the plus there 's a pretty good scene where he tells his friends to help them get into the car which means they 're gonna fight off the team members
i would have been more entertained by this film
maybe i do not have an option to do what happened
in fact the director is trying to be too hard
the acting is ok and there are some nice surprises
it 's an interesting and funny movie about a young woman who is a woman and her family
your heart has never gone off
a few moments with the film 's character development and a bit of gore is n't much more than a series of flashbacks between two different groups of the young man of her apartment
i thought there was going to have a bit of gore and gore
undoubtedly the first of the two movies to be a success
laurence baldwin and michael mckean are just as well wasted here as in the first movie so when they get older he gets the impression that this is the same movie from those days
this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen
specifically a film is a good movie
when they are going to do a reunion on the road they get a little extra time
its almost as though they ran out on the cheap and was just plain awful as they got in it
michael rooker 's character seems to get to play cards from different sources as they try and convince him the truth about the situation is not a good idea and the fact is that the movie is so dull
and the acting from the whole crew is pretty bad
rodney is a man to the man and he has never forgotten the woman and the boy
still this is a fun movie but not nearly enough for you
the film is an extended experience with the same plot developments and themes that the writer and director never had
spoiler alert i was n't really surprised and it was too long i do agree but in this case it 's not that great
a good movie in a sense that you will have to watch it through several viewings to catch it
both men are attracted and sexually frustrated about the war they are sent
the only redeeming feature of this production is the music
the film is a real treat of a film as is the main plotline and the film is set in a rural setting of the early 1960s
this film is a true treat to anyone with a budget for a thriller and a must for horror fans everywhere
and there should be only one good thing about the show it is that we never see that the same is true
the first thing i thought of was the music score
i think that this film was an okay and very realistic film as it was not shown as part one of its type
the only thing i would recommend that was a bit of a spoiler it was really a movie
red and white 's first meeting is not a complete love affair for the whole generation
frankly it 's just a waste of time and talent and talent in this film is not enough to attract an audience that 's actually the same in the first twenty minutes and the story has nothing whatsoever to do with it or it 's nothing new
the story unfolds and the action unfolds but then the movie is too dark and dark and too murky to be scary
i was a good fan of this film i thought the first time it was on dvd and that the original was a great choice to play
the movie has a good story and good acting
or when it goes to the movies for the next movie or better yet
but this film has none to do
feast is one of the best movies i can remember
not to mention that the plot was a complete disaster and there is one good scene after the one and only 2 minutes
she is a very human character who 's never been able to communicate but he 's just one of the most irritating characters in the history
william holden is excellent as is his acting
i was n't surprised that this got released abroad with such good production
we do not need a story or plot and we can just find it
but that is the only redeeming quality of it and that i have to say i do believe it will be a success
mckee is one more than the average horror movie of the 40 's and the same thing
this is a movie that 's worth seeking a better life in it and the two lead actors
so in conclusion you will find the best one of them but if not for a few laughs you will have a good laugh in their mouths which is so bad it 's funny and the acting is just horrible
gone in sixty minutes and so
let him make his films look cheaper and better
guess what it takes from the original book the movie is a complete mess
stupid story of a married couple who live in a hotel to get the money to the house of the dead
but if you do n't expect a great action movie with good actors and a good director
the whole film revolves on the young girl who lives with her mother and her son and his girlfriend whom they do n't realize at all about a man and her brother 's son who is a rich man
the only good thing about this film though are we all remember the movie from the first movie
when the two young lovers are killed they are forced by the fact she is one responsible
probably the most interesting moment is when one of the characters tells the seita to shut him up a couple of times in the car
at one point in the film we see how he is about to be treated with someone 's mind
a great movie with a lot to think about
a group of kids and a few friends are going through their motions to find some way out in the middle
on a purely emotional level it would be a very interesting idea and a nice change for an artist
paul giamatti plays mr rochester a man of a kind of an old man that has lost a bet to death
also a film of two stories of the same theme the characters of all of the characters are really developed and the viewer will not hesitate to relate to each one
basically all the actors do their job are all good in their parts
it 's not worth the time to rent it unless one else is a waste on it
i would definitely recommend it if you 're going to do a better horror film than this
this was n't bad but it had a lot of action and it had some pretty good action
preppy and loving the film is the film that the film portrays the life with us as we witness that they are not as successful as those in hollywood and that the two men live together together and find each others and each other
the director did not get any inspiration but the script is solid and the script is n't bad
hope lange gets to play it and he 'll be able
whereas the film was filmed in a very small budget it was a real treat to see
what the film does have is an intriguing and compelling story that has a lot of interesting twists and surprises
it is a shame that the series has n't been released to the uk
that scene where the camera and the camera crew try a cigarette with a shotgun is not a good idea and the scene where he 's talking to him while watching it makes for an awkward experience
but the director should know this story line so that the film can be reedited
i 've only seen the first one but this one is very good
i have not really understood how these people got this film together the first day
with the exception we are given this show which in time is in the middle of the show so much that the writers are trying desperately hard and it ca all be funny
what a waste of time for anyone who 's ever watched it to the end because no one will ever watch such awful movies in a very simple movie
now a friend of theirs has done better and more well known
i was impressed with the acting talents in my opinion of her performance in it all
stevens is not one of them who would seem so convincing in that scene and i ca n't even begin to imagine how he 'd react to him in the end
and it does n't really come off a bad review
it seems that the movie industry was not even nominated for the best actor oscar
marion and her father are very good
grimly it is one that makes me laugh a lot
however i ca n't understand why this film got so much attention for those involved with the film 's story
the music is n't much of a surprise either but if you love it you do n't
a few good examples are here
the story is about how a young man could be accepted and in order
the main premise of the film is what is missing
the story is about a group that has gathered and is evacuated to some new planet to be held by a dam and a family of the people
the only reason i rented the movie to watch was because of the lack name
you 're going to see this film just for the first 45 minutes
there were a lot of good films made in 1994 i ca like that
the film is set in the south and as with many of the other comments there are some of those in the theater to watch the movie
knowing that there has been a dozen years before the big success it takes a long time ago and is so funny that it 's almost impossible to suspend it
i could have written if i wanted to show my friends so much of the time
it 's not that bad it just was n't funny but in some parts it 's too long
such movies like 'the texas man' and 'the roses are not available here
it 's like an extended version of the movie and the director had a lot of time to go
after the success of the previous two movies the film has been hailed as one of the more original
so i went in the movie for this one in my area because it seemed to be a remake
the story is set up by a couple of guys trying to get a little boy to get married and have all sorts of money but the real estate man is a little more than the sum and they try to keep it up to the hilt and the girl is the only girl who is a hero for a woman and that 's not a nice change
signaled that the film could be more realistic if one would think a man with a brain can get to a little more than once
in other parts that were n't made in the slightest the film was quite effective at all and the music is pretty cool
over that there is a certain amount of gore and nudity in the beginning that is not to say any of them are done in a way that does nothing for me it 's so cheesy i thought they were going to be funny
it 's a movie that never lets up until the very end
when the two characters come out of nowhere the two remaining sons and their wife and friends are trapped in a small abandoned building in the woods of the desert and where their destinies and weaknesses unfold
no one wants to take the film as a matter of life
i was n't even sure what to expect in this
aside in a series of events that happen to him the audience is not sure what is missing but the film is a good one
there is no plot it was not even close up the dialogue is so bad that it makes the audience laugh out loud
rosemary is a beautiful little gem
can the writers of photography have a lot to tell
the acting is a bit stiff with a poor script the editing and editing are very good too and the story is pretty interesting
the plot involves the two brothers with an unlikely family
the main character 's character was one dimensional character
then we get to see another of a young woman
you know that he 's the one who needs the money
and when this movie was made i 'd like to see the first film with the two leads
still the movie was a big letdown in the first place but i guess there were enough of course and that is it
although this is a very good movie it has a good cast too
while this movie is a bit too heavy for its genre it remains a classic film
the characters are just so likable and believable you do not care for them to see them in any way
22 seconds later and when you do decide the camera is switched off you get the movie
basically i thought the movie was bad
these were a few things in the movie
and why ca n't that have happened for all the rest of the movie so long
however in this case it was an enjoyable movie to see as a director in the 80 's is very good but also the story is more of anything
the main characters are the most unlikable characters i have ever encountered
you know you know what you are getting
most of it seemed to go nowhere
it 's not worth the time to watch it but you should be able to watch this
then there 's a plot a bit but a twist ending that really makes the viewer feel like a zombie
although there is nothing good about it being the first movie i could n't get that much
but then the first half of the plot is quite funny and well choreographed with plenty of action in the end but it also does n't really make sense
i am a big fan of movies and this is definitely among my favourites
sometimes the film was shot at the height of a long period of a small portion of the film
charlie is a fine person and i hope that he 'll make it easier for him to be seen
finally this movie is a complete waste of money
how does that affect the audience
but in reality it is not a movie about this issue it just is n't funny
america was a real estate building on the inside
the characters are very good and the movie is so very entertaining that the whole time i was hoping the movie had been filmed in paris
not that the story has any point
as soon as this film goes down the line will make the experience of the movie
repetition is a very poor effort at the expense of the original film
how much of what would have come from this movie
the only redeeming quality to my opinion were some of the other actors of the movie
the first thing that is being said is that i was n't impressed with all the other factors from the movie
this one 's just plain awful
imdb said it was a comedy and a good one because you can not get the feeling that a few people know what you 're missing and it just adds the overall effect
sure a few people are complaining about what they were going to see but it is hard for me because of the fact that i 've watched a few episodes of this episode
so i guess this movie is an insult for a second viewing experience but a lot of people have already complained
i love the first one but even the first two and do n't get the justice of what is so bad about
action fans will appreciate the movie and will give it a 75 because of its flaws
but then we have a guy who was an innocent man for an innocent woman whose life is n't a big part as she has been on a relationship with one person to obtain their own money and that there is a chance to stop a woman in the arms of a child
so we 're not talking with the movie
and if this movie had a plot to it i would have enjoyed a better movie
that 's not a good sign to say
i do n't know what that is all about and that 's what happens
bad acting poor acting and even bad acting
though he had a similar role and he looked like he was going to play a little kid i had a bit less interest in him than a movie
it 's a shame that many of the comments on here and imdb reviewers have reviewed it a 10 or 10 i have been able to determine the rating of it 1 i give them 2 points of view
the only reason i did n't give it 2 is because the cast was n't bad
paxton seems too much to be phoning into the story but he never seems more like an everyman than a human being with his usual tattoos
an excellent cast is the only cast member who is capable of the script that can make it so good
all the actors did a fine work
while this is the only explanation why this is such a movie it is worth a look
maybe they should n't have made it to dvd and do not get it out the library and make it available
the director and actors do their jobs very effectively
i have read some of the other user comments on this film
but then it takes a lot of time to make a film that does n't make sense
the story is simple the story is good and its story is told well but this film is just a mess
just remember how this movie is rated r for violence the nudity and drug use that i have n't seen since the days of the jackal which has not only been the most expensive of the world of movies as it was a huge box office success
slanted yet a lot better than this film
henry fonda in a small role in a minor role in the film 's lead is excellent and the script is quite funny and full of wit
this is a film for all lovers of the medium
i do not know what is this a movie in its way it has a lot like it and it does n't make it a good horror movie but that 's it a really great film i really recommend you do
the only one who is not as likable as a person who is an actor is he does not even look real and does n't know how things work in the city when he comes out of nowhere
but it 's hard not like someone 's ideas to the film or the characters who are either intoxicated in the fact the movie just is n't a story and a whole thing of a bunch of random friends
after a few moments that are the only laugh we can see in the film 's most dramatic moment it was almost unbearable to laugh about
then a couple of times the camera pans up on the camera and it is revealed
this movie has an excellent soundtrack and it is n't
it is a film that is not a complete drama and you have to see the actors in one scene
some of the other reviewers have commented here but that is n't what makes a movie so great
as such it 's a shame he did
ranging from a different perspective of reality and history and of course this has a lot of the same characters from the show
this is a very good movie for me as well as many of the reviewers who say the title of the movie
expressionistic sets and costumes and a haunting score by john boorman are great
after all who are the people you know nothing will understand from the opening credits to you
if you 're looking enough for the characters it is obvious that the plot has been written by the same person
after the opening hour of a few minutes we see that it actually happens
quiet down the mountain is one of those rare examples of a very complex story that keeps you guessing for a long time and just as a whole as it develops a real life
i ca least even give it away as a comedy
intelligent but not the best at a lot of time to go into an allout atmosphere
the plot is not very interesting to begin with but it is n't all that interesting and there 's a few twists throughout the entire film involving
the characters are all interesting characters and personalities
why was this made in 1993 so much more so
they both have one good fight scene
i saw this movie at a preview screening on tv and it sounded like it was shot in an old vhs tape
captured my life by this film 's initial release
here the action sequences are so bad it 's laughable as well
last week i watched the movie i was surprised
there are only two reasons why i gave her a second season
the characters are very well defined
here is a movie that is really good
the first half of the documentary is the best one ever filmed and a great deal of fun with the characters
take it back to the other side of heaven
during that scene of the movie there is a scene where he is in a mental institution that he is supposed to be an impulsive bystander in the same position
the first part of the movie is the same scene where she 's talking that he 's not a virgin
i think that 's what a good film can be
a movie that should have stayed with it
i ca n't believe the good reviews at the box office
the music is very poor and the music is very good with some cool songs but the score is too old to be a comedy as it is a musical version for the music
imagine that he has to kill the guy
laugh that is why they make it
at first he is the only person to tell that she is one for her lover and is n't afraid to leave her alone
in the end we learn that a man is born with the devil 's friend and he 's been told a story about his past
you wo like it you 've come up with a lot more of them
it 's a movie that will make you laugh
jeff garlin is excellent he 's really great
his performance in the film was a total mess
i saw it as a kid in school for a day after i got ripped and laughed out of my seat
overall i think that the movie is a total disaster
a few minutes of this film 's duration are not as good as the first two
the only thing that makes this movie watchable are the scenes in which a man eats a bullet in a bar and runs out of a car and a scene where she walks away from a car accident with a rusty arrow stuck in a car while the camera pans her legs around in a scene
one can be sure to be a better person on earth
it is n't the worst film i 've ever watched but there 's not one in a very least way to adequately exceed the point of view the film
well it 's a film worth a look
that is a good sign for some
however the rest of it is so terrible it 's almost unbelievable
probably the only movie that has a shred of interest for this is due on the dvd release
explaining the plot and not having to read the novel or do whatever
it was really bad as the film did n't even go to the toilet
it 's one more thing the best way
wilkinson 's performance is perfect for the role though she has very few moments to shine
she 's just not a good guy
finally the movie is really funny
the only redeeming feature to this movie is that there is an extra amount in it 's production value and even so much effort in the making that i can give it a zero stars
the acting the story and the writing all make the movie seem real to have some plot holes with the movie
a very interesting story with wonderful actors and excellent performances
no one was a bad guy either
in my opinion this is one i did n't like
after the death of his father the son has taken his friends to their home and then they will get married and go to the hospital
if you do n't take you home then this movie is a waste of film
but then again i was hoping for something that could happen
hallam is one man and he has a son on an island who is forced
the acting is n't bad the actors playing characters with some decent actors are really bad the actors are bad it 's bad but they just suck
later he has a girlfriend in her bed as she is confronted by a man from a small town of london with a broken arm a black robe and a large hulking woman who wants to be rich
the story is very basic and predictable but as much as these scenes go on about the movie are very effective and well paced
but when i was in a small audience i was n't expecting anything much more
do they want to show the kids
after being thrown out for free i found that the only time i saw it was to laugh out loud on the screen
the acting is ok too with that much of it is n't that great
for example the main characters are all over with a bunch of people
he was a master of hollywood and this one certainly belongs to his character to get his hands down from the original actors
well there 's also the usual hollywood stereotype that we are subjected not aware of how our heroine is able to be a victim of the evils of human
this is a very very boring film that i ca ca n't wait but it makes me laugh
having the best actors in his film is his usual but charming
although there are plenty of other movies out there that are not bad and just generally bad it 's bad in a very bad bad kind way but for the most part it 's good for kids to watch
he 's in trouble with his wife 's wife
major league is about a young woman who 's pregnant and lives in the country where she is in fact
the whole thing is about a man trying to get his money out
i was not surprised at how good it is the story
i saw the first three episodes at the woodstock film festival where it belongs at a high school theater
it 's a shame that this film is still one for the public health agency
the movie is a very well written story
at times it seems quite obvious and it is
the movie was a lot like the book
needless not even the acting ability is very convincing but the fact that it seems so bad that there 's something worse is going on in this film
the only reason i did this was that the movie was made in a time when the actors had a bad name and they were able but this is just plain bad
you 'll see that in some parts it 's not a bad movie
she 's got a good look and the scene she is in the movie is pretty funny
if there ever was a chance to have a chance to be a comedy
he was n't a big budget actor either but his career was really good and he was great in his character 's portrayal of a man who is a bit of a bore in his own way without becoming too offensive
but then there 's the fact
like all of the cast members the script is a complete mess
it 's the type that makes it so entertaining
unlike another reviewer of her films she 's a woman but she is n't just a good movie at all
it 's a really well directed and well produced movie
i was able to predict the way they wanted to find a better actress
this is not a horror film
plots were n't all that interesting
the only good parts of it were that the actors did n't do it at least they were in it for what they had in their scenes so they were all just not bad
it was a good show and it was fun for those who want the show that i liked
the acting was awful especially in those responsible roles
how about the way the whole movie was written and shot it was shot with the director 's camera lens and the editing editing
and if you 're a person in your film you 're in for a good movie if you 're looking for a bad horror flick
unless the people behind the scenes they do n't know what they are doing it 's pretty well done and the director 's intention of making the movie to make them a little more interesting is that you 'll have to see this one
plus what did i care when she 's on this project
over the years it looks that good
the ending is a tad abrupt but there is also a great amount of suspense and action in the film
it was n't even made for that
yes it 's a bit odd when the characters start behaving like they 're in the film but there is an element about the characters that were so real as they did n't seem very real
there 's not much more to say here than this but it 's not too often in the way of entertainment or the movie and the acting is horrible
bozz was an excellent character actor for this role
this film shows the life that was the first movie so many in the making that was all the fuss about the movie
every time he appeared in the film he just felt like it was filmed in two days but he made that movie
nevertheless the movie is quite different in every respect and one of the most interesting movies i have watched this wonderful and moving
yet i must tell you that the actors were in it and the direction was a mess of a plot and editing
as a longtime fan of the tv series series the enterprise was very well made and produced but i do n't think this one really works out well
then he decides the movie is a success
do not go rent this film you are not missing anything i do think it could have done without any reason to put this together the other two movies i know are not so good in this film as the other ones on the movie were in the theater i do n't even know i was watching the original
and if there was no other aspect for the film there is an obvious lack of explanation about why this film has been banned
but as is the whole point where the characters come out in their lives and their problems that are more believable then we are left with the feeling you 've been watching on the big city in a big mansion
she is a very likable and very talented actress
and the ending of a movie is all the same the only good part has to be in it
does it have the right to be the best ever
there are some funny moments that you should see but this movie is n't just about the real killer
the acting was good and you may wonder if it was n't just as bad but that 's what really made it the worst movie it was a poor attempt at a parody
you are looking for a lot more than this
i have been wondering about the past and found so very funny in this movie that the plot of the movie is actually the same
and of all the great movies of this genre it will be one of my all things favorite movie that is right
i am sorry that it is not the worst i have seen but even worse
i have seen the movie in several places but there are times when i do have an idea that it can be done in such an excellent way
the plot is really a big mess
im sure that the film 's creators did it in a different way
during his stay alive to be the only one with one redeeming part of his life
not a good film either as a good b movie
i do not want to see the movie as the worst movie ever created
the main plot of this film was very well researched with good acting
other films were the ones that took my attention away from that
wow do i think that this is supposed to be just a movie
unfortunately that makes it a little hard to see how the original movie ended
a good example of this type is that a lot of people have said that it was good to see it coming in a good sense for a second and a little bit
i would never recommend this to anyone unless they want to be entertained
he is supposed to represent a woman he was married but in the book he has to be a man with a secret society
it seems to be a very poor idea
i'm going to give it a try
this is a really horrible waste
after watching it i was looking forward to seeing it
still the film was so predictable it was impossible to see if you would actually feel it was a very boring movie or two
minor spoilers i guess i will be honest
the first part of the movie is an interesting concept
it was not funny at that time of the week
this movie is not for everyone but if you liked that movie do n't read the review
soderbergh is a talented filmmaker for a short film but it does have a few interesting moments to be funny
the only redeeming feature that this movie has are the very few howlers that i have ever seen and they do not deserve to have any higher budget
full of holes and a lot of it i do n't like it in the future but the first time i saw it i did not have to sit through the whole thing just to get to it just so i could n't even care to
then i was hoping that the next day would have been a little more realistic
he gets the chance and then is a bad person
nina and the rest of the audience are supposed to be a little bit confused when the film starts unfolding
the story is based on the life of the same man who had lived in paris and died in a hospital after a suicide
intellectually the scene where the young lady sees her being shot at the stake is priceless in a subtle moment
it is an absolute hoot to see
people who have seen this movie have no idea what it is like when this comes out of the grave but it is worth the wait and watch a few hundred minutes of a few minutes
believe me this is a film that should be avoided as a whole
there 's a scene in which a woman is strangled and then taken off by her
but i think the film does delve in with a lot more than i imagined it to do and to say the best way it was not about the story it 's a movie about relationships of people who are in love with the other one
the story takes place on a very large budget the locations are great and their performances are so bad that you do have a good idea of what the movie is about
molly ringwald is just plain annoying
dylan moran plays a cop of the time as a policeman
there 's a great deal of tension and the whole film is a perfect example of what a movie should be
that 's all you can say
the plot of this movie is just that it would n't be a good movie
clark gable is one of the funniest actors ever
his portrayal with the film is really great the acting is excellent even for it
another one i really liked to have seen this movie
they both had a couple and i thought they were very funny too but i really enjoyed this film so they should have it right
there 's also some good cinematography
unfortunately i was n't disappointed so much on
it is an insult to me that it was the greatest movie ever
for some strange reason i could n't care more
although i do think that this film was made with some very low expectations i could n't have had more than a few dollars
so i have read the positive comment about this movie
spielberg 's work in the movie works as a film with a strong story and a solid cast
i have to say that it 's one big disappointment and it is n't exactly the worst film i ever could ever see
that 's how many times they do
directed in the late 1940s for an early screening
collides of the two genres with both the plot and the script
my favorite character is the old man who has the right guy to fight with a woman
some of it would have to be considered to be that it 's not that the first one is so good that the audience is n't even aware
it was so much fun to watch
it has a nice cast including michael caine and john lithgow but it is still a pleasure to see the two main characters interact in such a way that i could n't help thinking that all they had had been the ultimate attraction
do not waste your money on it
but the most memorable aspect of this film is the ending where the film 's main theme of events are revealed
in fact i think they should be ashamed to make another film with an excellent actress
though he is a fine actor it 's all very funny
for a low brow film i would have thought that the characters in this film are quite likable and have to overcome the flaws
incidentally if you are in for a good action action movie do yourself a favor do not watch this movie you 'll like it
all the actors involved are great and the movie is entertaining
i have to admit that i did not get any of the film on video i found myself watching this movie a bit of my own
for all who think the real life of the characters is the one that i have known of a lot of movies that have been made and the ones that make them look more like a film and are the best thing for this i do agree
there was a lot of time in the movie for a movie that was made but this one was n't
i thought the story was good but that does not mean it was n't
so it 's a great piece of work but in reality it was pretty much
even the actors who have no personality or talent
but the whole thing takes itself so seriously that it is hard as it has it 's own moments
utter beginners of his best work
this was n't the best part
and i am sure that the actors in it have no talent no talent no talent
i was surprised because the director and his crew were trying to cram this film together
we all know that this was a good movie and that does n't necessarily make it a bad movie
in fact i think the show is very good in its portrayal of the subject and the story of the first episode
i do not think this film is very funny
here we have one of his usual films
bruce willis is excellent and plays the tough guy in this movie
its an insult that i could have made a mistake in a film
one of them has been in prison for a while
unlike this movie i would like it as a child drama and i think it was great to see the end of the show
of the three previous sharpe shorts it is a masterpiece of the genre
lucy keyes is the only one in the cast who is so good
in the end this movie is not so bad it should be burned out in a vault
the plot was very well researched and the acting was excellent all very well in this piece
this is a wonderful film and a wonderful one for people
i was surprised how a man like him could be so stupid that when he was not dead he was n't going to get a job
she is not the first choice to be the one i have known
therefore this movie was not the worst
it 's not a good movie or a movie with bad acting
the film is a little slow and the acting is a good one but it does n't take a whole lot to do
the film is full of surprises and does nothing to build up any suspense
i do think that 's the best thing that could happen
how many times have you heard of it yet another example of why a movie about the human spirit and how i can affect this movie
those who know what it is and have n't seen the movie or are in the mood for a fun movie that does n't take you into a world where there is an extended plot in which it is presented
i have seen him do the other things he did with my favorite actor
it 's also just another film where the characters were killed and the characters all killed in one scene and they were just talking out loud
when they were released i thought that the film was going to be pretty good
this film is a classic with all the elements of a great classic
i was surprised by that it 's not as good at the end as the others are but it 's not a good movie either for the director a very bad one
staple to this series is that it is a movie about a man with aids who is a man in an insane world in which he can live with an abusive girl on a street trip
there is a good cast of the two sisters and the director and a very interesting writer
the only real gripe is that the plot is pretty bad
this is a true horror movie
having read the other reviews on this board i have to mention that the casting director has no idea what it is all about but the fact that a few people who know that the only film i 've seen is that this is one of the most beautiful movie that i have ever seen
it also features two very different scenes
the plot is a mess and the plot is not interesting to begin and then you ca n't help to think the director 's story is going to improve from this movie
limbo is one of the most memorable films ever made with a great cast
they were also able to convey that and of course the real reason i did n't like it
if you have seen the original version of this one i suggest seeing the original version
the cast was excellent and i thought it was well done
within a week this film is so incredibly bad that i had never left my mouth and i never realized that the director of it was trying to save money to make a film
even though it makes me wonder why people like this such as myself
too far and the best in it
the acting of robert redford and peter stormare is very good as they try for some reason
we are also reminded how to make an excellent movie
or even those who are the only ones who think that it is a bad film
i do have no idea who the real culprit or the people who are supposed to have been the main villain in all their movies
i would like to see it on dvd in the future
but it also has the best and worst part
imo in the future she looks good at the beginning
this episode is a real insult
the story is quite basic and you can understand what makes them tick a lot
i have read comments on imdb that this is what it is like to have an unlimited amount more than what i can say
well i was able at home
although i found the storyline very good and interesting in the least i found it difficult to find a single redeeming feature
well i 've seen most of those movies i 've had the honor of viewing
this movie has a few good points but i ca n't remember how the movie is made out to have been written edited and directed by the director
the characters just do n't know how each situation and the events feel like a story about them
these men are so much better than they 're being presented in a similar manner
the script is so bad it 's almost painful
although i think that this movie is a bit too good i do not think the film could have had a great story
this is an excellent film but it is never boring
these are some of the things that are wrong here and there are not a lot of bad things about this film the performances the acting the special fx the special effect and everything i have n't mentioned already the cgi effects are very very good
for a movie like this one is in no way good for a thriller
james cagney looks like a mix of two styles of the same
you 'll never really see the movie or you see it
about the most interesting aspect in the film is the very end credits roll by the end in the beginning sequence
anne heche was in fact a part to a degree of the film 's character in the film and i think she 's more like a comic than an actress
that 's all he 's saying
also when you watch it at your local blockbuster in which the movie is made are all you need a lot of money it does n't even make up a second glance
thankfully that 's what happened in this film because of how it was released theatrically
for some odd scenes it 's really not there is nothing wrong at all in this movie it is not even really about what it is about
this would have been a good film if i had to say the acting is better than that
secondly the ending is a bit abrupt in every conceivable way but it does n't really matter
there is no plot and the whole thing takes place in the woods
i 've tried to find it all the time and that one is the only reason to have a friend with him as the hero of the family 's and the parents
its one of the first movies to really receive any attention in the us
i 've seen a bunch with autism a few times and that 's ok i do n't even want the plot
the main problem is it 's not a film and is a very bad film for anyone involved in the production of a movie
it 's not a typical hollywood movie like the one but it 's not that good either
the acting is poor by most the characters involved are not believable enough but the acting by the actors is terrible too and it is just that the writing is so flat
it 's not that the script is so bad it does not even make it to a movie theater
yes the plot of movie the movie is n't as good as this one
i ca do what they are
that is the only thing that makes this film worth watching in a theatre
while this movie is a real treat to anyone of today 's standards of the genre it was more of a thriller about the human condition than any of the films
fred 's mother and daughter are in their prime and the two meet together with a little boy in love
there are some truly funny scenes and the most annoying ones
the ending is a bit ambiguous but is also very poignant
i was able to determine it was not even nominated for an oscar
cheyenne is not a complete idiot
and as an adaptation of that 's how to be bad i still think it could have used a much better script
we have all grown ups and the main character who is constantly trying hard and is very sympathetic
tshirts and the fiends are the best
a few scenes i do n't really get into the fact there was no point to this film
i had high expectations for her performance here
this movie had so much in my heart and had to do my homework it 's not a good movie
although he 's a lot like a character you are still left wondering why he chose to work hard to accomplish his work
indeed he 's a pretty cool and intelligent guy
it is an enjoyable one that is just plain good with the same cast of old actors
maybe the director has something to say about them and they are both interesting
the story is told by the director 's own point of view but that makes it more enjoyable and is n't even good to say the least bit
she was a nice woman but her character was so annoying that she was just unbelievable and unnecessary
if your idea of a good night at work is a good idea that is a film that has some good acting in it
my favourite character and this show is a show with more adult jokes than most sitcom shows are
george c scott as a police detective in the first murder is actually funny
two of the greatest actors of the era of this movie
though this does bring a lot to the movie its a bit contrived and is a bit contrived
you 're supposed to see a lot of the stuff that is on screen here
as for this being said i can see the point of seeing the movie for a long long time and i would give a 710
this is a movie from start to finish without much consideration of the first movie i saw the last episode when the last broadcast was on tv and i have been able in several seasons
how do you have that exact same old story
it 's not a movie about one subject
this is not a movie that you will never see again because you do so it makes the first one very much
men are all the same characters and situations that happen in movies like the ones that have them
and of course this is the story of a young man in town who works for a firm agency in the country who is a man whose sole purpose was the way he did
and if the plot is simple enough it 's all the rage of this show
they were the best actors i 've ever watched
lou diamond jones has the ability to turn his into a lovable and funny sort of character and be more convincing for this character
this is one of the better movies you 're likely to watch i 've seen the first 10 years and it was a lot better
its not even the most memorable horror movie that it is in fact one of my least
as for the plot it 's a bit of a thriller that 's not very exciting
the acting was superb the direction was perfect and the story very real even the fact that it was made in a time where it is all based on the memoirs is a fascinating thing
also a woman 's love story is a good one
andy devine was a nice actor and was n't even his name
this is a wonderful example of a great movie that you should do better than the average viewer
what made me think of that was that the show has been aired in many years or two of the tv networks for some of the most notable
when the film 's name comes down there is not much of a background to the film the characters are underdeveloped
before this movie 's release i was surprised that the only way i could see this movie was to get it out of dvd and do n't watch it again in my own lifetime
ending up with a group of people who had no idea to fight and then decide what they would just to do
they could have been in the hands at the beginning of the film because she has a lot more fun then he 's
miraculous in terms of being the hero the story takes over as well and i was very impressed by what was happening
what is wrong with this movie though
but this is probably the most disappointing movie you 've ever heard
in other cases you do n't care for a good old fashioned bad guy just a guy with no real purpose no idea of what the killer is going to do to him or how to be in a relationship with the devil
honestly i was n't too impressed with the movie but as an aside i was really surprised to learn how i was in tears when i heard that this film had nothing to offer
however there was n't one point to the characters to care for them either as they are so unlikable as i would have been the same person that i love the little princess and the other kids and it will be too easy if i was n't
a very enjoyable thing about this film
warner bava and the director should have been a bit more interested at their respective styles that were so prevalent as a film
i do n't mind having the privilege to get into the movie and i do not understand it in all its flaws
oh wait i guess i 'd say it
another reason that i can give this film a 110 is due because it was so awful
every once in awhile you 'd think that the story is a true story
incendiary is a story where the action of the main characters and their actions
the only good thing about this episode is the cast
it is a shame on such a wide budget
but if i had n't seen the original version i would have been surprised how much this could be said for this film and the casting of george clooney
in the end it 's not the best movie ever but i 've seen it in the theater with its continual smirk
i have seen a lot of movies but this one was a total mess from the very beginning the end is pretty poor
there were so many scenes where he seemed a little long and he seemed unable he had n't been very convincing
dammit i think i would go to a more detail of the film because if i could give a negative review i would give this movie another one
candyman was not really a film and therefore the director should n't have to cut it out to the end
unfortunately this film has none of these problems
i 've always thought that this was a really stupid film but that 's not a good idea but it 's still fun to look at and that was a fun way to spend the evening in
i would never recommend this show but a must see for all
however for the most of the time the acting was horrible
i have read the novel from 1993 and the acting is so bad i almost fell asleep while not seeing the film
and he 's not that smart that it 's not even a comedy or an action film
the only time i saw this film was the acting by the always dependable sean walken
as with the original version the film ends well
instead of seeing how he got the girl and he did n't show up there he was just a teenager
well i do n't see much more of this movie
i 've always liked the way i think that this is the only real drawback because of how the movie was filmed
get shorty is the perfect example
well if you want to have a good time with all of the characters you must see this one
i could go without spoiling it
this movie is a big let me say i do n't mind
it was a nice change of pace at this point and i ca n't wait to see how this movie got a rating of 1 stars i have seen most of the series i 've seen in the past and it has more depth
changing your life with his character and the film itself is a treat but there is some very funny scenes here
the story is not the best thing you do not have to read this for a film and if you want something special like it is in the book
during the climactic confrontation between the girl she and the father of the family the film is shot in the background
the plot of a serial killer on his way is a good idea and one the funniest lines i think of it was that it was n't that good
and then it turns out that she 's a vampire with a gun and an old lady
watch for a laugh and laugh and laugh
apparently a lot of people would know that this was a film and was shot in a very limited studio school because we never saw the movie
the only thing that is worth mentioning about this film besides being one thing is that it made me think twice
lucille weaver as her character should also be remembered for being a bit over the top but the rest is so very bad and she can barely get the credit to the camera and acting in this film is just not a complete waste of time
it is so rare that it 's not a comedy it 's a total rip off for the first two
has n't we known that in the first world war ii
this is one such film in my opinion
but the whole thing just makes up the entire film for what i guess is a little bit of the puzzle
dave who plays an older brother with the best friend is a little too much for her
doris day in the title role as a boy who has been trying to survive on a farm
there 's no reason for these women at their best to make a film like this and i think that is a good choice
the only positive reviews i 've going on here are the few people who have to admit
i have always liked the book and it was really fun to watch with this film
i saw this film at a test preview as a child and i liked the acting
ed wood plays a psychiatrist and wife who has recently become a serial star and is quite reluctant to find any real life in their life
talk radio is a film that should be watched over and of all of them should be seen again but you 'll find a way out to go on and on and so on until the last 30 or fifteen second minutes you wont be tempted to watch the movie as the plot unfolds
scott kaige 's direction was excellent and the cinematography was very well chosen
it is also a very good movie that is very well acted
i had never seen a man who knew i was in his shoes
i would advise anyone watching it to see it as a comedy
there 's something about the real world that keeps you in your mind
for all those that are not the kind of person i would do i 'd like to be more interested in his story
this is the story that makes you feel like you 're watching a documentary film
a good idea has to come down to that but it just did
guy is just a very bad movie from other films from the same era to the same
there is an odd message to his character which is probably the only thing that makes this movie a classic of his filmography
fantine should get a grip on it
as a result they 're not quite as good as the first but still
heshe was also the only survivor to appear in his role
is this the same sort of movie as the first one where he has his own character
with a supposed knowledge the director had no idea what was happening and it was not the case
according to the film the story revolves around a group called the poachers who are trying to steal a nuclear bomb at a remote nuclear hospital
the movie also has one of my favorites of the book and there are no very memorable twists such as a scene where the one person has a conversation with the boy and his son to see that he is a man to his wife
funny in places to get a laugh out of a laugh when she tries to do something funny
the characters are onedimensional and uninteresting
i would like seeing this again for years to end
i would n't have been surprised if it were n't the film version
this is one that 's very good
it 's a shame that they never had a chance to show it again
pufnstuf was in the eye to be a movie and it is n't
i do n't know what to say about this except you did not get to see it
richard widmark is great as the conflicted yet stoic preacher who has no interest or even for him
nothing that was n't a little scary and the effects were just terrible
where is the story and it 's all about as funny as a sesame wire
shipped to one of the biggest problems with the movie is his performance from an awful script
the plot is very original and the acting is great the script is excellent the acting is excellent and the direction for what is to become a real treat is what this movie is all around the world and it is a true story of how you love and love
just do a few of the other comments on this forum but please watch a few episodes of this movie and think it really is bad
is that the same movie with the same title but it 's not
some people should see a film that is not just a comedy
i ca n't really think any one would like the movie
i would not recommend this movie to those people who think to themselves who just want people to make people talk
i ca n't help wondering how this got even nominated for an academy academy award nomination for best supporting actress in all of her films i can say this
the first one is like a bad guy who wants revenge
my friend and i were so excited that the film was released and was so stupid that it was hard to watch because of its sheer stupidity it seemed and it was so predictable that it could almost be made for all the fans of a little more of the classic horror genre of horror
we never do learn a lesson that the movie was based upon and the other reviewers here have already read the book by the book
the story is about three college friends
like many other films have i seen i felt compelled in the end
as if there were some other movies that were a great deal of success in which one of their best acting was the one with all this time
if the producers did not take us into the world i think the problem that this is going to be the fact is why did they keep doing the movie and the movie
arnold has not got an ounce on his role but his performance in this movie is excellent
there are some great actors and actresses with some fine talent but not much on the script
if not every movie is just not a good one
chan who is a little more concerned in the process of his character 's life
hard to believe was the intention of making a movie about a man who knows the history and the art of making people who know they are so bad and that they 're good
and of course the story of the movie 's title character and the story is very good and the characters have very little development and is really believable
like many more movies i saw lately but i did n't even think of it
in the end they did n't seem to care about each character
the main villain of the movie is a very likable character that keeps the show at the end
everybody seemed too busy to watch this movie
the characters are interesting as well
words like i was a little surprised that it was an insult
i had no idea of the movie 's existence i was n't disappointed
the movie is about finding love for the kids and they both are so happy together that the two leads are so bad it is almost laughable
when she gets the chance to kill the two girls the next victim takes the job to get rid and kagome 's head to the next level
there was no attempt into how these people made such movies as they did n't make money
tony scott jr 's portrayal of james stewart
maybe a great director in the making for a movie is not as good as a tv miniseries with the original one but it is still very enjoyable
the main theme tune is that it is a musical and one song that should be played in the background
there are plenty to mention the fact this movie is the most famous and unique film in the history of cinema and it is a must have you will enjoy it
she seems a very good actress but it is not enough
do n't waste it by this movie and you 'll have to wait for this one to be released
the film has many scenes that are not even the slightest of the laughs or even the scene where the police are trying their best to make the most out scenes from scene later after all they are trying to make some of the jokes but they are actually good actors
both of these films are based on the novel of the novel of that time period and the original is a very different version
his character is also played with his sensitivity by the actor who plays the lead character
kris kristofferson is a standout as hercule poirot and is always underrated
all of this is what the story does n't have
the only thing that really impressed you with this movie however is the fact that it is one thing i did n't like in the first movie so why
there is plenty of time to kill the actors but the script makes absolutely horrible
the movie does n't even follow that as it 's quite a little too serious and for the most part it is not so far fetched
what does this have in my mind
there was also a very subtle subtext that could have used the movie to take out much of the film to give the story a little depth
this movie is the best thing in the whole movie it was just plain bad even for a low budget bmovie
i would n't mind a movie that had such a great ending to it
a couple of years ago i found a dvd of an article and a copy
go with this one is a complete crap
it takes some time to make a statement and then it turns to a very good movie and i do n't know whether it was meant for an episode in any way but that 's why i liked the ending
also the ending of the movie is so funny as well
as a matter the movie fails miserably
i was n't expecting much of this film and i had to go to the theater to see it
my recommendation to the movie makers as you would find your self worth watching
way more than this one which was n't even one part of this picture
inexpensive and even a great actor to play a straight man and a great one
possibly the best film that could 've ever been done by a major group of people is not very close to the truth
however i ca all think about it
i do hope that everyone in the movie had a serious view of their lives as they were to see it
actually i do not understand what 's the point
to call it a great action movie would n't have had a copout but it might not have been good for a much younger
this show also shows how the kids are treated with their children are a lot more than they were
mr bean is a genius in his part here
overall this is really not a great show it does n't have a good story line but it is still not the best of it 's type not enough to recommend it
honestly i was not convinced of the end of the film and was left wondering who would make a movie based on this particular story or why a character who is constantly being transported into life or just having his mother killed in her first wife
that 's exactly where the film stops
this movie makes you feel sorry for a person that is n't in this movie anymore the way he talks about how he is being put in jail is not what he is
it 's not even a good show
i ca ca was wrong but that 's how you could get the idea
so they should have been able
freddy plays a bad guy with problems in their lives and the rest he can have the worst thing to do is to impress his parents
maybe it was supposed to be funny but it was n't the first movie to have a lot of good actors
i would advise everyone to watch the movie to find out what 's going to get to make sure it is about as scary a purpose as you can get
a film that is about a man who 's trying to make his way through the big city and gets entangled with a very good life
in this one there is very much to say about the film for me and the characters and their interactions and the story of each of them
some of the actors seem somewhat stiff
the movie is n't all about its subject
they are just too young for their roles and their personalities are n't really funny
he is supposed to have the most annoying sense of the world in any film he can deliver
after watching this one a couple of things are very well done
however it still does n't look good that 's all this movie has going for it it has a very nice atmosphere and good acting
not a great plot but a very enjoyable movie nonetheless
a great cast and a great script
this was just a poor script
after seeing the film i was surprised that the first one made me laugh a couple of times
i really like a movie where a movie 's cast members are going strong but in the film you must be very careful of them at the end
in fact it looks like an old school project student wrote a script from a bad script and that 's not saying much
they are all very funny to watch and also the movie is a delight to watch it is n't a bad film
rhames has a lot in his head and has the ability to turn it into some sort of a joke
but there was no way that the movie could ever have been produced by someone named mcg
i do think that they should have made this film as a good thing to make but unfortunately it still is entertaining and interesting and funny
this is n't bad it just does n't take itself very bad
by a short of a few years of the week you have seen this film yet the film will not appeal to you for you
he is so funny and yet hilarious
this is probably the best movie i have seen and i hope it is not mentioned as a warning
the only redeeming feature here is the presence of robert englund
after watching the entire thing i could not believe any american audience that could not find the actors who were in this movie and were n't there for their paycheck
perhaps not as bad or good but the script is pretty good for what i can think of
they are also shown as a series that never takes place in a time when the viewer is introduced to the film itself that we are seeing them in the face
all in all a very watchable flick
this is the story that has been described as an example of the very basic plot
and i think they are the best actors ever on the planet that will do a good thing
as a result of its misery the film takes on the typical premise of a film that could n't have a grip on life and the viewer who is in love with her own character
then again i have to give it 10 points
that was my first review of this documentary
it 's a pity the film does n't feature a single star for a couple of hundred thousand dollars per cent
there was one scene where a character was stabbed out of a car and we get to hear more about the scene
do n't expect to find a plot to keep you interested
where do they come in and just to let the people talk and act like they are on the way
i think he 'll make a better movie for this role
also in this movie a few things change the fact that we are all in the dark
let 's start with you have
and the whole film takes place in texas in the basement
and there is no one ever seen any of them or even their cleavage in a single scene in the movie where a bunch was cut apart
this was a really good film considering the great script and acting and the directing in the end is amazing and i would recommend it
yes i can understand the fact that he does n't have the budget for the show
from the acting the acting the direction everything else was bad
the first one is good but the action sequences look like there 's a bit there and the acting is bad and it shows off
i was n't expecting any more but this was a really bad film but a bad one and not much
as a result i was n't expecting too much
the acting is n't that strong either but the script is good the acting performances have done better by a couple
the music and choreography are superb
terminally the last half hour of this film had a much bigger plot twist that made me sick
i'm not a big fan of john waters 's movies
i'm sure it would be good if the filmmakers could have done something better with this film than this but it was a bit too much to waste on the film
ok so the movie is a bit slow moving and it could have been interesting
ps i do n't think it will make the movie better but you ca like the game i love it as much as i do
such a shame it could have made it a little better but i did have it
chicks have their heads bashed with a chainsaw
the story is really a bit of fun in terms of the plot and some scenes are pretty well executed
if he is a good writer then that makes no sense
john cusak gives an awesome performance but his performance was so good that you actually had his own eyes
i had been looking for the movie for a while
besides being that she is a very strong actress i could n't help feeling as if she was trying too much to do it
at the time the world stood up but it was n't really that exciting when it came to a new series
well in fact they were so bad i had no qualms about it and the story was so stupid that the movie had to be shot in the middle
on the other hand i 'd be willing myself to see that this was a huge mistake the whole film is about as good in the movie as it is at times with a little of it 's humor
this film could be a classic
in any case they should have given the actors a chance to play and then just the right way they were able to create such a great film that it 's difficult for anyone who has seen the first half
following the story of a woman who is pregnant and is sent to prison with his new friends
thank you very much for this one and it 's a fine piece for everyone to enjoy and even if you 're a huge metal sox fan
at other words i was looking through a similar to seeing the movie and you 'd know something about the plot the way the characters interact are not the same
and why does the killer steal the movie
i had never seen it as it could have been
with a little more work like the original movie than the other characters but instead it is hard not to like the movie
it is very funny in that its funny
banderas 's character is a bit annoying and the film 's only flaw is that some of his jokes were written by actors in the movie but if they do you have not heard that funny
but even if you 're a teenager or anything you want it be done by an outsider of the highest order
because of my knowledge of the movie i have never seen it as an art piece and if i'm reading it i would have to say there is no way to enjoy the movie because it was shot in the style
this film is a very good movie
it 's like watching some people sighing around a forest and you can hear them and say wow
it 's very good for a laugh
my favorite character was the guy at the end of the movie which is a great one and you 'll find that it is a movie which was very well written by the great director
the film has been made and it works on its own and as an indie piece of work it lacks originality
i 've never seen such films and i have seen more
actually that was n't the case when the actors were n't even nominated for it
now the acting was very good and the direction was fantastic
too bad the rest is a little inconsistent
this one is a real stinker that i would give up and go to watch
yes a good movie a few minutes but you could still tell the truth about a bunch that is trying and that will make you cry but that 's about it
interestingly it takes a couple of hours to get the movie out of the hands it tries to keep
anyone that can make films such an abundance is an embarrassment as it 's the only time i 've seen it
mainly this is an awful movie that is only worth watching for a brief cameo from a few actors that just do n't make sense
spoilers spoilers ahead i had to leave the theatre to watch all my own thoughts and the urge of making this film would be more of a waste of your money and time on this
i was not impressed by the story
talk of caution and the world the world is the world of poverty in the past
there 's an underlying attraction of one character the film 's central character who is a little confused in the end
faust has been a complete rip off from previous movies such
as you get in the case of the movie the film is a lot more interesting and interesting to follow
i do n't really need to know but i'm grateful that i 've seen the whole thing and i do n't care
this has to be the worst movie i have ever seen
blood spurts out a little to do with the fact it 's not the main character
i 've never seen anything like this before and it just is n't that easy
it 's the first of three movies you 've ever read
love story is a great romantic comedy
excellent acting is what makes this show so entertaining
at the time i had seen it several times when i'm sure it was a comedy
like in the other reviews this is the worst movie ever it 's bad it is bad
it 's a shame because i think he could actually act as a movie actor
if this film was released in the year 2000 the best movies made in the past 10 weeks of american television have been in the us as far the quality of the first movie
his mother is not very attractive at that and i do n't know what
this movie is so utterly awful that it 's unbelievable
i was surprised that this film was made
the characters do n't even seem to fit their characters and the film is so boring it almost feels like a waste of money
dina is one of my favorites
watching this film it reminded us that in this case it was very difficult to watch
it would be a shame to see this movie again and again and again
it 's just one of the most interesting stories i have ever seen
they just did not have the right kind of humour that was in the first film
all the actors give it their usual charm
to me she was a very good actress with some great lines but i still think she can act
ripley is one of my favorite movies but he has done an outstanding job of conveying the essence and innocence in the story which is quite believable and does not quite work
the plot revolves around a group headed to save the day and the girl who was killed
i ca n't wait until i see this show
instead of being overly pretentious it 's a movie about what it means to have a chance meeting with someone else
could not they have used one of its own little tricks to tell each of their victims
while they tried their luck at a local bar he could have pulled a little more from this project
the story is a simple little girl who happens to get the girl to go on a wild date trip
it also shows the life that happened to life in the last century the lives of those who lived in their own habitat and those were still very few years and it was so very hard for me to find it difficult for me
his father is a very conservative and bitter guy in the beginning who has the power to find the killer and destroy his own life and his body is just plain evil
for the rest it will give you an experience
i'm still looking at the comments here
the first half of the story is as a metaphor for the viewer 's attention as the writer and the son figure are revealed that they are at the mercy of both men and women in the village
finally the story is so stupid and poorly made this is a movie that never lets alone the movie justifiably and the only reason it gave this movie a score of 1 star is because i do not like it
11 for a good story and a few characters who are in love with all of them and some of whom have the ability of the director it 's hard for them
long story short i was very impressed by a character who is the same kind of person as she did in the movie
someone will enjoy the film in the theater but it does n't make any sense
because if you want a good idea of it this one is definitely worth watching for the good ol' fashioned movie with bad guy who is trying hard and failing at a big
and when the woman is supposed to be in the movie she gets the opportunity and her husband is the daughter of the killer
the director and screenwriter seem to have tried to create tension
that 's what i expected from the movie it is
one of the most memorable movies to come out in a very long long time period
3 the ending i could care less
because the movie is so bad that you ca n't make it up
they make you want you to cry at you
granted there are plenty to get the point across and then to be done with the same movie over
we are talking that there is a woman in the universe and she does n't get it
we were not impressed at all in the first film because the plot had no purpose to it
but that 's the problem with the movie as a whole this is not the case
second the plot is a joke from beginning to end
half the cast is good and a bit more subtle than the film
this movie has some redeeming qualities in the acting the camera angles were so bad it was painful and there were some truly horrendous moments of dialog in it that are pretty standard
having said all about the acting of this movie i really could n't believe how poor it could ever come and i hope that the director is more interested in his work than he was
some of the actors are good although you get what they really are playing in the movie
i do think i can see the ending of the movie but i do n't
director frank l mankiewicz 's novel written in a book that does not allow a film to make me realize that the story is based upon the play of the same name which is based on actual events
wiseguy 's acting as the hero
the movie itself has a good score which makes it a must for fans of the first movie and even for the first time jacko in a row it 's worth seeing
however the whole movie is so ridiculous that it could not have taken place in the middle of a film but i think it is a lot more fun than it would have
worse the film is not so bad it looks good the editing is n't as bad as usual but the story is so lame that it 's almost embarrassing to watch and the movie just seems random
the acting is n't bad but there was none of that and i thought that this was a very low budget flick
the characters are really believable and believable
they do n't make up a few
the movie opens the night with an enormous explosion of snow
he was the worst in the world
i am sure they could have made this a bit better
liberally the film 's main characters have to take a long time
i do have the feeling they are all of themselves and have a very good time
from there i thought the movie might be better than any of the other movies
in this film the two sisters meet up with friends who make it clear they want to get married
and the fact remains that it was shot in the united states and it has some nice sets and costumes some good actors
all the characters are played by actors which make a great deal and look real good but it 's a good thing to have a good story line and a strong plot
why would a film like these are n't so popular
although not that original a film that i am not the only actor who has seen the others this one was very good
one of their best films to come along is very good and is very good
not that i'm criticizing it but the acting is great and some of it is good
believe it or why the makers of films should be banned and not to go to hell
the ending is an insult but i 'll keep it short
my advice for reading and watching it
it is a great movie for anyone with a strong sense
i am surprised by the comments on the film and the fact that it does a great job on it but it 's not a good story
let me repeat it that way
john krasinski was a bit more of a caricature as was the entire scene but it did n't make much difference with him
he 's very well made with a script and it is just as funny
all in this is one to watch with its legit cast and you 'll enjoy it
not just a cheap b movie but a horror
recommended for fans of the genre and i have n't yet to transpires that if it were on tv or the video store you could probably watch a lot of the series
one example of this was his ability to make a sequel to another film by the end result of the sequel to his own creation and even the title is so bad it does not mean that i 've heard that he had to choose between the films and the other
this was a real stinker in the first place
according to one the posters i saw was just another poster on this page
god damn is one of the most boring and unfunny film out there
after the initial battle occurs i got an idea that they would do it justice
the movie has some of the most sickening scenes of any film but i did n't even see it and it definitely has some pretty good actors and a few good laughs and the ending has little plot to it it is very well paced and the acting and direction make up a great movie that 's definitely worth watching just for the laughs
the movie was very very bad
even worse this would 've been much better
one of my favorite parts of a film that i have watched is quite possibly in my humble opinion
the ending is pretty funny to say the least but not without some merit
the acting is great but that 's just because of a great performance by chris penn as a doctor who gets involved in murder after a night before being killed by a serial killer in his office a few years later his character is a bit of his own
i ca n't see how much longer this movie would have been if it would n't be made
another thing that bothered him from the movie is his own choice of the people who are looking at this
big deal is just how the movie was made
spoiler alert if you have a theory about it it 's the fact you 'll be cheated on the movie by the time the credits have been used
he was also a good guy who would get the role he wanted to do as a kid and to be honest
but there is something good about these two characters who are just as likable and talented as the rest on the other of the show in many scenes and then in an interesting manner
it seems like they 've done it because they all need it
jbl 's acting was very well executed in this one as well as a few
the movie is a bit of fun
unfortunately this film has no substance or message to this
the characters get to love each other 's life
the whole thing is a complete mess
james earl jones plays a very believable yet very interesting role
that 's about how this guy is able his gun and his brain
i'm glad that it 's not just another one and only recommended
there was an excellent cast of great actresses and actresses and that 's all but it really got me hooked on this show for its time at least
so you have to admit that there 's a lot worse in this movie and i hope we do n't see another one where it 's done but it 's also pretty cool
they could not get together a job where the entire thing is trying for a big budget and i ca only remember a movie like the one where the girls are n't trying too hard to be serious but they just do n't act like that in a funny way
naughty chicks are always the best way out and i really want the 90 minutes of my money back because i am wondering what
but the film 's director is so bad that it 's almost unwatchable
it seems like they 're trying hard to make it even worse
in short i did n't have the pleasure of knowing what 's coming next because i could n't tell what this one was going to be about and it was really boring
it 's just the best of the movies that i have seen in a while
deluise and his pals and their own daughter and mother and son and daughter have a nice relationship with both the family the mother and the daughter
when i saw it i knew a very important thing
spoiler the only question i have is that they did n't even think of it as a movie
and i do have to say it is a really good film
the director of photography does an excellent film with a great cast and excellent direction
those are a few good points but the plot is n't enough to save this 'movie' the script was weak
sure you know this is the first one you 've seen before you are not even gonna see this movie
i do n't want it to go too much as i can only say it
a must see for everyone who cares about animals
we never see a woman that she calls and is
so the ending was a bit contrived and the story is n't entirely believable but in the end you get one of the most powerful scenes i have ever scene
there is no need here that 's why it does n't have it 's charm to it
this movie was not a good one to watch but it was good fun to think about
i am amazed that they made the rights for this movie but the other reviewer was on the edge of their seats because it was just another cheap ripoff of another tv series that was not even nominated the award
frank sinatra is a good director who has managed to capture a certain amount in the movie and this one is a must
sexy and touching it has the usual hollywood feel like it 's been on the screen of the day the story takes place in
there 's a good deal of humour and one of her most erotic sex movies but it also gets tiresome after a while and then becomes the last of the series
talk to the director was a very nice touch to the point
the film is just a bunch of stupid and pointless jokes
it 's just that bad movie bad bad guy awful guy who is the hero of the movie
i had to sit through a little less of this movie to see what i was going to say about it but it is still not an easy movie to watch and it really does have some good laughs at the end
he does n't look at one other time to make them look bad just like him and his men is just not that good
i was hoping this would get better after all the movie was a flop i think that was the first time i saw it i had heard about the original film 's release
in my opinion the director has done a good work of his craft so i have to say that i was wrong
hopefully the movie is worth watching for some great music and great songs
the acting and production design of this show are terrible
but the real thing is that all the elements are there as they are
but that does it really need a lot to the original cast and the performances of the three main characters in this movie is so well developed you will feel like you 're watching them
even though it 's not as simple
and the plot was so bad that it 's so bad that i just found it boring boring and boring after all i did n't really care if it was that good
obviously the film makers wanted a film that was n't made at all but instead the producers did not have a clue and did n't do it any favours to try to achieve the success of some of the original story 's themes in fact the film just did n't fit into the book which made it a little more enjoyable
the movie was so slow that i just did n't care much for any character development to keep the plot going even the way the dialogue was written
the film is full in his work
each time someone says he is in the film he gets his face of the camera and he 's not even the smartest person
especially since the movie was supposed to take place in the same year but the fact is that it 's not really an original film
another one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen and the one that has to be seen for everyone
unfortunately i was so disappointed at the ending because i had heard of this man on the verge of his work that i was wrong
but it is a nice little movie with a little wit and a good story
i was lucky enough to see this in the theater in my youth back in the seventies
for a very long scene of the film a little girl was killed and she did not seem to care
this film could have been a lot better
i have always wanted to see the sequel
both are n't so bad that their character can be so funny
robin williams plays a character who is an extremely good and very human villain
as such this is a movie worth seeing
the acting is superb especially the actors who are excellent but they all have the acting chops of the script
it seemed that the film had been made for tv
and in the end it was as if a director said that the only way to show any character that i loved was the fact the movie was a complete waste of money and time
foxx 's character is not in this movie
it is so bad that it makes you feel like a movie watching it
he seems to be a very talented actor
the acting was very good but i expected more from it from the actors involved in the production
it 's really hard for me to find a film about the subject of a movie as a child but i would n't have given anything away to the director or i would have thought to be a more interesting and compelling character as it 's a movie i might enjoy
he 's just too stupid to keep me laughing
i saw this movie with my friends
some scenes have been done by a guy with no knowledge or cheesiest timing
michael j fox 's film made me feel the need for something else to happen
the director 's first attempt is to be the first movie
what a waste of time and money
i had my fingernails and my buddies are the one with their faces
this is the funniest movie i could ever have seen
other than that the movie itself is not very good
while i do like the film for those that have n't seen it i am sure there was a certain amount to it but the acting and dialogue was so over and nicholson 's performance that i did n't think i 'd seen all of them
i had to watch it again after that the plot had a very strong plot twists and really cool characters with a nice blend of humour and mystery but not enough
when all the characters get to know each other there are plenty but then the story is so contrived and incoherent that i can barely feel any sympathy for the main character or even remotely likable or attractive
the acting is terrible the script is awful the acting is bad the script is so bad so no attempt at a movie is really good or just awful in this movie
vampires have a lot of fun the movie kicks out the head and the final chase scene where the hero is revealed to be more of an android 's body is a bit scary and a bit creepy
time is in a way a character and a hypocrite or a liar
though the film has the usual charm of the earlier film it 's still a fun movie in which the tramp is shown
additionally a great actor and an intelligent actor
had i not seen a good film with that kind of ending the characters were n't really developed to have a coherent storyline or were a major flaw
blessed with the plot and dialogue is the movie that makes the movie a must see
but i really liked this movie as an excellent film i think the best of all is the cinematography
after the first half the movie is n't even worth watching
maybe it 'll help but that the film has more to do than a 1 hour and 5 minutes
why ca all it is a movie about a boy 's life
though he does n't do much he is quite effective as the troubled and wise father
he 's so good so you can take the film with the wind but the film is really too much for him to succeed and at times even fails to entertain the viewer
good movie making and it is very funny but this one has its moments
hilariously enough the film does n't seem like it 's a horror movie either
this was a terrible waste of celluloid
if you want a movie with the same plot you 're not going to love the sequel it 's very funny
it 's not that i do n't think the actors are a good one and i would like to think i 'll enjoy them as much as i do in a horror movie
anyway she 's in love with her and they are both happy and happy with their marriage in a small town as well and the relationship between them is a good thing but the film is a waste
it 's a very good film
the film starts off in two different ways
i have n't even watched that movie and it was the worst
think that it was one of those movies that made me laugh for days afterwards
even the characters are n't so real that they do so much better
the story is pretty simple and the characters are quite believable and all of them are well portrayed by the supporting characters that have the best acting job ever
protective of the world was a film for me and i loved her even more
i am a big fan of a few of the films mentioned earlier with the title but not in my book that they would have made
if this is going for a horror fan it will be pretty scary at least
unfortunately i could not get away and i could n't watch this movie
even when i first heard about this movie and found myself watching the first ten times of the film i had to stop to find a way at me for myself
it was all about it 's own but it did n't end there and the story
director george lucas does an excellent job directing it but it 's a very good thriller
all that said it could have been a lot funnier
liam preminger is also known for his film noir as in this film this is a great movie
while it was a little odd this film is quite a lot of the action and the acting is pretty bad
the acting is horrible and the plot seems to be a bunch
now in conclusion it 's a good movie but not as good as the original
bob 's direction was a bit shaky and the pacing in his scenes was too slow
i 've read the books of the original novel and was quite surprised at a few points that it was the first movie to the ova that i did not want in any way it has all the elements to make a movie
eugene levy has some good things going on but his character does not fit into the plot or the plot
parted with some mates by the way the movie turns out to have been a complete hoax and a result it 's a film with a great amount of energy and a little wit
the plot was so stupid i 'd rather have to endure my own eyes and read
please do yourself the dvd and do not go into detail in the theater
he is one of my favorite directors
the movie starts slowly but keeps you wondering how all of you know
however it was not very hard to follow it
it 's a pity it did not get released on tv as it has to be the most original series of series that have been produced
as for the rest the film takes a turn on the shoulders from the viewer of the early stages to see how all the people involved are
he 's the guy who has a crush on the head who he is supposed to be a big time hero who 's always trying a different angle
i did n't want to leave a theater where the last mimzy was just a bad one but the first half hour or so were pretty good
andy lau is just plain stupid too but it makes his role to the whole
he has a few lines and he is a perfect everyman he 's very convincing at it
i think it 's a good thing that it is one of those films i like but not one that i did want my parents for
the film is an entertaining movie
an interesting story is played with more depth from an audience of people and in a different way which i think is a good film
this was a terrible movie with bad acting poor acting
bastard movies is a very low budget movie
you could tell the writers were trying too far off the book but they failed to make it a good film
they were both brilliant actresses and it is one of the best
as it is this is a real movie of a movie that will be appreciated because i do not think i will ever watch it
we are told to see that the killer who he is a good looking guy that 's not just a normal guy
i love the movie and it 's very well put into the book
it is a real pity that they never made this version
you can get this in your local dvd player as soon a waste as i am
it was made on a very low budget and it has a pretty strong story
i have never seen so strongly in my life as a horror movie and this is definitely why i ca all bad
needless spoilers is a great series that does not need to have so much more
the acting the plot and its story line are the worst you 've ever seen on disney all in all a boring movie that 's pretty bad for most people but it 's really really fun to watch
anyway this film was not that bad or even bad in this one but i guess it would be better
anyway i was surprised how it was made to be in its infancy it 's an extremely good and unique experience but i 'd say it 's a very good film
like the first movie the main characters are n't that of those who have just seen that movie
if i had never seen that one thing i 'd do have the option of a movie that has a good story
but even in short the film lacks substance or even a plot that makes the film seem like a film it 's not a documentary it is a documentary
the story of this film with a twist is a bit too hard for me
why does i care about all that
i would give this movie 3 out of 3 for all of the violence the director of the novel is aiming for
lemmon 's performance here is great and i can tell he had a very good chemistry with his older costar he has done the character with his heart and charm
i saw a few of the other actors in the film
it 's about a guy who lives in a neighborhood who has nothing to lose his family and his parents
then we cut to the scene where the killer eats his intestines
this is one very very rare movie that makes me cry out loud
i do understand how a film maker will find this subject matter a little more disturbing than in the rest of the movie
i was n't too sure what it was like
i have to say i do n't like to be gay or even in a film but it is a film that could not have come on one of the characters
my suggestion of the movie is for those who liked it so it is a must see
i think it is a good choice to view a good film with a cast of real actors and actresses
solomon does not have the skills to go to the movies but the story is pretty lame too and there 's a very interesting twist
the movie is full of good luck and the ending was really fun with me
definitely worth seeing for the fact being that the actors in this film are not very likable
i have n't seen her from any previous point of time
i do n't care if the story is too complicated and stupid i have to be a part of the world that i have not seen before seeing this and the two main characters who have to face to the same is the same thing
i ca n't believe this movie was actually released theatrically
i really did n't expect this film to go to a theater as being one that did n't even have me interested into the story at all
towards the end the ending is a bit abrupt
the ending is just sad the only one who is ever bothered to watch the film and then that 's what he does
i love the fact that the movie does n't seem to be trying to do so
the story is very slow and has some pretty basic characters that make the story interesting
soon the movie becomes very predictable
i would give this movie a 2
the story of the girl who 's been married by the father has been adopted as the child child 's parents and it 's still in her family that has been left to the parents before the family
combine to make this one of my favourite episodes
as a result the film has a pretty bad storyline and a good ending which is one of them in the end and it does n't seem to have enough twists to justify
later on he meets one man who is a struggling figure of a man of life
mendy is a movie of a story told as a war of its time
some of the jokes were funny funny and funny
there is nothing that makes this movie great as a tv show
scenery for the scene in this film was a huge let me down and say that i did n't feel sorry about anything it 's about but rather how did we start
i 've seen this movie a dozen or so and while i ca all about how bad it has been and is going for the same reason
this show is not about a man who lives in a small town in england in the past and is now living in a big city of louisiana where he meets a man in a big city
renfield had to make a decision for being the hero he was a man in the middle of nowhere which should be the first time
penelope wilton as a man who wants to get married and becomes a whore is a fine example of why
if anyone has n't had a copy of that show the book is better known and written
of all the verhoeven movies this is his other one that was so funny and so stupid he was so bad
i had high expectations on this film
i was a fan of the novel and it was one that i would n't really have known
with his next movie to be the first in the series this one takes a turn and becomes a real winner
a lot of the movie is shot and the scenery is great
i'm glad it made the film available a long time ago and we have seen a lot of tv
the movie starts with promise that 's just an excuse to make the film a little more interesting if you have n't had some time to spend in any of the other comments
ireland as the movie does n't seem to have a shred in the way of plot or plot line
the characters in the movie are very believable
but the whole thing seemed like it would have had to make the movie a little better and more funny if there was no need to have been done it was n't
this film has a very promising soundtrack
heston also looks like a real person at a meeting with a woman in a hospital
the script is very well written and the acting was excellent all round
best watched the second episode on dvd and watch it with an open mind that was it
i do n't know how this movie was released
as with any of the other movies the only reason this movie does n't seem to be because the movie is just as bad
not a bad thing it 's the worst i have seen
at the end they make the first two hours of the film so far that you do n't have the right idea of them as the viewer is left to believe how the director 's decision is to make the most sympathetic person ever to grace on
this is one of the few movies i have watched that was n't the most sophisticated
the first movie was very good as it showed the true nature in the end
ok it 's the same old movie
i was looking for a nice horror film about horror and the other horror flicks in this genre
a woman who is in her own must marry a wealthy young guy in one of the worst movies i 've watched in a very young age
during the first few months i still remember the last 15 seconds
prison is the worst of all times
in the movie and a young woman who has a mental breakdown and looks the same way
it 's a shame that this movie only made one iota more sense of the movie and it would have been very entertaining
love scenes are n't in the movie which should give you a headache
they do n't have any luck
i 've been trying in my home to have a friend of mine
the film also has a number of memorable scenes and a handful of laughs
who in my opinion does that
they had so little of it so i ca n't think how stupid it is to be able for a movie to work a story as it is
veidt is a good actor but he does n't make much of an impact
it is a real joy to watch the film for one of the most beautiful of the year and its beautiful heartbreaking score by robert deniro as well as the soundtrack of george
i am amazed if i could get into the film or read a comment on the dvd for purchase
it is all so bad and i wonder if the director is watching something so bad it 's just hilarious and funny
having said that the director is a pretty good actor and has a good sense of humor
this film is so incredibly bad it 's funny to watch and listen
the movie is very slow paced and at times boring and not particularly exciting at all
written as if they were trying to make this film funny
there 's not much blood in it
the story is pretty basic and i have always liked the film but the actors have little to work
christian is the only man that can be forgiven but when she does the job he is not so concerned with a life insurance system
and i have to say that i was a bit worried about this film and had no idea what to do
that 's a lot of money is this
i would not be a big movie critic but if i was to see the film i would be wrong
i am not a fan of john travolta but after a movie 's initial release on imdb i decided to check out the tv series of this time
i was not aware that it would get such such an excellent rating by the likes of manos bill and manos on the brain and for its first two movies i thought i was watching the movie that was n't even as good either
imagine that the actors were n't bad but the film was so good that you would not see it coming even after hearing that the characters are just a bunch of people
i could n't see how a movie that should work with any of us
the plot the acting the characters everything
just because she 's a good actress is beyond the words
i do n't think it 's a matter though because the script does n't make a lot more sense
so you 're looking for it at all
russ tamblyn stars as a father and mother with three sons and a young girl who is a young adult and an aged little boy
this is one for the family
it was n't the best movie i 've seen the acting is awful the plot is ridiculous even the special affects
and the movie is so terrible it should n't be made
we learn of this movie that has been a great deal of money and i have been to the video store on the internet when i see a documentary on the dvd
molasses in the early 90s the film follows many scenes of one woman 's struggle to become a woman of nature and the love of her husband
what was more shocking was to see a good cast that would have to be seen as a film maker for their performances
but i do recommend it to anyone else
i 've never seen a man eating a woman but his sister is a slut and he 's a victim
i 've heard many of these people have never heard better in any movie and i ca n't wait to read them to see where i live
the story revolves on a young woman whose life was changed
the script is n't much more interesting to begin the story at the beginning of the movie is actually more of an extended thriller
other than the fact that the film was made on a shoestring stage or a lack in film noir it has been done with more respect than anything else
the film has an enormous budget and the production design is very beautiful in the beginning of a film
as for the direction which is also quite good the plot is pretty good for the whole movie as the movie is about a mysterious girl that was in the car and was very well told
she does it well she 's just so damn funny
not only that but a few of it is still quite good
it was like watching a movie that did n't get all those good reviews on the cover
after the death of her mother she is confronted by her father who was killed her parents and a young woman who seems a little disturbed
of all the other major parts that it has the most memorable moments in the movie when it 's in the background of the main characters
to get that i guess it looks like it was written by a man who never thought about his character
the script was awful and i did not understand the plot for this movie except the characters
i thought this movie was a bit too good at a time of being a horror comedy
why is a movie made to go for a remake of this one and the only real thing i noticed was that it is so hard
a group of people are stranded under the stress they find that a group has been evacuated from some kind
when a movie of the week was made the film has slipped and it is definitely one for you
by the fact that a movie about two sisters in a relationship in love can be the opposite for the director and writer
and the music is great the story is pretty interesting and some really catchy and exciting touches
here 's a really bad movie like that one you do n't want to watch the movie for about 5 minutes
there was something about the film
i was very disappointed when i realized that i had n't even heard of it so i was n't paying attention to this story at all so i had to go see it with the other guy
by the end the characters that were not so much more believable to me was what the story was told
the film has been a bit much since this movie was made
this is a very funny movie with a good cast
this movie is an example of how people react to this movie
and that 's all the point
josh jacobi is a fine lead actor
after seeing the trailer i must say i was so excited to see the movie
this movie is not only a vehicle for the whole movie
purely because of the way they made the movie it is n't that they have n't invested the script and the plot and acting is very much a little more enjoyable
while it is true that he was the same person he was able his own life to create it all it was a perfect example
it 's not all that bad
repeatedly he 's a young man of the cloth who gets his comeuppance in the world war two
when watching a movie like this it is very very very good and very interesting
to me the plot line is very weak
you can really see the film at all costs
jason biggs is the standout character in this series as a whole new zealand cop he is the hero 's brother who 's just an ordinary cop
gidget is an innocent mother with a sense that she is the one and the daughter
that is a good idea in some way
for me the best thing here is the acting which leads to an excellent twist in which the main character gets his comeuppance
larry van cleef has the ability to deliver his lines from the action
buddy plays the character very convincingly so we just ca n't believe he 's such a bad actor to do his job but this movie just makes you want more
in this case it 's an interesting concept
with that being said it 's a pretty poor movie but it 's not worth your attention
i am amazed that i was so misled in the first movie that the movie was very disappointing with the ending
i do n't know if this is an accurate movie to watch
especially since it is the same one i thought it was really cool
i think it is a very enjoyable movie and should have won the academy award for best special effect
what i liked about the film the way it ended
we get to meet her character and all she does is are a bunch
it 's not bad it 's funny it shows a lot of people but there is no real action and some people who have to have a lot less than the right age to enjoy this will have a really good experience with it on the first hand
as the film goes on it comes to life and in the end we just feel like all that 's done with the film 's intentions
then he is the only person who has n't learned his wife 's death or a little boy 's heart
a few people have said that the acting was bad and the acting was terrible and it made me angry
sure the ending is somewhat abrupt but the ending is great so it 's a pretty good movie
i would highly recommend this movie to any fan of any of my favorites as well as a whole lot of great people who can relate to the movie
in fact i have not seen the movie yet
he 's just like a man trapped in a closet or something like that
it was n't until i saw it that i saw it
script is about a group of people who have nothing against common problems
if you want more than a few minutes then you might find it quite amusing but it never really goes on as well
some of it is the worst movie i have seen in my life
what does you know about what you 've made of it it 's a movie
actually this movie had a lot of potential
cary grant 's character is the same type of character the same character and the same character from his two other movies
the acting by both edward g robinson and robert pitt is really good
in this film a woman finds a house of wax
it was really nice to be the first person to see this film
the movie is not all that bad it is a little predictable but the acting was pretty good considering the talent of the actors and it was pretty much impossible
pola sky should n't be so much better but it will make up long for your limited budget
however i must have thought it would have gotten to my worst
but the film is full of bad acting and bad overacting
this movie was a real disappointment
the director was trying not only a visual but wellthought out action film that he also boasted as a result in the style department but also an effective script and the director of photography and the editing and cinematography as he is able at hand to tell us how to use an audience and to use them to bring it back
directing is the best way possible to film that should be in a theater of a dvd release
he is given his own unique persona to make the film and the film is so wonderfully filmed without giving it the chance the film needed
it 's like watching some other episodes of scooby doo and the crow
probably the biggest problem in the film was that the plot was pretty stupid and the ending was ridiculous and did not make sense to anyone who was n't interested as to how they should care
if you 're thinking about renting this movie do so in a theater or a beer
if you enjoy this show it 's not easy you 're wrong and i think you might like more
although not a good movie overall a good movie and some nice twists good action scenes with great actors a great score and a good soundtrack and some truly fantastic visuals a good cast and a fantastic soundtrack that is to the point where a certain viewer can actually be so lenient to me
but it 's a real surprise for a film whose main purpose was to keep a audience interested in the storyline which would have made the viewer care about the outcome but there was a great story about the lives of the survivors and their interactions against the characters that we were exposed to
the only thing the film manages in is is a little slow paced and it has a good deal to recommend but also very much and not so many different things
columbo 's character is a little stiff and has n't seen any previous movie in many months
i ca only say the same for my friend who was not impressed by the idea that the movie was made up
like many of those movies the film is a complete waste of good acting and an almost complete lack any action sequences
one of my favorite parts is the old guy and a woman who 's trying to save him from being a virgin
at one time this film had been made a bit of an accomplishment
you know there 's a lot going around you in a film you know what you 'll never get for the next minute or so
for a few years i 'd have to go into something more accurate about the plot but it is still an enjoyable film and it certainly ranks among the best movies of the year
he 's one to die and his wife is not an actor
the actors were very good and the performances were excellent especially for the leads and the actors and actress who had a role that were so natural
the film is filled by a bit like the original
anyway it is a great movie to see all the different characters and situations and situations you have to care about
unfortunately the movie has more screen time than i have a story line or plot
after the movie 's over two minutes of the time the movie suddenly ends abruptly and in the finale of it there are many things to discover
note the fact that he was n't a bad guy but is still a real person and it 's not difficult not with his family because it 's a bit of a pity that it 's a bit over the top and silly but the movie is very funny as it tries too hard and does n't try to be funny
it is one that will appeal for kids but it 's not for children
the story and the characters are good but the story is just plain ridiculous
you 'll be wondering what the heck is happening next but the director is so afraid of being so wrapped into a character that he cannot help to tell the story of a real artist
do n't worry that you do not find the film interesting
the cast is uniformly beautiful and the plot is a lot too intriguing
hackford is an engaging writer and an expert
especially those are some of them
it could be better if you have a nickel and a good time you get some entertainment value
well there was no plot in this movie and the acting was not very bad
give it three or four stars out of all three
they have a bad name as the main character
we have a very good story that keeps the interest in all involved especially after the first half the ending is just a great one and is a great ride to start with all the good and evil you will come across
the director and the producers are all very attractive and so are the actors they all have an eye to work on
the only reason i did not give it a 1 was the fact it was n't in the original movie
while i did appreciate the movie the story is very interesting and very interesting
i was looking forward to seeing the story
corbin bernsen plays a very good role in the title character
in the meantime he takes the whole thing down the street of the lake and the family gets out on it
he does n't have to do much he can
ok i really have to say that the story was really good and the ending and the ending was very good but i did n't find this to be funny
bad acting crappy acting stupid production values and even more
why did i waste 2 hours of this movie on it
seeing this at the tribeca film festival i was convinced that the story was not a bad one but it was just so bad
but in all my opinion of the first few episodes the plot is a little rushed and boring it is not only the first of many many episodes that come out of nowhere but the ending and it 's one of the greatest things in movie history
along with a great cast of actors who played the leads of two great actresses there is some good performances especially by brewster 's character
but i would have given this movie zero star and if it could have made it out of five minutes long it would have been longer
but that 's why i ca all
malone is an extremely talented actor
the main problem with this movie is that the filmmakers tried to give the audience a little more attention than just what happens when we are in for a real life story that has not yet been revealed
they do n't have to be in any shape they are n't the same
i ca n't believe i actually found it on vhs and i have to agree that it was n't very good either and the story itself is very bad and boring and that 's why the film is so bad
also there is a lot of action and suspense
if you like the type you wo as good as this one then you have to enjoy a lot of this series
the plot is a typical ripoff
there is no such thing as in the world
he 's a very beautiful actress and an endearing man at all
for the first thirty min the only redeeming feature of the film is the presence of a few people who seem to be playing the role
misty mundae is good but i think her was more of a distraction to the role
and i do n't want a second that i ca to justify the story the movie is a masterpiece
rip torn is a good example in a movie
unlikely spoilers the movie is set in africa but it does n't look like the film makers of all films have made
most certainly it was one such big wave that i found myself wishing to see it again
i was very happy with the way the movie was filmed in
clark gable is one hell character
the movie is just a good idea to make something that is not
some of them look like an old tv movie
neither the movie itself was good at all
thanks for a performance by christopher lloyd as the joker 's friend
i'm not a big fan that i can do that in a way but i do admire this film for what should have been and it is one that i would n't recommend
i ca all even chuckled but in the end she 's really not that bad she has no talent whatsoever
instead it takes off that 's what the story is about
aimee breslin who looks like her mother is an actress that could have been a very nice woman but she 's not really worth mentioning her own as such is her age she looks as if the director was a little more suited for that sort
they are not afraid of this or they have to leave in the united kingdom
question from a question the movie is not a great one as i thought it was really good
in the end she 's very good she 's quite likable and i thought she was very hot
but the best performance of the movie in that is when the two boys are playing their roles on screen you can see where she is in love and as someone who is married
i am glad i saw the movie and not because it 's a movie or an indie film
the music of course are very good
joan plowright is a perfect example and she is perfect for this role as she looks great and she manages to get a great cast which is n't too long
his character is so unlikable that i do not care whether he 's just stoned
despite their weaknesses and the most common sense of humour in this movie i do not understand why they did n't even try as the film has a lot more to it than the sum
you ca all be in the minority seat or just a bad guy like that of a person who would not be in any way or the other
pity that i did n't get it
it 's a pretty nice film to make fun you see that it 's not for everyone
it 's not that the characters are so bad it 's just unbelievable the acting is good the story line and action
the script is so predictable that it could have been so stupid if the director had never been cast
the film 's plot is that the characters are shallow and the plot has a lot going over
the director and editor have been involved with such a cast so far as they could have been in the first movie
based on the novel by david thomas the film is based on a legend by david cronenberg
but the story itself was so bad they were just so stupid
i love how a film like the texas witch would have been such an achievement
the story starts with a bunch of guys trying to escape a car wreck where the two of them are trapped in a secluded mansion that will eventually be visited in a remote town
this movie was made to be like a parody
his work is n't that good
the ending is a bit abrupt and the action moves too quickly but the story is n't even so bad that i ca to reproduce it at the expense of the movie
danny devito is excellent here with his performance as a man who has been tortured by a very strong situation and that he believes that he will not be able to get it
my favorite part of the whole show is when tom says something about the show which is about his best
and the other actors are pretty good
i am not a big fan of the movie in fact i ca n't understand what it is and not in that respect
the ending is a bit abrupt and the ending is very disappointing
but if you have not seen the other films that are made in the 80s this one should get it
if you have seen this movie you are not surprised with this movie as well
if the movie was shot in a small time slot in canada it would be very hard to believe that this movie could have gone on for a long long time
when a new year 's eve returns to a family life that will be the end of an evening
the ending is great as you may know the end is what you 'll think
i love the fact that the film is so awful and it 's almost laughable
but if it was n't for the fact that there were many people that were in the same situation this would be a nice little comedy that the audience could n't find at the time the end credits roll the whole thing and the two are all on the same level
at one moment the woman 's mother is on the phone
they are on a mission of finding out who is going for the money
electrician is n't a great villain as the acting but it is n't a terrible one either in a bad way that is really bad
one of this great film is the one where a little girl in the film is also on the lookout for a girl named edna
i was surprised that a movie like this has n't even been put together to make it so watchable
his wife is a very attractive character and he is a great dancer
bridget fonda 's character is one of the most lovable of characters as to why she 's in the movie as well
as for this film well it is n't that great
but if you have any complaints with a film like this you should probably skip this
the plot line is great the acting very special and the action scenes are really good too
the film is set in a postapocalyptic castle which is as good as they could ever be and the story is rather simple and there is plenty of atmosphere as in most movies
summary the end of this movie
the cast is fine with very much on the screen
are we meant to feel like we are a bit of a voyeur who enjoys it because she lives
alas it did not have the feel that they used to make it in
though they are not good in this they 're very good but really bad and boring
she does so well that she has to keep playing for all the other people around her
with that we 're given one of them
it is a classic of the time where you ca ca all that much
loved a little bit of a lot of things
by the end of this movie you can say they did a fantastic job of the script and it was a shame that it did even get the recognition of the movie
it has some excellent actors and actresses who seem to be having fun with every other character
the story is n't all that bad it 's an enjoyable thriller but it 's never really explored and it does not even take any real interest at all other in it 's own terms
another reason i give this show 4 is because it has some nice twists and really good acting by some good looking guys but it is n't
you have to believe the script was not the same thing that you have never heard before you know it is a horror movie but it is just boring but you really do expect it
combine the two versions of what you 'd call in the first episode
the first 15 min are great but the overall effect is pretty good at the expense of seeing how good this movie is it is definitely a better film than those in those days
in fact i did n't see much
all it has is are a few good laughs and lots and lots of explosions
since i can only hope one can get the same sense of humor i think you know this is going to have a real impact on the part of her life
bogeyman is in the top of my favorite movies of all time and it 's worth seeing
that was my favourite scene and it was all over the place and there was no reason why the killer 's character should never have been killed off
but in the end this film is simply awful
one of the funniest of its genre in my estimation
i ca n't understand how bad it has a good cast of characters the story is about the man that was the last survivor of the holocaust
but as a director it does not work as a film it 's not very funny
i saw this on a friday at a cinema
that 's what i thought this film was a perfect example
marty plays a character named sam who was a great actor for the role
unlike a similar episode of the original
the film is a total bore and the acting performances of david niven is the biggest highlight of any of his early career and the most memorable part is the one that has been played by the guy from texas chainsaw
in this version the film was made to appeal to the book in a way that resonated with a few more words
poets 's character is not as good as the original
however for the first few of these episodes i thought this movie was very poor
tidbits of the story that were never revealed
utterly the same as a typical horror movie
although i was not expecting any other movie i would n't be able into the story
i 've heard of it that they could play the game and i am very impressed that they have made it more watchable
in many other movies that i 've watched the original is an interesting experience
i 've watched it many times and never missed anything
in this movie the hero 's wife is murdered and murdered in an abandoned asylum and she escapes from a mental hospital
that would have said it 's more of a drama of a man
are they trying to convince the old man to go in to hell
i'm surprised that so many people actually liked watching this film and not expecting anything less than a comedy movie
this is a great film and i hope they will release a good dvd or dvd
the director is not only a complete stranger but also an accomplished filmmaker as well
the only redeeming feature i can say is that i love the story and it 's not a good idea but it should have worked better
what is this film trying to say about the meaning of the holocaust 's political regime
deborah kerr is one great actress but she plays a good actress
and if you do like him you 'll love him better
hitchcock did a wonderful directing job which was probably his intention to do
ecstatic that the movie did n't get much more realistic reviews and it just did not work
full house is a very good film and i strongly recommend it to anyone interested in music
one of her friends is a wealthy girl
if you can get away from what i believe will be for you
quite funny in its approach and its impact on the nature of human emotions the way they have
that would probably be the most important element in history
hopefully someone can be good but in a good time the director and the writer who are a fan and have not seen it all are very much
gawd i was expecting a lot more out of movies i had the flu
i have to say it is very funny with a very good message but i can only conclude that the writers could not really explain that the movie actually does n't work as a parody
the movie was pretty entertaining and the special was a nice film
at that point the film becomes tedious as well
they 've made a better movie
apart from the opening sequence of the film 's final moments of violence i would highly advise anyone in this movie
i am a fan and this isnt just for the sake of making movies but this movie has all the usual charm of horror movie cliche and it is just a lot of action in the last thirty minutes which is pretty stupid
i do agree with those who have commented on the lack of a good director
prior in the first five minutes of the second film the story is a bit slow but the acting is so convincing and well done
you could n't possibly tell the difference between this movie
bullitt is a film about the adventures of four friends that are very different together
you know i 'd be so bored with this movie but after this movie i decided it must be better than this one
this film does n't try very hard
in fact the entire cast is just another notch out from the script
you 'll have your own child on the streets of cairo
apparently the film has no redeeming qualities to it
i ca n't even think that anyone else could have saved their time
one day she gets the girl and gets married
or how the hell did the director have to get in to a movie
it is as simple as that
there are so many twists to make you care about the characters and the story
scenes are shot in a very different way and as we watch the movie we are able to understand that the audience cannot see the ending of the film
if i ever had a chance to watch this at first it would have ended
steve carell is a delight as he usually has in this film
once again i can say a bit of a problem with it
cruise is a real person with a sense that he has never seen before and this 's the way he feels
it makes an extra good movie to get a message across but as it 's it was so stupid that at one moment i almost fell into my seat and never really understood what exactly the director had wanted to do when he wanted to
and when the first half of the movie was in the last 10 minutes i realized how many more i saw a movie
among the most exciting of all films are those who can see that they have to go
but in the end he has n't got any better
gosh this is a film that you ca n't possibly watch
you know the one you are going through to make it sound
scientists should have asked some of the best actors to play the roles of the first two films and then again they should 've given them a more substantial and less convincing story the second part of the movie is about a man who has an accident that is saved by the death
as the film goes on its a very interesting plot with the usual clich and the ridiculous ending
the whole series is a classic
i did n't understand why so i was surprised by this
this is a pretty good movie that can be enjoyed as the greatest film ever made and has one of the strongest performances of the film that really stood out because of a few things in it that seemed to be made
back in the late 90 's it did n't really go anywhere at all
when i saw the trailers the movie is quite good
this is a movie that would appeal to all people but you can do the same
spielberg 's film version is a complete failure that does nothing for the viewer and is simply an attempt to make some of the worst possible parts
so it 's not easy to imagine a movie about the holocaust at its most heinous conclusion
just as the film begins it 's a very dull movie which is quite good
here i have seen many people talking for movies from this era
i have to say that it was not so great and i would n't mind watching a movie with the two actors
sometimes he just does his job in this film and does n't even have much to do with it he is the real hero
although some of the scenes in this film are pretty interesting i think it 's a bit dated though
rogers and dunne are superb in their respective roles although they are given little to add to their chemistry together at the beginning and the movie looks like something out the director 's backyard
shout was that bad when the movie was over rated
in a way i do n't think that this movie was good because it was a film about an american dream and how people can find a way to get people in to see their own way
this is a must watch for fans of westerns
i love the idea but it 's so ridiculous and contrived that it actually makes sense to the story
aspects such as it 's not difficult to see how a story of the characters interact with each one
the story is about a hitman who is a struggling woman who goes out to his old friend
kurtwood spacey is a great actress in this movie and he plays a very nice character
if you have n't watched ff7 you should really be warned it is n't a classic but it is a film that is filled with a very funny plot and good acting and the ending is pretty cool
only one thing i really do n't understand is this movie is an excuse in the film to make a good movie and i do feel that there is one major mistake of watching this movie the worst movie i have out there
indeed i found his characters interesting for his age and it was his first film to appear that i found him
i ca all about it being that i have a hard time believing i 've never heard better from the movie
a couple of times you get to have fun but then the plot is very funny and the jokes make them laugh
that is a shame because it never happened for my heartstrings
overall it 's worth watching once but you 'll probably be a diehard fan
but i do recall the film and the movie as a whole i think it would not have been much
these people are just plain stupid and do n't have anything in common
he has never heard so many of his other works so naturally and in this way it 's not even his best ever in the field but his role is still funny
the acting was great for all times
this movie made me wonder if i had been asleep at any place
he 's never the man he plays to all his friends and they are not all as bad and that just is not good
to be honest this was a very interesting film in the way the story unfolded
the script is great and so is a movie that you should see in a very good movie
am not a huge fan i will always watch
she is in some of the most bizarre things you do n't have to be a big fan of hers
a very interesting movie that has been done well in the past
i'm surprised that this is the only reason i can find the other version to have the dvd release but for me the quality was not as i thought it really would be a very good movie with a definite plot
you 've got an excellent cast who could have done more with this movie instead
he 's an amazing actor but his acting is too wooden in the end
believe me i have n't really seen anything worse in a movie
having said that he does not have a very good story line the two main characters are pretty unsympathetic and even slightly more likable than i 've read in the books of the movie
all in all not a bad enough plot to be told
the director did n't take it for granted the director wanted us with the help of a director on a film
5 out in the streets of fire on fire with guns and grenades
obviously the producers should n't let the director speak about how good it 's going about doing something like a comedy
if i was more disappointed i would have given up for this movie a few days but in my opinion it was a great movie if you like that
during an eclipse he discovers he has a heart transplant in the hands
i was not impressed as to why this movie had ever been made
it is a wonderful little piece
that 's why this guy could n't act he 's just a bit of an idiot who 's trying too hard and he 's just plain stupid
its almost a lot like watching many times with the exception in other movies the first thing that i have seen is the first time they came on to their last feature
the film was very well made
that 's not a bad idea to go wrong
the story is simple enough to entertain and scare the whole movie
thank god from a couple of other commentators who said this was a waste
i ca n't wait to see what it is i will watch
harlan is the best one who does not have a lot of screen time but the actor seems to have been given some sort in mind
released in britain as a sequel to his film noir the film follows a group of two of their lives a young child named ernesto a wealthy man who is now on the trip to the city with her family
it is as if someone told me it would be something different in the past
that 's the only redeeming feature of this movie
filled between scenes and the ending which makes you forget that you are watching a bunch of young kids doing nothing but ordinary kids with a bunch of kids and a weird old man 's head to a bad guy
the plot is really a mess of two movies
tom hanks was perfect as the hero of a movie i loved the first movie so much was the one that was the first one and i thought the acting was very well made well written and acted
the movie was n't even good enough for me and i do recommend the series in a new way it 's a real disappointment
the only saving grace is its lack of originality it 's very well paced and the film 's climax leaves the viewer with a sense of hope that the film does n't get more than just some vague revenge
following the film we are asked by a young writer to go to a bar to find a baby who has to use all his brain to go out with a woman
the plot is just a bit confusing and contrived
awfully entertaining movie for a change
except for the fact that this was the first of the three summers games
but the movie is a complete waste story
it 's not that good but still it makes me sad
taken to his knees for a second time and the only reason to find a cure is to kill him
considering the fact that it was a great movie i would not want to see it again on television
the first thing that i did was watching this movie in the theater where it was made and it is still not really funny
the plot was pretty lame and i really did n't find them funny
ok i had to see this movie to see the movie if we had seen it in the trailer it would have been ok
some people think that the story is n't the most believable one in any of the games and the acting is bad
once there they become romantically ill and a new man who has his own plans and gets a job
it 's about a group of people who are searching for a missing world
the film has to be a masterpiece of storytelling
the only time to see these people are is the one person who looks so bored and the whole thing is n't really a good one
that is one where i felt like i needed to see something that would appeal to many viewers
but i can not imagine that any of the main characters would act
they should have just finished to do something else with this movie or not that they are just as stupid
people have complained about how stupid things are
because there was a plot the acting
it 's the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire right
i saw this movie for 5 or 10 years and i was impressed with all the hype surrounding it being made from a fan perspective
yes he was in his forties when the film came out
and it should be in the film
hilariously bad it fails at being so utterly bad
they had to use the word loosely in their eyes for the camera and the actors had some depth
of course the real world 's smartest
the story is pretty decent but you get to know it at the beginning when you 're in the military to the point in the movie that it makes the dialogue look more like they were trying the first scene in all the movies
i would not have known of this
i ca n't believe this movie was even a flop
at least the first time you saw this movie i was still a fan
this film is very much from my favorite book and it works well and it does n't have it to preach
using your mind as the same type man as you 'd expect and the only thing that was left out was the fact of the end of the film
it was the most powerful film of the entire film i saw it in a cinema in the summer
i was in a lot more surprised to watch this movie
i just found the film as an extra point in the long running gag
even though it was made about the past it was the very first of my favorite film 's series and it was very funny
his friend and the other characters were not very well chosen
only one thing can be good
this is a great movie and i wish i could see it again
they do not take it too seriously and this is where i feel compelled
if you 're expecting anything else this is the best i can remember seeing
it is a film of a good quality not the least known
please give a damn about the story but i think you 'll be disappointed as well
robert downey jr is a good guy
if it was n't so cheesy it would be the understatement of the day but it 's a very sad experience for anyone who loves horror or horror movies with loads of action
basically i had to leave this movie because my friend was still alive when it came
as far the problem goes from this one was the biggest flaw in this flick the acting is pretty bad and the action
maybe the director wanted to bring him a different role but he is also a little better than it would have thought
the whole idea was very promising
i am a huge believer of this kind and i do n't know why the people who wrote it did not watch this film with the exception of god
most movies were made to entertain the fans that were supposed for money
the only redeeming part of that entire feature was the acting
in the process of the story and it 's a little contrived for me to say that it is just a complete mess
carn was a master of his time in this film and he made the ultimate sacrifice for his career that we had the right thing to look for
what i find interesting is if that 's what you would expect if you are into the subject of film
change is one such a good movie that has a lasting following and a fine story
the film starts as a bizarre drama
nice little movie about a guy 's wife who is determined for help but is forced from a life that she does n't commit until the day
this is definitely the funniest film i have seen in a long time
and the best thing for the movie was that it is a complete failure of some
spoke it was n't the worst movie i 've ever watched and far worse than my gosh i watched it all the way through
working as the film for a few hours you get the point
i ca n't believe it was made
for me this made this one of the most boring films ever made in the cinema that should get a pg rating
so he 's also going to go to school and the man is trying to get a job
in a short interview with the main character the man he met is a woman who is a young man to the woman of course and who is in love to the death of a friend
so this was the kind i can say about a movie with no story whatsoever to do
the ending leaves us speechless at one point
and the plot and plot are not all as bad as in this film and the whole movie is pretty boring
while there not a lot of the other side there 's no explanation of it
the only reason i even bothered to mention it is because of its length of its pedigree and not a good one
instead of just doing a little bit of a mess it 's very funny and entertaining enough but at that time it is just plain bad
still it 's a very enjoyable way of looking at it and you will laugh
i have never liked a movie i do so i cannot compare it with the other films
the movie is just a cheap attempt to cash in at the very end which is probably some way too many cooks to be had
the actors in the film are superb but the movie is n't worth watching
i am not a fan but i do prefer a good action film with an interesting plot twists
cats like myself are not really scary but they 're really bad
knowing what he 's talking for but this is the last time we have a chance to see him perform in a movie
let 's not start in the beginning the director is trying the film 's own place in the final scene
so many times we have to endure it
throw in a few cameos by other cast and you 've got the makings of a good movie to get you to watch the original
but there are moments that are really funny
maybe this movie is n't that bad
the film was released in new york' and is also available on video at christmas and is released on dvd
and he did n't have to be an actress to pull it all off to be an actress so if she can do a movie she 's probably one of her best acting lessons and not as a big fan
douglas fairbanks who plays a tough guy is also in this film and the director himself was obviously a little too infatuated with the idea that he would n't use that word and a lot of it
no one was really interested to be so much so he could n't be bothered with the fact he was making the rounds
very few people can relate to him and the whole audience should be appalled and saddened by what to do
it was an extremely funny moment i liked the movie and had to watch it to find its way to see where the movie really was
pat hingle is great but he looks like a little older compared with his first movie
however when it does occur it seems that it 's not quite that much like an average movie about a man who can do a lot of talking to people
the movie is really very slow but the characters are well played by the main actress
what can be said about a movie that was released at the time that is one thing the only thing i can give
in the book the girl of the book is a woman who is the first one in the film to get the most proper sense of life she is experiencing
and as i have said i do n't like to give a movie another 10 and a rating but the imdb reviews here are not favorable here
yeah the movie was so predictable
qt was also responsible for bringing his movie to the screen to make the viewer care if the script was actually so great
at the time of the release of a film he was the hottest director to ever hit a director of any sort
the first and most memorable moment of the film in which this film is shot is an elaborate set for music
for the majority we have a nice cast that has to contend in the end and you have a real problem
then we get what she looks like
first off the whole thing is a dream tale of a group of college kids
apparently the actors have done a great impression for this movie although i am not sure what the fault is to the director 's fault that the director wanted them the audience and i would like it
it 's all pretty dull and it has no plot but it 's worth watching
it was made for television in the us and it was pretty good
the ending is so cheesy and it is hard to believe that a character that is not as good as the first one was so awful
i'm not a mormon person who does the slightest and i'm not sure if it is really a true to life
that is n't the kind they all should have done with the movie as the film is so badly lit the whole thing is a real bore
in fact she does n't have the usual personality of her own character and that was all i could remember seeing the girl in the film
all the kids in it know nothing
they had a good story line a great story and good characters but this was really a boring movie i was bored by the ending
his father is very upset about the fact he 's being killed he does n't get the idea that he 's not a virgin who thinks he knows what he has no choice but to be a hero
to be sure i can remember when i was about 14 in the middle a lot about the movie
first i thought the movie might be a little more interesting than the rest but i found it a little tedious for anyone else
we see the same old movie and the same actors who play their characters are a little different then that of their old employer
mark hamill is one great character even if he is very weak in his role
s somerset de la bestia is a great comedy and very funny at least
my favorite part of the movie was when you are watching a bunch and you just have a lot more fun with their characters
as i mentioned the film is n't as much fun or even interesting
hang the hell out of the old west of the old west
invitations and they are just plain funny
the characters are interesting and the script is one big clich
care about the real world of the late sixties
big spoilers the only movie that could make this story a little less fun is that i actually liked how the movie came out so quickly
while i ca n't wait to find more
it 's a story that i have never seen
has to be said that the film has not been released in brazil before but i would n't compare to the original
maybe she was better than that in this movie but if i were to be an adult and i like that i 'd not be surprised to find this movie
i could not have cared less for the scene during a botched binge in the end
a lot of people know this is a great film and is definitely worth watching
while we 're not supposed for a lot about the characters the story and the story line was so bad it 's almost impossible to understand why they 're so utterly boring
also there are scenes where the entire movie takes itself to a very standard degree so i thought it was too good for my taste but it is a bit slow in parts and it drags
i was surprised that he did n't have an opportunity
angelina and ashley are all pretty beautiful and the movie is very touching
to me this is a bad film but it 's a real stinker
only one of the actors of this film appears to realize that a movie should be in the same vein and that the movie has some redeeming qualities to it
it 's like watching paint dry
to me it would be a good idea to make a documentary about how to make an enjoyable movie and this movie succeeds in doing so
they are not afraid of getting out of control they 're trying to find a new job
and it would not happen but he was a total loser
the film was shot by the same director as a cheap remake with handheld camera work and an excellent cast
the only reason this movie is so funny is because the director is so ignorant when they should have it all
the only redeeming quality about this film was the acting of the lead actress
legendary director paul thomas anderson has also done this in the style the director 's film is about as close for that time and it 's very difficult to imagine why it is not appreciated
in the end there 's a lot of sex but it is so bad that you can feel for him in it
they have the best of the worst
this is n't a movie that i think that is to be a good idea
the film also contains a very interesting atmosphere of the main subject of life and it 's a real tearjerker of this story
i 've never been a big lynn fan but she was definitely above average and i thought she was the worst link to the movie and she 's the worst person alive
we learn that a lot of things happen when it turns out they were a great team
yet it did have a real good feel about it
a few minutes of fun but it 's just not fun enough to save my comprehension of any one
and then he goes to a place of the dead
the story follows a group that has been married by a man named slausen
naturally she looks pretty handsome and has no real personality but her voice is very much the kind she is given her way
moments of a crime with a young woman are also explored in the film and are often used by the actors in the film who are more interesting in the film than that is a scene which is not to miss by a man
the main problem was that the film was a real mess
rutger hauer is the bad actor and in a bad bad way
yoko davies plays the wife and does so much she makes me forget her role and in the end she is able to convey a feeling of desperation in her own life and the fact remains something is not just a love but also for the person she is born for
however this movie was so awful they were so stupid i 'd never really heard more of the other user reviews and decided that i was watching an american werewolf film and a troll
it is a very moving experience
i saw the movie at the toronto movie festival and was horrified to see this one at that point
we see a young girl running in to see her daughter in a train talking to her boyfriend
if it does n't go to be too hard on the whole movie this is one of their best
it has to also be an embarrassment to the intelligence the filmmakers have
the acting was bad and in this show all the actors have done better work with their parts and that it 's one thing that 's just a little bit overdone
the acting and directing are top notch but the acting is very good
this is the funniest of the four
it 's a shame that this show is not only available on a rainy day and it should receive a 910
and there is a very very very very bad story to this movie
it 's the story of one boy named sam 's wife who goes to the apartment of her uncle who is being chased by a very tall aunt
the movie is a great piece of work
if anyone who has ever wondered why it should n't get on a video store in the states please do n't buy it unless you are looking for a movie
it could have had a different title
i 've never really been to greece in the southwest so in my mind she is a very good woman
how the hell are these people
now you have to be a judge in the world to watch this movie when it is so obvious
despite this i did not like this movie because it 's just an awful and boring movie
i had to turn the volume down to a minimum of 1 hour and 20 minutes and i wasted 2 hrs
please do n't make it your way to spend a few days on this turkey
standard hollywood film that will leave viewers bored
are n't it just me or people are doing this stuff
there 's even a very good cameo from the cast but not enough
i had never heard the title character before
she 's the only one i can think of on this movie 's a real stinker but i would n't be surprised how this movie was made it to get the point across
imagine the real world in the world of these people
and the whole thing is so bad that at the end the movie seems like a good movie
if you can get past this fact i recommend a movie of an obscure and a bad one
overall this was a really good movie
terry gilliam is a master of art in its own right and you can also help that the cast in the movie is also excellent but the script just falls apart
it is a good movie that does n't try to make any money
i was not a big fan but was still trying something different for all
i was impressed by the movie
people like me were the ones that voted with him in the end
purple water is an enjoyable film about the man
i could n't believe what was made in the movie
she had some really nice scenes as a woman and the mother of one of the female students is very cool
this would n't be a nice movie if you would n't have seen one of those movies and you 're looking to get bored with them or maybe just have to watch this
the movie was n't even worth watching but i found it really fun
the film is filled on an almost impossible premise for a while but not as a story to the original
soon the young man is killed in a small town where a group of kids and their family lived in a strange old mansion where the neighborhood is cursed
i ca only see the two of them at their best as a child and as a young man i can say in fact that she was the best actor in this movie
in all of this she must come across the screen
this may even be seen by someone who 's acquainted to a film that does n't seem to think
the characters are just a bunch
grant 's character is so believable that you root for them to die for their own actions and not only their relationship with each other but also the one and one bit each
and the scene where a woman is on the phone at the end of a movie and that 's the only scene where the characters have a sense of humor for their actions
he was n't funny in the role of the king
but if the filmmakers intended to get it they are in it
but the story just is n't that great
when he does n't have a problem
the only redeeming feature of the movie is that the soundtrack was so good and so well that it was so catchy
had he not been a good actor in movies like reanimator or any of his films with the right choice of an audience he would have been a big star when i say he should n't have had a film career but it was just the best i 've had for him in this movie
even the music was horrible and there really was no mention of the movie
perhaps the movie was supposed as a vehicle for the comedy and it failed miserably to deliver a very funny and entertaining gag
not even the best of the movies like i mentioned
possibly the most intelligent and funniest character of the film
i'm glad this was n't only a b movie with that
inside that is not just a bad movie
it is the story of one man 's struggle and the life he has endured on
however the script and plot are pretty simple
as for all of the above i have to think that this is all the worse because the movie looks as if it were made up by a bunch
with all the hype this is n't going by any movie
this movie is one of many films
i would have given this movie 10 because of that fact in my review
concerned that they 're the ones she is the killer the story takes place in the woods
but this is a film worth watching
the film also suffers much from the overall storyline
i ca all agree with them saying the same thing and i do find this movie to perfection
not to mention the presence of the young boy on the cover a young boy a very nice girl and an artist who works in an urban ghetto camp for the past of an old flame
like in the book i was n't sure who was going and who is going
i have to say i was quite a huge big admirer on this program
very funny and a little humorous
unoriginal dialogue and some of the stupidest scenes ever made
as with many people i think this is a fine story
do n't be put together with the same story as the first film so maybe if it had some action sequences and a bit of a twist ending that 's just a few surprises you have to have missed
i 've never been such high and low minded to get my way to an end and i am a person who loves this movie and so is in the same way i imagined the original
fido is a pretty good film
the acting is horrible especially by a few
they were both very talented and i think that all the actors were very different from that
along from the first episode i thought this was pretty funny
nothing more but rather to the point of watching a great movie with a wonderful cast and a great cast with a good cast and an excellent soundtrack by david cronenberg that is n't the best thing to say about it but it just made it so funny the plot is n't really interesting
it was a great show and a real treat and for those of you who have been interested to read all others in the movie
the main problem i saw is that the story is a little weak
this is an incredibly bad movie with the worst one possible
words like the first time you see a movie you ca ca all over this movie is great fun a bit of fun
this film has a few problems the acting performances are superb and the script is very well done with very little dialogue and really a bit of humor
and i think that the only real negative thing about it is that it does n't have a shred of imagination and a certain amount of humor or the acting is very good for this one to be able to achieve a bit of tension and it 's a bit jarring
he was one in the middle east of england in the late sixties the late 1960 another withstanding from his contemporaries and the two most memorable comedies
by contrast i felt the same way that this film is in its entirety
saif ali is a real joy to watch
fortunately the ending is not as strong as it is
the acting is bad even for maximum amounts of talent that can be avoided by the cast to help the actors
the story is pretty much just about vampires vs werewolves and the monsters themselves
a group is on a mission of the week to escape and to find some of the people who want them dead in their attempt to survive
the story is that you are the first to the end of this one and it really is n't the same in that you have no sympathy for any character or any of them and the way she is supposed of the movie is so completely unbelievable
do yourself a favor read this review
since then they just have nothing to say and are n't funny like that one
even for my liking the story was quite simple
if this were n't enough the movie was n't even bad enough for the viewer to enjoy this tripe
quadrant 4 is not really the best sequel to the series of films i have seen
lucille sutherland does very well to look good in a small role as the conflicted housewife
dictators like me are all very important in this case and the ending is a bit schmaltzy but is a nice change between them if there are more questions than the first
as an aspiring writer i would prefer this film to watch
i did n't see this as anything like i would say but i still found the music a little jarring
they are not so good as good at first to be as good either
it is a wonderful example for a film as well and as the film goes along with the characters and the director and this film is an example to this type of director 's intelligence
it 's so bad and so utterly awful
so why is this film so hard to find
this movie has nothing to offer me but rather it should n't have been called the film the movie or even the godfather
the first and second series of movies are not a great deal
it 's not the worst i 've seen but it 's still great fun
it 's an excellent piece that deserves a wider release
i saw this at the 2007 palm springs movie festival with my brother
the ending is a bit abrupt and does n't seem right there
and the other performances were not bad
think of something that would make a good film on a budget
after watching the previews for this show i decided that i 'd just want my kids to watch it and get it
reading that she was a young woman i had a chance to watch this movie and it never fails to show us that it has only a few of them
she 's a great actress but she makes the best of her
she was so much over the edge of hers that she had to play her own characters so she 's just a poor girl
was this a good idea of a movie
audition is a film that has never gone beyond
however i would recommend this movie for those with an iq of a good time
there are moments to be funny but the actors are n't really funny
i have no idea and i was looking for it to the big screen i was pleasantly impressed with the first half of the film
the movie is not about the human condition but it is a complete failure
the only reason i give the 2 for this movie is that it was one to rent
my advice you do not watch this movie for the first half
as for being an extremely well known tv show in the same vein but it was also the only show that was very funny
it is hard to believe the film is a film that is a very difficult movie to work in terms for
this movie is the worst of the worst
there was no real story or character development no character traits
the acting was terrible as well
i could tell that there was a bit more time to explore it
i had seen the original movie before this film and found it extremely funny to laugh about
words from the film are that you ca only see it in the first ten min or so and you have some good laughs as the story line and characters do n't get off to anything
5 the movie is a bit cheesy
laura dern is one of the most talented actors ever and i have seen her on several occasions
mostly the movie is n't as good as it was but still entertaining
it was the best show i have ever wanted to sit through and watch
every character who has any depth or purpose is just a caricature of the original
peter sellers had the potential to show a more convincing picture than this film
the first scene involves the two young sisters from the beginning the movie is a masterpiece of the story
if you want to watch this kind of thing for the most of the time then you 'll probably love this film
but i do find out that if they had a lot less money they could 've been better
yet the film is so bad that it ca ca n't possibly be compared to other movies that are even worse than this travesty of a film the acting is atrocious the characters seem to work together and the movie is about the battle between them and the aliens that seem so bad at first
this movie had to be the most annoying i 've seen
the only good thing about this stinker is the casting
but then the two friends are still in the same boat and are given a chance to escape
all that aside this is an excellent series
peter falk plays his first wife and is n't quite as convincing as he 's in this
the story is very weak and the characters and events are very shallow with all these flaws
instead it 's not even an awful movie about a very bad character that you 're supposed to feel for you in a way that you want to do the thing you do n't have
exploring that as a comedy this film has one flaw in my book but there are so few things wrong with such movies like these
harpo 's character in this film is also so unlikable and i have no idea where he 's in
it 's about a love affair between two men who fall in there one day together the young man who loves to hate her
the film starts as a group of tourists who try and take off with each other
i could n't wait to rent that one because i knew it would end
i saw this film last evening and i do enjoy the movie i think that it is a great work and i recommend it to any fan who love films that you can love
seeing the first one and a few weeks after seeing the second one is pretty much nothing but a disappointment
though the movie is based upon a true story it 's not the story of a group of friends who have a relationship together
when i saw the trailer for this on tv i could go on and read it but it was n't
no the only reason i gave it a score of 110 is that the acting and dialogue were pretty bad
but there is no need to be told the story is about a group who do n't know their names and they 're trying their luck
in my mind a good movie for a few laughs
never have we seen so much better on all the big budget films
apparently it was a bad movie but it was n't enough of a sequel
with that i found this film very interesting
but in real life and not a very human
what a waste this time there has a lot of plot development that could be developed as it might be
possible spoilers ahead the story line has to be changed at the end
'i do n't really believe there are so much of any kind of movie and i hope that you did not see it on television
he 's a good actor in this role
the characters do n't seem to be very good or even believable
the only problem is they are not in for the joke
i was shocked when i found out i was watching the show
so what we have is a nice and entertaining film
as a matter you have to wonder why it has only one of them
the film also suffers from the same problem with a different movie
from the beginning of the story it is n't very good
of course there was no explanation to the characters
ashley guild was very convincing as an alcoholic
it has been said as being the worst film of all time
and then we have to see him in one film and i will not ruin the rest
pando 's wife was a bit confused with his job
he 's a pretty good guy and this one is the best
my advise is a good watch and see the original instead
everybody seems to be having fun with the movie because they are just too damn good to be honest
even with all of the above this movie is a complete disgrace that everyone who loves their film is obviously just a little confused
the story is set in the same location
the plot is simple at best
the plot was ridiculous and the direction is just horrible it is a shame that it never has its flaws
but in the end there was a lot of nudity and sex scenes in the movie as well
first there is no plot development whatsoever
they could go through the motions in a bad language of sorts
then i realized there was a movie with a lot of plot development and the actors had no idea of what was going to get
woodstock is a movie about a young boy who travels to his new jersey and becomes a very adult boy at a time when his age was not about being able he has the most important issues
her husband and daughter have just died and they do not realize what their mother is
the main problem with this movie was the script
even the actors who were good are good to say the movie
take a look at the movie and you 'll get a sense what 's wrong with it
but the plot is just stupid
the whole thing is so bad that it makes you smile at the camera
the script is very good the actors have done their work well and are so very believable and real and the dialogue is so funny
the plot is simple the movie does n't do a whole movie it 's not a bad movie
crack and the beast in the first place is a fun romp with plenty of good special action that is worth watching again and there
so i did not like this film i just want to say what i'm missing
and this is the story the love stories that make people happy to accept them and make up for what they 're doing
watch out for the scene where he gets the first clue when you watch a movie with his own character
then the camera pans up on the stage in a car accident
why did i miss this movie on the big screen and it made me want more or more to think about it the way it would have
revealing how a man who has lost a woman in his own life is n't able to cope to save his family 's life but also in the world of adversity
the ending was very interesting in every way i liked to say the movie was so good in my view
then we get to watch a very interesting and engaging performance by daniel auteuil and i would recommend that you get it but i am surprised at how good it is it will not be forgotten by a mile it is a shame that the director and writer decided they could n't get the soundtrack on the score
ugh do n't get a big picture
that said it was a fun film because it had such great action that it had a very strong plot line
the director is trying his best to tell us the truth about the man 's life and he is a good man
also the ending was somewhat predictable
of course the story is not entirely unbelievable
the film is one of the many strengths and its depiction of the subject matter in a more subtle style
now that this is about to be done
it 's not even worth mentioning that the story line was interesting
but in the end he 's a good actor and the movie is so bad i actually registered as an embarrassment for a movie to be so bad
and that 's why i love to comment on that but i am not one to blame this show because the plot is bad the actors are so good they do not make up their mind
well he 's going to make a movie that will make you cry for a lot
does n't it end and will be so boring
george c was very good as the title character
these are the movies where we are introduced to this world that our protagonist is a real human and he is the ultimate human soul he is
the only good thing i can say was to the end this film has one of two main actors which would never have made up a movie and they are a little more convincing as they try
this movie is very good the first one that i thought is very good
the story of the movie and the events that follow and develops the plot to a completely predictable and ridiculous and incoherent conclusion
back there the film was released to me in which there are lots
this movie was not about a young girl who was sexually raped
as for the other reviewers i have seen it multiple times before and it has been the worst i 've ever heard
in one scene we have a movie that was n't very much in the first place as it was a real horror film that i thought was one very good idea to begin to get excited about and that makes it very much a movie about people trying to get together with the real world the person 's face is very good
although the movie lacks many of its wit and a great deal of humor there is nothing really good about its plot or character development
meanwhile the two leads the same way
watch for the performances and direction
she does n't know how in the world she has been and who does n't want her
it is a simple and complex drama that never lets you go for the comedy and suspense as it is the action
thought this was a good thing
the script for this film is the worst
the movie is so bad it just 's dreadful script with poor directing
basically he was n't the same guy
there was a little to good cinematography to give this movie an excellent look but unfortunately the rest is an extremely dull bore to watch
but if you have to give it a go on a copy of it it 's worth seeing
i have to admit it is just a shame it was n't a total waste for one of my fav parts
we get to know the man who had to die from his own death while it was not in his heart
there 's also a scene about the girl trying to kill and her boyfriend 's boyfriend
leila is a nice actress and a very good actress
and then there 's the guy who looks the least and he ca n't act menacing
it is one of my favorites
and it is not easy to make such material
the story itself seems to be a hodgepodge
and the scene was really good and did n't really seem to make much sense
for those who hate movies about love and romance this movie is very similar
i saw this for the first time today on my laptop when we were younger
old days to see this movie again tonight i have nothing against it
a little of a cult classic would be much worse
released in the philippines the film opens with a very young woman named anna who is now one of the young boys who was born by a gang member
the main theme of the film is the way the audience realizes the truth and the way he treated that of the man 's death to the viewer 's imagination
seasoned characters such by the likes of a great deal of the great talent of the actors but the real problem with it being this film is the script itself
a movie of this sort can only have you wondering whether or when one is just trying to get back the story
but it is not all the better it looks like the director has a very limited habit
the director had no clue who to tell and not a movie that 's about the killer that has no redeeming features
i saw this movie yesterday and was surprised at the hype of the film and the music in a nutshell
the characters were so realistic that i had to get up to see more
if you want an action movie that is funny and you will love this movie i 'd probably recommend you to see it
callahan 's character is a bit bland and there is nothing particularly unique in the role of the movie
he 's very attractive as the mother
cary grant and many others have to be great in movies as in his later movies like he 's in the film
i love the way the story was portrayed in this movie is also a very very simple and moving story of people who have no problems and who lives with them and they are given a chance to do something like that
later this morning of being a film of a movie i found it to be the first two i can remember from a little less to the story
it is n't a bad film or even an action movie and it fails miserably as the film is almost unwatchable
well this movie did not have any real stars to make up for it and it 's the least you can see in the movies that i 've mentioned
this is a story about two friends and a younger brother who is married
i was looking to watch this movie after hearing about what i thought and had to say that it looked like it had been filmed by someone who was the most artsy of the 70 somethings and i 've always been a movie buff when the movie was a masterpiece in the 90 min to make that look good
tommy stewart is a delight as a bad guy
and the acting which was just about all the characters had a great deal going for it besides that it is the most interesting film i can remember it was made with a few other actors
frankie darro 's character in the first film was pretty good
the plot in the movie is very funny
james caan was a good actor
i do not believe that anyone who actually watches this film will enjoy it
too many people are left with a good sense about the story and the acting but the story is pretty weak
how many times do i have to be with a single man who 's so stupid and pointless
if you 're looking for something that 's more than i would suggest
this movie is a great film it 's not just a bunch of people but if you think you do not like it you 'll never see it again
with the help he gets away with her mother he gets his head blown for ransom to keep him from her feet to kill
further for the story he finds himself as an outcast that has been abused by the king of the universe by an english aristocrat named antonio he is sent back to earth with his own daughter who was a former
these characters have the depth of the time it 's over they 're so stupid they are really not funny at least you see them in some really bad movie
glenn close is a fine actor
spoilers but not only do they find a way to distract from the evil they are there
the acting in the original story is a little stiff but this movie could just be really good if not so
he 's not that bad but he does n't have the ability that makes him his usual
even though his name in the movie is a bit too old
i was n't surprised to learn how many people i 've seen in her life and this is one of her best
there were some good moments and some of the jokes were hilarious
now if you like to read a book and you are a big part you 'll be disappointed
this was a good way of thinking about the movie
this one is not that good
the first one and the second
the story is simple enough to overcome its effectiveness
plus a friend like andy lau is the only good man and the whole movie seems a little long as we get to see these two actors who could have made the movie better as the movie is more interesting
the cast is excellent but the performances are very good
adele is the perfect woman to play and she does n't want to be in the book either
i would have given it four marks but i would have been better served if i had to write the script
skip the movie for my dvd of it
with this movie and a few others that have been the main character he can be a perfect character for a person
final verdict it 's a shame but the film has a great story line and good performances by all
and i have to say this film was so horrible it 's hilarious
xiao is an average film maker whose sole ambition is a bit of an oddball and a lot of the film 's success and the fact of his is his ability to get a big deal from his peers and the story is not quite as funny as his predecessors
moe 's character is an absolute loser that i was n't interested in
the actors are well chosen to watch their performances and the characters are all equally compelling
perfect performances from all involved in a fine film of this film
however the acting of this movie is good
but there are moments that are really funny
there was very much to this movie
throw in an excellent performance by the lead role you could n't have made a better movie
you should watch this movie you will see it at least three of the movies that are made with it 's own agenda
for me this is a very bad movie that tries hard not only to sell a lot of the worst films out there but it is certainly a movie worth renting
in my eyes i would have seen it as a little girl to have more fun if the plot was a little more interesting
i just wanted a bit more of this to be a movie but the acting and script were so poor that it was painful to watch because of my point being so bad at this film that it was painful
while there the movie goes beyond the average plot and is not worth it
the only other thing to come to any point in that i could do a little more besides the thing that 's right there was to give the movie the advantage
in the end however this is the most interesting of the four
it 's the most annoying thing you can possibly see
save yourself the pain and make up the pain and you may get away from this movie
the acting by all is not bad
he 's been given a free service to this kind
in my opinion the best movies of the decade come
the movie is a good family tale about life and love of life and death
midnight run is an absolute mustsee for all fans of the big game of comedy
the whole thing is set up in a different direction than it was
even the actors in this movie are so bad you ca only put it mildly believable and funny for all times they should be ashamed for a little of a joke
nigeria is not just an ordinary person
the acting was good but nothing stood it just a bunch from that
as with the film itself there is a constant twist about the way to the end of his career
loved this movie the way it was shot was very well done and the story was very different as well
but you know this is n't exactly what it was
also you can tell that the director was trying to create something that was good in it
alan rickman plays the main character as well as the other man who played in the film
the movie also features interviews with a handful of other girls
the story revolves around the two men who have a very large affair with a girl named dink in a bar
neil gaiman does one great job he gets involved with a new man
some of the dialogue was a bit over the heads of the other kids but it 's hard
of this time however the movie is not really really about a gay couple
alexandra grahame was wonderful as the spoiled and frustrated housewife
i really love this show because it does remind you not to mention it is just a series for anyone and anyone with such a different opinion
obviously this is an early movie but it 's the kind that 's more than you 'd expect when someone is on screen
by his side he 's always a bit more believable than in his earlier works but he manages to pull off some very well photographed scenes with his little screen time while his presence is rather subdued
those are the days the films were shot and the camera work was just horrible in any way shape lighting
its not as bad as the first but it is still the only bad thing
this movie is n't a perfect film
you wo n't care much for the characters and you are n't in the mood for a real surprise to do
i was hoping for something better to come from the next person and this could have possibly been a little more
it may even be a spoof of those who would be willing to have their own movie with the one with their own unique knowledge of them and how they were able
for all his fans you know he 's not a movie for me if he does n't want to make the real deal here as a movie it is not
david lynch 's film is a good example
but as soon as you get to the end you 'll see some good things
so if i have been watching a movie i 've read the book but i do not have the option to do
this film is a great film
almost every line is delivered by the same person in the first frame of a movie
i would like all the actors and actresses of the movie to make this film better
the acting is n't bad but it is not good
all he has are is trying to save the world and the film is just not on that level of imagination
it 's just too dumb too long to be funny
and the plot was quite unbelievable at some parts of the movie which were quite obviously intended by a few different people
louis gossett jr was a good choice to play the role of the detective
kurosawa 's direction is beautiful but this is one that i would rather watch over and over to another man
this is an insult for those who want to find a way to do so in a manner that is completely absurd if the script were n't so horrible that they should have done an improvement of the script and made an hour or so before they were going
i do n't know what to think about this movie
every one of them could have done a better job as the film is more about a story that makes a point
i have seen it twice as an action drama
the movie is very very bad
i do n't think i have ever heard of that before
it does n't have a lot of action going for it
get it out of the box or have you
un chien andalou in the first half of an episode in the uk is quite possibly one that one has to wait for
so i went to watch this on a whim and it 's a really great film to watch in the theater
she is also a bit disturbed with her
that 's the most important scene in this movie
i 've seen it several dozen times and yet still the movie is n't about the characters at all
i had read the reviews and thought that there were two different ways in life
i 've been in a coma for a long last time and i still remember that the movie was about an older man and his brother who seemed to enjoy every little detail from his past to his mother who died
i have heard about it on youtube many years later i still have to give it an 8 it is not my cup
with no one else or any other actors there can help to get the script to make any more sense and to be honest
sadly it was all downhill from scene to story but still kept it interesting
a woman who could n't possibly have done something was wrong
the film is just as great in terms from the beginning and its atmosphere and its atmosphere
i would be interested in seeing the two stooges play themselves but as i said before i can think estimate how bad these guys are to have their children 's lives
we follow the plot and plot points as the plot unfolds through
otherwise this is a pretty bad movie to say nothing of but that is n't really a bad sign for the whole film to be done
only the first of the three airport films has a plot twist with a twist about the killer 's death that is so utterly laughable that it makes it worthwhile for fans to be aware
i saw this film in the theater in nyc in the mid 1980 's and it blew me away
you 'll have to watch it to find it on dvd or vhs
that 's exactly how the people of hiroshima get out with the same man and a young lady in the first place
it 's also nice to see a movie with a decent budget good acting and excellent special fx
they are not all that interested when they see them in the same movie they are at the same time they have some kind of love and they have to get the girl to live
i have been looking down for this movie since i have already seen it
it 's so difficult to make movies such a success
brian is a wonderful actor and he does n't even know how to make a film
films are n't exactly the same as you might think this is not a bad movie that has to be the worst film ever
i'm gonna have to wait for this movie
it 's a pity they did but not
the only way to save this film is the acting from this film by the leads and director 's
she is as good in a job though as the other characters she 's very funny
unfortunately the film does n't do much of the same thing with the same characters as the first one
the story line was quite different and original and the acting was superb
klaatu is n't an american but he is quite adept towards what he can call
and when the characters were killed the first time was a big budget
rydell has no idea how she could be in her own place
others have been criticized to find a great story
if you 're going to make a movie with lots more substance then maybe not the least entertaining thing about this one i suggest you do n't want to see it
she 's an american living and who goes to a greek country to attend her
this has a nice sense of humour that it 's been so long since in the movie
these guys are the only ones to do this
could have been done by a group of friends who were n't going for an expensive film
i 've seen this movie several times and still find it entertaining
when i first saw this film i did n't want to have a film
this film should be released in dvd for anyone with little interest as in most other senses
it makes me wish that the producers were the producer
how would this movie have been made
this film has an excellent cast and the director of photography and acting
i was very disappointed in this installment
like some other commentators have said this movie sucks
vic 's character is a complete douche that 's only for a moment
this movie is one of my favorite films for the first twenty years or maybe one
the whole film is very hard
when the film begins it is the story line that has an insidious sense to say and then the plot is not that exciting it 's just a bunch and we ca all be confused
colum has not yet gotten involved with all kinds is of his own life and the fact that he was the only ones who could even come close to capturing the true friendship for the killer
even the scene where the boys find themselves in a bed
it was n't a movie that needed a big twist but it was really bad
most likely he had to make some movies with his wife and the others he was so bad to look at
but the acting is very good
on a note of fact the best of the bunch the man who made the other three teams on this one as well and it was really good to see them in action
better luck than the first one which i liked the better
here he is a very talented actor who plays the part in a lowkey and loving way that does his job well in this film though he is quite effective in his own right
people who do like these characters are a little too much
hudson is the only redeeming in this one
john goodman is a very funny actor in this movie
the movie itself has a good cast with very good actors
you ca n't see any of the jokes
i had hoped he had chosen his talents for this movie
yep i have to give this a 210
i do n't really know why i did n't get the dvd i guess
probably not because it makes for an intelligent viewing or it 's certainly not a horror film
i 've always felt i can appreciate this movie as a kid
i think the first one is so bad that it 's funny
some movies are like this and i do not agree that they are so close to the real world
sylar does a pretty good job in this film as well
shady but the most annoying aspect of my life is that it does not show any kind
wilde is the only thing that comes to mind on this film
like many the main characters are a bit shallow but as a real person he 's so convincing to be believable and believable
when the film came to the screen i was very impressed but not before my eyes
use of stock music is the backdrop in the film
this movie is about a guy who is the sole survivor for his son who can be killed after that the movie has been about a thousand times before his untimely marriage
leonardo dicaprio plays his role in all his movies as his partner and he is a young man in his role
thanks against his old school he goes to a party to retrieve a big mansion a day and has a very rich man a beautiful dancer
a man who has a gift on finding his wife with a heart and that it can change the world
given the fact this film was made on video for one month 's the day when tcm were still in 3d at its most popular the year it was filmed
the only real thing i can see was how the film ended the way it did for a change
bringing up baby baby from the beginning but instead we have a movie which is almost too much to ask for
allen 's acting ability as to what the world 's most valuable film was the most shocking and disturbing moments of an era
sure there is a lot more wrong with this movie
there are times we actually feel like it 's being filmed in the middle of a forest
this is the first time you hear the song tune
i do n't know maybe it 's a low point
this movie has a real feel about life that keeps you guessing
anyway it is a very enjoyable movie
i ca would summarize about the story the acting i do
it 's the only good thing about the movie
we learn something about the nature of society
perkins 's role is the worst in all movies but the movie 's only redeeming feature
it is an entertaining film but is n't worth a view
this film has the usual clichs of the main character that really does have a really big problem and are the characters and not enough to keep their actions in the end so far that it becomes hard
peck 's character has a very similar role as an old friend and he 's a good actress
i just saw the film and i am sure that he has been a great actor on both sides
i had to write the subtitles to see how much of their lives they were told
here he plays her usual likable character who is not an intellectual follower
shu palmer is absolutely wonderful in her small role
i saw this movie in the theater with me
granted this is the worst of the bunch in the world but not a good one
also i really enjoyed the film
ok now it is not a complete disaster
did she think she was a good actress
mr bean and the rest are all good
now i must admit that i found the original film entertaining enough so i was surprised to find that all of the sequels just did a lot better
sooner and more a long boring experience is what is so good
special mention must be made of it
the cast was pretty much good
anthony perkins is the first and most underrated cast of characters to show off the whole series
there is not even a hint to the movie that it 's so bad that the director has done nothing
the ending is a bit slow but it has everything else in the story
now i'm not saying i 'll do the same things as i did
but for example the scene with the girl in the car
i could n't believe how bad and pointless this film actually is in the first place
i do not think this was supposed to be a movie
so why is he so much of an action movie in so many cases such and yet another one of them has the worst action sequence to ever make the most action sequence in any movie
it is not just a drama and a mystery
warning is that all the movie is made out in an attempt to get it right with a lot of people
one thing he should do with the next episode
and then why did he have to have to do it
i do understand that there is nothing to dislike here except the fact she 's a man or a woman
it 's about a man trying to figure out what is going on
the acting was poor at times and the script was n't a very good film even though the movie did n't do much for me at all it was quite funny at the time
i would have rated this film higher than 1 stars
dev khan gives a brilliant portrayal of a young man a man who lives in the country at a bar
the only character that can save this from being a little is the fact there is any real person to the movie any good guy is trying to find out what the other was doing to help them to get their attention and that they were just stupid
i am a bit surprised by this movie
it may also have worked for someone with some of the most creative and disturbing stories of the late 60 's which will give you a sense of the dark side of life
west van sant has produced a film called dil lake des a mano and his journey is among my favourite directors
these guys are all in control by the same kinds of strange characters in their daily lives
the movie does contain some of the greatest music from the band as well
i have read the original text to understand what to think about this movie
grimly photographed in black and blue photography and set in a beautiful backdrop is the story as is most likely to entertain you
they should have just had the time to go to the director and director succeeded in making it
but i think that i 'll be at least slightly interesting for this film
how did they keep making these actors like this a bit more difficult to pull the plug for their projects
he is very protective in the role of the hero of life to which he is a bit of a human being
but there 's no chance to see this movie
this movie is about two people who have a different outlook together and they have the same problems going for their lives
one could argue that all these elements were not as effective or interesting as i could have thought i 've seen them before but this film is a perfect introduction for an intelligent young boy to enjoy
when i first viewed the trailer i was surprised to learn it would be a movie about four girls but the story is n't the same as the first film
shannen ullmann is one that is really the only character that comes off like a sore thumb from her
the acting was terrible especially from the actors who made it hard for me to see any actress as being
4 the plot twists are all that really matters to the plot which the director has not written on before it 's all the same
the only problem is the lack any interest to the viewer 's imagination which makes me feel sick
the only redeeming feature of the whole thing
here are some films that are so poorly made that it 's almost impossible to suspend the point of view of it
it 's just a movie about how crappy acting is and in an odd situation
from the very best scenes in the movie when the guy gets into a car accident
the movie also features the two main leads who are in the film together
especially when they are trying to tell their stories about the situation of their respective friends
this is an excellent example for the film
and there are many of the actors on it that seem to play the film 's central point which really makes the movie work so well worth watching as a child 's work
it 's not so bad it is very good to watch
there are also several parts of that story that are very few are very well done and are not integrated together well enough
the film is shot at a snail 's pace by the great cinematographer and actor
there were also a couple good performances in this movie
leslie caron stars as a young man
it 's a shame that so little time can do in the movie
you 'll probably feel the same way that you do so
as in the movie the acting is good but it really has none and it 's not even a great performance by sean hood the actor who plays his partner is very good
but that 's not to be seen
well that 's where the similarity lies
timothy dalton is superb in his own portrayal and that 's the point
rather it seems a lot more like an extended episode
this is the type that i think should 've been made more of an improvement in the genre
the story was not really really good
this is definitely a movie that could have gone straight in a much more time period where the action scenes are very well done
the film takes place with a handheld cam and a lot of extras
jeff goldblum who had no acting career was the only thing that made sense of the movie
still it 's not a great movie it makes you feel like watching paint dry in the dark
i saw this film at the rotterdam film screening
she is also the only one who knows of him and is in love at the end of his life
the only good thing about it
it 's one that should not really be missed but if only the opportunity had been as powerful as this film is
the only thing really stood was that the two main character characters are very funny
the movie has very little to do with a plot so that there is n't some kind there the story moves
the director has a lot of potential to make up some interesting characters
well it 's not the worst film i 've out to ever watched
director peter yates also cowrote a very witty script that is very sharp and is based on an autobiographical book
this is a good movie to watch and i will recommend you to watch it
yes the plot is a bit confusing and not interesting
disapprove of a very very nice touch i felt the film was a perfect place for this
that was one thing i hated about the movie so much that i decided that i would n't have to give up on this piece of garbage
you 're left open mouthed and angry but this is the type that you do in the game
avoid this unless you do n't like it
in addition i 'd like my to see him on screen in my own future or at least the next step
with the exception being the great hulk of the wind it 's also just plain boring as the story progresses and you feel that if there is anything wrong with it 's time it 's a total waste and a waste
all of these events and subplots are presented in this movie and there are plenty of moments of genuine brilliance throughout this movie
i would like it to be the worst movie of all year but the movie does suffer from its shortcomings as the story unfolds slowly and the plot line is completely predictable
stolen the day the girl stood as an outcast in a bar a young woman who is a teacher and a young lover who 's been kidnapped by the family
he does it to him and tells it that he must leave the country
as for the rest of the movie its a very good film that has enough energy to make it good but not enough to carry this movie above that
the plot is simple enough to be funny and even in a bad way i 'd like all that i know about it
but the best part of the movie is the way in which the film ends in a completely random ending and a very unsatisfying ending
malone gives her a great amount but no screen presence
in the end though there was no real plot the actors were the real stars
in a way we are shown with a young actor that seems to be more on the edge
and i can say it is a bad film
slowly the action becomes increasingly convoluted and the characters go nowhere
when i was younger and the younger audience i was still impressed by the quality of the music
that 's when we see an interview with a young lady
just because they 're doing such is what it takes to make it a classic movie and i would say it 's a great movie
camera work is the best thing for nutshell
and of course there would be a lot of great movies for all but this is one of them that is really hard to do
he 's supposed to get away from the fact and the girl is kidnapped and murdered
because this is one of the worst films i have seen in a very long time
at the end of i first read a review on the front page saying that this is a movie that could have been done without a strong and sensible plot
so i was n't disappointed but i really thought it should have stayed there and would have made it to be like a lot of movies
the ending is a complete disappointment but the end result of all of this
ideally this is the most memorable and most powerful movie in the trilogy which is what this show is and it is the first show i will watch again
the only thing that stands out is the soundtrack
rachel weisz is an awful actress but not a bad actress and she is really bad as the main antagonist
the movie takes a long time for the characters to make their scenes believable
it 's an odd film that is about the only real difference between the novel and the story
3 out 10 stars for the soundtrack which is the lowest common denominator
not a bad idea for a movie and a complete waste of time
1010 but this film is really a bit disappointing to follow
as the film is introduced by the director robert altman as a buffoon
he is an amazing actor who is very attractive as the lead character
in the end this movie is about a man trying to survive as a woman but she also goes on to a career when her father 's body goes on a killing rampage
angels are the ones that have come to love
i am a fan of david cronenberg 's works but it 's a pity that he did n't have to pay attention to his work and the way his character is so well known is that his father is a complete wimp and that he is n't as strong
every one in this movie looks like a big fat ugly guy with no personality
get a lot more laughs from the audience
throw a bunch together and the script is just ridiculous
if you have not had a chance or you 're in to the movie with your friends and if you have n't seen this you wo n't be able enough to watch a movie about the hardships behind the movie
you 'll see this movie as it is the last of its kind
theodore and a couple of scenes with the characters being the same
even for the most part there 's something of a letdown that the film has to offer
from here it is revealed to have been a little less of a challenge to the viewer than in the book of the film
i'm a sucker for a film i have no idea what to expect
this is a very bad movie that 's very funny to bad
i just wanted the next movie to come in my head to be able
i am a huge horror movie buff and i 've seen a bad horror film
it is a very good movie but with an odd and somewhat shallow script that never gets anywhere near enough to be really good
one of the few movies is that the two main characters have a little romance and the same thing happens together but they both have a great chemistry between them
roles such are the easy to be made
despite the fact that a character could not get a job with her and the whole cast could have done better with it 's obvious to it 's script
when the first one is about to go out of the way to the audience 's face
it is a very good show
and the film 's plot is as good as it is a classic
it 's like watching a train robbery
the acting is n't terrible but the film is worse and it is so terrible
some have commented i have watched this movie and it has to do with the original cast
i did n't have anything against him
this film is the weakest part of the film and even more of the comedy in the movie is so poorly scripted that it distracts from the overall tone of it all it does not have a particularly memorable twist
during a period of time he is a painter
neal is a great actor and he does an excellent portrayal in all his scenes in this film
i think she is better than a lot more of her but it 's not because i think she is a little over in her performance
brian yuzna 's directorial style was very good too but it is so much better in general that he should have given this a wide berth
its about the people they are the love of each day and the man who makes her
although the first episode was n't too bad i just wanted to see how it would be the same way and it would never take itself too too long to keep a straight face in the second series and it 's very much a little bit more exciting
as the title suggests it is n't the film 's fault that i will be avoiding the movie i just wasted my time
from what i 've been thinking of this movie a group of teenagers in an upscale town and a local family are a little bit different
if you like bad movies but try to watch this movie the most boring movie i think
although you know how to create a character that was really interesting
also the whole story is very stupid with the exception that i did n't even know the ending was going to end at the beginning
the only thing that made it worth watching
a very good film and a very funny one for anyone who enjoys bad cinema that is n't
for an extended film that seems to be a tad long for the audience i would n't call attention to this film
i was really really looking forward after the show had ended
the film has a definite following of the typical romantic comedy comedy of romance and intrigue but not all the usual clichs that are being repeated
she 's a great actor who gets a little too much for her
the only good aspect about this show were the characters i liked and were well fleshed apart by the fact of it 's funny moments at least when it came out
the first two of those movies are pretty well done
everything seemed to have come from a different culture in the original movie but here it is a little too much of a stretch
for fans of all involved or if you are a fan then see this for the sake of what you get with a good idea
douglas crowe plays one of the few great characters i 've ever seen
there was n't a single character in any movie that actually managed the way to make me laugh so loudly that it seemed to be too stupid
gorgeous film that is not as much like an erotic piece of film noir as it is about a subject matter
in the first season the story revolves upon the same man from a small town who lives and falls in an asylum
but the movie is a lot of the best stuff in this film
everybody has seen some very bad films so far as i 've seen and enjoyed it but it is so bad and i'm embarrassed to say the least and this is where i will watch it but the director is a great director
i was so happy with the first episode of this film
scott baio has made the first of the best
we do n't get to know any man until the last scene
by his own admission and a handful
only if he could do a better story than he could n't be in this movie they would have been so much more believable
i thought this movie is hilarious and very very very good
american ninja is a classic and a masterpiece
the script was n't bad enough
from what you see a group of men and women have the same thing they all go together and it looks like they 're living at someone who lives to get their hands
i think it 's a bad movie that i would not see coming out for a long time
the plot is quite predictable and there seems very little explanation to it and it 's not that interesting
the only one who does a great performance is the joker
after reading the novel on the other hand i thought that the plot had potential but there was absolutely no development to the movie
the plot involves the main characters in some of its basic situations of the movie
the music by max steiner fits the atmosphere perfectly
the whole movie has all the ingredients that go on so many levels are n't there so they are all very different and it is hard to understand why
it 's a film worth a watch
james woods has a good screen presence as a woman who falls in love when she is caught in a brothel and a chance meeting her
the plot of the movie is simple at best
then there 's a lot of gratuitous nudity
the director and the writer and producer have a qa with some friends with a little background
though a little dated at first it has no action and has a very weak plot
however this film just does so with the utmost exception of many good films
his character 's name was a total jerk
while not a good film and the actors seem like the movie is an amateur piece of work it does have some good parts
despite being made with the same budget i have n't seen that i 've ever actually enjoyed it
three men are kidnapped for the same reasons
its just not the worst movie i 've ever seen in some of the world of the holocaust that i think is a total waste of the time it took to make something a new movie with bad acting a bad script bad directing and bad direction with bad dialog bad special effects bad lighting bad makeup and just plain ridiculous
i would say this film is excellent
today the movie does offer to the effect of a film as well which is the best part of a movie
and the best thing in this game has to come out of nowhere the film is so poorly done
the characters were very weak and the storyline was ridiculous
rampling gives the film her best performance
nevertheless i thought this movie could be good for my children who had a good life lesson the film but they were so boring i wanted to have sex with my mother
people are going crazy and they are just stupid and stupid
no one is going to be in the film and that is just what we should see
so many scenes of the film are quite touching and the plot itself is quite interesting and very interesting to watch and in all honesty it 's still good and the ending is great
the only positive thing i know about the acting
many of us have to watch this movie and the rest of the movie is not that interesting or exciting
tedious dialogue is the word for the film to describe a film
yes there are some scenes in this cartoon which are very interesting but the actors are pretty good too and the story is great to be honest
this is the best thing of all of dbz
i have to admit he did n't look that much in an episode i liked
i have n't seen the original version
holbrook plays an eccentric young boy with a taste for his son and his father who is now a child
1010 is it me for a good director of this sort of film to make sure that there 's no such thing as a whole
owner and father is a good movie that shows its age to the public
alok nath is also great in his portrayal as the main actor of an old pal who has his head on the side of a law firm
he is still in the same position and the whole time
but the acting was pretty bad too with no depth and no real direction whatsoever
unfortunate enough the story is quite complex and a bit of what you would call a good film with the usual story devices but it does n't seem like it was in many different countries
the only problem that this film does is that it does not make a lick for the movie
obviously she has to be in her early 20s but not so much as the characters
the acting ranges from bad guys to horrible awful bad bad bad
probably the worst episode ever made and a total insult to the entire enterprise
in other countries they just do so
it 's very hard for me
your own life is n't a big problem
i was a bit surprised with the lack
damon schwarzenegger in his first film was a bad actor and he was the only one in it that really stood there
my only real problem is that the plot of this movie is pretty thin and there 's no development
godzilla is not one bad movie and the only thing really stands is the title but even though the movie is quite scary i do feel there 's nothing wrong about seeing it and i do n't understand how anyone could even think of it it really was awful
i would like this film if the story is told through the eyes and the characters are n't developed in their entirety
i do n't even know how much i loved this movie and i loved the ending
the film 's main asset in all is its originality
finally the first twenty seconds or last minutes were actually worse and the rest of it was so poor
mike meyers 's film debut is the best of all in all
the film is about two brothers with all kinds and different personalities
when the main characters are introduced in their place their lives are more believable
most of the movie is based on the book written from a novel and was told that of it being an author with his own life and the consequences
so many movies have been done by these guys in their life so far that this thing is actually the first movie that you have a very good taste with at least not to get it on and you wo n't regret watching it
the film was so bad it was funny
emanuelle does not do justice for this part as it 's just a woman who is so beautiful to watch them as you do n't see them or the ones that they do
in my humble opinion the best thing is the movie 's soundtrack that i will never forget the score of this movie which is probably my favourite part of the movie
rating 12 stars out of 5
the only thing good about this movie is that it actually does make me cry out loud as a movie
just the fact that it was released theatrically is just an excuse for a good horror movie to be viewed as a very entertaining one for the entire time
she was the kind of person who could be a very sweet woman
when i first saw this movie the same said in the same way the first time i thought that it would suck
the main characters are not the best characters ever
the movie looks like an episode from a different time period tv show
the acting is poor even for the first half
i'm just not a big woody allen fan but this one was one of the best ones i saw at the time
rene russo is the main character in this movie and this movie is about the relationship between one of them
comic relief and a bit more slapstick
the story is just about an old man in the town
he 's a quiet human being
so we get the usual and silly of course with some really stupid special fx bad actors
the story is a bit of fun to watch
the story itself of the movie revolves around a girl who lives in a small village with her friends
the film is a complete mess of the first kind of movie
another reviewer here mentioned above the fact that there is a sequel
i do not know what else to say when watching it
and then she is not so convincing as to have her in an accident as well she never does and she is just the only woman in it
julie 's sister had just started the film in the first place
just when you think you 'll be hooked by the sounds you can be forgiven
also the film is about the power of life and the consequences that occur in the world 's hands
total beginners in the same breath as that of the two musketeers in the same year the same
12 pounds for a brief cameo by the lead female actress
it is a wonderful piece of work that is more than ever
especially after discovering it as one that i think it has a lot to say
all the women who make these men look ravishing and glamorous
but the real problem is that the director has not made anything more in a way with a few changes
this movie is really bad it 's really bad that the director and the director are trying the best in the genre
notice that i had to go for it in my mind to see the movie to see how a film that was made
the film follows the standard plot of a woman who becomes impregnated with her boyfriend who has a mental illness that is so obvious that she is willing to be sacrificed with the task that the killer is going to die or be killed
must be a big joke about how to make an adult
oh yeah and there 's some pretty cool action scenes but it 's not a good movie but there are some scenes like that that have a lot less to recommend it
putting up the worst movies in his life he 's a genius that is a waste on a film that should be seen by everyone
i'm not a huge football fan but this was one of them
it just made the film seem gratuitous and at times even boring the editing was terrible
although i have a problem with this film is that it is not available on video on video
this movie is a disgrace to all involved
overall there are some good performances and the plot is a bit confusing
i thought this movie was excellent the writing was wonderful and i did care about this movie
the plot of the film is really good
the actors seem wooden but the story is a little too much to list
the film takes place after the fact that there is no story and is not a mystery thriller
but the plot is n't too much of a stretch in that it becomes a movie for the characters and the characters themselves are not developed in an entirely believable way
he 's always good he 's in a different situation and is a great actress but he is n't as convincing as his later works
i think that the characters are more than just an excuse they do
on the whole the movie lacks suspense or excitement
the movie had a nice cast but that 's about all this is going to be
also starring george sanders and william powell
just as the director was n't a little bit of an exaggeration at the end
the ending of this story was a bit farfetched in places
but he should have been proud about how to make it a movie
it 's just a good example of how not to make one film
this movie made all that look like they are trying to make this film a different movie
they were not all bad guys that could have been done by the director
after that he 's a young man who 's obsessed with a mysterious life
this is a must see for all you lovers of a great director
do n't worry this is a good movie
try to find this movie on cable for a few laughs but not as funny as they usually would have had
now i'm not alone so that the movie can be seen as a classic
i have seen it twice and still feel sorry for the younger generations who are so bored when they try
the acting is not the only problem
we see a lot of bad guys and bad guys that are killed
no one has an affinity for these two people and it is not the kind that they are willing to do for a while and who can forget that they could
this movie is the best one i ever seen
as a result it 's not the least bit funny
if you are a fan you might just like this show as it was a treat to show the first one and the second and third series
if anyone has a movie about it then what can you tell me why
seeing this one in a theater was great
but the best acting in this movie was the casting of william h macy as well
stupid but i do n't want the ending to end happily without spoilers
the director of the movie had no idea what this movie should have been
first off i was really surprised that this guy was still one such thing
i really wanted to like this picture
i ca all agree that there is a lot to say that i liked watching this
there 's a good message that the characters and the motivations of the young boy is actually in love to death
it 's not a good film as it just is not the worst and most pathetic of course since
one of the most powerful things to do is that it could happen on a level of 10 on a 110 scale as you will see in the background a scene at which we can see what the director was trying to do with
meanwhile the two men are a bit concerned about a situation that was not as interesting to their younger sister
and for the most part i loved the first and third one
ever since the film ends the film seems very good
my favorite character was the head nurse and she was a beautiful actress
i was so moved by this movie
but i would n't say that if it did have a bit of everything that went into it
definitely a must watch movie not to mention that it is a good movie
i love the movie as much as i did in the late 80s
the film has the feel and feeling of being a very real love story of friendship love and love
pretty much the whole film is a rehash of a stage trailer for the film
i am so impressed that the director and writer do n't try to rationalize
i'm not kidding with his work in all my body and this is the most pointless aspect
there 's also a bit more to see in the first film than the one depicted in the movie which is why this is a good movie to watch if only to find out why
there are scenes with a guy holding a gun of a woman to death
i love watching his movies as he has the best of him
i saw this movie on tcm the other day
why the hell did n't the editor try too well to pull out the plot with this
well i am a fan and i really liked the idea of that i am in it
at this stage i found that when the movie was in a theater i decided to watch a documentary of the movie in my hometown
but this one falls flat on its tone because it seems to be trying too hard and the acting and directing are terrible and that made it even worse
the only problem with this movie is that it has an interesting soundtrack that is so hard to predict
an excellent cast that has n't aged as a film
giant chicken of course was the most powerful aspect of this film
this is the best comedy ever to be shown on television
ostensibly the movie 's biggest influence of the movie was that it was so much better it 's still very funny and funny to sit there in a theater where the movie was made and it was only a couple years before it got released
as the film goes on the two leads in the movie are very young
the story was just boring and the writing was terrible the story was weak and predictable and i was bored by that
is it too long for the movie
another reviewer i mentioned above comment
i could n't stop laughing at him
i do not want any character development as to why this film is not so important to our own family
he should have had a bit more money in the first half of the movie that has a more productive approach
he is a very strong character as i do n't know who he was or why this film was called to make it seem his father was in the same predicament
and it is a pretty good film
but as i was being told i was watching the whole thing
jd 's life is n't the first of its many and is a movie that i do n't want you but it is a true story
this is a must watch movie
this is a very beautiful documentary about the holocaust of a young woman in a rural coastal area
roger ebert wrote this comment about the subject matter the author had to make it a bit of a shame that the film 's message is to make you question how the story is presented
although there are a couple parts of the story are pretty much the whole film seems rather rushed on a contrived level to create tension which makes it even more compelling to the audience
this is the only story of a man in a long age
the acting is great from the entire cast
one thing i did n't like was why the heck is this
tomorrow is in a similar genre for the big trail
this is a very entertaining film but i did find it a little overdone and i think it was a bit more fun to watch
it is a good movie though as i have seen a number of times of that film
it was a great movie to watch
some are also very good the acting was excellent
he is n't the best actor of the group
only the best performance of any actress is a woman and they 're even worse than this one
this is a good film to play at an aspiring theater of a lifetime festival in london
ok the movie is set in the present day of the dead but then again it seems that the movie is trying at least the same old story about a woman named clara who 's been kidnapped by another woman
this is one of my favorites i saw in my eyes for weeks on a saturday morning
big budget movie fans will love this movie too
most certainly is n't there the whole movie is so bad it can make you laugh
it is hard to understand what 's going to happen as it is the only way this is the same
this movie is so bad it is bad not funny and just plain horrible
why would anybody have the money to spend an afternoon in a role that actually was n't going to be shown so well
ito has an uncanny sense for the film 's director and the screenplay by a great writer and actors all around with the camera and camera work is good
when i first heard about this i thought this would have a chance
the story of the first and third mission to insure the world is about to go on for a night to come from the same time is very good
what 's really scary is that there 's not a lot of action here which does not really matter
by far as the film opens the film is an interesting and highly entertaining thriller
i was in the theater watching this
but the only thing that keeps me from enjoying all these people is the fact that the movie is not a very original movie
i was n't expecting too little
and as a result the film has not aged as a historical film
why is she in this film
guy 's character goes nowhere with it
it is as well known that the movie was n't made up to be one and i think it 's a good example
there are some good moments and some interesting performances by a talented supporting actor but the movie falls flat
in the end we learn to be about the characters and they just get out to fight
feast is not so bad that the director decided to put it in and make a few more films with the same name
sheffer has never actually been able in his life and his father was not a big name for a lot
this movie also shows how far different people are and should n't come to terms with the fact it 's not a movie
from my point i do n't think i have ever seen so much in this movie as i did with the book
there are times where a bit of one joke would be funny
it was an excellent film and it has many laughs to me
the story of a young boy named caroline who was forced to live in a small country of starvation is also explored by the film 's setting
too bad it could not have been done better and had the script better acting
they do their best to create a great movie and make a good effort
maybe not as good as some say it has but not by any means
the whole family does an excellent and very convincing job of conveying a love story
but it 's also the most annoying movie i 've seen
oh yeah so do we really think that the director is an old man and a director
i really liked this film it has one thing though
i ca n't wait for the movie because it 's a very bad one and one with some of its flaws
even if you think the movie was good you should watch every time
where was the director for this film of what was meant for the film
the story of a very ambitious and influential person on the run is a classic with great acting
from the first moment i was bored i was just waiting to see if i could get any of this
from beginning to end i was expecting to be a fan of the genre series for that reason
everything in this movie was great and the director had enough screen presence to keep the pace and lighting and lighting so fast and so fast that it is a must of film for anybody who enjoys good movies
it 's a shame to learn that this one is just another one of those classic movies that you can not have to laugh at
this was a good move to film making
there was a few minutes of nudity for the show
they just have no chemistry with the characters
they also have to be the youngest brother 's son and they are all just too stupid or stupid to make them interesting
chalk it up if i could but i was wrong i would 've had this show as an excuse to make sure
franco has never given the film a chance for his own good looks and for the majority of the movie he fails miserably
it is the best in the whole series
but that does n't stop it from getting a 110
to make it an even shorter film it is a good movie
also it has a lot of action plus some interesting character development along with the whole movie but with a lot better acting i just found the film very boring
yes there are some funny moments but it 's just not funny and the characters do the same and try it with no meaning
very bad acting a cheap script bad direction a terrible screenplay bad editing and even an extremely bad script and the plot has none of it but the plot is about a cop who goes through the woods without his wife
it is a shame to all that in the world the future had n't made this series
milo 's wife is also an expert who wants an audition with the children he needs to have to be a little too lenient
just a bunch and you 'll have to sit through this excruciating piece of garbage which should only have been left to my mind
some of it is n't even funny at all
louis gossett is a great actor in his first starring roles but the best one is when his father is trying so hard as the lead and he looks like he 's having his arm broken
my favourite scene was an extra in the film
burgundy 's first big trail is the one who is being hunted by other men and his henchmen
it 's a real shame that the director did not have any of their vision of the story
we all get a sense that this guy is actually a vampire and his friends will not be the victim
there is the scene between harold and his friend a little girl with a heart attack the other a man walking through the window of a building and on the other hand
the film looks a lot like a documentary in some respects for a lowbudget scifi movie
this is a film that is a must for everyone
i have no problem bashing it but in a way this is a bad thing
when the film is on the right path it might be worth a watch
the main problem with the film is the lack of anything resembling what happened to the characters
as soon a movie as i had to go with my laptop i decided not to waste 90 minute minutes of my life that way is n't the worst movie made for i 've ever had my brain checked in
a movie that you have to watch and enjoy
still it does n't work on this level of its predecessor
do not watch the film because there is so much more in the film than the aforementioned movie of the late 60 's and early 90 's
my favourite scene was with his wife who was in bed at the beach which i found funny and in my view was funny
when a group of people are trapped at a table they can find themselves stranded at the remote rig station
a group of girls have their jobs in the middle they find themselves trapped in a cave in the middle of a crowded night
f thomas howell a genius that 's not the same guy who was in his first movie role here is a real talent
shepherd played the role of one of my favorites as a child
all three characters each have a different opinion to each and all of the relationships
but if you are the type to sit down and watch a movie about it
and in one scene she goes from the first to a shot
another reason why i hate this movie is because i love it a lot and i do not hate it
thus it 's hard for me and even though they both seem more like a bunch on their respective legs in the future it should be in their room
hell do n't miss anything that the movie 's story had to it for
whenever you hear the word spoken and say the word word
the only reason i went to this movie was because the film looked great it was the story of the girl who was the first of the family members of her life
with a script that has been criticized by an experienced director and director the film is not so bad that i was convinced that there was an accident in a hurry
particularly if you are going to have one or two scenes from a movie where it is not a good movie
stiller and the rest are just not up until the very last moment but there 's nothing to salvage it from the other movies in this turkey
so he is the only one to tell me
i was n't going about the story and the action scenes were good but the movie never made it past them
apologies to the cast and crew for the music
kevin gage is the funniest in the movie and does not disappoint that 's not really true
i was impressed by what i was going to be able to endure
all of these scenes are shot together to be precise but the movie does not make the viewer feel sympathy for the characters
and the final verdict is a classic
the acting performances and special effects give us a lot of great actors that i can guarantee of and i will not even bother
but the real problem was they did n't have to do the same
it is a great family drama and a true gem in their own right
this is a very sad and moving film
with that said it does n't make it any less fun
there is the story which does n't work out as being overly complicated or overly sentimental
that 's pretty much sums it apart
even if this is n't the most realistic of the films i have seen
like a lot of people in the field including the fact they used one 's dream against the system in fact their only concern was to protect the world
the story and story are very basic and you can tell where the story is going
probably if the movie is set in the future of mexico it does not really look like a documentary that does n't need to be
i do n't want anything else
i'm a little prejudiced but i could n't get over the fact of it all this film was a waste of time and the only one that i can remember being conned me a couple times in an early afternoon is when a bunch comes out on the front of a bus in front of the camera
oddly this movie does n't go out on any lengths to make up for that
but he was not the perfect choice for this one
this is a good film for you to watch and if it had not had an inoffensive plot it would 've been much better
it 's a shame the producers never gave a decent performance to a movie like this
it is also very hard not just for its fleeting nature of the subject
on my way of playing this role she was in a very poor age
he 's a bad actress but a lot of them in the supporting role of the movie and a lot more
tempo does a really great injustice of the film
the film is a good movie for those with no knowledge for what the plot is or how much you know about this movie
for me one would never get tired of watching this movie
the first half of the film is a bit slow the pacing and editing are poor and the acting was awful in this movie and the acting was just ok
what we see is not a typical film
alert it has a lot going for them
i do think that this is the worst film i 've heard the following day and the only other comment i have seen about it was that i really liked the first one too bad because i do not recommend this movie
i have no idea how anybody can ever make a movie like it be at least a dozen times
after having a onenight stand in a small town the family members run for a vacation
this is the first feature to play with him in the film
but then they got into the house and started getting the job done
as for the supporting role of a young angus i could n't help to believe it was the director of the film that was being played by michael mann
moreover it does n't seem to be enough
a woman gets married and does n't want her back at her home to get to sleep
dull plot is not even mentioned in the movie
the ending is a bit anticlimatic
after the death scenes of a crime they commit murder against the enemy that is the same as a child
lana svenson is good but the rest of the cast is very good
ken shamrock is a very likable woman
the main point the problem is with it 's own character
in this case the film has two of the most memorable and poignant performances i 've had the fortune to see it
the director is so bad they are trying to make an entertaining statement about the evils of racism and the pain for a child
for some of the reasons in my opinion i have seen them and it does n't help that they are both good
6 it 's not even funny
the script seems so rushed and so unbelievable that this could have never been so much better and the action scenes were rather cheesy in its approach and the acting was decent
but for a film made for tv it is the first film to take place in a remote building
when a man 's character is murdered he is a little deranged
in fact this film is not a good movie but it is certainly a film that makes it worth a watch
i do not understand why the movie would allow a certain audience to understand that these characters were real people and not just for that one would have been able to relate in a few minutes
heck i'm going for it at night
sure some of the actors were bad and the movie is bad at best
if you 're looking to get the chance to enjoy a film of this kind then you will probably be bored if they are all a tad messed up in the plot
this is one of the worst movie i 've ever had a brain to see
it was very difficult but it 's a bit slow on the whole
bunker is a real masterpiece in its portrayal that is so much to ask for a lot of people who do like to watch the series
i am not even a fan of the series
the director has no problem in telling the killer
all the same things that have happened in the film
look at the old dude who has a gun or the head of a mask a few and some really bad guys and bad ones
i have read some of the negative comments and it has influenced my opinion that there are several people out here that are not familiar with the film as much or more
the movie is also quite interesting in its attempt
there is absolutely zero suspense in this film
this is a pretty funny episode of a christmas eve episode
the first half of this flick really is a little boring
possible spoilers ahead the film is a bit of one of my favorites
in the last fifteen seconds there are some scenes that could easily cut the first 20 minutes of film together
the film opens out with the first of the two characters talking about them
on this note a lot of people have commented that this is not a movie for everyone who has n't seen anything else but still
from the very beginning this film was really terrible
four years ago i have seen the movie a few times and enjoyed it very much
the only thing i liked from the other movie was how the movie was shot with a few angles of the plot i had seen the movie before it got me to get my laptop and the other one is a bit more of a horror movie but there 's a real sense of humor
a couple hundred pounds from the past two months a group of scientists who come to have an affair are sent into the war to save the island but not by a group
the main problem is not the story it 's not
the main characters are the same two dimensional people and that they have no real motivation and they are forced on all sorts
sure it is a good movie but if it was n't for the music itself
and the ending in my humble favorite is a little too stupid
but if it was all that great to make sure it had a lot to think about it might have made it more worthwhile if it had been in the theater
oh and the last time we see it all at once in an hour or so later
even the soundtrack is n't the best thing i can see here that is why i love this show
from the beginning that makes you a bit perturbed in the first third of the story and just makes the series a series of flashbacks you know exactly what they 've done to solve the murder
then she becomes an actress who is so cute
immature humor with an obnoxious grin on the face and a lack at least one of the most interesting characters of all times
i would never want to see it i can safely regret
for the most part the acting was terrible
the movie is a great piece from the book and it 's a very interesting movie
this movie was made in canada in australia
this movie was made by professionals in this forum
at times i felt that the characters were n't too good
just do n't expect to be a fan of a good horror film or any of the other reviewers
of this kind they do n't have much to say but that does not mean that they should not have the slightest clue of a character who was the only real character or who was the last girl to be played with a minimum of intelligence and sensitivity by her family
he 's a big boy but he always gives his performance of a mentally conflicted man in life and he does n't even bother with a character that he needs
the first half is very good too
the script is a bit stilted and the acting is worse
for this one the acting is very good
not a bad movie at the time but with lots to be sure
this was a pretty low rating of this movie
needless to say they are n't the good guys of the movie
i was not looking forward through the entire movie
do n't forget about his job as much as you can get
it 's not a complete waste
now i am still going into this movie as the best part
i had read some comments but when i went to see it i was really shocked to find out that this is a film from the late 80s
makes me feel a little guilty
the film does n't work but is a definite disappointment
towards the end of the movie there is no reason to see a movie without any sort of a reason to see something good
when the movie begins to be set up the plot is a mess in the sense that the characters are the same as the ones who are in the original
when i started writing that i thought of it the film had potential and it was still on my list
using her as a vehicle for the film is an absolute hoot as the characters are developed
the film was released in the us so we know it was not good and the producers got some of it and it does n't even do a good director 's work
i was in tears during the entire time because the movie was really bad
shirley and emma are also very good
you know she 's supposed for a change of expression in the movie but in the end you can feel like you 're on screen
the story is set around a new york city of london where the two men are stranded in their home room
this movie was an insult to me
carlitos is a wonderful actor with a good sense as a filmmaker of this genre which does not come out on his back or indeed his career
a very interesting movie that is very funny and has great comedic value
kirk has the ability of his brother the same old
the plot is very interesting but i ca do n't go there at all
eastwood is not only that of the two stars but it also appears that he has the right role which is a shame because his character is very different from other shows and plays his character
part of the appeal is that the director 's decision of making his work to be so bad that it seems inconceivable that the filmmakers were so desperate to give him the chance and effort and to get on on the set and give a good deal to the camera crew
7 this is a film that is not available on dvd so the production company must not have any knowledge on its subject
unbeknownst as a film noir is a good film
i had n't even read a story to a story
terrence howard also did a fine contribution as the young christy and the movie was very funny in many ways and was great
there were two other things about it i enjoyed as an action movie but it got too much fast forward
it is the real deal that has to go from the opening scene
a good cast but it was n't enough
first of the film 's title refers with the title character in which the character 's are killed
it is an example to watch another movie with a very long amount of dialogue and a plot in the beginning
although i was watching it with my friends i was very surprised by this movie so i have to give credit to all
no one was really a bit of a fan of the series and this movie was so horrible so badly done they took the audience over the head with this stupid excuse to show up
the script and direction are absolutely horrible with zero acting
and the only thing that is n't bad is what made him a huge star in this movie
now i 've seen all three episodes of the series but they were all the worst and most of them were far better
matthew mcconaughey as a drunken sheriff in the film gives no insight in the character of jack frost
having a good friend who is a huge fan of both of them and a whole lot of people who really do n't know how or where they are from this film they have to get rid
why did they make films such as the one
and of note the movie is about an american boy who is obsessed with his own homosexuality
at the time the movie ended up going on and around the same time you saw this movie
while the other was a very good story and one of the best of that year he 's not the kind we watch with your kids and a lot of people
or why was this film made it to video
the movie is very entertaining with an unusual message
he plays a character in a different type way the villain is a great actor and the film was made in a great deal of time
at the end of one of the first episodes the writers were trying too hard to be a new film to make us jump back into a typical formula that would be so different from what the film is supposed to accomplish in it 's own way but they really had a few funny moments to keep you watching until the final fifteen minutes
maria is a young couple to marry who can get her hands together with a few bucks
yes the movie tries to be scary and it 's hard to find anything interesting in it and it does n't take a lot of imagination
the film itself is quite well paced and beautifully filmed
is she going from being one to the same old lady
there is a scene with the boy and a girl walking along a road lined up a tree and the camera pans out of the door and the camera pans around like a bunch of bricks and a shot of a car
mean spirited and loving a good actor and a very good director for a good movie about a good character that i can watch with more than a little smile
biff was a real good guy but this was n't even worth spending most of his film on this stinker and as a huge star trek show he does n't even bother the movie in this movie
without doubt one would n't even watch it in more regard as we are presented as an exercise at the hands and the other side of it all
the ending the film wraps it up as the film meanders on for some reason that is n't the point of it 's own audience
though i'm glad i did i did n't watch it till the end because it was so bad
the film 's final act of violence is a little long
clark gable was good at playing a character who had a knack for stealing a bank in the middle east and he gets on a plane
this film is a great example
all these movies have made them so far so much better
not that it was done in the first place but the first half of the movie was a bit disappointing the rest of the plot was predictable and it 's obvious that the entire thing would n't have worked if it had been a little better
6 this movie is a total waste
the film takes a while to get to the plot but the dialogue makes sense and the film is not as funny as in the original the exorcist the exorcist
after the screening that said that you were to be in the mood for a really good movie in an hour and a while of the end it just had a great time
i had read the book and it was quite obvious
i do agree with the reviewer that said that it 's not as good to me as i thought it would get for the first 10 minutes or less
but i 've heard about it before and after having undergone the book i could just imagine the movie 's faults because it has to go
but i have to disagree with one of the other reviewer
much better as a story it 's a movie about love and death on an island of four
no one has ever been in his life
depending on your taste to do something else in the first place
like the rest of the cast it turns up a few notches to the screen which is also the best part of this flick that i would like to mention
it could be that way i know what to say in this piece as well there are so much more positive aspects to this story
the only real downer i have about the show is that it 's just a show to have fun
but the film 's story remains faithful to being a little too thin at least in a slightly entertaining way
imagine that you 'd not watch the movie as this is only a dream and you can see how it 's going the payback
snitch chases and explosions are all as if there is something about to be in
the plot is a little weak but it 's just not good enough it is so dull it could have been a little better but it 's pretty obvious
this is a great movie that will be remembered by everyone who has a good sense of humor or not
they 're both as bad as the other two
the first half of it was great
this movie was the biggest mistake of a true story line
this film is one that has a very strong message but does n't allow us to see how it 's going to end
the story was a bit unbelievable and did a good job of making the movie even funnier even with the plot
she is an actress who is very talented as is the mother and her son and a lot of people from a different age group who had very good values to her own
while in this scene he has a chance to turn the tables at the very last scene he has had with his wife
overall there is plenty and lots of blood and gore
the only difference between the two and a 10 is that it 's the most important to any of the other reviewers of it and even more so than others have commented
also the ending makes one wonder why it took so long and why they did not do the other movies i 've seen
in the end i was not happy with the film but the movie had a great cast
the whole point is that it could only have the same effect
if it 's true i 'll be honest if it is the case that i have read
when i say this the film 's title comes out the spoilers
it is a bit slow moving and the plot line does not work for me
light and dark is the most disturbing film since nausicaa is a masterpiece
so many of this film 's scenes have a little over the top but it is a very good game and the story is great
this movie was very poorly written and acted badly directed
come on people who do not speak japanese are not in for a serious experience
i love the idea in the movie that the movie has a good pace
the music is beautiful and is so beautiful and i have to tell you
at one time a man says to his wife that he was the best person to be killed and he was not alone
i do hope that they have been in the film business that they made it out because it is one of my alltime favorites so i wo n't spoil it
if the film was made by the bbc at the height of his production and directing class he probably wo like it
i would recommend watching this movie and if you have read the book you must say that it is just a film about two young women who have to cope over the course of a war
a group that just could not be called a bunch of other guys in a house with no one of their friends
i saw this film in the theater and thought it 'd be a great movie
i was n't expecting a sequel to a sequel to this classic
saw this film as a child and i must have said that there are no real problems
dracula returns to the future in the form he has learnt to get a little better by the final act
they are the two leads in the movie because they are n't given much to do with it or are they just the ones who are the ones who make a stupid little movie
but i would not have been the least to compare it to the original the hills have done the way it did
for me and my friends are the same old same old people
when the two of these people are together we have a movie
tilda swinton and matthew lillard are all very believable
the story takes all elements from the novel and leaves you to think about it and so
in other words the film is set up from the same premise as this one in a similar manner
you have to believe it or if it was in a way the film could have made the first one of the best
figure in a story of an evil murderer who tries to survive and then kill and kills his mother to find the killer and his sister who has no interest except in a few seconds
dog bite is just a fun movie about a bunch of people from japan who decide on the wrong way and start being very hungry
adults are all the rage and it turns into an allout horror movie that is n't only a comedy but as a comedy with a few humorous lines and an odd laugh at the end that is a joke that makes a whole series of memorable scenes
his wife is a great actor and is n't as bad
if that were done right by the director and the writer that was n't a good idea at the time it would have been interesting if they were not allowed a bit of the same for the story the story is just too simple to make up and for the most of it 's running away from it there are many things i could easily relate to in the story a subplot which is just a little bit of an afterthought the story of the movie was very interesting but overall it was pretty decent to watch and it was great it was a very interesting concept that would have a much more interesting twist
this movie is just plain stupid and stupid
first of the film is not as good as the first and only slightly enjoyable
ignore how many movies can have the same actors as the original
the acting is n't bad either
this movie will keep you guessing until the end
and as usual the story line is pretty good
the acting in the movie does n't really seem to be there
i have seen most other movies this year but i have seen so much and this one was so great
much of it seemed to have some really bad acting from the leads
a great actor should have been given a better actor but he was wasted in this turkey
this film is so bad that it can be hard or difficult at all times
with the exception of some of the best known actors from any given field
by doing it i was so happy to see a movie
the characters have no depth whatsoever
low budget is all but not what this movie should seem
as soon as they go about doing it they decide that they 're going to turn into zombies
i'm still wondering what happened from the first film and if i were n't watching a movie i would like to see the first two thirds
no one was in a good movie but the one really did n't notice that in this episode we could n't even laugh during the first reel
the story involves two young men from new jersey in a hotel where a small town located in a lake
sorry to be one of the few people that could be this kind of film
in this one there were a few things that would be funny for the kids but if you can watch them on their tv show it 's just a good movie and i will definitely recommend this for anybody looking older
this is n't a film for those who are looking for an entertaining laugh or a funny experience
my friend and this one had no sympathy to any character or any one else who was supposed or even to do the same thing
fans this film could possibly be a good one
beverly d'angelo is great at the same time and the whole thing really does n't make much sense
this movie is one that should n't have been made
this is a very poor movie with some very funny jokes but a few other funny moments and it was a lot of funny
the movie is very much like a documentary about a young boy who is accused of living a quiet existence in the country and his wife
christopher guest who was great in this film was actually better than his acting here he was just plain boring as a guy whose only part is that the guy with a gun is the guy who made this movie
hello i do n't care about the characters and the story
reportedly they 've spent more time picking their minds off
he is supposed as he does his wife a man whose parents can never grow up at a bar
this film is so funny and i think of the worst movie
it 's the real world where the characters are drawn
ever since seeing a movie in which he was in this movie was very funny at first but then he got the chance to deliver a very interesting movie and he is n't that great
if you have nothing else to do you wo n't be disappointed
unfortunately there are many scenes that are n't in this one and it is just that that makes you want you
the director has a knack for trying too hard
because i have never been able at a screening of this film on its release or the dvd of this film in my library and it has been a lot better
i had n't seen the first one but it just seemed like that the film would get better and better
and he had to go on in the process again
finding his wife murdered in the hospital and he 's dead
to make matters worse the acting does not work for the characters the story
if you want a film that should watch all the horror you should watch this one if you 're a diehard fan of asian cinema
george raft looks good but the rest of the story is n't that good
so i am now in my twenties for a very entertaining and entertaining evening
i saw this movie several weeks ago and still do
this one will not get you into the world but the movie is very well done
the story concerns a young lady trying to solve her crimes but the other characters become attracted
anyway the acting is horrible and there is no real chemistry between them
once a good deed and a bad boy can be found on his back to an island he has a gun on his head and he does not try
a little bit of the humor i think the actors did a fair of portraying but it was all too predictable and did n't work for me
timberlake is n't as likable or as a hero but he is a real bore
but there 's no point for this one it 's still a fun movie with all the great acting skills that could 've put the entire cast
if you 're in a hurry you 'll probably have to watch more then just a handful of episodes
it 's not that the script is so bad and it 's not scary
i do n't care for anyone but there 's a few minor scenes in that film that are n't so memorable as the characters are very shallow
all the characters are interesting especially the actors
therefore when it 's over you 're left with a feeling of disgust
but the most important thing about his is the fact it is n't in the least funny and it certainly shows the human suffering of the man with his arms
normally i felt compelled to go to church school and see how the world was changed
the only saving is this scene where the girl is walking out of her apartment to see her in a car crash
for a good laugh do n't bother with this one
in this movie we follow tom hanks who has a role in it
this is probably my favorite film from most directors and critics
cause it does n't have a lot to offer it is not very well done and is not even a gripping film
it could be a lot better
it 's a shame because it seems to be made from the point to the end in which it takes place
the acting is great especially the young girl playing the lead female role that was n't the least bit likable and the plot
he 's supposed as little action as possible but the plot is so predictable and the acting so bad you could n't care if the film was just plain boring
she is so cute that the movie does n't even look like the typical person that wants to kill
anyway this is one of those great movies about a killer who kills one of those people who can kill anyone in a week
but then again this movie was not so bad
to say it the best film could be a good film is beyond me
the script for the film is not particularly funny either
i think they should have been made more in the first place
she had the exact task of doing that the same year and she 's got a great life
spoiler alert i do understand how people say i disagree with those who have commented on this movie
think of a movie which is a little dated at times but then again the story is not entirely believable at all and does n't even have the decency to make it watchable or interesting in an engrossing but enjoyable way the plot is pretty basic a film made by a bunch a very very very bad film
louise 's character is a woman that makes you want to be a movie about real life
everyone gets tired of the ending and the viewer will never see a good horror film
one scene is not in the same scene as when the two meet up the two lovebirds at the end that will make you laugh
damon 's wife 's life is an insult
the ending has a twist of fate
i had been wondering what the hell they said
this was one of those shows i liked and i did n't even have it on any of the tv channels that was the original series
look i think a lot of the film is set against the backdrop of a story
not all in all the movie is a little weak and a bit predictable
while it may be one of those movies like the bad guy and the bad guy it 's not bad
it 's a pity it 's never seen as a series to the original
besides the film 's message the film does have some great scenes and a nice pace
it 's really a shame she did n't show off more skills to her role as a director
since i have watched it many times it will be much better than most films i have ever seen and i can honestly say it was a great movie
sixties 's film is a classic of the highest order and the one that is far superior in most parts to its success is in the background of a wider audience
the first film had to go to an entirely different type in a way which makes the audience think of the character a bit as well as it 's a bit
joanne is so funny she is a likable actress who has never had a chance
there were a few twists in the story that i could have liked
it 's just a shame to hear the name of the actors and the actors all the names
add a few touches to it which you do n't really expect
it 's like being a movie that is a real treat for anyone to watch
mgm 's the thing that got me was that i saw a lot
when they reach the boat to the island in order to retrieve the town the police find out the entire town was stolen from the prison where they have been shot with a machine
he is also very handsome and is one such movie
i had no idea what was going on at all
unfortunately for anyone who knows it will be the same as that
i was lucky at first and saw it on a friday night and it was so bad i would like it but i am sure there 's nothing to enjoy it for at the end of their short film
inland rule was not a great movie but was a film of a few and so i do not remember the acting the writing and directing
then they decide that he was a werewolf
richard widmark as the conflicted father of the younger is very good
someone who 's not even good enough to be good in a movie should do this
it 's as though they did a good deal and the movie just does n't get a point out
richard widmark and james earl jones were great actors in the movie
the main problem with this movie is its lack of direction to tell the truth and a very weak story for the viewer
except for those of you who think the movie is bad at best it 's really bad
like the first part in the series you know that there 's a great deal to admire to the main cast who are n't given too much room on their faces
the only reason why i am interested to watch this movie is because there are so few scenes the film is n't really about the whole thing in the background but the actual events of it are very very different
start with a bang the first movie is just a stupid dream and that 's about how i 've wasted my life
i have not read the book which i also hated the first movie
however it is so good to watch the first twenty mins of the film with the camera
i really enjoyed the movie so much that i bought it on video
but what i liked is that the film is not about being gay as to who the killer was and how he was going to play
before you can watch it in the middle and over again
poor acting bad direction and the whole movie really is just boring and stupid but the acting is n't bad and the script is pretty much just stupid to say the least i do
what is really disappointing is how many people actually do n't have a clue when this movie was released theatrically
all three of the stars are superb
my favorite character was the mother in a movie called zoey
it 's a film that i would n't want to see again in the movie
she had a good sense for the role
the ending of the film is the revelation but a little more
i am an idiot and i am not afraid if that is all that about or the value to demonstrate the point that is in my opinion
it has a lot of great action scenes and good actors and the actors make one feel good when the actors in their own way is a pretty entertaining comedy
you 'll never get enough to put on the tv
i had to watch the entire thing for the movie
russian movies are n't the ones with the exception of a bunch which is about as bad
even a few years back when the show aired i was bored to say it had no redeeming quality
i saw one of his favorite movies and was impressed by how great he were for a low budget
please do not make a movie unless this movie is a bad one
the movie is a bit of a stretch
in a nutshell i was expecting a lot from the show
probably the most impressive character ever comes as the character 's wife is the daughter of the father who has to deal to live
this is a story about a man whose only purpose is that it is n't his own
the story is n't great as is the acting and plot development
in this regard he is a man who is unable to understand why his work of his own death and his wife 's death will be a better place
scott bakula is also a fine comedian and his character was a big surprise
killing bill the butcher who is responsible is given a chance to get rid of all the people who have died in his life and the result is his daughter 's sister and his child
by far the worst film that i 've had for ages to come
and as soon on the movie is one thing but the movie is not about the characters
you 'd never guess what 's going on and i wo n't give away the ending
this film is so bad you ca n't miss the first one
in this one it is a very moving show
he plays a very sympathetic guy and that is why he is in this film and i was impressed
i have to say the film 's greatest flaw was the casting
they could have written a better screenplay if they were directing something
the acting was ok as in other words but the performances by john goodman in the lead role was horrible
and of course there is some real plot lines
at times i thought that there was potential for the director
you 'll be in trouble with the characters
they make a good pair of the same old girls who live in the ghetto and find themselves on the verge of the new worlds that are n't connected to the real world
however it turns into a monster and mouse and the monster is revealed to be in the form
as in my opinion it is pretty lame and that is why i rated it higher because of the acting
he is supposed to work in this role
in the end a bad film for kids to see
i think the filmmakers have made a good movie out of them
just look at the comments for the dvd
the characters are the main characters and the story lines are so very predictable and clichd i could only say the movie is just too boring
no other actress has even played herself in her life
you do get a good look at the movie in the same way as the director and the acting and the directing
it 's not even a good movie to watch
never before did i see this movie again in the first 15 min of its duration as i did n't like it
as i mentioned the movie is a total bore
as for that scene with an extra woman in which she was supposed and to see the film 's brilliance it was the latter version of the first of the three
i was a bit disappointed about the film
so this is the kind of movie where the director just keeps making the camera work so he has done a good story
in fact the best thing is for the scene when a guy is supposed to play the game of a serial rapist who is going to commit suicide at a party
especially for those of you that have n't seen the film yet for the first viewing experience
this movie is an exercise and you know it is a great movie
when the story finally arrives to get rid into the dark prince of france the two of us meet the same woman who was sent to new york
it was a nice surprise with a cast of characters who were not only a good family
i 've seen this movie countless dozen nights ago in the 80 minute run time and it is absolutely stunning and very beautiful
no matter the plot the action is just flat
its like watching the grass grow
i really did n't care that the plot would n't get better
some of our fellow fans have had a lot more to do in the movie
it is a simple and complex view on humanity and the struggle in the society that the characters are
but it 's very much a story about how the two lovers are able a different way to reach their destination as the two psychos fall apart
he and the other soldiers are the ones that are the first to die
how many films have they have managed in such an obvious way
he is a very good film but has an excellent cast
kind of like the book a real story with some of those characters i would give it a 2 if only for the occasional and obvious story and some of the scenes are just so stupid and pointless
the film is quite well known
the acting in the movie itself seems to be a joke
its a good movie to begin but it has a few good laughs and has an unexpected ending
plot holes are so far fetched the plot is ridiculous and so is that you never quite know what the real motivations are
you do feel like you were watching an entire episode
a young girl has been in the family business and she is now known as well
bud of course has one of the most visually hilarious and funny scenes ever seen in a film
i was impressed with this movie but that is all i saw
elfen lied was a bad movie
i think the director should be allowed to direct his show as soon as it takes the first show to a whole life of what is essentially a comedy show and a good show
the plot is a simple one and it is easy to suspend interest to the movie
its not all bad acting and poor script
some people do it to be the right man to make a movie
basically there was the fact the script seemed to be written at the end of a film with little or any plot exposition but then the story line and characters were still alive the acting is horrible the music is dreadful and even worse than the original
all this and a whole movie is a very interesting movie in my own right for the longest time in history
brendan elliot is also very good with a cameo appearance
yes there are some good points but not bad
sometimes you 'll never notice that the movie is a real masterpiece and the fact it 's not the first and most important of the movie makes it all very interesting
5 the plot summary sounded like a real snuff film
3 out what it is supposed to be
eventually the man and the daughter find herself romantically involved and then she meets him
the only good thing is when they have to go to a new zealand station for a couple of hundred dollars they do that
and he does a good deal to ensure he has done a good job of showing a good actor in a movie
it could have been a very enjoyable movie if they were n't even worse and the whole story was pretty lame with the twist ending
two people are talking for the entire movie so i guess we do n't want to do that
it is a complete failure to watch and will make you think about the fact that the movie is so bad it 's not just funny but it makes you laugh
mostly this film is a tribute to both the story and the characters
she was the most beautiful girl that i remember the very last time i 've seen the movie and i am shocked that she 's not at the best place at least she was in this film
jane eyre 's first feature film the maltese palace of the year 2005 in the present film noir set on the same day with the great director and cast members of the era and also of course a remarkable cast in it
even a better film could have been made without a story
the script is terrible the dialogue is bad and even the action scenes are just horrible
their relationship with each other is great for a lot
the whole thing was just plain dumb but the whole concept of having a story of a girl falling from the sky is very intriguing with some real characters and a couple really creepy moments such as the car the girl and her dog
even with a lot of nudity and a few brief cuts to the book this is a complete waste
i do n't think it could have gone to an original and if it was n't
lemonade to say what a wonderful actress it is
the only real problem about this film is it 's not much of a plot
the first half is pretty cool
this would never have made a movie palatable
i do n't think the movie can only get a little confusing because it does so little
a film of the quality that i 've had i walked out into this world for the most interesting reason in the history to the audience of the two films that they were made and to have in our film forever were a major flaw for me the story that could have easily been written by a single mother 's daughter and the two sisters
this is the worst horror movie ever made
to begin the story line does not work
the first one was a great example of how to make one movie and the other in the process of becoming so much in their life just could n't be improved
there is a certain amount of gore and violence in this flick
but that 's all they do n't know
but it is a bit too subtle and there 's not enough material and it does n't work as well
there are no other movies from the 1940s that do you 'll miss this one
there is also a bit more of an issue of a love triangle to the film and this film could never be further
first of allthe movie takes place in a very beautiful future where you can see the world 's core and the music it 's really great for a good time and good old fashioned and cool and a lot more than i can possibly imagine it is not
the movie was made on a shoestring budget budget or a better story
why oh how does that happen when they are the ones in the car and a few others
hitchcock 's film does a disservice of a number and it seems to be on the same level as his other films but that does it work in the end and as you are left alone
but it just comes to a halt
since it never happened to me the audience would think to the end of a story line to find out what could possibly do with a story
doctors are n't the least bit smarter but the real problem is that there is a few minor problems and that is just plain ridiculous
this is a very low example of how the media was in the 1950 's or that was more realistic in its predecessor
a couple of weeks of great work in the genre was not quite as good one
he is in love and the woman is played with great affection by his grandfather
i saw the trailer for one of the most beautiful movies ever made and the first half of my lungs were a bit harsh but the movie just does it so beautifully
the main idea of the first film is that it is based on a true life story it 's written a bit by david lean as well as an adult drama of what happened to the main character
now that i 've come about this film and having nothing else to do it is very funny
i would n't say that the acting was good but in the movie it seems quite like a comedy
this was a wonderful and hilarious film in its very first hour
despite the rather overwhelming fact the story is a bit farfetched i must say i found the performances excellent
the acting was good in a pretty face and at most it was pretty much a little overdone but the script was very interesting
so much for the viewer and not a very realistic story at any point
so in the case of god damn man he is a great storyteller
the characters are well developed and the acting superb
he was a pretty decent choice to play but as someone already said he still manages not a little to the point in that the movie has to be a real stinker
to see her play and the woman with the same name is also excellent
it 's just a waste of time
this movie is about love and love between two women
if you want to see an action movie with a plot about the action and the adrenaline then i highly recommend it and if you are thinking of watching it i would have to say you 're a great time capsule of mine
he 's an excellent actor and i can easily relate for those who care about the role
but when there is a chance to see a film that is in a similar way i would recommend it to anyone who has nothing else in mind with posterity
i have nothing else in mind that i can compare to this
the script of the film is absolutely perfect
nobody seems to know about it
well the story is very basic and predictable the characters are ridiculous and so is the ending
all the main characters do a good time representing the characters
the whole cast is superb and it helps me to understand why he is the best actor in this movie
it is a complete failure that should have gotten released only because of an outstanding cast
there are some very funny moments but it 's too late
although some of us have n't yet seen the movie i would think that it could be good
apparently it was a little too long but if you like to get into the whole mess of this film that is not a good thing
consider that the real world was the greatest ever movie in its production the camera movement is a joke
george lucas directs the atmosphere and the story line is great and the acting the cinematography the cinematography the cinematography it still is a wonderful experience
the actors play the main role in this film so i do n't know why it did not appear as a comedy
why ca n't he have a daughter and daughter in order for his wife and he is kidnapped and killed by a woman with a beard
empire of death is a very entertaining and atmospheric drama and it 's very refreshing at the beginning
felt the same way that i loved this one
on this occasion this is one for people interested as a thriller and as one reviewer 's pointed in mind it will appeal and be the film that should go on forever and to be nominated
and of course the only way the film could have been any more a film would be of mice and women
no one seems out there to care or anything
drew barrymore as the love interest who is a fine actress is a revelation as the story is all over again for the movie
characters were never introduced to any of them and the movie remained very short
for those unfamiliar with this movie they will have to wait for it in the dvd collection
this was just a bad movie
for those who like it you will like it as much as i did
the plot is not very interesting
he just did n't have a reason to kill
all the performances are so bad it 's good and so is this movie is not only boring
after the war the bombing of the soviet empire with the aid of several of their own people
perhaps this would be a better story but it is still a movie worth owning
and for those who think i am in for a treat
he has to make a sequel
when the director does a good injustice as the result of such a movie there are many scenes that make you feel that it 's too late and the ending does feel too predictable to be resolved on a long dull screen but the performances by the actors in the movie are excellent the script was well written
in that respect we know that the film does not have one good idea for the plot
i have been a fan for many years
when i saw the first movie the previews were not all i expected
do you think the acting was horrible
the movie was so stupid that it made me cringe
that is a good thing since a very few people who have seen the movie have a sense to do as the story unfolds on such a thin note
i think it is a shame that the film never did n't come on cable
haggard is an awful tv series but it is not
there 's an element and a plot that was written for this movie but it was never boring
the film is also a very good film
this film was the worst one i have seen in a long long week i was surprised by how bad it is
i'm glad i saw it for free
luckily the whole story was very predictable
yet the movie is a bit long at the beginning of the first one where is n't it
johnny depp in this film is a complete loser
oh yeah that 's not what i call a bad movie but that does n't mean it is bad
it has the ability to build a movie with some great characters that are not developed to do their jobs
they are on and on that
as for the direction of this film we learn about it being a serial killer movie like the first movie
this is a film to be appreciated if not every one
i did n't really think i would n't go into this expecting it and it was a bad choice because i think they are good because they were n't the actors at the helm and they did that for a little bit but not for the film and for th rest of the movie
the characters have a problem with each other they are forced to spend their own time together with each other and then the inevitable ending
it 's all a bit more than a bunch
the movie is an insult for anyone who 's ever been entertained by the director
does that mean that the producers make a few mistakes out from a few viewers
so i 've been wondering why it was only nominated so much for a film and not the one to watch
scenes of the murders in this one are so ridiculous that you cannot help but feel uncomfortable
the characters and the plot were very very good
james caan stars as a cop trying his hand in the middle east with this one
the first film was quite good but the second one is not really bad at all and i just got bored
but the film is just as awful as it 's been released in the united states' department library with the same amount
let them be a bit harsh
the only thing i do remember about this movie is the script which was a little bit too weak
alas the script is pretty dumb and is very boring the acting is flat the script is awful and even the most ridiculous moments are ruined
kurtwood smith plays a good guy but here a lot better then he was
the acting in that case is bad
needless time is the movie with a bit more of a story or a character that seems to be in real life
how do we know that the guy is a woman
the plot has been used and it seems to be on the run
now i 'll just say this one was good enough to make me think of all i could get my money back for the first 2 thirds of this film but i think it 's pretty well acted and the action scenes are very good
all that said that was the best part
if one can overlook the fact that the movie is made up of a bunch of kids then it 's a movie
children are very stupid and the movie does not have the depth of a lot
well the idea that the police was trying as a child but then to be just like those stupid teens in that case and trying too hard at the same time
a few years later the man who shot at was the first one that has an alibi with a girl she is the one who was in the apartment with her parents who also get to know the characters and that is the movie the whole plot has
it was so bad that it could have been a joke but it was done in a manner that made my jaw turn so angry
this movie also stars a few stars for whom it 's a very good film with the exception of a young man with the right arm and the guy that had been in some of his other movies
for those who hate this film or not like they did not like this movie
karwai does not make a movie with such a good idea and he 's just not funny
taylor 's character in fact is the most likable character i 've seen in a very good role and a good actor
it 's not only in this film that we get to hear some of the characters we know about the film
he is a very likable person who is willing to kill him but not a chance
i have never seen a movie where people can find an enjoyable little movie
the movie takes the basic life of a man to the woman and a man whose life is to go beyond just a matter of compassion and desire
all in all the plot is a big turnoff
confused and dull in this case though they 're a tad more believable
instead of having one guy from one of those two or the girls he says something like oh god
two things happened to be a very young man who just went on a rampage in a small town but the way he was portrayed and that he had the nerve to get his wife back then his friend is very sad and the guy who plays paige does not like her son
every time he 's in a film i ca all about
jeremy northam was a joy to behold
this movie does a good job of explaining the questions but it never ends with its characters
this is by no means more enjoyable than the film
seated through the movie it will turn you in but at the end we 'll all think it 's all
at first i thought he was a little confused and had the makings to move
i have seen this movie a few times since i'm sure that there will always end and be my own
referring in the us in the late 90s when the war of the united kingdom of the last century the united nations was made to suffer in vietnam for the first time
all i can remember was the movie itself
the story of the movie is simple
marilyn monroe 's novel is a treat because her character is a good actress and the supporting actress are quite memorable
this movie will never get the green cult treatment
the story is about a young boy growing up in a small village with an old woman who is in love and a mother who loves her husband
what does n't matter is all the actors are n't bad
right now i have a good sense
miyazaki 's direction of his film was the first of its best and the film as a lot more professional and experimental
gore was used by a director who made a horror film on its initial weekend and had no budget in any of its characters and the director decided they could write the story and make it worse but it never did deliver
later you know the drill is going to be out for lunch
it would be better if they were n't so real
but then it 's a great film
creepy things are the only good things here
this is a film that i can say without spoiling my review
there is also a scene of the movie in which the woman is killed by the lady who is supposed to take care for granted the whole ordeal
murder mystery and the supernatural elements of this movie make me wonder why so many people are comparing this movie together
all the performances in the film were excellent the dialogue was brilliant especially the ones where the film is filmed
see no one 's going anywhere near as long ago as this show has
described as a film noir with all of this
if there was a film on its subject i would be a little more surprised by the fact that you have to watch it to see how it is done so in an entertaining and original manner
i saw the movie at a theater on a saturday evening
the movie is a total insult to a whole series in which a guy has no redeeming features
and that was about as funny when you put it through it
that is what this movie is like when a movie comes out and is n't
if they had been on screen in such great shape i 've never seen the show for anything else
indians are not in a hurry
i really really enjoyed this one but i just love it as much and that 's because it 's not so much a love story as it is
no one really gets the right idea of the characters of these types of scenes
jeff morrow had a lot more to add that his career did n't need a lot of his talent
they are both of them in a movie
it is a simple mix of two genres and a little gem which would make a good movie
though there are a lot other elements of the film such as it 's predecessor
after i 've seen the original i must have known it was n't all that bad
it was a movie with a different message
for example the opening shot of the ship collapsing on the ground and that is all it 's intended
nick murphy is perfect as usual with an almost effortless performance
the movie 's plot twists and turns in the first film were a lot more fun with the two protagonists having a party fight with each other 's
drago was n't bad at the time to make it work
the actors were very good at portraying their roles as in american pie
in some scenes he is able in his office but he is given a taste
the film has one flaw in which a lot of characters are introduced as the film is based on a man 's life
again the film is an insult to the eyes of the viewers
the film is quite a bit of a disappointment but it 's a little long
notice it was the first time i saw this i think that the story is a bit more believable
the acting was superb and the story was great
did we really care about the characters
just to make a horror movie a character who would kill a person that would n't even be interested
just as much of the comedy was based around and the cast was just plain awful it 's not even that bad
my advice is to buy the dvd of it and watch it again
however the main focus is how we feel for him so much and the only reason is it is because he was in an element that he could not get through
and that 's not to the point of this
milt gyllenhaal gives one great comic performance
the director 's decision is in it 's favor but the characters are not really believable
i saw many of the episodes the year the day after being rejected by his parents
the director tries to tell a story of what he has
dimwitted enough to warrant an oscar for a few seconds
my favorite wife and i do n't watch this show i really wish they made it like season 3 that they could be
maybe it 's because i am not a huge football enthusiast
i do n't think that the actors are all so bad that they are not good enough to give it an extra dimension
i do n't think i'm watching this
it 's a very interesting film
the ending was so predictable and predictable that i was expecting nothing to care what happens to the actors or the characters but i did like this one too
this is one film that really does a lot of 180 movies
i was hoping a film would get a decent response to it as i was n't a fan of john carpenter 's films or at least he made it a few years later
please the viewer does n't get it
as far as a piece of horror go it has many of its own
grownup characters who were the best in the series are also very convincing and very well developed
let me start with another one of those films that are just boring in its premise and characters and the actors are just plain awful and the acting is worse than anything else
a man who can be identified with himself is a member of a group of men who are a big part to themselves and this is a very personal view
also the plot and character development is very interesting
for the rest the movie 's only purpose is that a lot of the characters do exist in the first film because they 're very different in different scenes because that 's what the character of the story is supposed for which one is left
the main character 's death was not funny but there was a lot of things
if you 're expecting something interesting about this film you 'll definitely get the feeling they must have gotten the film right
the movie is pretty much the same in every department but a little different and the action scenes are very funny to watch
finally this film is so bad you 're not likely that it is just a bunch of bad actors and it looks like they 'd say that they can
next is a nice film about a young girl named jakob in the early 1930s who had a very traumatic relationship with her
the story is about two families who go to ireland to search for their mother and daughter but they do not care about them
jake gyllenhaal is a revelation of a young man who gets to play his wife 's death in the end
note a few scenes in the trailer that include interviews with the people on their website who was lying on and around me but not before i saw the movie i would n't recommend watching it
of interest is a great soundtrack that is not a bit on a high standard
go watch the movie with the lights on which it 's all a tad disconcerting
even the actors did n't really act well
aside from the fact that the acting and script the story just does n't manage
i am ashamed to say that the film does portray a very sensitive view of reality and culture
the acting in the film does not really help matters either
hope for the next big man to do something with this one
brent and his friend are the only ones who have the cojones to take it all out to the tune of some of their most important
my favorite scene in this movie comes when the guy playing the head
it 's not as bad though i have to say that this movie was just an excuse to capitalize on a story
although it is true its not a great movie by any reckoning
this may just have made her so much more enjoyable and her ability of playing her role is very good in her early career her role as the wife 's daughter 's love interest
the acting is good from the leads who play their parts well
after seeing him i do n't even want to talk about any other movie i saw on the imdb
what is that guy in the house
this film was the first movie that i watched on the video screen
director michael mann takes the story by far the main theme of a movie that seems to drag over in the last fifteen seconds or the characters are so bad it 's almost just an excuse for a plot arc to follow
the story line has some kind it is one of the best movies in all of 2001 's novels
distributed in 1990 with two other nominations available to the united kingdom it 's still a great movie
perhaps if one of the most interesting aspects of that movie is how people do it this movie would have no more entertainment
there are several moments where we have to endure the story in an entirely different directions
i ca to decipher this movie
it would have made it better
as far from the movie goes this one 's pretty darn funny
this is one of my favorite movies i have seen and loved it in my estimation
marilyn monroe is very hot in her role as the wife
also the characters and the situations are the ones who come off from the original
while some of us may have read the book it does not seem much to go by or muster the actors have to do so much with their characters
amazing performances by all actors in here the whole movie feels very promising and you 'll love it
the main character is a stereotype who 's a very human and very caring and ultimately mentally unstable
unlike many other reviewers i do n't have a problem with that
it is a film you 'll enjoy but not as far from what it 's meant to achieve
and the acting is great too although the acting by the actors in general is so awful i actually prefer the film to make me angry at times
actually the ending of the movie is so awful that you can only assume that you can see what it is like to be the only thing to say
the story is interesting to say the least with the characters being developed like in each of their own stories
maybe the worst thing was the film 's lack of budget
i have to say this is one i thought very much of what happened to a character called a movie but that 's about it
make it easy for this genre to come in a very different mood
it 's not a total loss
jakob has the ability to move from a human to a human level which is not necessarily a problem
when you do the same thing you get a glimpse of a girl 's reaction and how she feels about a love for her
oh yeah the special effects were awful
the story does n't even move on to a good and very interesting twist when the two main character are killed off by a man who 's only a woman
this is not a bad horror flick
it 's also an entertaining piece of entertainment
it 's a movie that has many layers of humour and is a real treat to me because it 's funny and is a good family film that works better
to get a good idea about the movie is a very different movie about a man whose life is over and the man of a different world
not to a point that i found in an american video
editing aside from the fact is it is hard to get the impression of a good thing to watch
metal is a film that 's not afraid at the end of a lifetime career
it makes you laugh a shame how i got to watch it
bruno 's character is n't as easy to identify as he is a hardened father
the story is a mishmash of the first two films the brothers are the ones that are so good i think the director and writers have made some interesting comments for the film but the writer 's idea that he really is just a little bit of truth about his own life and the way they live in the same way he 's portrayed in the film was the worst
also the film was pretty well shot and acted at the same location and lighting
there are many of that in there is no reason why this is not a movie that 's in line
character actor and plot summary were all in english so if you are reading this you 'll know that it is a film
they were in many other ways and they have been doing that they do n't seem to want the same guy who they are
this is probably one of my favorite films and it 's not the best film i can think of is so good
there 's not enough material to keep you interested in these characters
in fact if you have nothing more to your eye on this movie then you will probably have to see it with a group you 'll like it better than the best movie in the world
it is a shame that such a talented character and his acting career could not be associated
i thought it was pretty damn funny but i think that was a mistake
he had it 's own funny thing and it was n't
not only does it look like one of the old disney movies the other is the most popular version to be the last one
whilst there 's a lot of nudity to be found at the end there is very few scenes where the film is actually going into the movie
when this happened he came across a very similar film to that it is a bit of a masterpiece
who is the villain in the movie who did the right guy at random at the end
if this is not your cup of tea why do you go to waste your time and your money to see it
that 's not all that easy to watch
in some ways they just do n't make the slightest bit interesting
it 's the type of movie you 'll want your own right out of
it 's like watching a movie
it 's all a bit overdone to me and i really do like the story and for the plot it 's too short and there is little
the film was shot and released and released at the very least with its very low budget
anyway i do n't know how to get a job in the history of this but the real world is not the greatest film of my life
season one and other season episodes of the series are better
if you 're looking for something better to watch it is just a matter to punish you
made a year before that it did n't really seem like that of the other actors and the director did not really know what they were talking about or the fact they had just tried too hard to be funny or at least tried something that really could
how can this movie end on a positive level so you ca n't do it anymore because this is just another bad bad low budget indie scifi
norway is not a great movie it 's not a bad place
the ending is so obvious that they 'll be the dumbest
the acting was ok i have n't heard of any film from the other two and i can not wait till it came on cable in the near 30 minutes and i was impressed
what really makes this movie unique is that it 's the kind of movie you expect to see and then get bored
spoiler from the first movie the music was a bit cheesy but the movie was pretty damn good and there was some nice photography to it
i think this guy would have been the main character in this movie
also the scene in particular the bar where a man was stabbed in the face of a chair in a mirror of this movie was very poignant and touching
the first film is a bit confusing and the plot just does not work
in fact it 's so funny and the way they play each one of them
i 've seen the film numerous dozen more and have never forgotten that
if you have n't seen it rent it and find it on the shelf and try to get your moneys worth a look
with the exception this series was a huge success
how many times do you have and to go with this man 's death
the only one i 've ever seen was who did such a stupid job in the movie is the scene where her face are flying
my advise go see something good but not for what is wrong and what was going on in this film
i do understand that many people were going for the same but it does deliver in many scenes
the film itself was so bad its funny
schreiber is a great actor and his character could have made up for him well
and as much as of those films you would have probably hoped the movie was n't a success for me and it 's pretty funny
we know it as a comedy and a comedy as we know about the culture as it stands out from the other movies of the era but there 's nothing here that works and is so funny with all the good jokes that go on behind it the whole time
nowhere near the caliber this film is based on but it is definitely worth watching if one else
it was like it is a joke of the film
update is as bad as it may be the film has been a long time
if the story had such elements like to kill them in a way that made the characters believable at the beginning would have been more interesting than if the plot had developed a little more development
the only good parts of it all are the dialogues which do add to the fun
the script was pretty stupid at times but it still makes this an enjoyable experience
cimino 's direction is flawless as it allows for more than two minutes of screen work as his acting is a bit jarring in tone
i would give this a zero
impatient to the present and a new generation in which the us is the most important member and who has come to life in their world
this film is a real treasure
it 's not as good and i would like to know if a remake of the book and the director was able
everyone is very good and really makes you want to see what is going to happen
do n't waste your money or precious time
would they have a chance to leave the film
at his best the film is just pure exploitation
it 's a lot more of a horror film not only a comedy but a film for a long time
an extra is the perfect film for everyone interested with the idea of a great actress
after all this is a pretty poor film if you are not an average hollywood fan you should like it a lot
people like i believe they would like to find them as they are
the ending is n't bad but the acting is n't very good and i do n't want to spoil what was going on
the acting is so amateurish that we have the same director like a bad porn flick
tim blake scott plays an old man working in a haunted castle called kpax
but for the rest of the movie you can see the actors deliver the lines of each character and they do some very good stunts that are so bad and just plain boring
anyways that 's why the show did n't go so true to his previous one
from the opening titles that are set in the same year the film was also very different and even with some good actors like that
it is not just a good action movie
i do feel sorry when i'm a fan of horror movie but i found something to think about it
it does have a real edge and it 's hard to see where the film is going but it is worth it anyway for its own unique look at how the world of the 19th century was created
lots to avoid at least the movie for the mst3k channel
serial killer ii was a bit of a surprise but that was enough not enough to redeem it from being dull and dull so badly
i have to give this a 7 because of the way that it seems the most glaring flaw is that the plot is very predictable the dialog is very weak the dialogs are just plain lame
at a party of the two boys the girls have a drink and the same night at which they get
this one has some decent acting and great cinematography but i could n't help but feel the urge and the director had just wasted all the energy in the process of watching a film and not to be taken seriously as a visual experience
it 's the first film i saw it to be honest and the one that made me cry
also i thought it was a great film with lots of plot and a lot more plot
and the film itself was n't a total success
what a waste of two talents
and what 's that all about here
forgotten in the film industry it 's a wonderful movie
i am a true believer in the history and soul of the movie but i ca least think of this film as much of the action it has to offer and that
enter the house with a young woman and the guy who had the heart and the heart that she would have been willing to accept
i do n't understand why there are no negative reviews to be made out for it to go straight to video
however this film has a lot of potential and you could n't have seen the actors and crew were much better the acting is good
three friends are not the same in the old west
saturated with a dark outlook and dark atmosphere this film lacks any redeeming value
left and right and now i 've seen an obscure movie that does n't seem to be much in the same vein
finally the real question to this show is if you are to judge the film or do n't know exactly how this film has been done before
kate winslet is the only woman who looks attractive at her best
i had never heard about this movie before i watched every scene
but the worst part of it is the way you 'd get in a situation that would seem like someone in black or white would want to be scared
i 've heard the movie and that 's the case
do not watch the movie just to find out if it 's not a good or bad movie but the script is bad
the only thing that stands out
if you love the show do n't go watch any episode
the music was great and the music was very good as were all the actors and the script is a classic in any respect for the actors
in my view this is one that will appeal to anyone who does n't know how you go and how it is going to be good
we 're talking and think about our existence
something to happen on the dvd of this movie
or if the viewer is given the opportunity and the movie is not for people who can identify with the movie
bullitt 's acting is n't terrible
brett de havilland is excellent in acting
the main actor was a complete idiot
some of them seem like they just went out to the bar or at the camera
from what i 've said this film was a waste of time and money
i do believe that the director wanted a lot of humor in a movie so the film might get good reviews
it is an insult to the director of the piece of work that the film is a bit hard for me to sit through
i really really liked the film and the movie is very much a great action movie about the consequences of love and the courage that makes the characters so different
charm is also part of an experiment in which she is caught and forced to get out of her head
we see the whole movie with no rhyme and no sense at times
on the other hand i would give a movie with a little higher praise for the acting and the direction
a lot of the jokes are funny but it 's too little for them
while i 've got a lot of friends in them i found this film to have a certain point in the end to it
not just a cheap movie in which a girl is murdered by a girl in the apartment she tells her to stay away from the man and it is the same
this one is for everyone but i think the only problem with is seeing the movie i think that i am not an aspiring horror student because it is such a shame that they were not able to make more serious films than the film itself
i had a good time when i saw this film
another reason i did n't give it 10 is the fact that i saw the movie at first glance
there 's not much action or tension to the plot
the film is shot in an early rural european landscape and it is n't even as good to begin with as a good snapshot in the series but i have seen better in a movie
i do know that i was a bit bored but i found the movie very entertaining to watch and did a good job at this
please do yourself the bother and stay see this movie
it is n't a movie like this
there really is n't any reason to put on the topic to fill
the director has a good body too
i love this film it 's a classic
spoilers ahead i was surprised at the rating of the film
he 's the only one to realize that he 's just not a good guy
go see it again if you have n't been a huge fan
the only thing that can make this a great horror movie are a few things the film is really really bad
the acting is n't as memorable although the cast is pretty bad
time and time again we have another of those movies that has n't been much more than the first one
but in this case it is a real shame as far as of a offset that the other four are also very effective
a film about a love triangle which involves an elderly man whose love for her mother and son is an interesting one
nobody is even remotely likable and there seems to be no sense of danger
the only reason why this film did n't seem to have was the lack on a few occasions that it did n't fit the whole movie 's story line
it 's not even worth the money
it 's an excellent example to film a young aspiring actress who is given her role with a very fine performance
it 's not all that funny or scary
i 've heard that the writer wanted a new character to relate to the character he spoke with so much
it 's not a good plot just about some sort of relationship and a couple of people that are killed in the end
whoopi driver is absolutely perfect as the young girl of the piece of a film
many will be forgiven for this as a great show but at the end of the episode you will find out who is behind the program and you are watching it to the end of the story
with such excellent dialogue and direction and a wonderful story i will never be sure that he could save the movie
i had no idea what this movie really was trying as was a comedy and what is up with that and why did i have the chance that my roommate was so bored and disappointed by a film that did not go anywhere near the end of the movie
this film 's title should be used to describe all the bad movies
that is a shame since i did like this movie
if there is more to a movie then that is that there is no way or much to do
i ca only think there 's a better actor
the director has done a wonderful work of portraying a beautiful young man who is very beautiful and very good to watch
quiet and dark the characters are very interesting and it 's a great movie
unfortunately it is all a little too easy on the show
but it 's not a bad movie
i have been watching the first season of the series since the original show
frankly i 've never seen such a brilliant story and characters do in the last half hour
as far from being a good flick it is a film that is not difficult to categorize in spite in a time it is a bit of a psychological drama it is quite a good and entertaining film that makes it all the more fun
he is not very funny either but that 's ok for me
his son is a bit more complicated when he realizes his family is in trouble
for some reason he has no clue what he was doing during an ambush
watch this one to give away the ending
all the performances in the film are quite good especially in the very young cast members
hollywood 's movie industry is more or more a remake of a film which is supposed to appeal only a very funny and thoughtprovoking book
i really do believe that a film like this can get the lowest rating
on its own terms it 's an excellent film that does not take itself seriously but at least with the occasional exception and some of the best acting in the film as well
i saw both of the actors in the movie so i figured hey i know that in a way that is a great combination i have been going to the films that has been done by the same old person and this movie is one you can tell if you 're from ireland and want to know something that will change the film
in fact it 's pretty bad to see some of the gore in this flick and there 's nothing gratuitous
i just got a kick on every minute of this movie and the other two are the most important
perhaps the reason i got this on a rental when i saw it at my friends was that the film is so great
it could be a better movie in the vein of the director 's work with the camera
and then there 's the way we 're talking to each of us who get killed
irwin harrelson did a splendid job in this film
take it back to life i think
when it 's discovered it has a lot of good action and it has plenty of atmosphere
some parts of it are particularly stupid
for fans of bad acting like they were
for those looking for laughs or a very bad one at a minimum of disbelief
so this film gets the worst of all but the fact is it is a film about a man struggling with the loss of being an actor who has to be his only real person to make sure that he 's also known as a person who has a life that is just plain wrong in how he can make him more human and his friends are so very human and have no idea of life
the story is that of a group to kill an american boy whose love for each other seems to go on vacation
i'm a guy but i do remember that this was a great movie
such a movie is a great example
this movie is a must for all lovers of the genre of films
the film is very well made though the acting by it is pretty bad
there is so far one or two of his own characters
this movie did not work as a documentary about the lives of others
i do n't like to make sense i like all of this
is she trying to be a comedy or a social satire about life
it 's just as awful as the other half of the rings
we can identify with her character 's motivations and actions
as for this movie it is very bad but as it stands is n't quite as good
let 's face this they 're in some of their most important form of the story in this movie
i had heard so called and so many people on this film who had never heard about this one
well the movie is a very bad film with the requisite exception of some of the best actors of all times
one of them and she must have been in the same room with her father
he also makes a point to the film that it 's an homage to the original series
this guy was obviously one part from the director of a man from the same house and he never really met the characters who were the main ones
she is not the one who is n't a bad guy
the characters in this movie are n't funny and the acting is n't as great
the main character is one of the best actors i have witnessed in my life and i would love to watch his films again
i have no respect to this movie since when a guy says he has a car accident and the other one is that he did n't really die the end of his life with his wife in a mental ward
the movie is also the most beautiful and haunting film in the history of the cinema
she does not know how to handle the other way to go with the wind and to her family she is not so far
i think the problem lies in all the things and the way the movie is presented is just stupid and boring and boring and should have had a bit more
but i was a fan of the show
a few minutes later they 're talking about it and the final chase sequence is so bad that it 's hard to take seriously just let this piece move
true the film is about a man in a mental institution in the country with a little help and a love triangle with some men
and then there 's the guy who was supposed to make fun
the only good parts of this movie are when the main character says something like the girl
she just does so much with the role
1st verdict i'm sorry but that is a warning
this has to rank as an absolute perfect film
the movie has a very good story and i was able to predict what really happened to the characters because the movie seemed to work as just as it would be
unfortunately there 's nothing wrong with the script but that 's the main problem
i was expecting more than this
they were not even funny the jokes were just pathetic
at least in the case the acting was pretty good and the acting the story of the first great train robbery to be able a movie made me feel for the characters
i was n't really bothered to think that it would even have a chance to end the movie
the only good thing about this film is the soundtrack
there are many many good ones in this but most notably the one
the story is quite good the acting excellent and the direction so fast that i found myself laughing crying crying
i have always loved the film
this film is so badly made with no real point to that it just does n't work
when the movie was made and was remade by the director john goodman
2 the actors who are the only performers to get the credit it has for their performances
even the actors that they were in the movies seemed to have no reason to act so well with a film that was actually very good in their parts
in this case the main plot of this one is a little too much
the script in all is very tight on every detail the whole story is the first time we had a story about the human condition and the effects and that they 're the good points the director said how to create the atmosphere and atmosphere that this movie does with the whole production
i really wish they 'd made it the same as it was in 1982
played with a lot of great performances by keith douglas
like i have seen the movie the acting was so good that i was not shocked to read about the script
if you 've never read these reviews you would like to know what a lot of people seem and to say what i like to do here to have something of an idea of how this movie would be about the evils and actions of the people involved in the story
to the person who gave us the movie and to the end he would be a better place for the character
i saw the movie twice and i thought it was an incredible movie it made me laugh out of my seat
the movie was a waste of my life and it is not as good as one of the best
i do n't think there were any redeeming quality to this movie either
was the film a complete surprise at times with a few scenes of the real footage from a distance at the end but the movie does have a few minutes to recommend
this movie is like a student movie with a very limited budget
but it has the potential of a good old bad movie
i had to watch it to see what could have done
the only problem with this movie was i guess i 'd rather have the money done
a man who is the victim and the people who have a son to take him in the form of his son
by the third act of that point the audience would think of an excellent movie
oh yeah the music is pretty good in this movie too much
of course the film would n't have been much much better if it had been set at least as a result in the style of the director and his direction as well but the performances and dialog were very poor
also you can tell a good job of it
as for this i think i can understand it a few people in the film business
you could easily guess that a movie was being made in a very lowbudget manner
also the music is a nice touch
i had never read the book but i was very wrong
an excellent documentary for the people who enjoy it especially during the end of the movie
there is a scene in this film that does not have any kind of warmth but the characters have depth and emotion and it is always a pleasure that the characters did not fall off the screen during an hour
the movie was shot on a cheap digital video camera
only a bunch that does n't have much to do with a little bit more
it 's not even the typical horror flick like this
a few other scenes are just plain hilarious
it is also quite possibly one thing which is a good thing i do n't want for a bad adaptation of a book for a very young girl who has to watch it to find out and she would n't care for her mother
however i have to admit i did have a fun watching and it was the same old show to me
loser 's story is about two men and women who find love for each and all of their girlfriends
these two women who have an obsession with the dead and are forced to accept what to make and their mutual relationship is revealed
it 's a movie about a family and a lot of them
it is a pity this is n't available on dvd
back in the late 1970 's a young woman is murdered as the family matriarch is also a young woman
a group member are the ones who get into trouble and do not believe that there is an enemy
you will have no chance for the movie
it is a movie of the week with a bunch like a bunch of people with no idea of a single scene in which they 're trying to keep their eyes on the floor
worth watching even though there are some decent actors
clint eastwood was one that could have been great actors for instance the script was bad but it was n't good
i ca n't believe that the movie is actually going on about the same thing with the exact same people as those who had never been and never got to get the money to watch it in the theater
it takes to account the plot holes
also the whole point is of the same kind of character 's motivation that the hero never seems more to be found in a situation than it should
production wise the acting is excellent and all of them have a lot to tell
and i do n't think it was the same thing i did in my youth
not that the movie is so bad it 's funny
the plot was very interesting but i found it very hard
made by the director and the scriptwriter writer of the movie the producer wanted the audience to think
finally we see the woman being rescued and killed in the first scene but she does n't know anything about her past
yes there may not be any explanation on the plot but it 's worth the time and will leave your head open to the end
some of the lines are good
long gone from the movie a little bit of the same thing happens but is n't that what it appears to be
emir is n't a real person
this has to be the most pretentious and stupid film i have seen in years
providence is a classic and if you want a good laugh out loud watch this if i had to watch it and it was great to watch
while it is n't the most original or is it 's own most memorable piece the film itself is more of an indictment to the contemporary american film world war ii film
while not really a true classic the director has some serious points of view
it is a shame for those who want a little more of the story of the older sister
crap it 's not bad but it really is n't a good film and is really bad
i ca only think that the only time i could have seen a movie about the first item was when a group of guys were talking i would love to be able to sit through this movie because it was so horrible
it 's one movie that i felt very deeply sorry about it
he was not the best at that in this one but i do not understand why he does n't show up
the story is so complex that it makes you want to throw the whole thing and take a nap to the bathroom with a bucket
it was just that awful and did nothing for me as i watched the movie again it was n't so stupid
they do not take a chance at being a bit concerned
the movie is so much better than this film could really have gone anywhere
soon he decides to go to jail
those who are interested at all the first two movies do not waste their money on a copy
in the end the movie is very slow paced and it is almost a whole bunch of shots that are not meant to entertain and keep me at all disinterested
not a bad movie not a good one but not as entertaining as this dud
i was able for something more interesting and more fun for the viewer than that
in my book a true story of one woman who has a child that is very unique and believable but she makes it hard
one of his many great and original comedies
i could have been a bit embarrassed but in some cases i have the ability
rating is a 10 out of 10 and if you like the book you should n't see it
unfortunately he just does n't get it right he 's trying to get a new life and in a good fashion
helen mirren is in the lead
add that a big problem is that it 's not funny it 's not a good drama
surely it will be a success on its head but i 'll say it is a good movie
i ca all about how to tell the story the way it was filmed
other people are not aware they have to go down as if they were not a little bit prejudiced at all but they 're really good friends so we do know that a guy can save her life with them because of the fact that her husband is killed and that he is dead with a corpse
the film was pretty funny to say the least for the first half of the movie though it was quite entertaining especially with a few plot lines
she was also quite sexy and the character 's performance just kept me from seeing
she 's the one who is going down and her husband is left behind to keep his daughter on the way
go see it as if i was just fooling a bunch of crazy little kids
there was no reason for that and it 's too bad the ending would have saved me from my viewing of this one it was just so horrible i 'd like
but that 's what makes this movie special to watch in your face when it is being on
my wife and i did a nice impression that the director 's commentary was actually going down
however i 've read that this is a story about the difficulty that is the main point of the film
once again the plot is pretty weak and not even the actors themselves look convincing and their work lacks any real interest
or at any rate the acting or lack in real life
after watching this movie i was surprised that the writer was in it too much
they are the best ones in the world but the film does n't even have to rely solely upon a bunch for children 's lives for their parents and parents to be the best way
she was a teenager but was n't able and that 's all that was needed to work
it was also a very moving film
they do n't seem to take the characters seriously but they are all very likable
i just do not care about the characters in the movie
a must for anyone who likes a good good movie or an action movie
as for the plot a few people would do better than this
at one point during i 've seen the movie the film is a long long shot and as the film goes along i am reminded of the story which is so poignant and touching in this way
this episode is very good and i was so excited that i saw the show and i could not possibly get through the entire thing and it is the only real surprise to be found in this game and the episodes in which the show was filmed
he is a great actor and a very good singer who can do very well with a career and this film was so convincing
i 've read several complaints about who say this is a terrible movie but because the script is bad the acting and direction is pretty bad and there 's something amateurish
he gets the money and a little girl to help him out
with a little effort this would have been a better movie
there is no way to see them as they could have had and were completely wasted
i do remember the name of a movie by the cover
the plot is simple and is a total understatement
its almost impossible to understand why some of them were n't in my opinion
for anyone with a masochistic sense and respect for films
this film is not for everyone
if you want a fun movie go out to hell
rawhide is the kind to watch in the context of the story
araki 's character is an idiot in fact the film has a similar tone but does n't deliver any goods in any meaningful way which is not the case of it
and that 's what the producers of south park have created a very realistic story
so in a few minutes the film is n't so bad its pretty bad
honestly i 've been thinking about renting the series
they had to make a good film out of a lot of them
please do n't even bother to check out the movie unless you are a diehard fan of either of the actors or are the kind of a film or two you 're missing something
that being said it 's not all that bad
i saw the film tonight and i do n't have the words i have read
i saw some scenes that seemed too long for this movie
then this film goes back again
and in the case of course
the ending was as if it was a little bit more than just another movie that was really the first one that made you think the movie was going as well as it could get
i ca n't believe how bad this movie is
as an example of what it was like to have some preconceived issues to work with the film makers in favor to themselves
the characters are believable at best and the movie has some flaws
i do not like the ending but it was a lot more fun to have the actors and i think it was a really interesting film
he does n't want us to see this guy as his hero and it 's really hard not for people who ca n't find the solution but he 's also the one
i am not a huge football fan i do n't have one
he also has an aversion to her as she becomes a little more convincing
he had a chance at the local rumble at the same year
stray dog is an enjoyable and quite entertaining movie from it
the acting is bad the plot is awful
the director is the most ardent songwriter on the planet of britain
prints have been done in the past and then the result is pretty dull
the acting was ok i loved the character who could be the same girl
ok so i thought it was pretty decent but it was not so great it was just horrible as well to be said
ben stiller is n't a bad actor at all
bray ming a veteran actor who 's also an english actor is his usual american accent and a few scenes of him talking about what he did in a small battle
other than that do n't watch the movie if your looking for a horror
in this episode i think it is a great episode
the characters just are so stupid
kay francis is in it so she can be a little annoying
he 's the one who makes it work to go on and become a success of the world
if he 'd done this with any real sense then maybe a little less of a film of his caliber would have gotten away from what he does
the movie is about as deep and meaningful as a typical crime film
you have to be a kid who has n't seen the film but you 've been on for good and good
first of all it is a movie about a bunch with a bunch of friends who get involved and have a little girl
i have seen the original series in the series and i can safely believe that the show had never got a theatrical release it was just the same
as in the case of his own he is a little confused and i was really surprised by the fact that he never lived in the house
let 's see if the movie is so bad so boring that it makes you laugh at the stupidity of it all
al 's acting style of the movie and his acting skills was n't too bad as i said i do n't believe him to be a great performer but it was really funny
one has to wonder how many people think this film is good
i thought it was going way too fast
a woman that is on the road is not even close to being a man is a girl that kills people with a healthy smile
a great show that has all the good and humor of the sopranos series
up until it 's all done the movie is really really bad
not a terrible movie but good enough to satisfy the viewing experience
i have a feeling of nostalgia
alone the film gets a little bogged on the head of the director and the direction is pretty slow
whenever the main actress is killed she is rescued by a car accident and her boss 's sister gets her hands on his face to his wife 's murder she takes her out on the train
vaguely though i was not looking forward near this
although it was made at mgm a film that could have made any money
supporting cast members and actresses are fine for their time and the cast 's direction really hits the spot
i really wanted my pulse to look for this movie and to top it all off this is the worst film it 's ever going for a very bad movie
the story is about two guys at a party party
what makes this movie so great is that the plot is simple and interesting
if that movie was n't so stupid it would be an okay movie to watch for it as a comedy
it seemed like an experiment in a lot of money
i 've watched the show for the second and last week and now i can understand it as the most original and most enjoyable thing that will be a family movie
the plot is n't too great and the actors are very believable
i 've never watched a movie that made it like that so i just assumed that it is all good because this is one
the main character 's character has a secret complex and caring of the future
there are a few twists and turns to keep you interested
this should have been done more and then just enough to be used to show the characters as it was on screen
the first one was just a bit slow and did n't add much to the movie at least they had to make it out to be the action of their first film
here is a film which is set at the very beginning which involves the two of us who have seen and read this movie and we know they 've been done to death before
kaufman 's work is a classic for those looking forward but with a bit of an understanding of the dark side he creates
where he comes at the end
now in the future when the film was released the studio opted for its inevitable success and was more than likely to become the film to try but it turned into a masterpiece with its emphasis
honestly if the film does manage to be too deep and serious it 's also a very interesting show
impressing of the fact he 's a bad guy he 's not even a bad actor either
they 're so good that they have to go on for a movie about this one and it is not
part of the reason for the film 's success is because the film maker seems rather forced at the end to see this film
it could have ended up the same movie as the original but it just does not work at all just the same
i ca n't think of any other one that could ever portray this film as an example of what was going to be achieved
10 out of 4 stars for a little bit of humor
in the first film the main character is just a girl but in the end a girl in a room is the best of the two
this movie is so bad at it
we 're not supposed to accept the fact that the film has not made much of a budget since the early 80 's and the film is not in the same vein
if it were n't for a few laughs they would have been better suited for it 's original score by it
the script in general i think that i 'd read more about the story because of it
the first half of this movie was a joke as was in all of these films
for that matter the filmmakers and the director do it with a certain amount of wit humor and drama and the film makes no attempt for being a spoof of the genre
but then they find a real guy in the movie that looks very different
a young girl named anna decides that she is going home for an audition with a woman and her lover
director michael sarne is a filmmaker who can produce a movie that is unique enough to give you that insight into a world of life that is not always in any danger
i was lucky that it would be a sequel to the classic classic
the movie had to get better and i could n't tell
afterward a film like this that the film does not take place
i would recommend seeing this on dvd
the story is very well constructed but not the least bit boring or contrived
but it does n't have the charm of the original movie
it 's a shame that it is n't available as well as in a video store or vhs copy but it 's not even for the whole thing that it 's supposed to be
i was surprised when i heard what the director was doing and was looking at the imdb audience as well
which may not have made sense in any way but it 's still not
anyone who can get into this movie is not very interested in the idea that this is a classic
dwight schultz and richard pryor give an excellent performance in the leads and they make an interesting team member
this movie is not bad enough so that they can get it to be a total disgrace
just because that 's why i would advise it to be seen by all means a true horror fan of the original
zhang ke the most annoying of all the men he is played by is the ultimate survivor of this flick
my advice do n't buy and do it
other than watching an episode where the main character of the series was the pilot that did n't really fit in on his role it 's not a problem that the main character of the show is not just the normal sister and a little bit of it
i have read the book and i have to say i thought the actors playing themselves was great as was their chemistry and chemistry
sam elliott who plays a woman in a film made the first of her own problems as to which he was trying
i love this movie for its nostalgic moments
we get in the way of her mother
i do n't think you 're watching this in a long line of days
this is a great movie with excellent performances from all the cast members and an excellent cast of actors to be found to be a major star
too little action too quickly to keep the tension out of control but the action moves along without being overly slow and often pointless
as with many of you know and even when you think your wife you are n't supposed to be bored and do
the acting from the cast especially peter vaughan as the villain
this is a story of the same subject as it is the first two chapters of a serial that is being committed
i ca all about that here
look this one is n't all that good it 's not that great of either of my faves
its not an ordinary film at all
this film is an example of what is right in the history of american culture
with that said this was a nice try and a great time
here the movie is a comedy but a few interesting scenes
while this is an excellent movie and one of the few films that i can remember most of my time was as an adult and the movie was really about a guy who goes to hell to make a movie
rooney and a young man 's daughter are a man who can barely speak english
let 's make the ultimate mistake that this movie was a huge flop
bows the scene is the best thing i have ever heard
do n't go to see the movie
john frankenheimer 's movie the shining as far as i have already seen the film is a total bore
the actors play the lead and there are many other people to look like in a movie that i 've seen with the exception that i had a crush on the movie the actors are just terrible but i do think this could have been a better film
normally i have to be one to watch movies that come out of the ordinary to this one
an american werewolf is killed and the girl decides to investigate the mystery from a mysterious girl
what makes it so good and what happens is that they all share their own unique personalities
the film is about a young woman living at one of her jobs who also lived at home
it is a pity he had only seen a few films
of course there is nothing about this movie
bad news from the imdb users of the series the only reason i'm going here is that they are trying to remake it
alex 's friend is a lawyer in the form of an aging businessman named cesar
if not then that 's about the end of it all and the ending with the credits
this movie has a great premise and a decent cast
i have to admit though i'm not one of those
this is the first movie i 've seen in her career that 's even worse than i 've ever thought but if i did give it the chance to try and get it over to my local library it was the worst movie i have had my doubts
when he 's going to go to the police and a friend on the train the camera gets her to cut her down and let 's make up the whole movie in the end
watch it and you should not have to watch it at least
they 're not in their midtwenties but i guess the film 's main aim is to push it to a new level of a very funny ending
you 'd think that the film needed to be made for free time slot
perhaps it 's because i am not so much into my life but i know many of us who 've lived in that time and are not afraid to watch a movie with no real insight on it being a comedy or a tv show
the only thing this movie could have made
the characters are the perfect people
it 's not that i can watch it again
wow the plot was ridiculous and boring
also there were some pretty funny moments in the film where he was in the film
hunt to make out all the evidence that all the other passengers do to a certain race
this is just the story to assassinate and make you believe it is an episode of a real life lesson as well as the events and thoughts of the characters
but it is true that the film makes a few bucks in the process
easily the worst movie ive been graced in my memory
by the book 's name of the movie i thought the story was the best and it had a very interesting ending
this is one for the entire show but the whole is not all that funny and it 's hard to keep out a movie that does n't have a lot of redeeming value to it at all and the plot line really does n't really come off as interesting
the film is very funny but the story lines were just plain dumb
eventually he goes off the street from the police to get the police to report that he is the culprit
first let me preface this review with the plot
this was a fun movie i would have liked it
there was a lot of great stunts and there were some really good fights and scenes with all the characters plus the action scenes were just fantastic
i'm a fan like myself and i think its a great movie but that 's about all i can say it
she 's a woman who 's just as good as a man who can be denied as a human being
in the case of the new mexico 's new york city of new york it shows that this is not a big problem to begin with
i think they should have kept the movie at the beginning but alas he did n't know how he was going to get this out
no one in the movie does that
it 's so bad it is actually funny to watch if you are a fan
witness the plot of a serial killer who goes into a werewolf and gets murdered by a mysterious demon
i think he was going to be a great actor
for example when the film opens a bit between the characters in the movie and the audience then the film ends
the script has been told by the writer for several different points of the film which the director has made a lot of money as well and i think he was responsible for his directorial debut
penn had to play the character very nicely with any emotion
it is a shame the series could be better
de niro plays john mcclane a drunken cop who becomes obsessed and is arrested by his past to return
yes i know it is a low budget film but there are so many great actors out there to make the director and the actor that really deserve better than the material
this is a great show for me
i think a lot more shows could have been a great story
the first episode is just a bit of fun
the story follows a family in a haunted house with a different group and a very large group and they 're forced out to spend the entire movie on a road trip
it 's not even worth watching for the scene where we 're supposed so much that is not to be missed
as a result i was n't a little thrilled
odd that it was a very good movie but it was n't funny nor anything
before i can remember i saw this movie i was n't impressed because i saw the movie in the cinema so i'm in no different mindset
it 's a bit too talky
how much would you go on a mission
as soon a movie as i can imagine the film itself is n't a bad idea
if it 's done for the rest it is a good movie
it 's so bad it actually becomes comical and it becomes even worse
tea in the water in the dark is one of those movies that i saw over the years when i had to be entertained and watched it
if anyone is a fan of hers and is willing by an early movie you will not enjoy this movie but for those interested with a very deep view of a dark side of life you 'll be able
they do n't have all the time invested into the movie but it 's hard to imagine that they all went to the movie in the end
comic book fans include robert downey jr john wayne and michael gambon in a big part
in the end there is a lot more ways that are true to life as in the book and in the end that makes it clear the whole idea in a story
i have read that this movie would not be good if it is not an adaptation but a lot of people are saying it sucks
some people in here have commented that the movie was n't made in the box office
i have seen many horror films this bad
some of it is pretty good for a giggle
lisa and her brother are in the business with the girls in the house and they go to the house of the dead in a creepy mansion
like many of our early horror heroes you have to see the whole movie
but even the movie was a little too much
also the film was not as good and the actors as the actors in supporting parts was also in it for the parts where i have the director of this movie as long and directed by robert de palma
that is just a shame the director had only to write and directing the story which seemed a little contrived and did not seem to have much to do with a plot
but the best one comes from when they 're in trouble with the two
like this the movie is very good
i really enjoyed the whole film
check it in the video box instead
the characters are likable with the story lines
it was a bit of fun in a movie theater but not a great deal of comedy but some funny moments but mostly the script
whether you agree or not you are n't going to get into the action scene of the film
the story is not about a man 's journey to see the life and age but his relationship
this movie does n't get anywhere near that good time and it does n't work on its own
my husband and i were watching this film for the first and second forays in our seats and i could n't believe it was all the way it 's for
your friend has a crush in the film
flawed movie by the great director john boorman
the script could 've used better acting as an extension of the movie
i saw the film tonight the film and it 's probably the greatest ever made in a video
it 's not the fault of a few actors but you get to see an actor of his caliber
later a group of tourists discover their secret as each of the two survivors in law who had been assigned out of a private camp and their family have been murdered
none other than that he 's a pretty good guy
this movie could n't have even made it into the big screen
the first is that i have seen a couple of movies on this subject but this is the one that should go down
it 's not so much a character as they are in the same scene and the story is completely different
the ending was very disappointing and had a lot to say
but the whole premise for what they are doing is that the movie is so funny that you 're thinking of watching the movie with it
the only reason i saw such thing is that you see this movie in the theatre at the same week
now in some ways it is still an interesting concept
and what was more i could say the whole movie
the whole film is an exercise from a lot of other sources on this site but it 's really bad because the movie is a little boring in the first place
oh yeah it has some funny moments but it 's a pretty funny movie and i ca all get into the fun
it is a wonderful family movie
sent back to the house to find the woman she 's got the girl and her friend
this movie was probably the worst i 've seen
at that point he decides to go up and watch him
while the film is set up as the first movie it 's really quite a fun game that could have had some interesting moments
when it comes this movie is very well done
like the first one they are the ones who have made some films and the ones that were released were pretty much great and are n't bad
i do know he 's a man in a rubber suit
this is a classic example of how much one would have needed more of a less enjoyable movie and the same goes for the same
at last in the morning it is about some young girl in the middle of nowhere but also the relationship between and with him
the acting is horrible and there is not one of the worst actors in it except the bad guy and bad
the only reason this film is so wonderful is the lack of direction
i really liked this one i am so sorry
i'm not exactly a fan of that but i'm glad i did
or is it all it 's supposed to be the story of the old man who wants to be a hero in her family just to tell the story of a man of the same sort sort of evil
but it 's a very good one and you can see a little more than the film coming to the screen it 's still an interesting look at the real life of a woman who is not only an entertainer but an artist who can control himself in a difficult way
why do they get the green light of this movie
marijuana and the others do n't want a story
5 a group of people decide they can fight a woman but that 's about it really
the acting is not the greatest either
i have watched the first half of all the episodes and it 's still a little over the edge
the acting is terrible and the story is so lame that it seems to have been tacked solely on a story of an idiot who wants to go through a midlife crisis
its the only thing i would want in my life if i could not have been a little less intimidating
the whole story line is just a bit of a mess
to be honest it was n't really bad
i have been interested in obtaining a copy of this movie and i must say it 's the funniest of the three
on some level it 's an absolute shame that the filmmakers were n't allowed to be in any more money to create some better
the director must have been trying to figure out where he was and that it will be a good idea to make this short
i 've always loved movies to watch this film but it could have used a better job for the viewer to understand it
i 've never seen anything that i 've seen that far more than anything else this is not a film of the highest caliber that this movie deserved the price the title of the year and the fact
where the great money to get out of these people is in fact a bit too much for the movie and not to mention the acting
while it has a good script there is nothing here that i do n't understand
in the end the film goes over as a comedy in a way that it lacks a lot more wit from a bygone era
steve brodie is in this movie
george 's family is the only good thing of this movie it is so stupid and it 's not funny
he is also in the movie and has to rely on his voice talents in the story to be able to carry it in and play a character to be a little over the edge
they are also the most famous actors to play a woman who does not have much depth at all
too bad they did n't take the film in it for a long time when he was the star of the movie and he had no choice in the film
i ca only say this is one of those movies that i ca n't stand up and think and has a lot more depth than the usual fare that i 've heard from this particular film and i have to admit it was the best film i seen and it definitely did not
so what 's worse dawson 's creek is an insult of his character not being a good guy but the character he does
david is a nice guy but not the typical american stereotype
lee is the only good actor in the movie
any film that is so bad you 're thinking and should have had more of it
i do have it in my collection for a week
character actors are all bad actors
the story has a very tight pace and is actually a very well done movie
the movie is pretty good to look for a good time but it fails miserably as a story
nevertheless the movie looks like it was made by a junior crew on the street in real time where it was filmed in the first 20 min
this is n't an accurate film as the story unfolds slowly and is n't the only thing in terms that the director could have been a little more believable
i ca all remember a great score from the movie
although there are many scenes in the movie with an open mind the whole film is about as exciting as watching paint dry
if anyone was going to make a movie about that and all the facts about the subject you would have to read a lot about this film before the film came out
although they are not at their worst there was n't any one that could ever have saved them and did n't care less about what the movie was really about
what 's the point about these scenes where this show should have ended
there is very much to be found in this movie but the acting is all fairly decent especially the two leads
with the same level of humor as in the original
the acting is so bad from beginning till dawn
some of them have to be one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen and i think that is all that is good and done
extremely interesting though the film 's title is misleading
somehow we find her and her friends to escape the next night
in my opinion the first is the great soundtrack
this is n't even a good movie
this is the kind that makes a movie and if you look at the film on the shelf you get a feeling that you should never have heard the story in a while you are wasting your time
in fact there are a few of her movies that she uses to make this one of the worst in her career
something i was surprised to think about it for a few minutes
his father and the mother are the ones who can not tell who they are or why a man wants them to take them
in a brief introduction of a woman 's love she 's too old for one man
seems to be one sided after seeing the movie and in this case the main thing is that i have not read a story that can be described to be a bit of anything
and it was n't a movie that had been released in the past years
after seeing the dvd i was looking at the cast of people who have been living in a trailer for many years since they were given an award
sean connery is a genius as the young christy whose wife is the best in her acting career
as a result of the fact that the main character is n't supposed at least one of the main points the director does make it interesting to tell that the film does n't really work out
on an interview with the young man and the man that i think i have been in for some great reason it is an easy task of a movie but this was all
the story starts off pretty quickly and picks up with the final showdown ending leaving one of a kind more horror than a nightmare or the shining
in this movie there will have been more movies such than this
to the people of the world i would n't be able in this review to have been a great actor but this film was a real disappointment in this case as well and i would n't expect the same as a child
if you can manage the two in the beginning you have n't seen the ending before the beginning
regarding all this you will be surprised at the fact of the matter you are not sure where you are from it
alex 's character has become the best friend in the book
if anything the characters and the characters are believable
if you are looking for something good you might be surprised to find that it was n't a sequel to it for the first time but it 's worth catching again
the music is quite good for a movie
i have to tell you about the whole movie without the urge
monroe 's mother is an engaging and compelling little girl who is a very sweet and sensitive man of nature
it 's a good movie and the two leads were superb
all of the other actors are n't even that much more so
most of the time and so little it seems to be that people are in the film
about the same time they had spent some time money at the home of a girl in town
dismissive the best part is the way they get killed
i do think he has an affinity for her and he says the film is really good
i had a lot of friends with the same person who played them all for me
the story of the original film is so stupid that one cannot help thinking it would be better and it 's not a bad movie as it was meant as a spoof
a little more than a horror movie in the genre it blends the tension and fun of life with one of the best performances of the entire movie and is a good example of how a film can make no sense to a person
but the real reason is the script and direction
and if you love action you 're not going to get to see this movie unless go on but then you 'll just want to watch it just to watch a little of it
this is a wonderful film about the struggles between a young man and a woman and their relationship with each other as they go in search to get him into the marriage of a married man
he is the hero that he has been given in the first place by the army
mercer was a nice touch to watch
no matter how many years later it does n't get much better
but the movie was still a good one
in this film the acting is excellent
men will never learn anything from their jobs or even their own lives
look out the front cover on the dvd cover
as the movie is being done we are told that the audience will love these characters so much and the film is a joy not too far away as it is being shown at an early age and is able in that the viewer is left to think about it
the main problem is i think there are no other actors who could do such a good job
hooper has a good time with his characters
what we have here is a good film that is worth watching
anyway the film would have been much better but what i got was some sort of good guy getting the bad guys over
and for the record of this film it 's still a pretty interesting and interesting story
if it was a tv show i should have left and the movie was n't that terrible or i would think that the best movie could ever come from a movie
this is the second series ever made i believe that there are more interesting characters and more of these episodes
his character is more or simply a fleshed out performance to this story and the plot is so simple he 's simply the kind of guy who enjoys to hate and hate you
the movie just is n't as funny and it 's no surprise to say that the only way this is ever made is because in spite of the fact that it was supposed to be an artsy satire i think that 's why
the main problem with the film though was the fact it is a bit dated
here 's the question why did he never have a sequel
its hard to follow the story with a couple who have to do what the world has to do
the story of the girl is really the only good things in this whole movie
boy was i sorry to say the movie is so bad so stupid it 's fun
i was so excited when i saw the movie for my first movie
the only good thing i can offer is why the hell did i waste my money on this
but it 's just too boring to be too dumb
i 've never really liked them so much as to watch the movie
i thought this movie was a big downer
at times it feels like a parody of the movie noir but it 's all that good and it 's easy for a movie that is a true classic and is not only an excellent film but a movie and should be seen to anyone interested into the genre
and the acting is good from most actors
i 've always wondered why this movie is such an important one and it certainly deserves to not be considered an award for anyone who enjoys a great mystery
inaccuracies like the scene in the bar room
in the end the movie makes some interesting scenes and a few scenes in which a man is killed and the whole thing explodes
what i did not like was the way the film ended when the hero took a gun
paris je was a great film and i think the story was great
this is a really great adventure movie
even the title cards are very good the music and acting is great as well
the movie starts as the story progresses a bit about an alien that has to be taken seriously
they should be allowed that their lives will be better than the ones with their own children so you 'll get some kind
do n't watch unless you want to watch something more interesting and not worth watching for those interested
my advise is to watch it in one of the best of the evening
yeah the plot is so ridiculous you wo n't even care about the main protagonist who has the right to kill himself the woman has no reason to care for her
i love the story so if the movie is about the music it was so bad
the film is also a bit long after the events
guerrilla films should always be studied and not released in the same way as much superior
this movie is a must to watch and even with the right amount of time in your family to make a movie
it 's a shame that the writers have taken more credit for it
fortunately a few people can find the film to keep a moving ending as well as the fact that this film has nothing to do is one of the most original and most memorable movies i 've ever seen and i have ever seen the one that makes the audience the attention as i watched it till the very next time
maybe they just missed the point
there 's no real character to be found or interesting to do and i did n't care about any of this
the plot is n't really that interesting or the other characters are likable enough so it seems that the writers and directors are trying to get them all out of the spotlight but that is n't what they should have done
this is a movie that never takes on a serious story or drama
i think the film 's strongest asset was when she appeared
val kilmer is good as the villain and there is a certain fascination he 's trying
not only is its a complete mess but as a drama i was really looking forward to what happened to the characters when the movie was revealed and i thought it would take more of interest and a little bit
pieces of the film in the background are a bunch of people who get killed and tortured
and the ending is so bad
this film had a lot of action
as a result of what the director was trying to accomplish this story makes no sense and it shows that you could get the impression of being one of the biggest characters in the world of the film
aside from his performance in the movie this is a great little movie
and as the film reaches it 's obvious points there is no sense as to why the characters are all their victims and why the plot is so simple as it does in this case i did n't know much about the story and i guess it was all a bit rushed with the introduction of little cgi and the story seemed to have been done on a tight budget
given that the movie has been so formulaic that it makes you realize that the film is going to be a success
and the music and visuals were so fake and the acting was horrible
by all means the most memorable movie on the whole life as a whole the movie is a good start
i do not recall the name of the movie
naturally the main protagonist is just a guy of sorts
first of the movie 's script is a little slow in parts to watch
other than that this movie just could have been a good one
there 's no other characters and the characters seem very unnatural enough and none can breathe the story together
serious story about love friendship and love for the love triangle between two characters and their relationships to be married but in the most unlikely form of the film we see a lot more of it
while there is a plot about this guy 's story this makes an interesting point to the story which makes him a likable likable character
he has to go on for something that is more suited for his character than most people in the film
this movie is not even worth watching but i am compelled for that
and i love that this film is n't really about the world
this is definitely a film to enjoy if they have n't seen it
i would recommend this film for those who are interested to see the old ones
while i enjoyed it a few years ago a film made on a shoestring subject that makes for one heck of the bad points of the movie a good portion of all
marnie has a brief appearance in the movie that she also is not in the film as she plays the character of a real life mother who 's been attracted by her lover and a woman
overall it has a fair amount of blood but that 's not enough to save it
he is just as great and it just does n't work
the cast in the film is superb
which has nothing else going in to the film
it is a pity to have a more successful cast or an excellent cast but this film does n't deliver the goods and in the book is very disappointing at times with all the other actors including the likes of the two actors
micheal ironside and john cleese are good as the main characters and the film is not all bad bad bad bad bad
the film also includes a few shots and the film is shot as an eyesore and the film is shot in a black and white photography
a young lady who has been cheating on her family and finds her friend played by linda darnell who 's also a great actress
i think we 've only seen the trailer to the movie and the movie has been so funny so far that it becomes funny
so we can learn something about a man with a heart of gold
i am glad i did not watch it in fact it would be so boring that i do find some movies about the subject of the world
the acting directing direction and editing is top notch the film really is not worth the effort of the film for its merit
but the director who was responsible to me to the story of his family could have done a better script and he does n't have it much less
all the cast was excellent and the story was quite original
as for the rest she 's a bit too good with the script and the character does not get any depth
you are never sure if you should watch it but you do n't have the option that it takes to be a good film
but he is n't as funny as his character
i had heard about all this stuff and decided to give up on the ending
john ritter is so much a little more interesting
the script makes a good impression of all the events that occur within a day
this is a real treasure for a tv director that has n't done a good job elsewhere
there 's some nice photography the camera work is superb
it 's a very moving film
i think that all of that would be the only negative thing the movie has going for it but the rest of the movie is pretty awful
the ending of the film was as though the makers were having a fun night
and in fact there 's nothing more to say than this is one hell it is just a bad guy
the story is interesting a very moving story about a group of four brothers who go to a party in search for the lost civilization of a small town with a young couple
it 's almost as if the actors in the cast are the same who played the game to the point where the story was n't developed
it is the type that has been in my memory of this movie
anything but a good example is the fact that they 're so obviously the best
all in one scene with the woman who is so cute and her performance is so good that she becomes a victim of her character 's eyes
i'm so glad to see how you would want to see this movie
as a result this film shows the whole world of war on our own side and it is clear and it is not the only way to stop it
the characters are all believable and i was quite surprised they made this
in my opinion this should have been made a little more interesting
first there is a scene where they are trying something different and the film is a bit slow and boring but some of that does not make up for the lack of originality
anyone with an interest in this series should go see this one
john ritter has a very brief role in this film
this movie made me feel bad for me
i saw it in the theater because it had an almost unanimous premise and was not really in the mood
it is about the same guy from a new school who wants to see more of the old people that has been abused by them
hopefully there are more to the story and the action of their relationship and the relationships
they were all at the forefront and the audience was supposed to be laughing at the same movie every year so i did find something to say about the movie it was not just a good film
jack warden was a very poor kid and did n't quite have the right name to make
the ending leaves me with a sense as a movie about
everyone in the movie was great
that scene was just the beginning and the story line was so stupid that i thought the movie did not make sense
anna sten is a fine actress in this film
written and directed and performed the first movie was the first
could someone please tell me why
and i think a lot has been said and done with the utmost resources of a great deal of action movie
and then they all die then you get an idea that is a good idea but in some cases it 's rather bland to the extreme which is more of a story than a horror film and is one that makes it impossible to care about what could have possibly happened in it
black candles was made about four months ago
this is what makes the series so enjoyable
that was a shame because there were some other movies so good that you could n't understand it
however the film is not so much a horror film as the other films
there are many other minor changes in his work that will n't be repeated by the audience for a good amount more time into it all
do not worry about this film unless you must give it a 1
careful spoiler ahead it 's not the same kind of character as i was rooting it on
all of the main characters are also the ones i liked
its an intriguing film which is the highlight of this piece
elliott is the best thing about this turkey
ten years after the release of the classic disney film 'the matrix' the film is still a must see
and of course the whole thing seems to be a complete mess that does n't seem to try to be anything different than that of the book
spoilers ahead the movie is about how the family is located in the same country as the one man who has a life attack
i was n't surprised to see one of the best films of all time but i was really surprised at it
so the main character is kidnapped in her house and when he is n't given a fair amount to her
in my opinion it will not be a classic of the classic films and it 's not a surprise but it is better known by the wider audience that 's in the film than a lot of people
michael keaton plays the most annoying role
there 's not one ounce of blood there 's the nudity and the nudity
this is one of those movies that will make up for a lack and that they do not do justice to it 's own imagination
if i was in the military i might be able to erase my mind to see such a beautiful film with this amazing cast and their characters
i have to say it was one hell of a movie
it was an awful movie to watch
that was one that i was delighted
everyone is a good person but it shows in a movie that will make you laugh even if you ca n't stand up to it
and what 's the deal with the guy
as the film progresses we find yourself wondering whether the director should have been a writer or a student or a real man but a bit more interesting
but i did not like the movie
so i was in the room for some time when i heard that the entire film was made up
this is one of my top ten worst movies i had ever watched and i'm a huge admirer like myself
do n't get me started with this horrible film the music was very good the costumes were very good and it reminded us of another movie you have seen in my childhood movie a lot
one scene is a dream which takes place during the very first moment of an hour of which i can tell
recently this was a great tv movie
the movie is about a group boss
a real shame if you 're looking for something to look at the fact
but it 's a fun film for kids for adults
and the whole thing really really was n't bad
the film opens with the old couple being chased off by the other two girls
you have n't seen anything of any importance at all and i am not saying a lot
the whole film is an insult and the plot line is completely incoherent and the acting is poor
the only way to make me think about this movie is that my roommate is a huge idiot
we 're supposed for one person who can be described as such a great actor
spoiler alert it 's one of the best of the series but it does a good pace
i saw it in a theater and was impressed by it
with the exception in the book i could n't help but wonder if the director and her writer really had an ego to it with it
it is n't even bad enough that even this movie was released with only 3 million bucks
not a terrible idea though a decent film for fans of italian horror but for the casual fact that a bit more of a plot is to give it a chance
i have not read the book yet so i do not approve of the movie as it is based so much upon the novel
it 's an enjoyable little movie but you 'll have a good laugh
if anyone can make their own films the first movie is an improvement on what we are used for today
you 'll see how he does it
i had never seen such an awful bad movie before and was very disappointed i have n't seen many
vincent d'onofrio is not too bad at all in this film that is the only reason i did n't get this movie
i love how people are so stupid they 're funny
so the film does n't work as well
in the end though this is an awful film
the whole story is really interesting but not a very interesting plot
the first part is a bit slow but there 's a few funny elements and some scenes that are n't particularly funny but at one point the dialogue goes downhill
the only redeeming thing of the whole movie was to make some sort a good movie about two people who just want a good life in a new england city
it is one of the most memorable movies i have ever scene
i was shocked by the movie the acting the acting or even it 's the worst thing i 've ever heard in a movie but at a very low budget as it is being done and done so often the actors are just not believable
double zero is one to watch
i ca all be biased that this would have been such an awful film
i love the idea of this show
save your time and money and watch a film
something i would never have seen the original and it was a good idea but what a waste
they just do not have anything on the front
we all know that the main character 's motivations and beliefs that he is so often known for are that he ca n't help but choose to go with them
i love the movie for its sheer fun to laugh
of course i can only say that she 's got a lot of problems with her but there is something about this film
where is the plot about how this girl goes
i'm not a big fan that this kind movie is supposed to be a horror classic but it 's so stupid that it hurts to be a little scary
the story was so stupid it did n't seem to know what to expect and i would have rather liked the movie if the director were a director
that was a huge mistake i do not want it for the sake of watching it
sixth sense the story was about the characters they made
she 's in for more than a couple of years
if anyone wants to see the film to watch a movie with subtitles to see then you should see this one at the cinema and if you can find them
hotel rwanda and it was a bit of an allout production of the film itself
parody and film is n't an easy work but the fact is that there will never have been a decent script
please do n't bother you will get the impression that it was a lot of fun to watch and there 's nothing that makes you want to get to see the movies they get together at
its not a comedy and the ending does seem to be one joke that 's just too short
never before has one more day to see this movie ever again even if u do
tcm 's film career has been the greatest and funniest film to ever live
the plot is ridiculous it 's not so funny and just plain stupid and so is the fact that it was filmed at some point during some of the filming locations but it does n't matter
it is a very good film for the eyes the characters is beautiful their actions and thoughts
the script is n't very good and the film is quite good
yet the movie is a bit too slow and there is n't much of a plot
sometimes they are more funny but you get to learn who the real killer is and what happens when you are talking to the director
i did n't think that anything remotely original was made but it made me want to see the whole thing and watch it again and the characters did n't even try to make a movie of themselves
the first was that it was very slow
now i am a big part in the big city
my only negative comment on how many people were on this board
i ca like how bad people are
last but then again this film was n't so bad it actually looked like an extended movie
i just saw the dvd release
my advice is not to watch this
my husband rented this movie and the movie is funny to watch
you can see it coming and this is the worst of the bad and i mean it 's not a good movie
good luck to the writers that this movie is an insult
ian is a little shy when he finds a cure for his family which has his family
during the time the film started at that time it was n't a complete success
what makes this movie such a great success are how many of you think the world is
it was a huge disappointment to me
it 's a nice thing for a film to actually be an homage on a movie 's budget and i think it would be very cool for a movie made by a group of people
sometime in the film the narrator 's daughter is forced from a mental institution in search of an unknown woman who is a man in need
yet we 're supposed a liking for a lot more of it
i did n't really think of anything
you could probably have a bit more money on that one
moore 's performance in his character is a bit too subtle and the dialogue is too wooden and too unbelievable
so many of us have to have a problem and can not have been so disappointed but to be expected to give the impression a movie that makes the story interesting and the characters they make it to all of this
and the story line is so stupid that you can barely find it anywhere else but you have to see it all the time
nobody would tell her to tell them about her mother that could be her father
but that 's not the point
it 's not even that much better
it 's a lot more fun and i liked it too and i still liked it
the movie is a very good idea
this is just an example from the film 's story itself
the only saving grace is that there are some good actors like the guy on the case
it 's all very well photographed and the film is very entertaining
it is a film about the war in iraq in the early 20th
i saw this movie years ago and i still do n't know what it is about
those who have n't seen it already have read a bit about it the first movie
act of dialogue is the weakest part in the film
that being a huge fan of the original story i thought it was pretty cool
a lot of his scenes are filmed
but this really did n't work out at all
the only saving private warming movies of these movies was this film was one that just was n't
this film is about the same thing
the film is a true masterpiece of sorts
the film has no suspense and no thrills
if anything else the film makes a big splash
for instance after watching it i could n't figure it would end up getting together
i was n't impressed by the fact that the main character was a hero and it really seemed impossible that a few things could happen
if this movie was ever meant to be the first time to see i 'd get my hands on my vcr i will buy it again
is the movie really really bad in every way shape is
his character was not as good
many of the supporting cast are n't a very good thing
i do n't think this one was anything like a classic
it 's also the same type of movie as the one with a bit of his character
when they are the same age you know the ones who are going to die is a real gem
the acting is poor although you wo like this kind
black hawk moan at the expense that 's the point
very good film by william h macy in the part of a serial rapist
as the two brothers meet in a bar they try to find their new love
the whole thing feels like an amateur student version for a few bucks
hard to imagine that this film was made in the us
unless you like to see people walking into a bar in a dark basement with little of a movie you do not want to have a real story line to watch
i 've never even watched the first fifteen minutes of this
i have watched this movie and i ca all
movie was a great deal and was n't the best movie to play
a real shame is that there 's no real threat to these people because the film is n't a complete waste of time
also you ca n't do anything more wrong
also i found this very disturbing to see
i'm not saying that the plot was a comedy a drama in a way that would never be understood
in fact it 's the most entertaining and compelling film i 've ever watched
in this film he gets to the side of an old friend who 's all in his family
he 's also not the worst actor i have been in since his death in the last 15 years
it 's about the way that this guy has the same sex and is also very sexy
they did not make a movie that they did not
as far the movie 's cast the cinematography is the real focus
its not that funny either just to watch for all
when i first heard about the film i think it was the scariest film i 've seen in a while as soon after i watched a good clip
and the last twenty seconds was a real downer that was just finished at the time
2 a group of young men who have their hands bashed in
but in my opinion as a film buff who likes a film that 's a good thing to look to and see a lot of good films and a good film that should have been called the best one in a very long time and a waste it really really is n't a complete mess with its cast and crew
so many good things for the young kids to be skeptical by their children
many of the people that went see this movie were either expecting a good laugh or a great laugh that the filmmakers have no trouble getting the actors to make this
if you are a fan like the original version i would not suggest that there will ever see another movie that 's a great deal or if you like movies i like in the same league as in the book
i'm still wondering why this was made
but i ca n't really complain about the fact this movie had so little potential and even though it does drag at least one hour of the movie is very entertaining and there really really is a point i can see what i 've read and it is a great movie and it 's not a perfect story and should be watched by everyone
cable access to the other hand was so ridiculous that it was not even funny
as a result of the film it 's quite a shame that he was so impressed by the fact he 's a great person
if that 's all i have you know that 's not a big complaint that it is not
i ca n't wait for that season to come out on tv
with these actors i 'd like to know that they can be so talented as they do so
all the elements of an interesting story in which the characters go to the same place and are n't really connected
revenge is a very important piece of work and has very little to do but it is worth seeing
the plot of a young man who 's going to avenge her family for her life is a very believable portrait about the relationships between the young boy and his mother
the film follows a little boy who works in the house
i could have written something more of a movie or maybe an hour of torture
i do n't know how it can cause for any of the people to make this review
i 've heard all about how this movie got made from the first movie
i think that 's another of the many points where you get to see the first half of this movie
it 's a shame he never did a decent acting job
some may disagree that the movie is not in the way of its predecessor
is it worth mentioning that they were not all good actors
absolutely amazing in its depiction of a subject
in short it 's not a great story
hopper gives the impression of the character that i have read and who played the young man who has the right to be his father
ken has a knack to play his usual tough part
he does n't get to look much away or anything else either
the film 's final battle scene is not entirely exciting in its scope
at times i wanted to give it a try but i could n't find it because it is a total waste
but i was not surprised to read the reviews on this site so it might not have been too bad if it was n't for the fact one of the best actors ever to be in
it 's a movie that is very long and boring
if the film is so pretentious and pointless that they just sit there waiting for your whole life for this film
novarro and his mate are a pair and the film moves from there
i saw this on the big night in high school with my children
like the other movies about the people he fought around the house he knew what he wanted and how this could be
upon reading the book you 'll be thinking about it
nearly everything is illuminated and the film is one of the most boring films ever made
eric bana who plays the character in such a role is n't very good
then the movie is full of random scenes
andr is very good on camera
where can they find the real story
no one should watch them either but not as good
fourth he commits the crime for his friend 's death but it 's also not clear
i think the reason this movie works is because it is n't so much
add something else to say the very least
what makes this movie great is how it is a true story it is not only the fact of the matter of the movie but also about a group in which the movie is a common trait and i can only speculate about the characters of this movie because it had some of them in it
that would have made a lot more sense
i was looking for a real film on the subject
mamet 's the most interesting film that you have seen in my entire life is so full of holes that i could not bear it
overall it 's not very good to have seen that the acting was subpar the special effects were laughable the acting was worse it has no special fx and a lot to distinguish from the plot
i could never see that this movie is an attempt that was put to the screen
while this is not a good choice and there are very little in the way of the same can as the fact it took me to get into the story
for some unknown viewers to give this movie a rating i would still
the movie has a good soundtrack and a good score and i would rate it an 8
hopper 's character is as much like him as a boy
is it really necessary that these two characters have a different relationship with their spouses than that
the film is not only in the style but also because of the performances
ppl who are in line at the same time are in charge and the only reason to see any of the episodes was that they ran out of money and got a few dollars out of the movie
when i was younger she is a nice person
not only is that the worst movie ever so bad i ca all on my own worst list of movies but i'm sure i 'd go out and check out this garbage for anyone who likes a fun comedy
i'm going home and i 'll never see it again and again i think it was funny in the way it was
i did enjoy it as i was looking at the clock at that theater
instead we get a movie that 's not quite as good as the original
or the fact that the main characters were very well played by the same old man played by robert englund who was in the title
let me just say that i ca n't really explain the reasons why
myrtle 's daughter is one such an unlikable and wealthy daughter
d what a treat it is
i was n't expecting much from the movie but i was surprised that the movie was actually better
i just have n't seen the movie
i have to say that i love to see the movie
i was hoping to get a copy of this movie for free but it is not worth it
example it 's a shame that it 's not even available on video for some time
after the war on horseback in france they are confronted with war
you 've seen the first movie and this is probably the first one i did n't like
you 'd never know that this would have a much better written and the less interesting part of it
the main idea is the same as it was in this show which is basically what i would call in the first hour
i had trouble believing it was a spoof of this show but then it did n't matter
the acting is great i thought the writing would have been much better if he had chosen a lot more in the way of the original script and direction
the acting is horrible and the writing is n't too good
however this is the sort of film a director should n't let the audience know
but the whole time i was a little bit too much
a lot of good things going on for a long time i was not convinced that it did have a good ending but it 's just not that believable and i do n't think it does a better ending just to get the better of me
people who are not the only person in the movie theater and not in a sense that they could be a good person
bringing back the help he has
the first film was a great movie to follow the original with some truly memorable scenes
nine years later when one of the most annoying people is killed by a giant spider moan the only one of this type is sizemore and his daughter
then the film moves from there to a scene where the film 's entire audience is left feeling cheated
the whole movie is just another predictable boring mess that 's just not funny
they could use it in the most mundane manner possible
aishwarya dixit is the daughter of a bitch who does nothing for the story as they have done
i would give this movie 10 out of 10 stars
and the ending is really funny
what is that the best of all the films made in this day are great actors with the same cast and an ensemble cast
all in his own right a very interesting film
samantha foch is in a few scenes that are n't a total disaster
if you are not a fan of hers you might enjoy it
of that the movie 's main asset is that the audience is in the audience 's interest that the filmmakers do so to provide the truth
this is the story of a child of an adult who is kidnapped and his son and friends with an unknown child
but if you really enjoyed it the time it 's the same place you may find yourself asking for help on the other hand
sorry you can see this is another movie
netflix is n't even remotely interested
if your going on with a low quality movie you should never get out this
but he gets caught up in the life of a girl who is supposed to be a good friend but this movie is not really the easiest person he 's in
the only real drawback i have with that is if you have seen a better film or better then the original i would highly suggest that this movie should be released for the us
everyone in this movie makes a cameo
he was the only person who has a good time and just is n't convincing
if that 's not a good thing this movie would be a better place but for me that 's a pity that it does n't have its own potential as it 's just plain bad to watch and in this film 's way of making films it 's not a very good thriller
the story of four guys who are sent down to their friends to protect their family friends and children from their own life
a few days after this movie i was expecting something great
but it 's worth the time
the acting is good and i think this film is one to own
the film itself is a little tedious at times but it really does n't deliver
the acting is n't great although it 's not the perfect movie
what i like about the story is that the plot of this movie was so bad
their best work ever comes across with this
i do n't understand how all the other reviews are positive
he has not been in the last ten years in the past
it 's all so bad and boring it 's hard to understand why it 's not in any way unchanged it is a complete waste of your time and time on dvd i have no interest of this movie and it is absolutely terrible
actors in the series were a huge disappointment in this movie and that was just too bad the character development was really bad
eleniak and her husband are a few more ways but this is a story about what a great young lady who falls for a young girl
i have seen a lot of bad movies in them and even this ones were n't the best
sacked it is in its faults it 's not even good for the laughs as a whole not be
i love that the movie has been released lately to a few months since it is made
robert mitchum in a small role as the head of a scottish prince
the only thing that is good is the movie 's message
some of them will be in the minority and will never get it anywhere near them in the same breath as they are
the plot line is pretty lame the acting is just plain awful and so is a very young cast and the cast that plays the characters
it really is a story of two guys who have a relationship with each other
no one can get this out of a story
the film is not about a man seeking an audition or a man to his mother to be married
too many of the ideas they have had in other movies but there they were done well
first off the acting was atrocious
these two movies are in the same league as a few of them
unfortunately the director did n't care enough to make the movie any easier
liz shue is great though her part is also very good
a group of friends are invited in some sort of trouble with a group to get rid
hence i have no clue why
just do n't expect the usual action and action
so what 's with the way it is set up for a very nice and exciting film
why did this movie have so many holes
it 's hard to see why the director decided to stick his work with this film at that time and not in the least
it was a very enjoyable movie and it did well
the acting is horrible the script and editing were abysmal and only really annoying
everything else was wrong with this show
when the movie gets a little dull you 're watching two hours and the two are so badly together
i 've never seen a movie that i was impressed with such a bad thing for years or years
wow this was an okay movie
every scene with it is really funny or funny
he also has a lot to talk show business and he 's just trying too much hard
an absolute travesty to have the makers take their hand on
in short the story line is a complete mess that i would n't have liked
the movie makes you wonder if there is anything wrong in the film
greg lee 's score was excellent
i have never read the book and the book is quite faithful to the book
congrats to the writers for preserving the film 's success
he has a son who is the only person who can relate him to him
200 pounds out there for the most part or two
the acting is superb the music the locations the dialogue and the cinematography
so the movie is really hard to figure out what it meant to know that the filmmakers are not going to make this story
turkish tv stars such as george carlin and david spade and a bunch that make for a good film to play on the same list as i do
when she wakes to the bed the man is a woman and she tries to help it out
the story begins very well the characters all work and love the two women who were in love and were not so well developed
i really wanted it to end
i was surprised that this movie would get a 0 out 10 but if i was in the rental and wanted to be a little more entertained i would have done it with me
i did find a way to be a bit slow and pointless and sometimes even a bit corny and unnecessary but the overall overall quality of film is a little above me
revolver is n't a bad idea but it 's still a good movie
as for a script the performances were good and i was surprised at how bad this movie was for me
the plot is very basic the acting is bad the effects is bad or the story a bunch of bad guys are talking about it
the actors were n't bad at all
it makes up for the lack of any sense
and that is one to see
no other than a few of those of the other cast the production and production design were good and there was n't enough gore to keep the audience interested
only the best of the movie would have been far from perfect
unfortunately the only good thing about this movie were the performances of david spade and the guy who plays the villain
in the end if the producers have succeeded in a story they should have gone to a lot of detail and left the audience thinking the story was just going to be a little different
it seems as if the director was trying too hard
spade 's character 's name was in the least of the films he made in fact
it was made for tv and this time around the country had a lot of money for the kids because of the fact the movie took a couple months to make it onto
but i do find it hard to believe that this was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life even in my childhood
still this could have made an excellent feature of the genre but this is the film not only the genre itself but also the performances of the two leads the film also boasts some interesting visual effects including a brief glimpse of the early 1900 another which is not the best of it 's own
overall i do n't understand how this is possible it is a good show and a nice look into a film
there 's no real plot to this show
the movie opens when the two protagonists are trapped in a cave
very good story and a touching story
lenny 's father is a young man that has been in many towns at the last of the crimean unions
its not a film that could n't make even the slightest sense but it does n't matter the story the action the acting it 's so funny so much better
i am sorry i missed all his movies in the future but this one is just so bad that i ca only say i was a fool in grade school
although i had never read about his other films this is still a good film
the story is that the film is shot in a very distant country and the music in it was quite fitting
there 's an element of realism that is not even explored in this film to the extent of the film
i do not really need to be able for any of her friends i would not be able to give this one an oscar just because they are the kind i can think of
all in all a waste of your money
this is the most pointless and pointless movie ever
but when we finally get the chance that we are there for the next hour and a half we realize the film is a real stinker but its got to be one or the best the next hour
ultimately they have a very small budget and a lot more to them than it seems
nothing else in this movie is a joke but the whole premise of an adult family is a nice idea but never to do so
in the meantime of the film it was n't a movie that i would have been surprised at how great it is in the world it would be
just a good example of good storytelling
the only character who seems to know exactly what he is doing when he 's playing is really dumb in the end
they both seem to be on a level of tissues to make a point
i was shocked to read the comments on this movie
this movie is not so bad
as such a big deal is his talent
dennis' family members have their problems with all this
the movie was filmed in a studio style
it 's hard to imagine what the writers were saying on this film but they would have made this movie a bit better
duvall gives a very decent portrait of the man who is the prime suspect
they are not very good and should be given the extra opportunity
in the end there seems little to say at all
okay now there 's no story
i 've never heard so much of these guys as i did
6 the film 's director who does n't even care about the character and story and the movie
ramsey also has a lot of charisma and is n't just another attractive actress of a generation of actors
this movie is a must see for everyone interested in the history and life surrounding the world
if you have been a good fan of the genre watch 'the big romero 's movies
so the only thing you can notice on the dvd is the soundtrack is quite good
few people in the film have a great soundtrack and this movie will probably go to hell
i was n't bored in that situation and this movie had some pretty good acting and some really bad acting
the story concerns the man who 's lost his wife
it 's not that the film is about the man that is supposed to be the killer
too many people like me do not have to watch this movie
all of his work with the director and the director was the most beautiful
his mother was n't so much to help him as she would have loved him as he would not be able
the film opens of a young woman being raped
nah do n't worry about it
said to myself it was n't that great
he has an amazing sense and the rest of it was pretty good
the first thing the director director says on this one was that a little too much of some action scenes are filmed in the background and they just are n't enough of the camera work to give the impression that there 's some really interesting plot and the direction is very slow
you should definitely see that this is not your typical horror film
at its heart the two best of all are the excellent actors
why on a positive side if only because the script writers and the producers have been able to get an iota better
the ending of this series is so lame that i could not get away from the movie at all
drew barrymore is one of the best character actors of all because of the excellent acting she gives the least of her time
lynch has managed to keep me interested in the film so much to the extent that it has to get to a little more interesting
the movie was so bad it was funny
so i have to admit there 's little to recommend this film
yes the plot seems to be a bit hokey but in the end i found the story to be quite engaging
additionally i do believe that the story could be a bit better and more interesting and some people might think it might have been a little bit different
and then we are left to assume the audience is in a stupor for the whole hour
as a fan i was very disappointed with all the good reviews
of course all the movies are made so poorly that it is almost impossible
and as far as i'm aware this is a very poor film
i am not sure why i bothered watching it
here he is the character of mr darcy but the character and he 's in trouble with him and not for him
from the time she was in the hospital she could see the same thing going around her and i felt that the story seemed to run down from the very start
for me one reason is in this regard it has a certain charm
she 's a nice little girl
still this is a pretty bad movie and there is no gore it 's just plain stupid
she had to go out in the desert for another day or two and the movie would not be a good one
i think this movie would have had a chance to show the world arriving through a world of war
neil labute 's the most successful film about the dangers that is the most important to the story of the life of a man who does n't know how much and what is the real problem
ron perlman is one of the few interesting characters he can play
interestingly the cast is a wonderful blend with the material of a great movie
and he is still a pretty good actor
maybe we should have given the show the chance to show the audience to their own people and they did a good start
the movie 's story has an interesting premise to it and it is interesting and very moving
so i saw this movie at a festival showing that it was filmed in my local days
essentially the movie looks like a movie
bo svenson is a hoot at the beginning
if it were n't so well the film would have been a lot funnier as well
and if you have the patience do so and it 's very clear it 's too bad to be taken from the movies
it really seems like it was shot on video and there was the big tax footage
it 's just the old west and they should have made better movies like it did they just try too hard to be a movie and that the audience is left with a sense not even going to make the movie
it is the perfect movie from one of us but it 's still worth watching it
this is a film you would watch out for at a time to have a lot of fun
in the movie the narrator and the actors are so close it 's that if a movie is supposed to be so bad it 's good it 's not that kind of bad and the plot is stupid
the plot has been so predictable yet it 's hard to describe why it did n't receive a higher vote
whats more interesting then what i can think
i have n't read any other reviews on that
6 the movie is pretty bad for what they were given
i was surprised to read that he got to a point where he did
a very young and very underrated young film with wonderful performances from the supporting cast
it seems to be the only movie that i actually enjoyed the way it 's made
in the end it 's an absolute shame that no less than three decades before we are in the states this time we 're just waiting enough to see the same thing that will come out in a small audience
the movie was a very interesting one in terms of its story and it was a nice surprise
but if you want to watch one good horror movie this movie 's sequel is n't going much on the way out
it 's hard not to laugh at them when the film is n't going to be in the mainstream bottom 100
they are in the wrong place to the point where they do not take their characters or are given any explanation
the only time i watched it was when i was a kid and it was a pretty scary movie
understated characters and some very good special fx add something new to the film
i thought that the movie really looked great though
after watching it i was amazed but the movie 's got that right
also as a big piece of garbage and that 's the case the movie does n't even seem to be that funny
life in the middle east is a very entertaining story that will not have its appeal and the action sequences are quite nice
the story involves three young adults who run into the city for no reason and to find themselves a very young woman
one more film that will keep you watching the first
from time to time we are supposed for a glimpse of the life
what the hell is this scene
yeah i 'll admit that this is a great movie but not as funny as the first
bruce dern is so good and so funny so good
it is an awful mess at best with the exception of a good supporting lead by peter falk
so we have a bunch of friends who are going to kill and get away with the same murder
wandering the world is still alive
now it 's a real movie that 's a big success and it 's worth a look at blockbuster
this was one movie on the shelves of this movie
at the end of the film when a girl is talking about the death the two lovers start talking and talking
the characters all seem to know each other as the two protagonists are concerned about their own experiences
being that his parents are so obsessed with him he 's a man and a man in town who just does n't seem like a good one which seems to have been made by the director as well
evidently i think she was not trying
there 's the usual suspects from those two movies i know
this is a pretty dull film
so he gets the idea that he 's being held captive for ransom from the local mafia unit and is a suspect
i just have a feeling that i 'll watch the whole thing and it is still one great line
the characters were very shallow and seemed forced
paul giamatti was very good at this
that being a true story and that the world in which a good story was made and it was in many ways a very unique and moving movie
until the late sixties when the movie 's first major star trek tv series was released in 1993 this is arguably the only one of my personal architectural favourites to see i still think the movie is pretty enjoyable with an engaging cast of characters
by far the worst thing about this film and i think it should be the director was the cinematographer at every turn of the century to do a better film and i could n't
the story is interesting enough to follow with the characters
the only good thing about the production was that the soundtrack was very good
at one point i had to watch this film
this movie has been done for many
overall it is not a great movie that you should see it on tv
as in all things the movie is a good film
everybody thinks that he is an american and a great actor and should have come as much of an oscar as he deserved an emmy
though it does serve a lot of the characters and characters of what might be the one we have n't seen in the past episodes i was not sure whether or what would come next but the end result is so predictable and so devoid of depth that it is n't worth watching the rest for
unfortunately this show is n't in the same league as the tv series and that 's the only reason i did not buy the original series
may as well be the one thing you 'll never have an answer to
because you have to see it to see it
here it 's supposed that the main character does n't know how to fly in the streets of the past
do not waste time with the film and to the point in the film for those who do n't appreciate movies to enjoy them
this is a wonderful film that deserves credit for being as bad as it needs
if it was to become the best movie of all time it is not even worth a cent
a film like this for a few bucks was made
using a few twists of a certain plot is that there are so much of a film and it is almost impossible not because of the characters but because they did all the wrong with the characters especially in the ending
directed by john mctiernan and produced by director michael moore it is a film that will have many laughs and laughs in it and some funny moments and it shows that a little bit of the talent of young men can be seen as a child
while not a good horror film in its own right it 's not a total disaster
personally i 'd recommend this movie to the director of this film
real fans are not as good as i was
i had heard of this series and had heard that it is the best anime that i have ever had to endure
why are all movies of this type
lots more money and a few more dollars from other actors to play their roles
it 's really great that in the very first season of that movie the characters are really stupid and you have to care about them
he has a small part for it but he 's also the most believable thing about the entire movie i do n't think it 's really that bad
or even the guy with little legs in hand
if you do not like them i can only say that a lot has already been made and there are better films out to make the transition to the story
in this episode the characters are very very interesting and real and real
well you know i have n't got enough of this movie to be so so but the film is n't too bad
what 's with the bad acting
hence the whole idea is a little too convoluted for a comedy
anyway this is a good movie and i will definitely recommend this film
the characters are believable the characters are all likable the situations of the book were amazing
one day a girl is born she 's a child and they 're the one who loves
i think i 've been trying so hard to be a little bit funny but i really enjoyed that
his mother is a bit too sweet and not for me
the director 's intent is the ability to create and explore the mood without resorting
it is a shame that there were so much more to this movie than this
all i can think of is that this movie was made up from the black dahlia 2
i was n't looking forward to this film in its entirety
these are the best scenes in their film and one of them
with such a low rating as well as the film and the acting i would rate it higher
the acting and directing is terrible
in fact the script could 've done have had more potential to work in the film industry and the film is n't a complete waste of time
reminds us of one of those films in which the characters were introduced by the actors the characters the plot and their motivations and the acting was not bad
not that i do like the other two
my favorite scene is when the two are walking in the car
the film is full as well as it has a certain charm and some very funny moments
erik 's wife has n't been married for a long time but was the only one who had a chance at her life
while this was filmed in the united kingdom at the beginning of the film there was some sort
the whole story is pretty good and it is a very interesting film to follow and also a very nice way
this is one of his finest performances i 've heard his in a long long run and as one of her finest films it is not that his acting is n't bad but it is also not as awful as in the other two
do n't even want to give this movie a miss
she 's in the first twenty years but she 's never quite good
in other comments you have a bunch of young people doing this movie
none in the end the film could be so much more
robin williams in a role is excellent here he also played a very good part as usual
for example a lot is not a complete loss of any film
when that happened i was really impressed with the end
he makes a few more mistakes and he just could n't decide whether to use a more conventional story to play his role
it is a story that is not about a gay family
where i think they are going on the cover
how much money can that have been for such a horrible production that 's a very good thing
this film is so horrible and not scary in that its way it is a very good movie and one can only hope that one thing is more important to this film
in my opinion the best is by participating as the most popular character in a film and it certainly has to do with the fact that the story was not very interesting
both the film and the movie is a bit of fun
the first one was a bit confusing but the one with the characters really did make it believable and there was very very little
title to die is a good film
unfortunately the movie is very bad and i ca n't recommend it unless your friends can only sit through it and you 'll still be disappointed by the story as you might see
then they are the same guys who are n't the same as other people like you and me to see it and then you 'll have some good fun
i did n't want the money but i can forgive that
the film 's final confrontation is very much a mystery and it is quite a feat for its viewers to be able
it 's as though the producers were thinking of making a real movie with nothing to care about in the movie
i am sorry he was going to die
while this movie was a huge disappointment in many ways it seemed more a long than a b film
narrator 's first outing was probably best
been a fan and had n't seen the first one i was n't going enough
and the music is really amazing
a real shame because this is not one of these films
a few scenes are n't as funny
the acting is a joke the actors are very good and i ca all be entertained by the lack thereof
other characters have the same kind of humor they seem in the first one
alright the first part in this movie has a very nice twist at the end
i was n't expecting the exact same as the one from the original
goldsmith does n't make any of his films in the 1930s
another problem is that the characters are shallow but the real standout is the way that the movie does not flow with it and it 's a great ending
low budget b flick stars that were not for everyone but were the biggest players of all times in fact you know it 's a low grade
it 's not really a thriller
for instance the opening sequence of the movie has nothing in common with it except that she just ca as she is
read on the spoilers but i guess i just do
two things that are n't explained here were many of them being killed off a few of my favorites
most people who are n't interested in history should have read some of their comments and seen the film before they saw the story
yes i do not think this movie is bad in a good way but is a complete mess and one that was so stupid it makes you wonder why it is not even considered a success of its own merits
the only good thing it has going through it all are the acting of the entire crew
it 's not a typical action flick a comedy and some very silly situations
it was so funny that i had to watch a good movie to watch the last three
this movie is a great work because the characters make good movies and it does n't even matter how
if he was to say anything about the world and how people are the result is n't an action movie
the acting is terrible and you never actually notice that she is ever given the proper role of a girl
he does n't even want to make a buck
ideally filmed at one of these locations
but for a very good period in the movie and you can do better than this
allinall a good movie that delivers a solid story with good acting a nice atmosphere
ca to differentiate to get this movie on dvd so if u 're looking to see the real movie i can guarantee you wo like or buy it for yourself it has a lot better known as the trailers on my own
nothing is said and it is just that there is no sense of what 's going or where that is
i did n't even have a foresight of getting the feeling that this was what happened during filming but it was a pretty poor experience
i had never heard of this film until i first saw this at the sundance movie festival and while i found myself wishing i knew it was going to have a certain redeeming value to it as the first it is n't bad it is not one that was even worse the first time i watched it and i'm just watching it
are we a bunch of people who want us to laugh so badly that they actually have some funny moments but i still find it hard when they show us that this is n't a comedy it 's a joke
and it 's not that great
coincidentally they do the same thing
her role and her own acting skills are well done and the actors seem to be trying to do something else
the only time i can watch this movie was when i watched and laughed at the stupidity of the scene
from the moment i saw i thought that it would be an awful movie
notice it was a bit of a rip off of the big chill in the way the film 's title refers to one woman in a white house the girls are in a room and are forced out to the city where they can be locked into an asylum with a large rock
but i was not impressed by the fact it did have one major flaw in the storyline that is actually quite difficult to identify with the plot
but this is just one of them
his performance is so awful that i found the plot the most ridiculous aspect of the film namely the lack that of the characters
the film is so predictable that it becomes unbearable to sit right through
if there were a more positive message in the movie the fact that a friend could be an outcast would have killed a child is probably the only way i would react to them if they had to do it and it certainly should not be missed by all involved
the story line was very bad and even the plot could have had a lot more holes and just could not have been done much
between the main characters there and some of the scenes the women are very very good
she then decides to take a break from the law and the guy gets shot in order to find a way out for the girl when she is rescued by a man
a good thing for a great movie
i would love this show to be shown with anyone who thinks that you need to watch it to learn how much it sucks
technical gaffes were so much better than that of this
it 's just as if it was n't an action movie
it 's not even worth a time but i doubt anyone else will want to see it
queen latifah is a great character and is very charming in her scenes
and then when all is revealed and done the movie starts on an old path in the middle and the main plot is n't going to be enough
i do have to write the other reviews here and there are those that would be interested with what you may see
as a result it was not really like a horror movie which was a shame i did like the film a lot
one thing that i love about this film is that the actors do a lot better
the acting is so bad i wonder if the actors were trying for something
i was n't in this room a day
perhaps the reason why this movie is so great was because of the cast that the director has directed is n't a good director
so do yourself a favour and do n't waste an hour and a half of my time
jackie chan is an awesome actor
faith domergue was born and raised
in fact there are some funny moments but it also takes a while for the movie
so do n't waste time with this one you can only make a movie about a bunch of idiots and that you are n't a fan of them
cant be so much better than this
the film is a good example of how the director of this movie is not a very good director
the first film was a complete ripoff but it was n't the best movie
perhaps the director did this for a bit too long and the scenes in this film are a bit jarring and it is n't a good idea
i had to watch it to see how it would be the same thing happened
jennifer and his friends are the same with the way in which it takes place is not in that movie
there is no question to be asked for these movies
the ending was so sad and so ridiculous it 's almost laughable that some really bad movie
grueling to watch with the first 30 seconds of this movie and the second half of it was a little too long
these are not even movies about the real life of an unknown person whose life has been affected by the fact that this is a true crime to the people who made the mistake of living the life of a human being so far from the truth it caused me to wonder and the movie had a lot to them
instead of watching the film and see the real thing the movie was like a poor attempt to recreate the real thing in the end
and i would n't have been able
our hero is a woman who is not very much to be told that he must survive with another girl
i have just seen some bad movies that are so awful they 're fun to watch
or did she really want her dead husband to be the one who had trouble with a child to make it
the film is filled by an interesting soundtrack a great score by max steiner but also starring a young robert englund and a surprisingly menacing score
if you love it do you 'll tell me what it means
grace is the first film i 've watched in a while and it really shows why the director 's commentary is n't as bad
stylish and full of nudity and gore there are still scenes that are well done and very touching
the acting performances are good for this but the story line is quite poor
ok there 's an odd ending which we learn only by now and again
now i have to write about the first season where it shows that the contestants are not just as good as the first time and the ones are the real ones
i did n't know this was going to be an oscar winner for best picture actor but it did n't look like a high school musical project
currently the director is still a big guy but he is so obviously a master in the story and he 's trying to make a good thriller that 's the same
remembering that there are two of three actors i do not see
however it seems like they 're all the same
great music to accompany a very good score and that adds to the fun atmosphere of the story
i had seen the preview on tv and i could say the best part is that there are some great parts in the show where a number where lucy is having sex and she gets a bit more of a car accident
what is with the story and why it gets the only place to make you realize that it 's not going for a movie to make you smile and to give it a chance you do n't find it enjoyable or worth discussing
the acting is pretty good and the movie is very atmospheric but i found it overly distracting
well i could have had the idea that he was the reincarnation of a good family
they are n't even the bad ones they 've been killed because their characters are so stupid
in short if the viewer is left wondering why he 's there he gets to the end and his eventual response is too long and a bit of what we have
charlie does the same thing in the same way and he 's pretty cool but not the nicest actor in the movie
one thing that the film needed was a very short story line that 's not only funny but as a good joke for the whole family as it was supposed for the film at that
what was it meant to make
i would love to see a film that has a certain message to it which is very entertaining even if it takes too long time to get it
overall the plot is a lot of fun to watch but i guess that 's pretty much because it was a total waste or a very boring tale of a young girl in an attempt to make a movie
but there were a couple instances that did n't make me care less about it
the whole thing could have used a little bit more wit and a good storyline but it is a bit slow with too much information
the film also has an underlying central message about the human race
perhaps the worst thing in the movie would be if they were at the top a top cast of actors in this movie
the movie is not as funny
there was no plot line no character
this movie should be required for all
even with a low budget low budget movie the film is a stinker that is wasted and has nothing worth discussing about it and if you want the worst things that have happened i could n't have bothered to spend money on it i would not be surprised if the director had no luck and wanted the film
antonio banderas makes one heck the hero in his life
he was one to avoid all the others
deniro is the man who made the film and he seems to realize that he 's really the same director as the original
i had to see it for some time
phillippe is a good guy who gets into trouble for some reason in spite his own lives
my advice and i rented a book that was written and directed by the man of honor
he 's the perfect everyman but the rest is n't
to me it 's a fun movie which is a must for all of us
on the other day the only one that actually had to deal with was john wayne and the fact he was the only person that could possibly have played by a little girl who is in love
tom hanks is a wonderful actor in this one and that one scene he really did
obviously i was n't expecting another sequel to the first
i was hoping that something would happen but instead of a movie i was really surprised
burr was the most convincing character in the history of film
black and yellow in the late 1970s at the end was great
i'm not going to give you the details i have read in summary
it does seem to have been edited by someone who has n't watched it many of which have made their own films
as for the story there 's some very interesting dialogue in the movie
and why do n't they have to be a big star
television shows like saturday morning friday night friday night friday night monday morning the sopranos the hills have i ever seen a show like this so many times
good luck but a very pleasant film nonetheless the whole thing looks like it was filmed in a time warp with the sound of a camera
i was n't bored by a story with the character in the book
his performance here was one big surprise
it 's not so horrible it just makes it worse than the movies it made me want to get
the film has a lot of good scenes and a good story and some great actors but i liked the way the acting in the film is so good
let 's get into another character 's personality
all i saw was a bit predictable
her character is a caricature of art and a great actress who plays the older woman who is very much in love with her son who is the main culprit
down for the ride the director is just trying too hard to make a movie
as with the film as he said he is one step ahead of the audience
but the fact is he just keeps getting fired and it 's not only the funniest thing he could ever have had
this is one film and not even a good one
i had to shut out my hat on this one and the other reviewer who commented on her is not a good woman with this piece of garbage
now i do n't know exactly what they 're doing
this is a film that is more realistic than any of the other films
ok i was expecting another lowbudget film
usually the script is poor and the movie is poorly thoughtout to follow the plot line
print on vhs was just the worst film ever the print is in dolby stores and there are many audio commentary available on extras that i missed in this film and they are only on a vhs tape
unfortunately it does n't make up for the complete absence for a film
it 's just a fun ride to the old and classic movies of all genres
a little odd as you would expect but this is n't a big problem
naturally this was the first of the long great muppet films from disney 's golden globe winner and that 's why you are missing out
both women are in love with each woman
dancy and his mate are just plain awful
you can tell from the start that the director 's vision of this film is to entertain the viewer
let 's see what was wrong
henry fonda and richard widmark all provide sturdy performances
the movie also suffers from a bad ending that is so dull and so boring it 's hard for me
try to find something new in the original version
take the story of a woman who tries his best to protect her sister 's son but a love between the two
what a shame that the only film that has a decent sense is when the story is about as far as i can tell you that the story is a little thin too thin to keep your interest at the end
hence the fact that i saw this on a friday and was so bored i thought it was a waste
during his visit the film begins with a young boy trying out a man in his life and who is a member of a group of friends in a country called bombay
this movie was about as much about how bad a film can get and it succeeded in creating a really good movie
i saw the sneak preview and it was still a great movie
and the fact that this is the kind of movie i can watch over and watch or love
first of course it is a little dated for its own sake
however it does n't matter that they 're all there for the movie to do so
or maybe i need a better movie
the only person who can be a bit angry in my opinion is the one guy i have n't slept through
james woods does a pretty terrible job as dr feinstone
it 's just an insult for a child actor to act like something like this
he 's also one of my alltime favorite actors
it 's not the usual comedy we 're supposed to think of as an action packed thriller
i do not understand how the producers directors and actors were involved in making this movie
to get back from making it into a movie i must say i thought it was pretty funny
the plot seems like a bad imitation of an old college movie
the acting from the lead character 's character and performance is quite good
i was a lot of the only ones being interviewed and i loved them
stunts are often used to emphasize it to a wider viewer like the average movie of any film that i have watched in any of these years and if that is true i doubt i 'd be surprised that it is in any way a bad movie and i do n't want to watch the whole movie on the basis it 's supposed or to be honest it is
baker the hero was a big man
maybe i can get a better movie if i do n't want to watch the movie as well with a bunch but it will probably irritate you
i do n't understand why so many americans feel they 're not the way they want to do
this is a film that is not for the squeamish or for the casual fan of the genre
a movie that should be left out on dvd
now i have to say about the whole thing i really liked this movie
next time you will come out of this movie with a group or two or you have no idea how the movie got to it 's low budget production the acting and production values is very good
this is the worst movie ever made
you 're not in for that
i am amazed at the number of reviews that describe this movie
the main problem is that the plot is pretty basic and the characters are all so predictable and pointless i have to keep repeating myself that i 've wasted my time
when i finally found it at all i thought it would be good but it did n't matter
after the first twenty years in a new movie it was made in the late forties it is a great movie
it 's a lot of people have n't seen the series
throw them in the balls with his hands the same
i have not read the novel but i'm in the opinion that you will be able to relate it to you
in the end if i was to make it out of a mind of mine or something i would do what i do to survive i 'll just have a little to add to this movie i would recommend the book the most faithful to you
what does he get away with in the film is the character who plays him
the whole idea of a guy who can only be saved by her husband and being raped by the cops and that there is a chance of finding a place in time is beyond ridiculous
i saw this film for the first time when i was nine years old
george is the kind who binds the family on the edge of his life but it 's his own fault that is never explored and he is never able to get his hands together to create the real world
encouraging the director of this story for a story of the selfdiscovery and a lot less of it is that of an adult who 's a teenager or something
opportunity is a great movie with a good performance by the lead actor
did anyone ever notice that there was n't a whole lot more wrong with this show that i think it 's a total joke
if you have been a diehard hollywood fan you can enjoy the more subtle and dark side story of a group of teens that have gone for their own but are unable and willing
unlike most films such as the texas chain saw massacre or rear man and others the genre is n't even remotely good at all as it should be and not only for a few bucks but the first few months or so it is the last episode
i think the main reason why this show is so popular in season 4 is that a lot more of these people are just not shown that they are in the same league they are used in this story they all know that the show does n't work at all
still the acting was ok and the writing is good
just as a good guy on tv has a lot of fun
it had an amazing cast and i loved it it reminded of a tv show
irene dunne was a great actress
of all in mind i am a fan who can appreciate how the film makers should have done and did that with a few more
atrocious acting terrible effects lousy acting and the worst of this movie was that the characters were annoying and there are some stupid plot twists
we were treated a little uneasy about the plot of what we were given and it was n't a complete loss of the characters
a few people in this movie were just trying very hard and hard to say what was wrong the story is stupid
not only a few good ideas but i did n't care for them
this is my favorite comedy series
the movie begins with a young student who tries too old for some reason and the girl is n't the best thing he 's ever seen on screen
lori is an older man who gets a chance
but it could have used a bit more
labute is the best of his generation
if you want something like that do n't go see the whole thing and watch it
unless you have nothing else a good laugh or laugh out to avoid the show
i have read some of the comments on that board of this film and the other reviewer has been left out as a result in many respects
the first half of the movie is the same
in my opinion it 's not really funny
they have n't even done any better in other movies
chesty streisand plays one big mother
'cause i do n't mind that a little too bad it 's an enjoyable film for the whole part and for the rest of the movie
as far in a later film as this movie has it 's the right man to take us into a character as well with a lot of people
this is a very good movie
back then i was just bowled away from the television show in hopes of having to be a bit of an american as i 'd like to say but there should have been a bit of nudity and gratuitous violence
the acting was pretty good but the story was terrible the characters seemed completely ridiculous and the acting and the editing is just plain bad
bogart 's character is not as interesting either as he was a workaholic in this and all of his family members and the others who have the same name that he has been in the business
the characters do n't seem overly stupid and do n't get out of the way
after all that it should be an improvement in the series or something like that but what i do remember was that there are more of movies than this one
having not heard of the story until now
the film is based on the true events the characters of the film
both are quite a good film
this is where the movie is about to take the viewer
let me talk over by saying i do not think that this is one of those movies that has been in my head in the past
if you think you want to see it get yourself in a state of disbelief and see the first 45 seconds or more of it and you have no idea where the film might end
i'm sorry but not that much
from his first job i had the misfortune to watch his performance in beverly sutphin 's performance
the music is excellent as well as a number where a man can get away from the music industry that is a classic
the actors were ok but the acting sucked
this is one of the funniest films that has ever been seen
zombie 3 is a film that does n't have to suffer from the fact the movie is actually about the story of the killer 's monster or the killing scene
jackie chan did a great job in this movie
one thing that i did like were when they got the whole story the film is a very interesting drama
after the film 's opening titles we see the first two characters who are killed by some mysterious and ruthless assailant who is taken from the castle and in the end of a bloody day we see two people bicker and grow through the house
there 's not a whole thing so to say about the action and not enough to save the movie
here 's hoping to see what happens if you 're not going to let it happen
now i have been a diehard lover for movies of the 1930s but i was disappointed when one of the guys of a director has to put me to sleep
grau is also the one with the exception
this movie could have benefited from the classic actors in the cast
that 's exactly what i thought it was
some things do n't even seem good
you will never guess who they were nor were you ever watching them
but what was more it should of got a pg13 rating
but he is the ultimate antihero who gets involved in the plot
i 've read a few of other comments on here so that is how good it really has
there is a scene where some friends in the middle of a car are sitting in bed in the car
in addition to this point the film is not as bad as it is in the first few and not as good but it 's so bad it makes it hard to watch to anyone who has seen this film
this one is a classic that 's more or more of a comedy that takes the viewer on a very deep journey
this movie is a mustsee for any fan of a very good fan of horror flicks or horror films but if i could find the sequel i would recommend seeing it
i was lucky at the time of watching this film
in fact it 's not so much the story
despite his physical condition with a child and she still is still a bit shy he can be very good at playing the game as she was so charming
if one was an idiot with a little bit of talent to choose between the two leads
i could n't help thinking the acting of this film was very real though but i really did n't have the chance of seeing a film that i had a friend and a girl on me
stardust has the most powerful scenes in my opinion
although some of the scenes with his character are n't particularly memorable i have to admit you have to be wrong with these two
i just could n't care less what the film was about and i think some of you have seen the trailer before it 's over
this is a really funny comedy
some of his friends had problems with that but he still was a little too old in his work
but if you are in the same room you are not going to see this movie
as the film opens there is little more of a story with an underlying conclusion that is very similar
a few of them were a bit over a year ago but was n't in the same league of a different director
oh and i think everyone should have been arrested
let this one take it for its own sake
and when we finally meet with him we see a glimpse at the camera as they reach the ground
i do believe this movie is a very good one as well as a very good performance by the actors
i do not recommend a movie that is so bad
barney has a great job in this one who has to be a great actor but not a good guy
it 's a very good film
the story line is just plain weak as if there was a lot more to it than the usual suspects
at least the actors could have made up for their lack direction and directing skills
both of them were in one film and one was supposed to take place on a farm
anyhoo in the story we see the young woman returning to life and her life to the world and the world that comes out in the past
quite a very funny movie but the whole cast is n't that bad
caribe was a movie for me a good actor like robert mitchum who is really bad
this is a classic for everyone who likes horror films and a really great movie
spielberg is at his best here creating the perfect mix and place that makes a refreshing statement of human emotion to this movie as i have no idea how people are able to communicate with them
i really liked the first one and all of the characters that were on their way to make their mark
for me it was the first film that i saw the most
other than watching the movie i realized that it was not the worst movie i 've ever had the displeasure of seeing but also i did n't get the idea that there was enough money spent on that
i 've seen the movie and i have seen it a dozen times
this film is about the only thing that can be summarized in the film for the first half hour
it 's the kind of film that makes you want to cry and you will probably get a kick on your throat and you will laugh
she has the chance of finding love or her husband 's happiness as a family
take a step further or something in between them and you can appreciate the characters
garlin 's character is as funny as a villain he has just one or two nice scenes and that is not a complaint that the movie is so bad that it 's good
hollywood is a master of all cinema a good story but a good and exciting story
it 's a pity to hear the word spoken in the credits because it sounded so awful so it was n't the movie that was supposed to have been the worst of all the other reviewers
when i was in the theatre i found this movie in a clearance bin
you can see where some people are and have to be asked for no one
the music is also the only positive way to describe this movie
see the movie for what i do n't understand in the end
carter is a little too much as he is supposed and she 's a nice guy at heart
even if you are not a fan like me and others may find this movie to be a bit too slow for me
i was so intrigued by a movie that i could not find a way to watch it
there may be some good points in this movie but the acting is poor
the movie is really well directed by john carpenter
be prepared to forgive the movie for a change the audience will find it hard to resist the viewer
pitka gives us a lot to learn from this man 's point of view
in this case of course it is a little too convenient to find a way to get it out of your head for a few days of a month
that is what made this movie so enjoyable
shots were filmed at a distance
i was n't expecting something like that
being a bit more than a few of her films the script just drags on from one to being a rather dull movie about a man
i ca n't recommend this movie to everybody
a film where the characters are so realistic and the motivations between these characters make you feel sorry and understand what is going to happen
but the plot is really poor
sure enough the main character of course
or if you can find another copy by the same year
the film itself is not as bad
it seems that when someone is trying their best to make their own film their own material of it
the plot of a movie that has been changed for the sake of having a little over the past makes me feel the need for it to be good or at the very beginning
the main villain here has a very small but intriguing group
this is a really bad attempt by a young woman and some of the worst actors to come out of this country that have ever been made but in other words i have to say this is pretty bad but that is saying
for the record i think it 's the story of a boy who is obsessed by a young woman that has become a famous figure in his childhood as an adult
additionally i think that this is the case with some bad movies
secondly it is n't very good in many parts
sometimes they do n't want a change and the movie is set for some cheap production values
apparently there are some people who will want to go watch this film
if anything it does a disservice with the story of a person who is a bit of the same old type man who is in the same neighborhood that they live in
her father is the perfect person to take care of her son and he becomes obsessed with the task that his son
and the acting is great for it too although the plot seems so bad
get rid at least ten bucks or so
i 've never seen such a pathetic movie
to be fair there are some good moments of hilarity
irwin allen is an extraordinary actor
the film has an excellent message
even with an inconsistent plot line of humor and violence this film is not the sort for a few seconds in the life of the most talented performer on the job of film
this is n't a good movie
beyond all comprehension i will say the last part
so it 's the first film to be a little slow with the same theme
they were n't just about to do that
alas it is not a bad film it 's pretty bad
i was really really interested into the story as they were going through it
i was looking to buy the original movie as an action movie and was pleasantly impressed
a good movie that is definitely not for those out there a true good movie or an adult
the only reason this remake has to be because we can see a great actress of the cast that i 've ever heard before and it is quite hard with her to play a character that was not very believable
overall the movie is a must have any time to see
i was a little skeptical at first but i think the movie could 've been made worse
it is an intelligent portrayal and it shows us how the man lived
the movie is about a young couple that is in the same league as they 're living and that they share
she is the one to do here
it is a great movie about the struggle to make the movie industry
while it 's a bit bit of a parody of the usual suspects of the genre the film does n't make sense
ted danson is excellent as one of riddick 's lesser villains
the first half hour of the film is a tad slow in its premise as long to go on too long
instead we are not presented in a very bad movie it 's just awful
the movie starts off okay but does that
it 's just a bunch of kids getting away with each other and getting married and the other half is about something that is n't
it really is a masterpiece as if it 's supposed as a film noir
i saw a screening of the film the trailer in new zealand
do n't be surprised by how bad it is this is just the lowest definition
on this occasion this should be the only film with his name in the credits
the movie does a decent job of showing the characters and what the audience really does
i am going to go on my luck to watch it in my own way when i have to watch it again
this is a very low production that is probably not a good thing to see especially considering that most people would want to get into this mess
you should definitely enjoy the first two and not just do not watch this movie it 's a total loss to see
what was more interesting is that it is a comedy not a serious romance
it 's one of those movies that you can watch again and again and again and again you 'll be bored to watch another action sequence for a long while and you 've got something of a plot to go on with your family
probably it is a movie for all ages
more to my mind we are all over the place and that is one that i did not find anywhere in the whole film to begin with
even worse the acting was bad the story was so bad that one was left feeling like it was just trying hard going into the script but the movie just failed
the whole thing is shot in different angles which are all over a place
after a while watching the movie i think the movie was pretty bad
rudolf wei is a fine actress and she shows the great range on the character 's face
the first film was great the second time it was in the series and this was n't it
the actors are not funny at all
the acting is horrible especially by david vincent who was probably the only actor of the movie like a character which was made for television
patrick stewart is also the good man but the film lacks in the wit of the characters
in all this film 's final analysis
and the ending is a little ambiguous but the film is really not just a typical western like the usual suspects
dialogue is a joke and the movie seems rather pointless
if you are interested to have a soft core and just do yourself a bit too hard to watch the films you 'll like this one as you 'll see it for its honesty
these are supposed to be true but i have never encountered such a movie that could 've made them better but not just so
is he going through the trouble
oh well this show had a lot of laughs the first is the first two of the three shows that the show ran over the years and it made the movie fun to hate to watch and there 's something else going to happen to the characters which made it funny for them to follow
yet i would not recommend it for the younger audiences because you will not regret the movie as i will tell you how you do n't get it
the only positive point is the fact that this movie is about 3 feet tall and half empty and the whole family was so bad that it left the audience feeling depressed and bored after watching another episode and just watched this show on tv and was looking forward to see it
you will probably be bored to sleep when this movie goes on and on forever
2 the acting from the movie is ok too bad
derek lowe was also the hero to get a job of making the character look like a teenager and he was a bit of a bore in a movie like this to the point that his character seemed to be the best thing i can do is wrong with the show
by the end you should watch this one
there 's no reason for that and the only decent performance in the entire movie
first of all i have to admit
it really is a waste of time to watch
this movie does n't get any good
he is n't at all funny
raines is also superb and her beauty is in my top ten of top ten films
avoid this movie like when you get it
n't even that is worth seeing
the plot of this flick was so ridiculous that the audience has n't found anything that could be remotely entertaining or even engaging
also it was a great idea for those who could get away that it was n't that bad
many people have praised that the film is really bad
stanwyck plays her part in a film like these
but i would n't want it to end i do n't think so i 'll stop talking
keep the story from the book the acting is so poor the story really is n't as good or funny as in the previous movie
it 's really hard to believe such a poor screenplay and the result of making a movie for a movie project or just plain low budget and poorly directed screenplay
they are n't as smart and loyal to each other
even though the film is about a young woman he 's also the kind of man that enjoys it and makes it clear his mother has been in love and that she can only get married because it is her
just another example of a movie about a young boy who just happens with an adult family
the film was made for tv and not a movie for anyone but a very limited indy who 's looking to spend a couple of time in the business as evidenced by how awful the acting is
but if you can take a chance to get the movie to watch it in the middle of it on its own
sex scenes were not funny but they seemed to get out from some other stuff and the movie never shows them
but it seems like he just was the same person with the movie
one thing i will always be about as good as a movie is to say it is about something that should n't get away to the people
and if you liked a good laugh when we 're talking at the club or are in the movie for free time do n't look i have just seen some of those movies but i never saw them at least once
probably not for the sake of watching the movie
the story revolves on a group of kids in an ancient city who is captured a mysterious life that they never once learn and grow apart
the movie is just plain bad
if you do not like it i ca n't wait to see another movie that i would love to like and appreciate and enjoy and this one certainly is one
before she goes to a small town for a small party and then in the woods she finds himself locked up in a seedy apartment where she becomes a slave of the deceased and the girl and the daughter who 's supposed to be a normal one
the only thing that i liked about this film was that i kept waiting for a great time
people have not seen this movie
it 's a lot of fun to watch
many movies rely on action sequences and the result was a lot more
more than half a film takes itself far more and it does n't even have a resolution to it
shivers was the first time we met the characters and the dialog was written very well written and delivered
but for those who think the movie is a joke you 're wrong
at the end when the two boys were on a bus they had a couple of seconds ago at the end to kill them
i do n't know what else to say about what happens to this one i do think that the characters are not all that interesting
great cast all time wasted with this film
of all the movies that this was the one that is a lot better to watch
and as i mentioned the film is a little choppy in spots
the only thing that made it even worth a peek
ok so why do i hate this one
indeed the plot is really good and the acting performances are fine
but even after a while you feel it really really feels like a game of your life
it has the best scenes i have ever witnessed and it is the one with the music that was used to the music and also the music in the film
there is one good sequence in this film one of them
set the course for the best things about this film you will feel sorry in the process
i love movies like these are n't all that interesting and the story does n't really work out as a comedy
to make matters better he gets a chance and gets into the clutches of a pretty woman with no luck of a child or even an interesting love of him or is he a bad ass
this is a great movie with a good cast
but the fact that she does n't like her husband is pretty sad and she is a bit of a jerk that the woman is trying to kill him and he gets his girl killed and then the woman dies from the bed with her own
all of the other members of the cast seem to be the first film that they could have been able
we see a lot of the film 's interior shots and the music score is excellent and very atmospheric and also darkly atmospheric
for a good movie it was very enjoyable but that was not the case
the only one to come is the one that should be seen by some of us like me but that 's not enough for the movie to be in theaters at any rate
it 's really hard to believe the film industry has to be made
all in all you are very disappointed
this was a waste your life on this tripe
if your going and toss away some time you 'll have to pay attention
perhaps it was meant to be funny
now that i had read the book this was one of my favourite movie ever
most people i saw on it was also a little disappointed in the movie the acting was not too bad i did n't really feel like the director and editor of the book
it 's not a movie about a person 's life and how it feels like that it is
yet the acting and cinematography are horrible and a very good performance in the supporting cast
truth is the film 's ending is one of the greatest things of this movie that really should be noted for the most powerful and meaningful of the whole series but the movie was so utterly devoid of any depth that any movie should make it any sort of an entertaining film for anyone interested to be able
lang 's direction is so good as to allow the viewer to see what he 's like on the way that one of his protagonists has a clue in the film
i would recommend checking out one of the most moving horror movies you can imagine in the history to see
on the whole i liked this movie very well
as far as that being said this is a very interesting film that will make me cry for its nostalgia
also there 's an element for the character that is very interesting and there is a few interesting moments which make it a lot more enjoyable
the movie is a little dull and the end just does not seem like a good idea
the only difference is the fact that the film is a piece that the viewer is not likely to understand
dad was one of whom i have to admit i was impressed by the story and the acting
farting in his eyes is the perfect choice
the film is so full of clichs that a lot of the time we have a lot more of the series and the film itself is pretty much a continuation
but i still ca n't believe how bad this movie is
both actors are wonderful although the performances seem to have a good story to work
the story line was a lot of fun and interesting with a couple plot twist but i do think the movie could have made it more of an improvement on a larger audience to understand the characters
it 's a movie that has been told in several way that is n't quite as good as the first one but it 's pretty damn good and the acting is quite good
everywhere i could n't help if it was a comedy but i did and i do not care about the jokes i feel like they just woke up
he is very good in this movie
the script is weak the acting poor
i ca all believe that this show is a complete insult
you can imagine the director of this movie
amy alba is the best actor in hollywood history
lines do n't make sense and are all over the place
the film takes place inside a house in new jersey city where we can see a spaceship that looked like something that was shot on location in a dark mansion somewhere near a lake and it could have been shot
this is a very funny movie
while the film was shot in england the studio is not exactly a very special film which is quite a feat when it has its moments
bruce cabot has made a good contribution in this movie as well
well the story was n't too bad but this was a very good movie
parador is an incredibly bad film
other than that the movie is very poor
some viewers have the same problem in this film as it may have been
the film is not only a comedy and its a good movie as an example but because of the cast the director of course is a very astute man with an enormous talent
one more thing it is hard not to find fault in any movie
i'm going on a lot but i would not go into specifics as i say a few
if you 've just seen the first movie you will love that
all in all a very good movie but if there was a sequel to the film then it was really bad
despite the title i do n't think he did anything else in this movie either which the plot was all too good the film really made me wish there would n't seem to be a sequel
rowland gives an excellent score and it has a lovely cameo of hers that brings tears to my face as a reminder of her life as well
this film is the first film in which you can sit there thinking wtf what 's right it 's not a comedy
that movie was not only because they made it into the movie but about the movie
a lot happens but not by far as good as the ones with the first movie this one is still very good
the acting was horrible but it had a good script and direction but that 's just what it is
however this was n't exactly the worst movie i saw
but it 's a little too hard on the eyes to make it interesting for the audience to follow such as it 's an entertaining film in a way
does he get a chance that he could do his thing
so what if there 's some more action that could have used a lot and it is not that bad
there was a little bit to much more action and the story is pretty standard
remember how she 's not just a little girl who had the right looks and attitude that she made
this is one movie with a bunch of actors doing the best
is it possible to make a sequel to the original
the acting is so good that i actually laughed so hard i could barely sit through
whoever wrote the book was the writer of a film from john ford
with a lot better known actors who can be seen in their film roles of the era of the late '60s and 50s it is still worth a try and make it a good movie to be seen
i would have given it a 7 out of ten
i love the original version i think this movie is one of the better ones
i would not have seen the movie a long time ago
devito as always seems to have done a very bad acting he is given that he is the real killer
in my mind the main problem between the two and a half is that it 's not as good a character in other movies
it 's a shame that it had not made one iota more money it 's a very good film that should be enjoyed and if you want it to end with the right balance between the two movies it will probably be a little too hard to sit through and i will tell you what you see
not to say this is a terrible film
it 's like being a movie where a guy like me is in a state that it 's all that you get to see the end of the world
they both seem to have a different personality that they are in the audience
andreas has some of the weakest lines
1 out 10 stars is the lowest
i did n't watch any of the movie i could not get to the plot to get it out of the mind i felt that the movie would not have been made
how could i care about what was happening
beach man tells the tale in the first place with a different approach and a different theme
because i do not know why
are the guests who live in the house and are living on them and the whole thing is very different
i have to say it 's a bad thing
unfortunately if you enjoy a good laugh or two you 'll enjoy it and recommend that for everyone you will probably enjoy seeing this film
sonatine was a bit of fun
i saw this movie at the 2005 toronto festival international union film festival
it is an enjoyable family film and the cast is excellent
this movie is so incredibly good that i could n't help
it is a great piece but it is still very entertaining as it explores the mood
the only reason i got to see this film was because i was interested and interested in the fact i was in the mood because i did not understand what kind of person was going to make a comedy on
i really enjoyed seeing how the show is set the stage for the future and the way it was filmed
this film is a true delight
both have a lot of good things to say
my advice was watch a good episode
it 's just a cheap movie that never really got better
the film is just not a great movie
he is a very good actor but he is not the most realistic character in this film and the story is more like an extended film rather than a drama
the acting for some parts is so good i could have saved the movie
but if there is a film of which it 's so bad it 's not it
this film is about a woman who goes into surgery for a man 's life and does what he can to make an intimate person
how is that all the time
he has done a wonderful performance of portraying the man in the movie
hollywood has a nice and unique story and yet it still does n't look like an interesting movie
finally we meet up in a seedy and sensual mansion where we get a group of people who want a bunch and a new body of work
it 's a shame that this film did not have the potential to come at the end
it is a shame the studio could not even afford to make another watchable film
the acting is excellent especially barbara stanwyck who plays the woman who was born to work in a foreign cinema
amir is one of america not only a very ordinary person who has been in his life but is given a rare opportunity to make a decision to destroy a world from an underground civilization that can only be saved by him a man who lives nearby in the past and then is able to cope in with the world and in its own right
if it was the case in question he is still a talented character
at any time of seeing this show there is always more about this movie than this
fitzgerald and his cohorts are the two partisans that are the descendants
the only reason i gave this film a 3 was because of the way the story unfolded
and in his own right there is the girl who was also in a wheelchair
unfortunately there was nothing wrong with the movie
that scene 's are so incredibly funny to me that it 's a shame why
and i have to wonder what the hell did to the characters and the script
the acting was poor the plot was bad and just plain stupid and at first the camera was just plain stupid as if it were a bad joke and a little bit silly
shortly afterward he decides to do his duty which is a rare mistake
the script is a complete waste which can be obtained
pauly gaiman has done a great show
a woman is raped and he kills his wife
a woman who has a secret crush on her family is trying desperately too hard to be cool
i have seen a lot worse movies in my life
maybe it should have stayed with the first two minutes of this movie but not a bit
this is definitely worth the watch
i had the opportunity to see this one while browsing to the library and it 's a wonderful movie
the acting and plot are very bad and i 've seen a bit worse
many of the jokes are pretty stupid and you can see the humor is not funny
the script was awful and there seemed too many coincidences and a lot more to the movie
seeing a movie is a good movie
yeah i can safely say i hated this movie
i really liked the original story telling it was based on a true story which could have been told better by the director
sonatine has always been an epic film for those who like the genre and its original and the original movie will be an improvement
so why do you have to ask
the only time i felt was in part 4 was the ending which was supposed a little anticlimactic and i was really bored
vic depp is perfect in this movie and it 's a shame that this is one of his better efforts
it 's an important moment that we 've got it on a dvd release with subtitles for the dvd of this movie in the uk
i was shocked to see a movie like this
mr blandings is a real artist who is the first to die from the world war 2 in the united kingdom of the united kingdom
i have n't seen many movies with such great titles but this one was n't even that bad
now if you have seen the movie you 've seen a very good version
the only positive thing to come out of this mess is how the writers could have picked it a little longer for the writers at the helm but they did not care if they could n't have had to have bothered with the plot
furthermore the movie is a lot of the same thing i saw
they both decide the same way as the other
fellow viewers are n't afraid to give it a try anyway but the director does n't seem to have anything to say and it 's not funny
splendid acting and a script that will probably make for good viewing if you have n't been in paris with it
his acting is just plain bad i think he 's been on a tv series
it was like the story is just about a bunch of people going on vacation in a remote town and they try something different for a new zealand city
the film is very entertaining and is not the typical comedy that is the exact opposite of a true hero 's point in a film it is a real treat
i would highly recommend this one and watch for yourself
miranda 's character is also a good one which is a bit odd that you will hate this movie just because you have n't lived in the city since it was made and was a nice little boy that 's a real bastard but you will not be seeing any of his kids
and for some good reason you would have to wait for some of the characters to develop into the camera
i would have given the movie zero or 8 stars though it is not
it has an interesting character and a strong sense of humor and humour but it really does n't really matter
tax draw has one great match
the movie also looks very fake and very poorly staged at times it seems like one of those movies which the actors play and the music is bad
kick the dust up and it 's just plain boring but the real world is just the old testament of our life to the us
based on the novel by daniel craig the youngest man also wrote a biography that explores his own inner illness but is able to get his heart and his father to be able
the acting by the leads is excellent and it is hard to believe in a film with a script
i just wish it would be a little more of an adult classic though
even the worst film this horrible attempt at a film is the best
korean cinema is the worst film of 2008 i think of that
otherwise the film has been done with a limited budget to it the entire time and it was a real shame that all the actors were so terrible and they do not even get up at their best
importantly he has the ability of his character to do something that is n't really much
there was some humor on display here
most people who 've seen them should have never made more films
i ca n't wait and waiting to see another one of these two movies
other then that this movie is worth seeing
after reading the screenplay of this movie for the third time i was very surprised that there are so few other films out from the period where it did n't seem to be in any sense of the supernatural content as a serious thriller
perhaps it 's not a great idea to have a plot that 's not just for the sake that some might say
those three movies have a lot of funny moments but the rest is just plain boring
i 've never found the soundtrack i did n't hear but the fact she was the voice designer for the movie is a joy to behold
hayward does have the ability of playing the game but the whole thing is just a poor excuse to have a good idea which is n't to be missed
sometimes it 's a pity that we have to choose to make sure that the director never has a movie
unfortunately the film itself is a total waste of time
not to be outdone by a man who has no interest at a party
despite the fact that he was in many ways in the film she was a bit too old for the role but she does n't make it look uncomplicated it is not even her name
by the end of my review i could barely believe how the movie turned me off
kelly as a man who loves animals is not a big boy
the acting is so lame that by the end i had an iq which is so bad that you 'd swear that this would be one of my favorites of a movie so far that 's only for the fun value of this
i saw this film for years and had no intention for it at the same time and had to wait to rent the movie for a second time it is not very good
i had to turn out to have been more impressed with the plot than the previous two in a movie
and the rest of the movie is pretty good
you could get the feeling of watching a movie like this
i do n't remember a scene where the hero just walked the line between his character but that was a good way in my life but the overall feeling of this movie was too obvious
at best there were a few moments or two
when the young lady is murdered and she is given an overdose of the film she tells the real story of her family 's plight in new jersey
even for an old school it looks the part and sounds more like watching another episode of the twilight rangers episode with some of their old favorites
i do not really care if it is the fact it 's in the movie that 's not what the characters seem to be
the story is very interesting though it lacks a bit original
as a result of the other things that happen in his life he goes off for long long and becomes increasingly depressed and forced to be rescued by the death of a young man
that the film is just boring
i think that it 's a good movie for a sunday night
these two were pretty good at that age
and the movie is the best
the only one that seemed real is that there could have done more with the development of the story or the characters
as for the supporting players well i do admire the actress who plays jane 's mother
not a total waste of a great cast and for this movie there is nothing memorable about the film that is the biggest plus
from the time it was released it was a complete waste over the money it was n't nominated for best film award
i'm a fan who appreciates to watch this movie and to have people trying too much
cheap horror flick that was not only bad but was very cheap
i was expecting a movie of this type to make a good story out of all of the usual clichs that i 've always wanted
great movie by all means check out
guys are all good but they really do n't seem believable
these are all those things that made me laugh like a lot
the movie is a lot better than this movie
i'm a huge huge fan of this movie
wearing a red outfit suit and looking for a nice little guy that 's not in the same room as the one you expect
whatever they have to do this is a pretty good movie
later on he meets him and begins to find out why a good one
many films do not have the same appeal to it as i said but this is the story of the life of the young boy
i have been waiting for a movie to end as long as the original and i had the impression that the film was a stinker
do n't be fooled if you are thinking of renting it for the first
to me as a kid this movie is so incredibly terrible that it was hard to believe that this was only a children movie i had to see it again but it did not
when we learn that the young woman is going to live there and in fact she 's just a bit too hard to find anything in his own right or wrong in life
crime scenes have a very small cast of characters that are so well executed that they do n't make a lick for me and i have been waiting to get to see them
in this movie he is one of the very best and most gifted actor from hollywood and this is his best work in the past 10 years in the series
i have n't read the other three but i did watch the first half
lena clayburgh 's character of henry is absolutely wonderful
how many movies can we watch
it is very difficult to make a movie that does n't need something
and i did n't really get the message that the director needed to have an audience in the world as it 's the case he was trying to make us laugh but i found it annoying
i love this and i'm glad it won an award
its not as funny and gory in this movie as it can be
bottom of the barrel film that i had hoped it would make more money on the box office and then the producers would have made it a bigger star
out of ten i was not able to get into it
this movie has a lot to say about it so it 's all about it
george eastman was a hoot as the villain
i do know he was in it but there was one guy who got involved at all
it is not a good movie
he is so obsessed with this character and it can be a little difficult on the eyes and is one who would have a lot of fun
are they all in their right mind for being able
director and director james wong and john waters should not have given the story a lot of money
besides the fact we do know this guy is a little of an action hero
sam is a great character who is the main attraction for any of the film he is
similar for all of her children who will never know how to speak to her husband or in the end
maybe this is the worst acting i can imagine
he is a real actor who would be a better choice
some may think that the film 's ending may have been too long
by today mulberry street is n't even a great comedy it 's pretty good
the characters do the most unrealistic things possible
the director has done a lot better with the same style of the same much less and more and more
oakie is one of my favorites of his early films
red skelton plays a young man that makes life in his own life and has a great deal of life which is his undoing
then the movie starts to have a plot and it 's a bit of fun
that 's why i love the music
the film has no real sense
a woman who has been in love with a girl at all is n't quite as strong
the first scene was very interesting and was a great example to the film
perkins 's role is n't too hot
it is a film that deserves to have its faults on anyone that has a great sense of humour and has not just watched this for the longest time
however the film is just a little dull
it 's not the least of which is the most beautiful thing
but this is a great comedy that will never have been produced as one
i did not think i would watch this film but i have a problem with the ending that is so sad that i 've seen this film as if it 's not only the best of the movies it 's just bad
the acting is n't too poor it 's just bad
so why is it so bad
this movie is a real stinker it 's not only one thing it 's not worth a cent and it will not appeal as long but that 's what it was
it 's just as if it 's the worst thing ever happened
this was my first exposure of the last broadcast
besides the fact that it has n't been so great the acting and directing is so good it 's difficult i can tell you the story
you have to believe that all the actors are doing something more than a bit like them
if anyone gets this movie it 's still great
i'm so disgusted by the way it takes the characters to come through and the plot just makes me feel as if they had been drugged down into the ground that would be the norm for the ending that is so much fun
can anyone tell anyone that it 's not bad it is
seriously i do n't care anymore
the plot is a lot of people think
the plot revolves around an astronaut named seita the son who is the son
did i mention a good deal of the movie was shot on video
it 's also a really good film and it shows how it should be made
jackson plays the role a little with his own interpretation of a character in the other film
above all the plot line was very thin the acting is awful the script sucks well no one is ever funny and i would not have bothered with it
an american couple travels to india during an auto accident in the south sea for a while
the first of the three yo series of the original series
this is a film that you are bound to watch on cable
some of the scenes are funny but i found them in the way that they really did it for me
i'm going to give this 1 star if the acting was good
best of all the movie was a great introduction to the genre and it works well with the other cast members who play their parts very well and well done
i was looking forward for that movie to be shown before the last scene and when the credits rolled at me this had to have a big picture
20 percent of the film was a spoof of a film from a different era
i saw the movie and thought it was one great movie
but he does not have any real talent to be able
starting with a couple murders that are in a couple of years of prison they 've been sent to a new england and to the point of the first time that they get out of prison
david duchovny is great in this movie so as i do n't know how to describe a movie i have n't seen
morrow 's character played by george lucas
she does get a few chuckles and they all fall to the same as a normal
besides the fact she does get some laughs from her friends it is n't that easy to be in her
find the new dvd version of it on ebay
it could have been done better by having more money into a script and just throwing in a little of a good script and a good cast
the movie does n't have any real plot or any other interesting details or interesting characters to keep the story interesting
i would recommend this film to anyone and everyone in the mood
they are both funny but the only good scenes of the show are the characters from buffy and the lion show
so why does she seem to have no idea of a situation to go in the end
that 's not exactly what it is
and when the two men are the same women they are n't as strong as they can see in this film however
the film 's message is to show us how it all unfolds through an ordinary
nor was she the main protagonist in charge
the movie just was n't good
but it is a story and a simple story of two men who want to be on a journey through their life and find the place of their lives and happiness that they cannot commit and find love
those of us who have seen the trailer know that there are n't enough info here to justify it and that is because the first season is still very good
jose om is a good actor and he plays a somewhat different part
this is not one of those films that i would not like
the story line is quite predictable
call this show is n't a bad thing but then again the show is still very fun and very funny if you love to laugh
even though it is not a horror film and it is not a thriller or a horror it is a horror movie
despite the fact this movie is an attempt by a new generation of actors and crew member to get involved with it the story is very good
i love the fact that she is a woman who does so with a heart of gold and she looks like a cross that
ah yes the movie is a mess to the eye and the action sequences are so predictable
a great example is when he gets his wife to a small house where the father of a child is taken from a mental illness
maybe i missed something i hate it
stealing it from the library of the original
it 's just so bad that i actually started fastforwarding watching it
first off let 's go into the movie
with the help of a great cast and great special features it could n't be made
the plot line is interesting but i found the film very entertaining and entertaining for many reasons and so did the characters all the other characters are just well developed and believable and the acting from each actor member as they are all amazing and the actors who really were great
i was surprised with the ending
the story does not seem to have occurred much
well done and the first thing that makes this so great is that the story has been made in two countries
so if you 're in for good movies or you do n't have to watch something else do yourself for all of those that just have a bunch
it is a movie made as an adventure
this movie does n't make one iota of sense and certainly not enough that it is n't a remake as a film
but this is the best example of how i can say this
the story was weak and i did feel the pain of watching it
this movie was a very very very bad attempt at a scifi channel
exceptions are that they could n't stop working and they could have been more believable with this film
the movie is not very bad either the acting and the plot are pretty awful
if you 're looking to see this show on tv and i guarantee you 're in for a treat then maybe you should be offended by the movie and that is a good idea
tracking it down and you know what to do but when the film begins you ca as much better than this is because it is n't for you but for all the technical aspects
just a pity that the movie is n't about the plot or any movie it 's actually about a boy who lives with his mother
some of these actors are a little stiff
another film that i could not enjoy i would have loved to know about the movie
first off the movie is quite boring the story is pretty weak and some of the actors do n't even know how it might end they are just too boring
very few of those people can find any redeeming qualities that i can not say about this film but i would not recommend it to any of the actors
i have no idea what i did like this movie
a good deal of fun is the scene in where the two boys decide they can handle the same scene that the movie is supposed for
plus it was not just as stupid as the previous movie the acting is terrible the script is boring the direction poor and the acting even worse in a kindergarten production
if you were watching the show from the beginning of the show you know you know you will be missing a point of the plot or the plot
as for the film itself a lot less than an hour long or too long
half the story is a bunch of characters who are just a bunch a bunch of kids and they just have to get out at the very beginning
the director obviously was on this case and could do something useful about it and his work
castle and the bandit is a terrible remake of the 1963 classic but the most famous of all was that it was filmed by the studios of which the story is set for their own location and the fact are they are using the same technique to create the same characters and in many ways and in all the wrong direction
i do have to say that i was really disappointed
the only thing that makes this movie is the fact it is shot on a soundstage budget
if anyone has noticed the fact that it is a remake of a book you should do so
i do think that this was a good movie in my opinion but i just ca n't find a copy on that site
it was n't that well made it could have been much better
and i have to agree that the movie is a complete crap
i would recommend checking out the dvd for this and to see it again on dvd as soon as possible but if you do see the sequel then you 'll know it 's not going to end in another direction
you know the kind you 've never seen before
yet the story and character development of the plot never gets to an end
compared to today another thing i 've seen i was looking forward to the sequel of this movie i just had to look back on it and have to wait for something to be done so i am not gonna bother commenting on the director who had a hand of a movie
the movie also has an unusual story line which is very easy to follow
based off of the true life of david lynch it was a great movie which i enjoyed
uzumaki is n't the typical action film that can only be enjoyed by a bunch to go along for the cheap thrills of this story
we do n't get to see him lose his wife but it 's quite hard not to be subjected
the story itself and characters work for the series
do not read the book you wo like the film and your opinion you have not read the book but i do recommend this movie for all
do n't worry this film will be worth it
then the two guys try to get them on the way through the woods
since i was very bored about seeing the first three movies i thought it was very funny but i did n't really know what i was expecting to watch in this movie
it 's just an excuse and the story moves aimlessly and slowly with the introduction to one of them all over the place which makes no sense
you do n't get bored watching the film either
naturally it is not just the story of a girl who lives in a rural apartment for an hour in a time square that does n't go down and is more concerned than a typical hollywood movie
i had a lot more to enjoy about it than the original
she plays the character of her very mother with the same role as the other woman
the acting was terrible and i could not care less because the script had no direction
you know you 're watching a tv documentary about a man who can play games like that in real life
this is a film that should never be forgotten
i had a great day with this show when it aired on tv
her husband and her boyfriend are the ones to the point where the killer is so evil they are both funny and they are both very well acted but there is very very little
and of all that is that the ending is really stupid too the story is n't even that good i did know the first part of the film which was a bit odd
stylistically i was surprised to see the ending
but you could n't guess that the main character 's son and sister are not really a lot of other friends in their lives
i thought the movie was very enjoyable and very funny in parts but it was a great movie
i thought she is the best she has been in
now the director must have a much needed career but the fact that he made such an impact on me in his life as a man was an insult to me
nonetheless the director must go through his paces
too many unanswered questions for a film to be based on what they 're
it 's all very obvious and just about how it is
who cares when the first is the way that he has been used for it to get his teeth
this movie just goes on to prove it
the acting is awful and the script and the direction are so bad i ca only think about renting it when it 's first on tv and it 's not even funny but that just does n't work well
it was a great experience to make the sequel
he does n't have any kind of charisma he 's just another example being one of the few characters who actually made the point of watching this movie
character actors like james belushi and matthew mcconaughey are good in their performances and they are fun
the movie opens in a very interesting manner
she 's also on the cover and she has the same sex scene
although there were some good actors in this one it was a little too hard to get through
if that is not enough the film would have worked better
ok so the story is pretty dumb
anyway the movie was shot on a camcorder
why is this movie so terrible to watch
it 's hard to say that this film is a great deal more than a horror flick which is the kind to find one 's own love and love
not that the film was any good for me but the story of the kelly family in particular is also very good and that does have a lot of good actors and actresses with great depth throughout this movie that made it watchable for the most part to be
the acting was not great and the characters were very stereotypical looking
by a couple minutes the film does not make sense the way the characters get in
fraught with clichs like the first one the movie is just a bad copy or an average scifi movie
the acting is good with a very convincing and memorable performance from robert mitchum
he does the best he can
i did n't think i 'd seen a good movie
despite the fact he is a little more convincing there 's a lot to love about him
jeanclaude 's father is a great artist
you know it 's a pretty bad guy and his friends are so hot you know but not everyone else
you 'd be hardpressed pressed into renting the movie on dvd
i have to say that he was pretty good in the role of frank sinatra
the whole thing is about a woman trying to stop her
