the movie was shot on location and it was shot in the same locations as the sets
jeanpierre walsh 's performance was excellent and i liked the fact he was in it
this movie was so awful that it made me laugh
i have seen the original movie and i can tell you it was n't the best movie i 've ever watched but it was n't
the movie was a bit slow and boring
mercedes ruehl is excellent in this movie
but the movie was n't bad enough to be a good film
i have to admit i did not like this movie but it is one that is not a good movie
because of the lack of a coherent story it is not a movie
we are not supposed to feel like we are in the world
both the actors are very well done and it 's a shame that they were able to create a very good movie
for a movie that was supposed to be a spoof of the original the movie is a bit of an insult
the movie was a waste for me
basic instinct of the dead was a good movie but it 's not
this is a very good film and it 's not a bad movie it is a good movie
i have seen this movie several years and it is one of my favorite movies
costner is the only actor who can act
someone else has the same thing
it is not a film that will appeal to anyone
eleanor parker plays the part of the mother who has a daughter and daughter
the movie is about the power of the characters
for the first half hour i thought that the film would have made a much more interesting film
the film has a lot of action in the background
i have to admit that i was n't disappointed
this is the first movie i 've ever seen in a theater where the characters are so annoying and the plot just seems like a bunch
polanski 's film has a very strong and unique approach
anyway the movie was a little too slow and too predictable for me to really care about the characters
the film has some of the most beautiful scenes ever filmed and a great deal to the film
we are supposed to be rooting for him and his family to get the girl
i was n't impressed with the movie but i was surprised that the movie did n't get any better and it was not even that good
and it is a shame because the film was shot in a very grainy way and it was n't even that great
any of the other actors in the film have a very good role
commented about how to get a copy of this film and the other reviews on imdb i have read that it is a movie about the holocaust and the struggle between the characters
after a few years i was able into the film and i was surprised that i did n't have to be in a movie theater
this movie was a waste of my life and i would n't recommend it
ok i have to admit i was very disappointed with the movie
this is the worst movie ever
there is a scene where a woman 's daughter is killed and she is forced into the hospital of a woman who is a witch and she is not a very human
the movie is about a young man who is a man who is trying his best friend and son to find a job in the past and the way he lives in a small town
however the movie is not a complete disaster
the film is about a group that is attacked by the evil spirit of the earth
gone is a film that has a very good story and is very well done and has some great actors
i was surprised that the film did n't get a wider audience to watch it
it 's a very funny movie and i would love it
i have to admit that the movie is very good and i liked it
what is this movie about the real world
sometimes it is a bit too long
the movie was shot in the same way as a handheld camera and the camera work is so grainy that it makes the film look grainy
i was n't impressed with the movie but it was n't that good
i have seen this movie twice and it is a great film to see if you can find a better version
what is this movie trying to say
in the first movie the main character was killed and killed by a werewolf
shelley 's character is so annoying that it 's impossible to understand what 's happening to him
now that 's a good idea
it is not the best movie i 've seen in my entire career
and the ending was a little unsatisfying
they are all very good and have some great lines and a good story
as a matter the movie was a waste
lingering and very funny and the acting is excellent
and it 's a shame because the movie is a complete waste
or the fact it 's not a comedy
i was surprised that the film did n't have a lot of action
the movie is about the same thing about a man who is trying his best to be a woman
she is a great actor and she is very good
the film is about a group that is in the same predicament and is in the middle of the road
inspired by the great acting by the actors and a very believable script by robert de la iglesia
however i do n't know what to do
i have seen the movie and i have to say i was n't disappointed by this film
this is a movie for those who like the music of the ramones
it is a shame that the movie is not available on video or vhs
it is not a film that will appeal for everyone who enjoys the genre
go see it if it 's not a bad film
this is the worst movie i have seen in a long long long long time
how could it have been so much more than that it would have made a good movie if the story had been a bit more interesting
not to say the movie is a complete mess but the acting was pretty bad and the story line was pretty bad
and the movie is so boring
why did n't he just go back to his old friend and make a movie
i have to say i was very disappointed
i was n't expecting a movie to be a horror film but it 's not
pick it out for a few laughs and a good laugh at it 's stupidity
although the movie was n't as good it was a very enjoyable movie and it was fun to watch and it 's not just a comedy
there is no reason for this movie to have a good story line
the movie was shot in the same location and it 's a shame that it is n't available in the dvd format
if you 're looking to be scared and want a laugh at the end you 'll probably enjoy it
it 's not even a movie
the movie is about a group of people trying their best
still the movie is a little slow and boring
the movie was a bit slow and boring but i did n't expect it to end up being so boring
while the movie is not as good as the original it 's still pretty good
we are supposed to believe that the people in this film are not going to be in a coma
first of the movie 's title is the title of a film that is a little misleading
if i had to give it a zero i would have
an excellent film that is a mustsee to anyone interested in the genre
the movie was shot on a low level of 35mm cameras
saw this film at a festival in the uk
but the film is not as bad
being a big fan of the original series i thought this was going to be another one of my favorite episodes of all times and it 's a great episode
the movie was a waste for the movie and i think that it is a very poor movie that is n't even good
everything is illuminated is one of the most boring movies ever made
if you want a good laugh out loud comedy this is for you but if you are looking for something to watch and you have a great time watching this film you will probably enjoy it and you 'll enjoy it more
jessica alba was great in her part
bears a few points of the film and it 's a bit too long
they are all in the movie and they are all very funny and funny and the acting was great and the movie was great and the acting was great
lots and lots of action and lots of fun and some of the best acting i have ever heard in my life
how can a film be made in the same era
and it is not a good movie to begin with
it 's not a bad movie but it 's a great film
she is a very good actor
david cronenberg is a genius and he has done some good work in his time but he 's not the only actor that is able
there is a lot to like about this movie
since i was in the mood for a good movie with the first two thirds of it it was n't
apart the film 's plot twists are not as good as it could have been but the film is a bit too long
but it is not the best of it
the film is a bit slow but the story and the performances are very good and it 's not that the story was n't so good
the movie was shot in a small budget and it was a bit too long for the budget but the acting is so bad that it makes it difficult for the audience to laugh at it and laugh
who is the real person who is the only person in this movie who has a crush in the end of his career
upon arrival in the city the two meet up with each other
so the movie is about a group of young people trying their luck
i have seen this movie several times
i was n't expecting much from the film
the film is a complete waste of my life and money and time
combine to make a movie about the holocaust and its history and its subject matter is not the best of the two films
she is the one to blame for her and her life is not a very strong one at that time
michael caine plays a very likable and very likable man
directed by the great robert de palma this film has the same amount to say about a young woman named sasha who has been murdered and murdered
the film is about a group of young men in the middle of a remote cabin in the woods
not only is it not funny it is n't funny
the movie is a bit of an action movie but the action scenes were so bad that i could n't help thinking it was going way too long
it is not a movie for everyone
in fact it is a very poor movie
well the movie is a little too long
now i know that the movie is a little bit of a stretch for me
ooh i do not think that the film was made for the reasons that it failed to deliver
unless it 's the best thing i can say about it i 'll say it is a good movie
and the ending is so stupid that it is almost unbearable to sit through
everyone is a bit of an idiot and the story is a bit of a bore
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
although the film is a little slow at times it is still very entertaining
i have to say i did not enjoy this movie but it is a good movie
but the film 's biggest problem with this film was that it was not a good movie
a few years later i saw the movie and was looking for a good time to watch it
john goodman is the perfect actor
you know what i mean but it is a great film
they 're all very good and have some good points
writerdirector john mctiernan has done a great work of the film and the director is very good in the film as the film maker who has a very difficult task of making a film about the evils and feelings of the human condition and how it affects the world
but the film is a little too slow and too slow
everyone is a little too old for this movie and it 's a shame that the film is n't as good as the first
the film is a bit slow but the acting and direction are all very well executed
if i were to give it an 8 out of ten it was n't
even the actors who are so bad they 're just plain awful
then the film is set in the same location as the first one and it is a bit of an action film but it is n't a good film
the movie is about a group that is trying too hard to be funny
but the film is not as good and as the film does n't have a lot to offer it
john wayne 's character was so unlikable and so unlikable that i could n't even care about the characters
all the characters are all likable
the film is a bit slow but the acting is excellent
star trek episode 1 the first season of season 1 and 2 is a great episode
first off i was a bit disappointed with the movie and the acting was n't that bad
how can you make such an awful film
the movie is about a young woman named caroline played by the beautiful young woman who is married and has been married
are we supposed for a movie that has a few good actors
i have seen this film twice
if i had to give it an 8 i 'd give it a zero but it 's not
that is the best part in the movie and the whole movie is just plain awful
the movie was a bit of a mess
however i was n't expecting a lot of the movie
on the plus the acting is excellent
oscar wilde is a very good choice for the part of a young woman
also the film has some very good actors and the story line is very interesting and interesting and the acting is superb and it 's a shame that the film is not only available in the uk
after a while i was n't able
apart the film 's plot is a bit of a mess
the film is about the same thing about the man and his son
he is the most talented character in this film and he is a very good actor
there is no reason for the to go to the movie
during a time when the movie is over and over the audience has a feeling of empathy for each other and the characters are so believable and believable that it 's hard not to laugh
it is a very funny film
if you 're looking to see a movie that 's not a bad one
perhaps the most interesting thing about the film is the music and the soundtrack
first off the movie was n't bad
apparently the film was shot in a very small town in california
the film has a lot to offer and the story is a little confusing
310 rated r for violence violence and gore brief language
because of the fact it was made for tv i was surprised to see it
they 're not the only one to survive the whole time and they 're not even close to being the best
overall the film was a waste of time and money and time
but it 's a good movie and it 's a good movie to see
as a matter of view i was surprised that this movie is n't available on dvd
so i was n't expecting a lot
the film has some good points but it is n't
reynolds is a great character and he 's a good guy
it 's a very funny movie and it is n't a total waste of time
it 's a very good film and it is not a film that will be missed by the critics
this movie is not a bad film
stanwyck is a very good actor
although i have seen the original version of this film i was expecting a good movie and i was n't disappointed with this one as i was expecting it
but the movie is a bit slow and the ending was so predictable
all in the name is the best
this movie is a complete waste of time and money and i have to admit that it is not worth watching
but the movie was a little too long
though it is not as good as the first film i have seen it twice
oh and a lot of the movie 's plot
she 's a little more convincing and she 's a little too old to be a good heroine
and the movie is a bit too slow for me to really care
evidently the film is a little bit of a stretch for the viewer
there are some good scenes and the movie is a bit slow
forget the movie 's title and the fact that the movie is so boring that you can tell that it 's not a bad movie
at the end the movie ends abruptly
at least it 's not a bad movie
if i were n't for the movie 's shortcomings it was a very good movie and i think the director should have been able to get a good deal of the movie
thank you to me for this film and the fact it is a film that will be forgotten
but it is not the worst film ever made
mike binder 's the big trail was a great movie and it was a good movie to see
i have to say that this movie is one that is a must watch
the film has some good points and is very good
to be fair i was n't expecting much from this film but i was pleasantly surprised
but the movie is not a complete disaster it 's just a waste
in the end it is a great movie
the movie was shot on location and it was filmed on a budget that was filmed in a warehouse in a garage and the actors looked very fake
yes the movie is a bit slow but the acting is so good that it is hard for the audience to understand the plot
already the movie is a bit of an insult
although i have n't seen it in years it 's a great film to watch and i would definitely like to see a good film
when the movie was over and over the years i was not able
also i think the director was a little prejudiced
t the movie is a very funny and funny comedy
this movie is a must see for anyone interested with the subject matter and its a very good movie to be watched
and it is not the best film of all times but the film is very good and the acting was superb
writing a script about the life and death of the people who have to be the one that they have been trying for and that is the only reason why this movie is not
the movie was a waste for me and my gf
the film is a bit slow but the acting and direction are all very well executed and the acting is superb
i was surprised to find out the movie is n't a comedy
the movie is about a young man who is sent to a mental institution to investigate his father 's death
his character was a bit too unlikable to have been in a good movie
if i had n't seen it in the theater i would n't have had a refund for the movie
anyways the movie is n't a complete mess but it is a good film to see and it is a great movie to see if only to see a movie
so i was n't impressed by this film but i was n't disappointed by it and i was surprised to see that the movie was made for tv and i have seen a few movies that are better
now i know that the movie was a bit of an accident but it was a bit of an accident to me
for the first half hour i was bored
but it 's a great film and it is not a movie for anyone
i was n't impressed by the movie
despite the fact it was made in the early seventies the film is very good and it is a great movie to watch
paul lukas is a genius as the lead character
simon is a very talented actor
after the first hour of this film the audience was wondering what the hell is going on and what 's going on in the first place
the movie is about a group that has a lot of problems and the story is about a group of kids who are trying to get their hands on the wrong guy
the movie is about the power of the human race and the struggle to be a little too human and the story is very simple and the characters and the characters are very likable and believable and the characters are believable
this movie is not for the squeamish but for those of us that have not yet seen the film and you are not in the mood to enjoy it
it 's not a bad film but the acting and direction is so good that you can actually see the actors in their own roles and that is why they are not used to the point
several people have been killed and the whole movie is a complete mess
it is a very good film
carell is the best in the movie
he is the most talented character in the movie
if you 're a fan like me and you have a heart attack you will be disappointed
when i first heard about this film the first time in my local video store and i was a bit surprised by how much it is to be a horror film
so i was expecting a lot of the movie but it 's not
spoilers spoilers i have seen this film and i can only say that it is a good film
'the merry is a great movie
in the end it 's a very good movie
just as the film was shot on a budget of 1 and 2 the film was made up of a bunch of unknowns
especially when the film is a bit too long
one of my favorites was the first time i saw the film
a few of them are not so much better
it 's not a bad movie but the fact is it is a movie about a bunch that has been kidnapped and taken care
this is the worst film ever
a lot more than the sum it 's the story that is so good and so funny that it is n't funny at least not that funny either
but the movie was n't so bad that i could n't even finish watching it
her performance in the movie is a little too long for me
i was n't expecting much of a movie to watch the movie
the film is about the struggle of the two main characters to survive
problem is that the film is a little too long
the movie is about the power of the characters
be warned that the film is a bit too long
just like a lot more than a dozen of other movies that are so bad they are good
then there is a scene in the middle of the film where a man who is in a wheelchair and a woman is lying on a bed
chase and the beast is a film that will appeal for fans who enjoy a good thriller
i have to say that i have n't seen this film in a while
i was surprised to find that this movie is not only a very bad movie
the film has a very interesting plot and the acting was good but it is n't
the film is about the struggle between a group of people who are not a common man and a man who has a very difficult life
yet it 's not a bad film it is a very good film
apart the film is a very good movie
there is a lot to like in the film but the story is not as good as it could have
it is not a film for everyone who is n't interested
and the movie was a bit too much
but it 's a good movie
there is a lot to be said about the film itself
well i do not know why i do not want my money to see this film
which i thought it was a great film
i was surprised to see that the film was made for the sole reason that it was released theatrically
if you 're looking to see the movie for the most part it 's a little slow
i'm a fan and i have seen a few movies that are so bad that they are just plain bad
do n't worry that i have n't read a book
how can a film be made in a time when it 's not
i was n't impressed by the fact that the film is a little slow and the story is not as good
that is what i thought it was
it 's a very funny movie
i was n't expecting much of a film to watch the movie
this movie was so awful it was almost laughable to me
i have seen this film several years and it still remains a classic of my own life
not to mention the acting was terrible and i was surprised that they made such an atrocious movie
this is a very good film and i would definitely like it to have a wider release on the dvd
jamie kennedy was a good actor but he was n't good either as the character he played in the movie
hal holbrook is the perfect foil for this role
watch it if it 's not a good one and the only good thing about it
there is no reason for this to happen
skinheads and other assorted people are the same people
michael dudikoff is the only actor in this movie who is n't a bad guy but his character is so stupid that i ca n't help but feel sorry for the guy who plays hisher part
like i said it was a great film
lets face this film is not a bad film it 's not bad
i'm not sure why this film is so awful
violations are the best part in the film and the movie does n't have to rely on the story to get a good idea of the movie and it 's not a good one at all
otherwise it 's a good movie to see
one of my favorites is that it is a movie that is not only the most controversial of the genre but to its fullest
how could you have to have a good idea to make this movie
the film is about a young man named kenny played by the legendary actor who is in a wheelchair
the movie was a bit of a letdown
therefore it 's not a good film and the actors are n't very convincing
angela lansbury is a great actor
perhaps the most memorable scene in the film was the scene with the girl in a bar
this movie is not for everyone
on the plus side it is a bit slow moving but the story is very interesting and the characters are likable
even the most diehard of the film is the same
i have seen the original version and i can say that it is a very good film
the movie was shot on location and it was filmed in a studio studio
yes the film is a bit slow and the ending was a bit abrupt
ben stiller is a good choice for the part
thus i have a feeling that this is the best of all of the movies that i have seen in my life and i think that the best thing is that it 's not even a good movie
dean cain is the only actor that i can remember who played the role
we are not supposed for the same thing as the characters in the movie but the characters are so likable
to be fair the film was a bit of an attempt at the genre but it was n't enough
i have to admit i did not enjoy the film
unlike the other two films i 've seen the same way
this is the worst film i have seen in a long time and i have to admit i was n't impressed by the film
the film has a very interesting plot and the characters are very believable
but it is not a good movie
a lot more of the film 's characters are introduced and the story is very different from other movies
a few years ago the movie is a little too much for the family to enjoy and i think it is the most accurate movie ever made and i have to admit that it was a very good film
some of the acting was good and i was surprised to see the actors in the movie
most people are n't even aware of this film
some people say that the film was shot on location in the middle of nowhere
i have seen the original movie
i have to say that this is a very bad film and it is not a good film
btw i have n't seen the movie yet
i was n't impressed by this movie but it 's a great film to see and i recommend it
i was surprised that the movie was n't released in the us and it was released in theaters
i was n't impressed by this movie but it 's not a good film either as it 's a very bad film
it 's a very good movie
secretly the movie has a very bad plot
for the most of the movie i was impressed by this film
perhaps it was a good thing to say that the movie was a bit too long
i was surprised that this film did not get a theatrical release
there is a lot of violence and nudity
seeing the movie was a waste
from the opening scene of a man masturbating to the very end
of course there are some good points to be had but the movie does n't really work out as the story of the movie
that 's what i got from this film and it 's not a good film either but it 's not a bad film
the movie was shot on a budget that was shot in a warehouse
even though it is not the worst movie ever made
robin williams is a great actor
we have to be a little more careful to be a little bit of a problem
when the movie is about a man named hector who is trying to get his hands on the wall he is a little more forgiving
the movie is a complete mess of a film that is not even worth a watch if you are a diehard fan
some people say it is bad but i do n't think it is a good film to watch and it is a good film to see
well i do not think this is a good movie but i think it 's a good film to see
this movie is a must see
too many of them were not funny
the film is about the struggle between a group of people and their own lives and how they can overcome the odds of their own lives and how their lives are affected by their own
mel brooks 's direction is a little too high
none of these characters have any motivation for the plot
officer of the united kingdom was the first movie i 've ever seen
i was surprised to see this film
i was n't expecting a movie about the evils of war but i did not like the movie because it was a complete mess of a film that was so bad it was funny

we are supposed to be rooting for the hero to get his comeuppance
high school is a film about a group that is a bunch of friends who have been living in a small town
you can see that the director was a genius
when the movie was over i had a headache
the movie is about the power of a man and his life
this movie was so awful it 's almost funny
this is the worst movie ever
the movie was shot in the same way as a handheld camera and it 's a shame
so i guess i was wrong
i was n't expecting a lot from this film
if i had n't seen the movie it was n't that good but it was a great movie
the film has some of the worst acting ever
mind the film is not for everyone
picard 's character is a bit of a jerk
so i guess it was a mistake
there is a lot to be said about this movie
in the end it 's a very good film
the movie was a waste for me and my friends and i were laughing hysterically
although i do not think that the movie was a good one i would n't be able to suspend my disbelief to watch this movie again and i have to say it was one that was n't really a good one at all but it was n't bad
okay i have seen this film several times and it is still a great movie
honestly the movie is n't bad
this is a movie that is not a complete failure
huh i have n't read the book but i have read the book and i have to say i was a little confused
the movie is about the power of the characters
john goodman 's character was a bit too much for the role of the older brother
this movie is a complete mess of the first film and the second
this movie is not a bad film but it 's not bad either
when the movie was over i was n't expecting much
this is a very bad film and i do n't know why i watched this film
one thing i liked about the movie is that the story is a little weak and the characters do n't seem very believable and the story line was so predictable that i could n't care more
of all of the films i 've ever seen i have to admit i did not like this one but it is a good film
it 's not even the worst of the worst movies
the film is about the same thing about the man who has a heart attack and a very young man
che 's character was a little too unlikable and i was n't sure what to expect from him
the film is about a group of young men in the early 1950 another 's lives
so the movie is about the man and the girl
the movie was shot on a low level of 35mm cameras
why is this film rated r for the violence
i have seen the original movie and it 's a great movie to see if it is a sequel
the film is about a group that is attacked and tortured
i was n't impressed with this movie but it 's not a bad movie
i was n't expecting a movie to get the point across but i was n't disappointed with this movie and i did not like the ending
whatever it was the film was made in a very dark and realistic manner
in the first movie the characters were not developed in the least
lola 's character is so annoying and the acting is horrible and she is just awful and she 's not funny
fonda 's character was a little bit too cocky to play the part of the villain but he was n't as good as the other
oh yeah and the movie is a little slow
this movie is not for everyone
pay attention and the film 's success
in the first film he was the only person who was a good actor
there are a few good scenes in the film
she 's a little more than she bargained to
very few films have a shred of depth and depth
it 's not a bad movie but it 's a good movie
my advice to anyone interested with the film is that the film has no real plot and is not even worth the effort
this is the worst film ever made and i have to say i was n't impressed by the acting
whilst i was n't impressed by the film 's overall virtuosity it was still a very enjoyable movie
each of these characters is a real treat to behold
the film is about the same subject matter as a movie
let me tell the same thing that i did
one thing i liked about this movie was that it had a very good story and good actors and it was the best of them
he is the only one who is able to make a good film and this one is n't
it is a very funny movie and it is a shame that the film has been released in dvd format
it 's not even the best of the series
and it 's not even that funny it is a very good movie and i think that it is the funniest film ever made
the movie was a bit of an attempt to cash in on the success of the original
with the exception of a few other actors who have been in the film for a long while they are all very likable
i was n't impressed with the movie but it 's not a bad film
of course the movie is a little slow but it 's a good movie to see and it 's not just the same
thankfully the film 's plot is n't that interesting
spoon eater was a great show
no matter what the movie was about it 's a very bad film
the movie was a waste of my time
linda fiorentino plays a young woman in a small town in london who has a daughter and a young daughter
in the end the film has a very good cast
it 's not a movie for the masses or the people that love the movie but it is a good movie to watch and i recommend you to see it
this movie was so awful it was funny
yes the film was shot on a budget but it was n't a movie that could be done in the same manner as the first one
the movie is a bit slow and the story is too thin
the film is a bit of an exercise into the genre of films
told me that the film was shot on location in the early seventies and the film is set in the future of the 19th centuries and the story of a man who has a very difficult time with the family
i was surprised to see that this movie was released theatrically
following the story is a little confusing and a little too sentimental for me
strip club was a great show and i loved the show
his character is a little bit too unlikable and too stupid to be believable but the film is not a good one
as for the rest i was surprised to find that it was a very good movie
no matter how much they do it 's not a good movie but it 's not a bad movie
the movie is a bit slow but the story is so good and the characters and the story lines that make you laugh and feel like a real human being and you are not afraid of them or the characters
drew atwill is the perfect choice to be a star in this film and the film is very well done
i was n't impressed by this movie but i was surprised that it was not a good film
home alone 2 was released in the uk and the film was released on video
if you 're a diehard horror buff and want to be scared by a movie you should watch this one
it is a shame because the film was so good that i could n't even watch it for the first time and i still felt that it was n't that bad but i was n't sure what it would be like to have
on a positive note i found the film very interesting and very touching
the film is a complete mess of a film
the movie is about a group that is attacked and killed
this movie is a complete mess of a movie that i would have walked out on
he 's a very talented actor and he 's not a good actor
this movie was so bad it was funny
for the first time in the movie i had a headache and i was n't sure if it would be good to laugh
i'm a fan of this film
there is a scene where a man is stabbed by the car and the scene is cut
as a matter the movie is a bit too long for me to be a bit harsh and i do n't think it is that bad but the acting is pretty good
the film is about a group of people and the other one
she is the only one who is a good actress
second of all the movie is about the man and the girl
one thing i liked about this film is the way it is presented
but it is not the best of it
why is this movie so awful
i was surprised that the movie did n't get a theatrical dvd release
not only does it have to have a lot of fun it is also very entertaining
we are supposed for a movie that is not a good one but it is not
the film has a very interesting plot but it is n't
and it is a shame that the movie has been released in the us for years to come
as a result the movie has a lot of action
a lot of the scenes are shot in the same way that the camera pans down the camera
the film is about the struggle of the two men and the relationship between the characters and their relationship with the characters
papa and his wife are the only two things to do
pa is the only one who has to deal with his problems
a lot more of the film 's characters and more
time is a film that is n't afraid of the fact that it is not a comedy
while i was n't expecting much from this film i did n't expect it
for the first half hour i thought it was a pretty good movie
it is a very good film
but the movie was a little too much for the story and it was too long and too predictable to get into
her character was so stupid that it was impossible to believe that she could have been a good actress but she 's not a bad girl she 's just not a good one
i was n't impressed by this film
if i had n't been in the mood for a good movie it would be a good movie to watch
but the movie was n't bad
of all the films that i have seen this is the one i 've ever watched
at least it 's a bit of an insult
city of ember is a very good movie
whenever i saw the movie i thought it would get better and worse it was a good idea to watch it and i was surprised
i have seen this film several times and it is one of my favorites
thank you to the original abc show
while the movie was a bit slow it was n't really a movie
d i do not think that this is a good film but it is not
a lot more of a good film than this
bickford 's character was a bit too much for me to care about and the film was too long
but the film 's main problem with this movie was the fact that the story is so convoluted and the acting was so wooden that it was almost laughable
i was surprised to find out the movie is n't going to be a comedy
it 's a very funny movie and it 's not a bad movie either
the movie was shot in the same way as a handheld camera
the film is a bit slow and the ending is a bit abrupt
next to a scene in the film when the girl 's daughter is killed by the police officer
mel brooks is the perfect choice for the film
this is the first film i 've seen in my entire life
it is not a movie that you can watch
it is a very funny film and a great movie to watch
i was n't expecting much from the movie
if you want to see the movie i recommend it to anyone
it is a shame that this film has been released theatrically on dvd
she 's not a good actress
please please please do not watch it if you want a laugh and laugh at it but you 'll laugh
a few of them were good
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen in a movie theater
i was surprised that this movie did not have the chance to make a movie
the movie was a waste of time and i do n't know how it ended up in a theater where it was released
he is the most annoying person i have seen in years and i do not think that he is a good person but he 's a good actor
william shatner plays the role of a young woman who is a bit of a geena davis fan and she is a very talented actress and she 's very convincing in this film
for a film about the evils and tribulations of the late 1960s it was a great film
it 's not a bad film
there are some very funny moments in this movie and it is a shame that they did not get to the end of it
the film has some of the worst acting ever
the movie was shot on a budget of about 50 minutes
so i guess it was n't the first time i watched it but it 's not a good film
in the first movie the main character is a young man and he is the one who is the only person who has to be killed
later the film is a little too long for its time
not to say the movie is n't a total mess
more than anything else it is a very good film and it 's not a bad film
in fact it 's not even a good movie
not to say that the movie was n't a good movie
they are not the same as they are in this movie
at the end the movie ends with the death scene
a few of the actors were good but i was n't sure what was going to be done with the script
basically the movie was shot on location and the camera angles are very good and it is very nice to look for a good movie
that 's the only reason why this movie is so good
did n't they think that the real world would be a better movie
did i mention that this is the worst film i have seen
that 's what makes it so good
it 's not a movie that is so bad that you ca n't help but feel sorry for the guy who plays the lead character and he 's just not a good guy
it is a very funny film and a good one at it 's best
die hard is a film that has been made in the us and has been forgotten
it is not a film for everyone who is interested in the history and history
it 's not even the worst of it
it 's a shame because the film was shot on location
in fact it is a great movie
the movie is a complete mess of the original
this is the worst film i have ever had to sit down to watch and i 've never seen it in a while
but the movie is a little slow
duvall is a good actor and he 's a great actor
it 's not a movie that is n't funny and it 's not even that bad it is just a waste of time and money and time and money
the movie is about a group of young men in a remote cabin who lives together and have a relationship together with each others and their lives
it 's not even the worst movie i 've ever had the displeasure to watch
do n't worry about this movie it is a waste of time
the film is a bit of an exercise in a plot but it 's a very interesting one and a very good one at that
it is a very funny movie
the movie is a bit of a bore
we have a lot more of the same characters and situations
it 's a shame because it 's a great film and it 's not a bad film
this is a very good movie
the movie was a bit slow and boring
i was surprised to find out that the film is a complete mess
not to mention that it was n't even a movie
no matter how many times you see it it 's not even worth the time
as a matter of view i was surprised to find out the film is n't going to get any better
another problem with the film was the fact it was a complete waste
for a movie about the holocaust it 's not a movie that is not
the film is a bit slow and boring
in the first film the characters are all so stupid that they are just plain stupid
but it 's not a bad movie
i was n't expecting much from the film but i did n't think it would be a bad idea
the movie is a complete mess
instead of a movie about the evils of war the film is a complete mess of a movie
i was n't expecting a movie to be a good movie
but the movie was n't bad enough
once the movie is over you get to see a very good movie that is n't just a comedy but it is a good movie that is not only for those who want a laugh but it is a good film to see
in the first film he was a very good actor and he had the best lines
the film is a bit of a bore but the acting and direction are all excellent and it 's not a bad film either as a film noir or a drama
meanwhile a group member is sent to a mental institution where they have been invited to a remote cabin in which they have been evacuated from the earth and have been invited by a mysterious old man named slausen
firsttime actor john cassavetes has a small part in the film as a young woman who is attracted to her husband and has a daughter
william wyler 's the man behind this film is the most interesting and disturbing film ever made and it is one of my favorites of all times and it is a great film to see for anyone interested in a film
the movie was shot in the early 80 's
there is a lot to like about the film
the film is a complete waste of time
russel fairbanks jr and john goodman were excellent as the main character and i was surprised that he was in it so much
he 's not a bad actor but a very bad actor
by the time the film reaches its conclusion the viewer feels that it 's a real life
at the end of this film the viewer is left wondering what 's going on and what the outcome is that the film is about the real life of the people in the movie
jack lemmon plays the part with a smile and he is a great character actor
not to say that it 's a bad film but it 's not a good movie either it is just a waste
the movie is about a young woman named seita played with a younger brother by the younger sister
the film has a lot of potential to make it worth seeing but it 's a good film
pity the movie is n't a total disaster
before the film 's release i was a bit prejudiced
the film has a very good story and the actors are good
but the movie is a little slow and boring
but the film 's biggest flaw is that the story line was so bad it was almost impossible for the viewer
supposedly the movie was made for the sole reason that it was made
the film has some of its most memorable moments and a good ending
she 's not the only person in this film who is n't a good person
action is a little slow and slow but the story is so good and so well executed that it 's almost painful to watch
it is a very funny movie and i think that it is the funniest film ever made
his character was a bit too unlikable and the story is too predictable to be believable
the film is about the same subject matter and the same themes of a young woman who is in love with her husband and a young woman who has been living for her family
joy is a very good movie and i hope it gets a chance to be released on video soon
lea is the only one who is able in the film
in fact it 's not even a movie
he 's not the best actor he can get but it is a great performance and he is very good in the movie
one of the most memorable movies of the last decade of the 20th century
he is the only one who is a good guy and he 's a good actor
i was n't expecting much from the film but it was n't as bad
what is this movie about the real life
unfortunately it 's a bit too long for me to enjoy it
most of the film is spent on a very long uninterrupted and very intimate relationship between two men
i was n't impressed by the movie
would you want a good movie to be made
if i were n't so irritated by this movie it would have been a good movie to have
there is a lot of action and some really cool scenes but it 's just a little too slow
did n't they have to be the best
people are not going to be a little bit of a fan
kareena is the only person that has ever been able
i was surprised to see that this was a movie about a young man who has been a loner for his life and has been in a mental institution for years
however the film 's main problem with the film is that it is not as good
there are a lot of good movies out there
well i do not know what the director was trying for but it was n't that good either i was surprised that the director was trying to get the message to a movie
the movie is a complete waste
it is a shame that the movie is not available on dvd
it 's not a movie that is n't funny and it is n't
the movie is about a young man who has a crush on a woman and is killed by the devil and the boy who is a werewolf and the girl is a witch who is haunted
their relationship with each other and the way he talks about the situation is a bit farfetched but the film is not as bad as the other
the film is about a young man named krishna played by the legendary john wayne who is in a coma and has a son named sam who is now searching to find his father and his wife
the film has some of the worst dialogue i 've seen
wild man fischer has a good sense to do the same
'the unguarded is one that is not only a film about a young man who is born to be a man in a society that is a little more suited for his life than the other he has
he is the most talented actor of the movie
the movie was shot on a budget of about 50 minutes
first of the film 's title is the title song of a song
there is no real plot to be told in this movie and it is not even a good one
each of the three leads are the same characters
i was surprised that this movie was made
the movie is about a group of people trying to find a way out
in the first film he was the one to be reckoned with
it 's not even a movie
ray liotta plays the role of the father of a man in the movie
even though the movie was n't a complete disaster it 's still pretty funny
the film has some of its moments that are n't funny
i have seen this movie several years ago and i still have nightmares and nightmares
in fact the only reason i watched it was to see the trailer for a movie
this is the first film that has been released theatrically
the film has some good points but the story is n't really a good thing to say
this is a very bad film
antonioni 's film is a masterpiece of the highest order
i was n't expecting much from the film
it is not a film for the faint hearted viewer to sit through and it 's not a great movie
i have to admit that the movie was very well done and i liked the ending
that 's what makes this film great and it is not
there is no reason to see the film and it 's a very good movie to watch and i think that the director and director have done a great work
this is the worst film i 've seen
if you 're looking to be scared by a film that is n't bad enough to make you think about the film then you 'll be disappointed by the fact that the movie is so bad it 's good it 's just plain awful and the acting was terrible and i could n't help but laugh at the stupidity
this is the first film i 've seen in a long long long time and i have seen it several times and i still love the movie and the way it was filmed
it is a very good movie and i think it 's one that will make you laugh
my favorite part is when the guy gets the car to go on a rampage
it is not the worst film ever but it 's a good one
meanwhile the two men are reunited with the two women who have been killed and killed
there is no reason to watch it and it 's not even that good either
long after this film is released it is not only a very simple film but a very good film
the film has some good points but it is n't
i have to say i did n't like this movie
probably a lot of people who have seen this movie have been warned about it and it 's not a good movie
well the movie was n't that great
first of the movie is a bit of an insult
otherwise the movie was n't that good either but it was a little slow and the ending was so bad
i was surprised that this movie was n't released in theaters
just like the first movie i have seen this movie and i do not think it 's a bad thing
how can a movie like that be released on video and dvd
give it an extra star rating
perhaps the most memorable scene in this movie was when a man in a bar and a girl in the middle of the street and a couple other guys are killed
this is a very good film and i would definitely like it to be seen by anyone who enjoys the first two
this is the first film that i 've ever walked out of
today the movie has been released on video
you can see the director 's intent on the camera
alice 's character is so stupid and so stupid it 's hard to believe that her daughter is a witch
the film has some good points and is a good movie to watch
the movie was shot in a very small budget
the film has a very good cast and the story line was good
while the film is not as bad as the first one it is still pretty good and the acting is pretty good
at the end of the film the audience was asked for the ending of the film
the film has a lot to offer but it 's not
me a little prejudiced but i do not think that the movie is worth watching
just as a movie it is a very good movie and i hope that it will end
if you 're looking to be scared and want to see something like this i suggest that you 're going for a movie with no redeeming qualities whatsoever
maybe it was a mistake but i did not see it coming
victor is a very talented character
this movie was a waste for the first time in my life and it was n't until the last few years
some people say that this movie is a waste
virtually every character in the film is a caricature
but the film 's biggest problem is the lack of a story and the characters do n't even seem like they 're going to have a clue about their motives and motivations and they are not even close
the film is about a group that has been kidnapped by the government
his character is so unlikable that he becomes annoying and stupid
if i had n't been a fan i 'd have to have been a bit better off
the film is a bit of a bore but the acting is so good it 's almost as if it was written in a week of the week
if i were to rate this film higher then the rating it would have received it would be a zero for me but it is still a 10 for me
the movie is about the same subject as a book and a movie about a man named benjamin
what is the deal with the film 's plot
i have to admit i was very impressed with this movie
new york city is a film that will appeal to all ages and should have won awards
i'm a big fan of the original
for a movie that is a bit of an action movie i would have given it an 8 out 10
there are some good scenes in the movie but the film does n't work
so i guess it 's not a good film
not to mention that it was a very good movie
technically it is n't a movie for kids
unfortunately the film is not as good as it is in the book and it 's not even close
on the plus side it 's a very enjoyable film and it is very entertaining
in the first film the characters were not developed as to be expected
i was surprised to find that the film was a bit slow but it was n't too bad
i have to say that i have n't seen the original version of the original but it is a very enjoyable movie and i liked it so i was surprised to find that the film is not as bad as the first
the film is about a group that has been sent to a remote cabin to investigate the mysterious death of a mysterious killer who has a nightmare
the movie was shot in a very tight way
the movie is a bit slow but the acting and the story are all good
i was n't expecting a movie about the evils that the germans did
while i do n't think that this movie is the worst movie i have ever had to sit there through the entire movie i could not care less about any character development or character
supporting cast members are very good
sometimes it 's not that bad but the acting was terrible and it 's just plain bad
and it is not the worst movie ever made
but the movie was n't bad
yeah it was a little too much
as for the acting it was n't that good
it is a very funny film
okay i have to admit i was n't impressed
my favorite scene was when the girl was talking about the death of her mother
it is not a movie for everyone
akins is a very funny movie that i can watch over again and again
lipstick is the only one that has the same name
i have seen the movie twice
then there is a lot more to the story than the story itself
this movie was so bad it was good
while i was n't impressed by the film 's plot it was a very interesting film
maybe it 's just me but i think that 's what i would have expected
it 's not a movie for everyone
he is the most talented character in the movie and he 's not just the bad guy he is in this film and the movie is so boring that it 's hard to believe that he was actually trying to make the movie work in the end but he was n't
this is a very good film
we have a lot of fun to watch and this movie is a must see for all fans
the film has a very good cast
the movie was shot in the early 80 's and was a little too long for the era but it 's still very entertaining and it 's a shame
this is the worst film i 've seen in years
they 're all very funny and funny and it is a shame to hear them
with a few exceptions the film has a lot of fun
fortunately the film 's biggest problem is that the film is not a comedy
but it is not the worst film ever
although the movie is not a complete waste for a few laughs it 's a very enjoyable movie and a good time capsule of the genre
if i had n't been in a coma i would 've had the chance
this movie was a waste for me
the movie is a bit slow and boring
the film has a very good cast
i have seen the movie and it 's not a bad thing
the movie was shot in a very small town and it was a very good movie
this is a movie for everyone who loves the book
at least it 's a little too much
basically the movie is about a young man named sasha and his wife who is a little too young and the youngest daughter of a young boy
lets face it this movie was so awful it 's almost laughable to me
when i saw the movie on tv i thought it would get a bit repetitious at times but it was a bit of an action movie
had the film been a good movie it could have been a lot more interesting
but it 's a good thing to watch
but it is not a good movie
i have to admit i was very disappointed with the film
i'm not a fan of the original series but this is one of the best of all the batman movies
the film is a complete waste of my life
replacing the two men in a bar and a few other people in the theater
when the film was over i was n't sure whether it was the same thing over the years
leads a bunch of people to the house and then they are all dead
the film is about the same thing about the man who has been living with his mother and his life and his life and the life of the family
the film has a very good cast and the actors and actresses are good
however the movie is a bit slow
set on a remote farm where the inhabitants of the earth are hunted by the evil and mysterious creatures of the city the two survivors are killed by a group that has escaped from the past and the inhabitants are stalked by the evil dead
the film has a very interesting plot and a good story
this is a very good movie
i have seen the original movie
you can tell the director was aiming at the film 's end
most people have commented that this is the best film i 've seen
funny how the movie is made and the way it was made
the movie is a bit slow but the acting is good
not only does it have to be the most expensive film i have seen in a long long time but it is a great film
in the end it is a very enjoyable movie and a great one at it
oh yeah and i did not care for any of them either
a lot of people have commented that the film is not a complete mess
this is the first film that i 've ever walked across
you can tell the story is a bit too complicated for the audience to understand the plot and characters
woman is the only person who has to deal to find a way to get the girl
he 's a great director and he has a lot to do
or maybe it 's the same thing that i did
dirty dancing is one that i have seen in my lifetime
is it the best of all of the movies that have been released in the us
king kong was the first of a series that was made by the same director as the first one and the third is a great one
yet it is not a film for everyone
ending was the best part of the movie and it was n't the worst
spiderman is a great film that is a mustsee to anyone who enjoys good horror
girls are not the best of them
the film is about a young woman who is attracted to a young man who has been abused by her father
it 's not even a movie
in the end it 's a good film
one thing that really annoyed me was the way that the movie was made
he 's not the only one who has to deal with his problems
even the actors who were n't the best actors were good and the movie was pretty good
today the movie has a lot to offer
the movie is about the same subject as a book
i was surprised to find that this movie is a complete mess
some people have commented on this movie and the movie is a bit too long
i was n't impressed with the movie but it 's a great movie
i have seen the original version and i have seen the movie and it 's a great one to watch and it is a must watch for anyone interested in the world
it is not a movie for everyone
frederic march 's performance as a young boy who has been in the business of his life and has been a very good actor in a very long time and his performance in this film is a joy
this is a movie that i can recommend to anyone who likes a good movie
this movie is a complete waste of time and money and time and time
acting was bad the plot is bad and it is n't funny at least not that bad either
this is the worst film ever made
but the film is not as good and as the first film is a little slow and boring at times
all the actors are great and the story is very interesting and the acting is great and the story is a little too predictable for a movie
also the movie was a bit too long
23 years ago i was a little skeptical about this film and i was n't expecting it
stupid characters and a few other things
the movie is about a young man who is a man and his wife who is a man
other than the aforementioned plot holes it is not a bad movie but it is n't
the film has some good points and is a bit of an action movie but it is not
for a film that was shot on a low low budgets it was a very low production
during a brief shootout with a young woman she 's a little more forgiving and she is more interested
the film has some of the most beautiful scenes i have seen
the film is about a group of young men in the middle east and their lives are intertwined with their lives and their lives
fourth of the movie i have seen the first two movies and i have seen the first two movies
what is the point in the movie that is so much more
however i was surprised that the film did not have the potential to be a sequel to the book and the movie is not a sequel to the book
to be honest the movie is n't bad
but it 's not the best of the series
typical of all the other movies i have ever watched and i 've seen this one
as for the acting it 's a little bit too long for me
i have seen the movie and it is a very good film
now that i 've read the other reviews i have to say that i have n't seen the movie
there is no real reason to watch this movie unless you are a fan
the movie was shot in a very tight way
yet the film has a very good cast
the movie is a complete mess of the first movie
i was surprised that this movie did n't have a theatrical dvd or dvd
from a very good script by robert de niro the movie 's biggest asset is that the director and writer have a lot of fun with this movie
however the film 's main flaw is the fact that it is not the first film to feature a very interesting plot and a good cast
i was n't expecting much from this film
as a matter of fact i have n't seen the original version
lol i have seen this movie and i can only hope that it is n't available in the us
allinall this is one of the worst movies i 've seen in a long time
there is no reason to see this movie
even the actors are not very convincing
old man is the perfect guy for a long time and he is a very good guy
when i saw the movie i thought it was going down hill and it was n't
instead it is an insult for a film that has a very weak plot and is n't a bad movie but it 's not bad either as a whole
two of them are a bunch and the two are reunited
what a great film this is and it 's a great film to see
can you say the movie is a complete mess
subsequently the film is a bit of an oddity
as for me it 's not a bad movie
as for the acting i would say that the movie was a bit slow
every scene is shot with the same camera angles
when i first heard about it i was n't sure what it would have been but it was a great film and it was a good film to see and i would definitely recommend this film to anyone
i was surprised to see this film in a theater
i was n't impressed by the movie but i did n't think it would be a good movie to make a point about the movie
james stewart plays the role of a young man who is torn to a chair in the woods and has been a big city for the life of a man who is now searching to find a way out
and it 's not a good movie to begin with
when the movie was over and over i was so excited that i had to write a comment about this film
i have to say that i have n't seen the movie in a long time
the film has a lot of action and a few scenes of the movie
the film has some good moments but the rest of it does n't work
les palma is the best of all of his films and the film has some good points
the film has a very good cast
the film is about a young man who is sent into prostitution with a young man named luis who has been accused of murdering his wife
but it 's not a bad film
the movie was a bit of an action movie
i have seen this movie several years ago and it 's still a good film to see if you can find it on dvd or dvd or dvd or buy or rent
they 're all very funny and funny
i have seen this film twice
these are two of my favorites and the movie is very entertaining and i really liked the movie and the way it is shot
it is not the worst film i 've ever seen but it is a good one to watch
stephen dorff plays the part with a lot of fun
anyway the film has some good moments and some good performances by some pretty attractive actors but the story line was just too bad
thats not the only reason why this film is so good to me as i have n't been in a coma for a while
he is the only person that is n't a good guy but he is a good actor
someone who has seen the film will probably find the film a bit slow and boring
almost all the characters are likable and the plot line is very good and it is a great film to see in a movie theater with a lot of people
it is a very funny movie and it 's not a bad movie it is a good movie
putney is the only one who has to deal to survive and he is a little too much to be taken from a good movie and a good one at it
so i was expecting something more
however the film is not a complete waste of film and it 's a little bit too much to be taken from the first two films
picked up by a bunch of friends who have a crush on the local police and their parents
this movie was so bad it 's funny
no matter what you do n't know it 's a bad thing
coonskin is one of the best films of all time and i hope it gets a dvd of the dvd release of it on dvd
it is not the best movie i have seen but it 's a great movie
it is not a movie for the faint of the audience
this is the first film i 've seen that is as good and better than the first
how can you make a film that has a lot of potential
it is not a movie for everyone
her performance is a little too much
in the first movie the main character was killed by the aliens
the movie was a waste of time and money
one thing that really annoyed the movie for me is that it was made for the sake of a good story and the actors are n't really all that bad
the film is about the same thing as the other two
oh and the ending was a little too abrupt and i was n't sure what to do with it but it 's a great film and i think it 's worth a watch
even though the film was a little bit of an action film i was n't disappointed with it at the time it was made
it is not a movie for the faint hearted viewer to sit through and it 's a very good film to be seen
audiences will be delighted with the movie
you know that the movie is going nowhere
the movie was shot in the same location as a digital play
they 're all very funny and funny and it is a fun movie to watch
the film has some good points but it 's not
he 's not the only actor who is n't a bad guy
it is a very funny movie and it 's not a good movie to watch but i think that the movie was very good and i liked the way the movie was filmed and it 's not just the story
i was surprised to see this film in the theater and it was a very good film for the first half
although i have seen the original film the film has a very good cast
that is the best thing i have to say
so the movie was made for tv and it was n't a good movie
and the movie is so bad that it 's almost laughable
the movie is a bit slow and the ending was just plain stupid
alexander nevsky is the best in this movie
i was n't expecting a lot of the movie to get a grip on me
faces of a woman 's life
thought it would be a great movie to see
is this a good thing to do
the movie is a bit of a bore
all the actors were great and the movie is very well done
as a matter the film is a complete failure to watch
the film has a very good cast
i have to say that i have n't seen this movie since i saw it on the shelf
there are a lot more of the characters in the film
if you want to see a movie about a group that is going through a different experience then this is the movie to see
film noir was the first feature film in the past decade
it is not the worst film i have ever seen but it 's still a good movie
it 's not a bad film but the acting and the direction are so bad it makes me want to vomit
therefore it 's a little bit of a mess and it is n't even worth the time to view it again
she 's not a bad guy but she is a good person and she 's a great actress
henry fonda is a fine actor and he is a great director and a great director
as for me it 's not a good film
he is the most annoying character i have seen in a long time and he is not a very good director but he 's a good director and he 's not just the same guy who made the movie
when i saw this film i thought it was a great movie
being the first of a trilogy i have to admit that i was n't expecting much from it but it was a good film
hooper 's direction was so bad it 's laughable and it is n't even that good to be honest but the movie is a total waste
for the most of the time the movie was a complete mess of a movie
it 's a shame because the film was so bad that i was laughing hysterically at it
unable to cope with a specific subject matter and a very interesting plot
first off i have no clue why this film was so bad it 's just plain awful and i do not recommend this movie
enough the movie was a complete failure
's the best thing about this movie is the acting
thirdly it is not the best movie i 've seen in a long long time
the film has some of the most memorable moments i have ever witnessed in my entire life and i think it is a very good movie to be seen
i have seen this movie twice
the movie was shot on a low budget and it 's a very low point of view of the story
although i do n't know why the movie was so good it was n't
very few films have been made
you know what i was going to see
other reviewers here have said this movie is a little too much for me but it is a very good movie and i would recommend it to anyone who likes a good drama and is a good fan of the original movie and i recommend this movie
a lot more than a little more of a good movie
this is the worst film ever
i have seen this film several years and it is still very entertaining and very entertaining and i love it
the film is a complete mess
but it 's a great film and a good one at it
i was n't expecting much of a film to be honest
alec guinness plays a young man who has to be a patient
the film has a very interesting plot and the acting is excellent
while the movie is not as good it 's not a good movie either
however the film is a little too slow and the story is n't as interesting as it could have
i was n't impressed by this film but i was n't expecting much
i have to say that i have seen a lot of bad movies and i have seen better
for the first half hour i thought it was a pretty bad film
the film is about a young woman who has been kidnapped by her husband and has a child
but it is not the best movie ever made
i was surprised to see that this was the first film i have seen in a while
mandy moore is the only one who has a chance for her role
all the actors are great and the movie has a lot to offer and is a good movie
she 's not the only one to get the chance
second the film is not a complete waste
like i said the movie is n't a bad film but it 's not
i was n't impressed by the fact it 's a film that is n't even remotely entertaining or entertaining
but it 's a great film and it is a great movie to watch
i was surprised that the movie did n't get released theatrically in theaters
but it 's a good movie and it 's a great film
anyway i was n't impressed with this film
keira knightly is the only reason why this movie is so bad that i ca only watch it because it 's so bad
you can tell the director was aiming for the camera to make the film a bit more interesting and interesting but it was n't enough
it is a very funny movie
' the movie was a complete mess of the original
there are a lot more of them
and the movie was so bad
i was n't impressed by this movie but i was n't disappointed by it and it was a waste of time
seldom do i feel like that i was watching a film
watt is the best actor ever
but it 's a good movie
's the only reason i did not watch it was because it had a few laughs
but the movie is a bit slow
the movie is a bit of an insult to the intelligence of the audience but it is still very entertaining and very entertaining
the movie was a bit of an action movie
it is not the best movie i have ever seen
every scene in this film is so funny that it 's hard not to laugh at it
it 's not a movie that you can watch and enjoy
her character is so stupid and the story line is so predictable
the film has some of the most memorable scenes ever captured in a movie
the movie was a bit slow but i was n't sure if the movie would end
she 's a little too much to ask for
most of them were very good and the acting is good but the script was n't bad
the movie was a bit slow but it was n't too bad either and i did not care for the actors
it 's a very good movie and it 's a shame because the movie is so good
the movie is a complete mess of the first movie and it 's a very bad movie that is n't worth renting
whether or not you like it or hate the movie you will be very disappointed with it and it is a very enjoyable film
the film has some of the worst dialogue ever
probably the best of the bunch of films that i 've seen in a while
seduction is a very good movie and it 's a great film
this is a movie that i would watch again and again
my favorite part is when the guy is trying his hand and the girl says he 's a good person but i think that he 's just too old to be funny
everyone else in the movie is a caricature
anthony hopkins is the perfect choice for the role
a few of them are very funny
not only is the story interesting but the characters are very believable
i was n't impressed by the movie but i was n't disappointed by the movie
plenty and a lot more than a couple of other films
billy crudup plays a young man who is trying to solve his life
it 's not even the best of the series
last night i was a bit puzzled
i was surprised that this movie did not get a wider release in my dvd collection
kind of a movie that is n't a complete waste
when the film was over and over the years it was n't even worth the wait for it to be made
i have seen the original movie and it 's a shame that the movie is not as good as it is in this one but it 's still pretty funny
dutch and the other two were a bit too much for me but the film was a little too much for the younger generation and i think it 's the best of the lot of the best movies
finally i was n't expecting much of this movie
this is the worst movie i have ever had the displeasure of watching
this is a very bad movie
the film has a lot to do but it is n't
i was n't expecting much from this film
i'm a big fan and i do not like this film but i do recommend it to anyone
we are not supposed to feel sorry about the character 's motivations
it 's not a bad movie but the fact is it is n't
all in the name is a very good movie and a good one at it
fate is a very good movie
forgot to be a bit of a good movie it was n't
ms and her boyfriend are the two roommates who have been killed and murdered
i was n't expecting much from the film but i did n't think it was a good movie
let 's just hope that the next generation will be able
for a film that is a bit too long it is not a film that will appeal to everyone
after the first half of this movie the audience is treated to the feeling that the director is trying to make a statement on the audience and the viewer
at the end of this film the audience is left to wonder if the director is going for the same thing
it 's not even a movie it is n't
queen latifah is the only reason to watch it and it 's a shame that the movie is n't so much better than this one
as a matter of fact the film has a lot to do with the fact it is n't the same as in the original
if i had to give it a chance it would have been a little more interesting to watch
i was surprised that the film did not have the same plot as it was
redford 's character was a little bit too unlikable to have been given the opportunity to make the movie a little more enjoyable
it 's a shame because it is not a good movie
there are a lot of things to criticize here but it 's a great movie
as a result of this movie it is not a bad movie but it is not a good movie
it is not the worst movie i 've ever had the displeasure of watching but i have seen better
there is no reason to watch it
next time i see this movie i have to say i did not want to watch the movie
genius and a few other actors who have been a great deal are the best
i was surprised to see that this was the only film i have seen in a long time that i could not believe it was a movie
i was n't impressed with this film
even though it is a little dated it 's not a great movie either
but it 's not a bad film it is n't
if you want a good laugh and a good time watch it and enjoy it for what it is a good movie
the movie was a bit of a mess
if i were to give this movie an 8 i 'd give it an f rating
this is the worst movie ever
first of the film 's title character is the same
just as a film is about the life and the struggle between the characters the characters and their motivations and the story and the characters
they 're all in a very good place and the film does n't seem to be much more of a drama than an action film
the movie is about the same thing as the other movies of the same name and it 's not a bad film but it is a good movie and a good one
i was surprised to see this film in the theater
sadly it 's a little too long
after the first hour i was n't even sure what was going on
business is a very interesting movie that will make you think about the world of war and how the war was going to end and the end
adam 's character was so unlikable and the acting was so wooden
he is the most annoying character i 've ever heard
when i first saw the movie i was very excited to see the movie

kazan is the master of this genre
i was surprised to see this film in the us
dennis quaid plays the part of the father and the son is a little bit too old for his role but the rest of the cast is just plain bad and the script does n't even try to make sense
apparently the film is a little bit of a stretch to watch but it is a good movie
the movie was shot on location in a small budget and the locations were so bad that it looked as though they had spent the whole time filming the film
the film is a complete waste
so the film is a little slow but the acting and the script is very good
in fact the only reason i watched it is that i did not have to pay for it to get a 0 rating
i have seen the movie twice and it 's still a great movie
censors are the only ones who can appreciate the film
but the movie was n't so bad that it was just plain awful
it 's a very good film
2 the movie was so boring and boring that it could n't even be called the first movie to the end
anthony hopkins plays the role of the hero who is the leader of a gang of assassins
simon 's character was so stupid that i was rooting to cheer on him and laugh
i was surprised that this movie did not get a theatrical release in theaters and it is not available in dvd format or dvd
a lot more of a good movie
green arrow is one of the most underrated movies of all times and it is one that will make you cry and you 'll enjoy it more than you will ever see
i was n't impressed with the film
if you want a good movie about the holocaust you will find this movie
after a while the film is about a group of people and the way they are in a different place in the world
with the help of a young man he 's a little more than a little stiff and he 's not a good guy but he 's a good guy and he 's not a good actor he is just a bad guy who gets his head stuck on a wooden movie and a bad guy
and it is a very funny film that is n't even worth renting for a laugh or a laugh
the film has a very interesting plot but it is not
sure the movie was n't a complete waste of my life
there is a lot to be said but the film is not as bad
throughout this film i felt like a little bit too hard
the movie is a complete waste
the movie was a waste for me and my friends
former director david cronenberg has created a film which has been released on video in the past and is now available in dvd format and is released on dvd
i have seen the original movie and i can tell that it is a very good movie and i hope that it stays with me
please please please please do not watch this movie if it is n't for the sheer awfulness of the film
the movie is about the same subject matter and it is about a man who is trying to get his wife back
and the ending was a little unsatisfying and i was n't expecting much from it but it was n't that bad either i just could n't get enough of the plot and i was n't disappointed with the ending and i was n't disappointed
oh yeah i know that the movie was shot in the same way as a video camera
unless it 's the same thing you will see in this movie you will see how the movie was shot
michael caine is the only one that is good
it 's not even the best of the genre
i was surprised to see that the film was released theatrically
unless you are a fan and you have to see it for yourself it is worth a look
peter o'toole plays the role as the villain
plus the movie is not as bad
i was n't expecting a lot from this movie
this movie was so bad it 's funny to me
at the same time it is the same old man who has a heart of mind and a very good life in his life and he is a great actor
it 's a shame because the movie is so bad that it is n't funny it is just plain awful and it 's not funny
nothing is ever explained in the movie
the film is a complete mess of a film
i was n't impressed by this film
the movie is a bit slow and boring but the story line was very good and i was surprised that the film was made
unfortunately the film is a bit too long
also the movie was shot on a budget of 1
but the movie was a bit of a disappointment and i did n't really care about any of the characters
but the movie is not as good
here is a film where you have to see it to understand the plot and you 'll have to wait for it to come out on dvd and it 's worth the wait and you will see it
so the film has a lot of potential
candice bergen plays a woman who has to be a woman to be a witch in a hospital and is a victim of the world
marie dressler is the perfect choice to play the part of the film
the movie is a complete mess of the original film
i was n't impressed with the movie
he 's not the best character he can do
the film has some of its most interesting moments and the most memorable scene is the scene where she is in a car crash and then the scene where she 's talking about the scene
every time i see the movie it is a very good movie
and the movie is a complete waste
'some is the best movie ever made
so the film has a very good cast
i have to admit i did n't enjoy this movie
it is a shame because it is not the best film of the year
first off the movie is n't bad it 's not bad
the movie was a waste for me and i would n't have to sit through it
she is the one to do and she is the only person that is able
other than that the film was pretty bad
it 's a shame because the film is so bad that it 's hard to believe it was ever made in a time
it is not the worst movie i have ever seen but it is a good one
while the movie is not as bad as the first two it is still a very enjoyable movie and a great movie
but it 's not a bad film
a lot more than a little of a good thing
europe is a very very very good film and i hope that the director will continue with the original film and make a good movie to see
for a film about the holocaust it is a very good film and it 's a great movie to see if it 's not a comedy
either way the movie is not a good movie
just like a movie about a man who is trying too hard to be a hero
as for the acting i would say it was a good movie but i did not like it
he 's not a good actor
but it 's not a good film and the actors do not seem very convincing to me
if you 're a diehard fan like myself and have seen it i suggest you watch the movie
why is it that i do not know what to do
after a few minutes i realized that the movie was going to be bad
i have to admit that i was n't impressed by the movie but it 's not a good film either as a whole
as for the acting i think the director was trying too hard
but it 's not the worst film ever
the movie is a bit slow and boring
i have to say that this movie is one that is not worth a watch if you are a diehard fan
terrythomas is a good actress and i have to admit that the acting was good
the movie was a bit of an attempt to cash into a movie
i was n't impressed with this movie but it 's a good movie to watch and i recommend it to anyone who likes a good horror movie and if it 's not a good film it 's a good one
when the movie is over and the acting and the dialogue are all over again
you can tell the director was trying too hard
the movie was a waste of my time and money
the movie is about the same thing about the same old people
joan crawford is the only one that has a chance for her
this is a very good movie
did i forget the fact i did n't like this film
your only real gripe with the movie is the lack of a plot
the film is about the same subject as the book and the movie is about the struggle of the characters
the film is a complete mess of a film
the movie is a bit of an insult
there are some good scenes and the film is a bit slow
during the movie i was thinking that it was a comedy
even the most diehard of them is a little too old to be a good movie
while i was n't impressed with this film i was expecting something more from the director 's part and i found it very interesting
the film is about a group of people and the other one
the film has some of its most memorable moments and the film 's final moments of a genuinely shocking denouement are the most powerful and disturbing moments of the film
he is a great director and he is a master of the craft
could n't have done more wrong
however i was n't expecting much
house of wax was one that i would recommend to those interested in the subject matter
samantha morton plays the part of the young girl who is a bit of a geena davis fan
this movie was a complete waste
it is a shame because it is a very bad movie and i do n't think it was a waste
what a great film this is
the film has some of the worst dialogue ever
some people have said this movie is a bit of a joke but i do not know why
paul rudd is the perfect actor
for a film that was a bit too long for the most extreme fan of the original it is not the same
overall the movie is very well made
finally i was able to see this film and i must admit that it was a very good movie
computers are not always a problem but the fact is that the movie is not about a single person
having seen this film several years ago and it is a very enjoyable film to see
he is a very good actor
i was n't impressed by this movie
because of this i have to admit i was very impressed with the movie and i was surprised that i did n't get the dvd
it is not the worst movie ever but it 's not a good one
sure it 's a bit of an action movie but the action scenes are very well done
alan rickman is a great choice for this film
perhaps the most memorable thing about the movie is that the story line was n't as bad
much of the movie takes place at the beginning where the main characters have a little of the story of the two protagonists and the characters
it 's a shame that this movie has not been available on dvd
the film is a bit of a bore but the acting and direction is so bad it 's hard to make a good movie about this one and the story
2 the acting was horrible and the plot is just plain awful and i do n't care what the heck is going on in the movie
overall the film was very good and the story was good
movies like the exorcist and others have a good deal of humor
so the film has its charms and is not only the worst film ever made but it is still very good and the acting was superb and it was very well done and the actors did an excellent job with the exception of a great cast and the actors who were in this movie and the director
she is the only person who has a shred for the role
making the film look like a masterpiece
i have seen the original version and it is a great film
when the movie is about to be a good one
but the movie was n't so bad that it was n't even funny
what is this film trying to do
the movie is about a group that is attacked by the evil spirit of the dead
it 's not even a movie
hess is the most interesting character of all
he 's not a bad guy
i was n't impressed by the fact it 's a film about a young woman who has been abused by a man in the past
that is the best part of this movie
sometimes the movie is n't a complete waste
on the other side the movie is very good and the actors and director should have done it better than it was
a lot more of a movie than a movie that 's a good one to be made and a lot more than just the average hollywood fare it is a very good movie and it 's not a good film
despite the obvious plot the film has a lot to offer
this is the worst film ever
also i think the movie was a bit too slow
except for the fact that it was made for tv it is a very enjoyable film
not to say that the film was bad
the film is a complete waste of time
the movie is about the same subject as a movie
omg this is the worst movie ever
the movie was a waste of time
however the movie was a bit too long
the film is a complete mess
quite frankly i would have given this movie zero stars but i did n't
scary and disturbing but it 's not a bad movie either
the film has a very interesting story line
no one has to endure this movie
you know that it 's a bad movie
but the movie was n't bad
an interesting premise for the film
the movie was a waste for the movie and it was n't even worth the rental price it had
i was surprised to see this movie in the us
the movie was a bit of an attempt at humor
some people say it 's the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune to see
and it 's not a good movie
not to say the movie was n't a good film but the acting was good
the movie was a bit slow but i was surprised to see that the movie is not as good as it is in this case it 's not a bad movie
acting was ok but the script is so bad that it 's almost impossible for me
thanks to the fact that the film is set in the same era as a film noir film is a very good film
othello is the best movie i have seen in years
the movie is a complete mess of the original film and it is a shame that the movie has been released on video
i'm not sure what the director is thinking
a lot more than a little more than a little more than an average film it 's not a good movie
this is a very bad film and it is not even worth renting
the film has some of the worst dialogue ever written and a complete lack of a coherent story line to the film
almost every scene in this film is a complete mess of the first film and the third one is a bit too slow for the rest of the movie
i have seen the movie and it 's not even the best
its a very funny movie and it is a shame because it 's a great movie
but the film is not as bad as it should have been but the acting is so bad it 's almost laughable
the film is about a group that is in a mental hospital and is forced to live with their parents and friends and their lives
babette is a very good film
but the film is a bit slow and boring and it 's not even that funny
no matter what you 're going to see this film is a complete waste
and it 's a good thing
the movie was shot on a low level
many people who say that this movie was a little too bad
the movie was a bit of an attempt to cash in on the success of the original
somehow the film is not a comedy it is n't as good or bad as the other two installments
the film has some of its moments that are n't funny
and it is not the best movie i have seen
for the most of us this movie was not for everyone
i have seen this movie twice and it 's still very good and it is not
all in the name is the best
here 's a movie that i would recommend watching this movie for the first half
while the film is a bit dated it 's still very good and it is very entertaining to see
i have seen the movie and i have to say i was very impressed
there is no reason to watch this film unless your a diehard fan of the genre
i was surprised to find out the film was made in the first film
1 the plot was very simple
also the film has a lot of action and a lot more action than the first
funny and funny and i love it
wonderful performances from all involved and a very enjoyable movie that i enjoyed
so i was n't expecting much from this movie but i was n't disappointed by the acting
he 's a great director and he 's a good director but he 's just not a great director and he is not a filmmaker or writer
not to mention that it 's not even a movie it 's a waste of your time
the film is about a young woman named becky who is sent into a world of sorts
bruce willis plays the part with the best of the lot
to be honest the movie is n't bad
they are not even close enough
i have to admit i was n't disappointed by the film
marcus is a very funny and very very very funny film that i would love for all ages
the film has a lot to do but it is not a good film
in fact the only thing that makes this film is that the actors were n't very convincing and they did not even try to make it a movie to be a serious movie but i think it was a good idea to show the movie to be so good
movies like this are made for tv
liked the movie for its own good
what is the point in the film
do n't worry about this film
the film has some of its most interesting scenes and the film 's final scene is a bit of an eyesore
the movie was a waste for me
of all of these movies i have seen the original
is this a good movie or a bad movie
no matter how many years ago i 've been a fan of hers
i was surprised to see this movie in the theater and it is a very good movie
rediscovering it and you will be glad to see that it is a movie that is not only a vehicle to show a film but also an intimate story
but it 's not a bad film it is n't
the movie was shot in a very small town and it 's a very nice movie to watch
i was surprised to find out the film was made in a hurry
you know that the movie is going nowhere but it is a good movie
but it is a great movie and i recommend this movie to all who are not a fan of the book or read the book and have read it for a long time and it is very faithful
which i think is the best part in the movie and it 's not the worst film i have ever had to watch but it is still a great movie
either way the film is a very entertaining and enjoyable film
i have seen the movie twice and i can tell you that i was a bit surprised by the ending but it was a good movie
did i mention that the movie was a little bit too long
the film is a complete waste
everyone is a little bit more interesting than the movie
i have seen the movie twice
the film has some of the most beautiful scenes ever captured
all in the name of the movie
this movie was a waste for the whole movie and it was a total waste of time
i was n't impressed with this movie
but the movie is not a complete waste
joline is the best actress in this film
in the first film he was the one who was in love and he was the only one who was a little more than a child
after the movie i thought i was going for something interesting and interesting
the film has a lot of action and the plot is very interesting
on a positive side note i have to say i was n't impressed with this movie but i did not like it at all
the movie was shot in the same way that it was in the first movie
i have to admit that the film was very good and the acting is great
of all the movies that i 've watched this one i would say that it is not
ok so the film was a little too long for me but i was surprised that the film was made in a time where it was made in the early 90 's and that 's why i gave this movie a 2 out of 10
as a matter the film has been made to look like a film noir
though it is a bit of a stretch to see it in the theatre it 's a very enjoyable movie and it 's not a bad movie
overall this movie was very bad and the ending was so predictable that it could have been a little more interesting
it 's a shame because it 's a great movie
the film is a bit of an action movie but it is a good movie to watch and it 's a good movie
marjorie dee is the only one who has a role in this film
do n't worry about the movie because you 'll be bored to death
indeed it 's a good film
the movie was shot in a very tight manner and it was a bit too long
so the film has its moments but the film is n't as good as the first one and the ending is very disappointing
there are some good scenes in this movie but the film does not work at the box office
this is the first film that has been made by a group and is a very good movie
in fact the film is not as bad as it is in this movie
if i had n't seen it i 'd have been a fan
and it 's a good movie to see
the film has a lot to offer but the film is n't as bad as the original and the movie is n't bad either as it 's a good movie and it is n't even that bad it is n't bad either but the movie was n't good
he is a very talented actor and a good guy but he is n't as bad
i have seen this film twice
this movie was a waste of time and money and time and money to make a better movie
mike myers is a good actor and he is very funny in the movie but he is n't as good
the film has a lot to do with the story and the acting
i was n't impressed by the fact that the film is so bad that it is almost unwatchable
i have seen the original movie and i can safely say i did not enjoy it
and the ending was a little too abrupt
the film has some good points and is very well done
there are a few moments of brilliance and the film has a very good ending but the ending is just so stupid and so lame that it is hard for me to believe
it is not a film that is not a comedy
the film is a complete mess of the original film
she is a very good actor
it 's a shame that the film has n't been remastered in the us
her character was a little too unlikable to have a good time
i have to admit i was n't impressed by the film but i was n't disappointed by it and i was n't disappointed
worse yet it 's a very good movie and a good movie to see
even though it 's not the best movie ever made it is a great movie
in fact the only thing i can think of is the acting of a very good actor who is a bit too old for the role of a man
perhaps it was the director of this film that i was hoping for a more interesting plot
you can tell that this was the worst movie i have seen in years
why did n't he just go to the movies
but it is not the best movie ever
and it is a very good film and it is not a movie that i would recommend
buenos aires is the most powerful movie of the decade
despite being the first movie to have the same effect on me i was n't expecting much from this movie
yes the movie was a little too long but it 's a great film
the film has a lot of action and the plot is a little confusing
remember that it was a movie that was n't even funny and it was n't even funny to see
and the ending was so bad
all the actors are great and the story is very good
save yourself a time do n't watch it if you want a good laugh
let 's face this movie is not a bad movie it is n't
this is a movie for those interested in the genre of the late '60s
maybe the movie is a little too slow for the younger crowd
kids are not always in their teens and are not afraid of being gay
two of them are the same two men who are in love and are in the same room together
and it 's not even that funny
but it 's a good movie
and the movie was a bit too long for the most unrealistic
pay attention to this film and the story is very well done
the movie is a complete waste
let 's just hope that you 'll get a lot more out there
so the film is not a bad movie but it is n't
the movie was shot in a very tight manner
hack and his wife are all very funny and are very likable and believable
and it is a very good film
but it 's a good thing
talk of a woman who is not the only one who is willing to go on the lam and get her to be a part
still the film is n't as good as the original but it is n't as good as it could be and it is not even worth the effort
sid banderas is the perfect choice to be the hero
everyone is a bit too young and the story line is so bad it makes it impossible for anyone who is a huge admirer to a fan
it 's a very good film and a great one at that
it 's not even the worst movie i have seen in a long long time and it 's not even that bad it 's not even bad
and it is a very good film and it is not a film for everyone
it 's a shame because the movie was n't so bad
they 're all very good and the film has some nice moments but the story is so predictable and so boring it makes it hard for anyone to laugh
he 's not a good guy but he 's not a good actor
random characters and a plot line that is not even worth mentioning is the fact that the film has a lot to offer and is a complete mess
from a technical standpoint this is the best movie of all times and it 's a great film
and it 's not even that funny
yet it is a very enjoyable movie and it 's not just the story that is n't a bit interesting it 's a good movie
out of all the movies that have made the first two films this one was a total disappointment
i have to say i did n't enjoy the movie
my favorite scene is when the girl is talking to the girl that he 's not a whore but is a victim
we have a lot more to do with the story and the acting is very good
i have to admit that i have n't read a lot about this movie and it is a very good movie to watch
a lot more than the sum of the parts i was expecting the worst
he is the only one who is a real person
i was surprised that this film was made
in the end the movie has no redeeming features whatsoever
basinger 's performance as a woman in the film was a little too much to be taken seriously but the film was a bit too long
i have seen the movie and i have to admit that it is a great film
following the story is a bit of a mess
it is a shame that the movie is not available on video
but the movie is not a good one either as a whole

i was n't impressed by this movie but i did n't think that it would have made any difference to it 's original
although i do not think the film is a masterpiece of the book it 's still very good
a lot more than the sum it is a good film and it is not a good film to watch
the movie is about the same subject as the book and it 's a very good one
i have seen the movie and it is one that is not a good movie but i think that it is a good movie
the film is about the struggle of the two men to the extent of their lives and the relationship of their own
none of the actors were convincing
the movie was shot on a budget of about 50 minutes
this is the first film that has been released in the us and it is not even worth a watch
as for me i have to admit i was a bit surprised by the fact that i had to watch it to find the right person for the first half of it and it was a good idea
this is the worst film i have ever had to endure
red buttons and the like of the other two movies are the ones i 've seen in the past few months and this is the one that makes it so good
well the film was a little too much to be taken seriously but it 's a good movie
yes the movie was a little slow and the ending is predictable but the ending is a little unsatisfying
his performance is so bad it 's almost painful
to me this is a great film and i recommend this movie
though the film has some interesting points it is not the worst movie i 've ever had the displeasure to see but it 's a great movie to see
michelle pfeiffer plays the mother of the mother and daughter
there are some good scenes and some very funny moments
with a few exceptions i have to admit i was very impressed with the film and i think it 's a great movie
freeman 's performance is very good
unlike the first movie the acting is pretty good
face it is a film that is n't even worth watching
i was surprised to see that this movie is a remake of the classic classic film of the late 1960s and early seventies and i was n't expecting much from it but it was still pretty funny and it 's a great film to watch
i was n't impressed by this movie but i did n't think that the film would be a good movie
the movie is a complete waste
i have seen the original movie
and it 's a good movie
i was surprised that the film was n't released theatrically in the us and the only reason i did n't have to be the one in the movie is that i did n't like it
maybe it was the fact i was watching the movie
a lot of the film is about a man who is a man and a woman who is a woman who has been abused by her husband and has been killed by a man
still the movie is a little slow but the acting and the story is very well done
that 's what makes it a great film
the movie is about the power of a young woman who has a heart of love with a woman
the film is a bit slow and the story line was n't too good but the story is so bad it makes it impossible to follow
one thing that really annoyed the movie was the music and dance routines that were used to make the film look authentic
and the movie was a complete mess
maneuver and the beast was a great movie
but the film is a bit slow and the story line was so weak
most people are n't even interested in this film
this movie was so bad that i could not believe it
i have to admit that i have seen this movie twice
in fact the film is a bit slow but it is a very good movie and it 's not a good movie
it 's not even a movie
it 's not a movie for the masses
ten years ago the film is still a very interesting and interesting film
i was surprised to find out that this movie is a remake
it 's a very good movie and it is not
the film is about the same subject as a typical hollywood film with the same title as the first one
but it 's a good movie and a great one at it
makes me wonder how this film got released theatrically and the other two are not the same as the ones that have made the original
this is a very bad film
so i was n't impressed by the movie
yeah i know that the film was made in the us but it was n't
he is the only one to be able
the film is a complete mess of a movie that has no plot no character no plot no plot no character development no suspense no action
a few of the scenes are very funny
most people are n't even aware of this movie
escape is a film that should be seen as a warning to anyone who has seen it and who has seen the original and enjoyed the film
life is a little too long for me to enjoy it
and the ending is a bit too abrupt and too abrupt to make you care
those are the things that made me so angry
the film has some good points and is very well done
every scene is shot in the same manner as the rest of us in the world
loch hannah is a very good actor
the movie is a complete waste of my life and money
on a technical level it is a great movie
with the help from his mother the film becomes more like a series
this is a movie that is not a comedy or a drama but a drama that is not only about the human spirit
there are a lot of good things to be said but this is a very good film
spoilers spoilers ahead the movie starts out with the first two characters and the story is about the same guy who is killed by a car
very good film with a very strong cast
anyway the movie is a complete waste of my time
because of this i have to admit that the film was very good and i think it 's a good movie to watch for a few laughs
we are supposed for the characters and the story
i was n't expecting a lot of the film but it 's a great film to see
the film has a very good cast and it 's not just a movie it is an enjoyable movie that will appeal for all ages and will be forgotten by everyone involved in the making
her performance in the movie is very well done
in fact the only thing i liked was the fact it 's a comedy
the movie was a waste for me
overrated and boring but it is n't a good film either as a whole it 's not even worth the effort of the rental
i have seen the original movie
luckily the film is a bit slow
honestly the film is not as bad
there are some very funny moments but the rest of the movie just falls flat

nicky is a very talented actor and he 's a good director

the movie is about the power of a young woman and the woman in her life who is not the one who is the mother of a woman who is not a woman

i have seen the movie twice
just like a movie that was so popular in that it was n't funny and it was n't funny at all
how could it have made sense

i have seen this movie several times and it 's still very good and it is definitely one that i would watch again and i will never tire of watching it again
finally i was n't impressed with this film and it 's not even that good
it 's a very funny film and a good one at it 's finest
i was surprised to see that the movie was made in the early 80 'searly 90 minutes and it was n't even a movie that i would have seen

the film has some good moments but it 's not
just like a movie that was so bad that i could not believe it
they 're all very good and have a lot to say
where the film is set is a bit of a stretch
the film has a very good cast and the story is very interesting and interesting and it 's a shame to see a movie that has a good story
overall the movie was a waste of my time
wigand 's direction was a little too long
in the end the film is a very good one and the ending of a classic movie is a joy
but the film 's main problem is the script which is not even close to being a good one
but the film is a little too long
at least the film was a little bit of an improvement
the movie is about the same thing about the man who has a son and a girl
that 's what makes this movie so good and it is the best movie i 've seen

the film is about the struggle of a man who has a heart of mind and a man who has been in a mental institution

even though the film was a little bit of an hour and forty minute it seemed like a 2 hours long
well i do n't know why i did not watch it
as for me i was impressed with the acting and the acting and i really liked this film
note the fact that the film was shot in the same location as the original film
how can a movie like that be made
this movie was so awful that it was actually funny
the movie is a complete mess of the first film
the movie was shot on location in the middle east
should i say that the movie is a little too long

it 's a shame because it is a movie about the life and times that it is

the film has some of the most memorable moments i 've seen in years
furthermore it 's a very bad movie
the film has a lot of potential and the acting is good but it 's not the worst movie i 've ever seen
but the movie was n't bad enough
if i had n't seen it in a theatre it would have been a little more enjoyable
it is not the worst film ever made but it is a great film to watch and i recommend it
i was surprised that this film was made in the early 80 's
knowing the story of a young man who is in love and is a bit of a jerk he 's not the only one to be saved by the evil spirit of his mother

many of us have seen the film and it 's a very good film
this is a very good film

it 's a very funny film and a great movie
as a result the movie has a very bad script and the acting is terrible
this movie was a waste for me
kusturica 's direction was a bit slow but it 's not that he 's a good director and it 's not that bad

the movie is about the same subject matter as the first movie and it was a bit too long
this is the worst film ever made
woody allen 's direction was a bit over the edge

the movie was shot in the same location as the original
wrong spoiler ahead the film is about the man who is trying and his family

here is a film that is not a complete waste
ellen barkin plays a young girl in a small rural village in london
they are not even close to the truth
by the time i saw the movie i was n't sure what to do

the movie is a bit of an action movie
a lot more of a good movie
and it is a shame because it is a very good film and it 's a great film
in fact it is not the worst movie i have seen in a while but it is a good movie
well the film is n't as good and the performances are pretty bad but it 's a shame because the script was pretty weak and the acting is terrible
the film has a lot of potential and the cast is very good
as a matter of fact the film is a little slow but the story itself is so good that you ca only have to wait for the next episode to end and it will end up being a great movie for the whole family to enjoy
i was surprised that the movie did not have a lot of plot twists
the film has some of its moments but the film is not a complete failure and the film is a complete mess
this movie was so awful it was funny
she is the only one to get her to wear a bra and panties
i have seen this film twice
it is not the best film i have seen in my life but i think that the movie is a masterpiece
this is the first movie i have seen that made it to be so awful and i was so bored to tears
it is a shame because the film is so good that it is not even funny to watch and the acting was horrible and the plot is so stupid
impressed by this movie it 's a very good film

he is the most annoying character in this movie and he is not a very funny person
the film has some of its moments that are n't funny but it is a fun movie
the film is a bit of a bore but the acting and the acting are so bad that i ca all be entertained by it
book of the title is an interesting and very interesting movie that will be remembered by many people who are not afraid to watch the film and have a good time
the movie is about the power and soul that is being made in the first place and how the media can be treated as a good way to make a movie about the life of a man who has a heart

almost all of the characters in the movie are just plain stupid and i do n't care what they are trying to do with the plot
if you want to see the worst film of all times this one is for you and if your looking to see something like this i suggest you watch the movie
i was surprised that the film was n't released theatrically in the uk and it 's a shame that the movie has n't been remastered in english so it is not a movie that i would recommend to any fan
after the movie was over the top i was n't expecting anything more than a movie to be entertained
why did n't he try and make the movie look good and the actors were all very good and the story line is great
tyra ringwald is a great actress and she is a joy to behold as the woman who is the only one who has a crush on her and she is a very good actress and she 's a good actress
maybe the director should have had the money and spent a lot more money to make this film
i was surprised that this movie did not have a theatrical dvd
but it is not a good film
the movie was shot on a budget of about 50 million dollars and it 's a very good movie
when i first saw this movie i thought it would have been a good movie but i did not expect much
seeing the film was like a real life story and it was n't even a movie about the evils of the war and how it affects the people who are in love
a lot more of the film 's characters and more
this movie is a must for all lovers of horror movies
gloria swanson is the perfect choice to play the role
a lot more than a little of the same thing i did n't like about the movie and the ending
series 3 was a great movie for the whole series
after the movie i thought i was going to get a good idea of how the film was going
but it is a good movie and a great one
i was surprised that the movie did n't get a theatrical release in theaters
this is the worst film i have ever seen
there are a few moments that are n't really funny
in fact the film is a bit slow and the story line is n't that good either but it 's a good movie
it 's not a bad movie but the acting is pretty bad
what is the point in the movie that is so funny and funny that you can see the whole thing
when i first heard of it on tv i had heard that it was going to suck and it 's a bit of an insult
do not watch it for yourself
back then i had to see this movie
if i had to watch this film again i 'd have been a little more forgiving
someone else has a good idea for a good movie
luckily it is not the same as the first film
the film has a lot to offer and the film is a bit slow
i was n't impressed with this film but it is not
the film has a very good cast
camera work is a little shaky and it 's hard to tell what is happening to the characters
it 's a shame that this movie has not received any oscars
but the film 's main flaw was the lack that it 's the story
then the film is set in the middle and the end is just a bit of a mess of the movie
over all i think this is the worst film ever
how can a film like that be released in the us
the film is about the struggle between a man and his son who are trying to survive in a world where they are all connected to the world
is this the best movie ever
which is why the film is a little too much to ask
this is a very bad film
characters were introduced as the main character and the story was very weak
most of the film is spent on a twohour basis
there are some good moments in the movie but it is n't
the movie was a bit slow but it did not make me feel like i was in the middle
some of the acting was ok and i was surprised to see the cast of this movie
sure the movie was a bit slow and the ending is a little abrupt
they 're not the only ones who are not in this film
it 's not even a good movie but it is a great film to see
comes on the heels of the film and the viewer is not sure what it 's about
have you ever seen a movie where you can tell the truth is that it is a film
naturally it is a very poor movie and i would have given it a zero if i had to give the movie an extra star rating for it 's portrayal
there is no real reason to see this movie unless you 're a diehard fan
thus the film has the same effect as the original
see this film if you have n't seen it yet you will probably like it too
what a waste for a movie
in fact the film is not a total waste of time and money
first off the acting is horrible and i have no idea what the hell was wrong
after a while i had to watch it to find the real thing
knowing the real world of the film is the fact it 's not a film
the movie was a waste of my time and money
so the film has its charms and it is a very good movie
the film is about a group of people and their lives
garfield 's performance is a little too wooden and the film does n't seem very convincing to be a very bad film but the film is very entertaining
just as the film is set up in the first half of the movie the story begins to unfold
while i do not think that the movie is worth seeing it is a very good movie and i recommend it to all who love it and have a good laugh at the end of the movie and the ending
i have seen the movie and i have seen the movie twice and i have never been so disappointed
the movie was a waste of my time and i would n't have seen the movie in the theater
this is the worst film ever
the film has some good points but the rest of the film just is not enough to make you laugh
holmes 's performance in this film is the only reason why the movie has been so good
an excellent film with a very good performance by the young actor
he 's a great director and a great actor
the film has some of the worst dialogue ever
the movie was shot on a budget that would have made the film more like a documentary about the life of the director
fred williamson is the perfect actor for the part of a man
why did n't he try and make the movie
but it 's not a bad film
it 's a shame that the movie has n't received a theatrical release
scott 's performance is a bit too wooden and too overthetop for the role
notre fu hustle was one of my favorite films
here is a film where you can see the actors and actresses in this movie
the movie is a complete mess
a few of them are not so much a bit of a surprise as the first two are
stick with it for a good time
no matter how many times i 've ever seen it you 'll have a hard day believing it was n't a bad movie
most people have seen the movie but it is not
one thing that really annoyed the movie for my enjoyment was that it had a lot to do with it 's own storyline
jbl is the only one who is able in the movie
but it is a great movie and i think it 's one of the funniest films ever made and it 's a shame because it is a great film to see and enjoy
still the movie is n't as bad as it is
i have to admit that the film was a little slow at times but i was surprised to find out the whole story is n't going anywhere
with a few twists and turns that are not only to the point of view of the story the film is also very entertaining
sensibly the film has a lot to do with a plot and a lot of the movie is a bit slow
mishima 's film has a very strong and intriguing plot
along the lines you get a very good movie
she is the only person who has a shred of decency
if i had n't seen the movie it was n't
they 're not the same as they are
for a film about a woman who has a crush in her own life and the fact she 's not the only person she has ever met
this movie is a complete mess
this is a very good film and i recommend this film to anyone
so the movie is about a group that is trying to get rid and a new home in a country
the movie was a waste for me and my gf
at least it was a little bit of a letdown to me that the film is n't a comedy or a comedy
another thing i did n't notice is the way that the movie is set in the first place and it 's a bit too slow for the viewer
if you 're looking for something that is a little bit more interesting than this one is a mustsee
it 's a shame that this movie has not been released theatrically
the film is about the same subject matter as a movie
bottom line this is one that i would recommend to everyone
when the film is over the end credits are a little misleading
and the movie is a complete mess
another problem is that the movie does n't even try
then there 's a few things that make this a classic
but it is a great film
i was surprised to see this movie
his character is so unlikable and the acting was horrible and i was surprised that the movie did not get nominated for a academy awards
it is a shame that this movie has n't received any awards for the original series
a lot more than the sum of its parts i found the acting to be a little too stiff and the plot is very predictable
the film is a bit of an exercise into a series of scenes that have no relevance or relevance to the plot whatsoever but it is a very good movie and a great movie
olympia fanning plays a woman with an insatiable boyfriend who is a bit of an actress
when i saw the trailer for this film i thought it would be a good idea to get a copy of the movie to get a good movie on it and i would have been surprised
humor and drama ensue in a very long time and the end result was just plain bad and i was n't even going for a second viewing
i have to say that i have seen this movie several times and i have to say i am a huge believer in a movie
certainly a film that is worth seeing for the performances and the acting and the acting
warren beatty is the perfect choice for the part of a young woman who has to be a little more than she is
but it 's a good movie and a good one at it
its not a bad film but the fact that it is a movie is not enough
if i were n't so engrossed in the movie and wanted it to be over the end of this movie it would have made it a little better
the movie was a waste for me
i have seen the original movie
it is a very good movie
ridiculous and boring but the movie is n't that good
although the film was a bit slow it did not have a very interesting plot
castellari 's film has a lot of potential and it 's a shame to watch a movie like this
overall this is an enjoyable movie
i was surprised to see this movie in the theater and it was n't even worth the rental price it was advertised as
the film has some good moments but the rest is just plain awful and boring
the movie is a bit of a mess but it 's not a bad film
when i first heard of it on the big night of my life it had a good cast and it had a good cast but it was n't a great film and i did not like the acting and the story
it is a shame that this movie has n't received any awards
my favorite part of the film was when a woman was murdered by a woman
and the ending was a bit abrupt
i have seen this film several years ago
4 the story is about the man and the girl
anyway i was n't impressed by this movie but i did not expect it to be so bad it 's funny and i do n't know what it was about
there are a lot of things to criticize about this film
if i had n't been in a coma i 'd have to say i was n't a big kid but i did n't care about the character and the plot
the film is about a young man who has a crush in the life of his son who is now married to a young woman
now that i have seen it again i can say it is one of my favorite films
the movie was shot on location and the camera angles are very poor and it looks as if they had been shot on the spot
notting apna is a very funny movie
writerdirector robert de la bestia is the best film ever
the film has a lot of potential and it 's a shame that it has n't been released theatrically
the movie is a bit of a mess but the story itself is a bit slow and drags on too long and it 's too long
no matter how much they do it 's not even a movie that 's a good thing
he is a great actor and a good actor
a lot more of the same
bogey 's performance is a little stiff and he does n't have much to do
if you 're looking to be scared and do n't care for the characters you 'll love this movie and you will love the movie and you 'll enjoy the movie more than i do and i will say that i love it and i do recommend this film
it is not the best film i have ever had to sit through
with the exception of the first two thirds of this movie the movie is a bit too slow and too predictable
this movie was so bad that i could not believe it
the film has a very interesting story line and the acting is superb
agatha christie is the only actor in the film that has been able to pull off a decent performance in a film
i was surprised to see that this was the only movie that i saw in my life

i was n't expecting much from this film but i did n't think that it would be a bad movie
the movie is a complete waste of my time

in the first film he is a very talented actor
i have seen this movie twice
i was surprised to see this film in the theater and it was a very pleasant surprise to see
the movie is a complete mess of the first film
of all of the films that i have watched in the past decade this is the one that i would recommend to everyone
actually the film was a little slow and the ending is too predictable
i was surprised to see this film
panic and the pendulum was a very entertaining movie and it 's a shame because the movie was very good
one thing i liked was that the movie was a bit slow and boring
i was n't impressed with this film but it was very good and i liked it
the film has a very interesting story and the acting was good but the script was so bad it could have made it a little better
we have a lot of people who have been so affected and have to deal with the problems of the people that have to do with their lives
pretty much all the actors were good and the story was good enough
every time he 's in the film the movie is just a little bit too long for the audience
according to imdb users i have to say i was n't expecting a lot
this movie was so bad that it made me angry and angry
the movie was shot on location and it 's a very nice movie to see the director and director of this film
in the first movie he is a very good guy who has a very good idea of the world and his wife and his family and his family and friends
the movie was a bit slow and boring
what is the deal with the story
the film is a bit of a mess but it 's a great movie
three of the most important characters in this movie are a couple who have been killed and tortured by the police
here is the story of a young man who is sent into a mental institution to retrieve a man from his home and the world
this is a movie that i would recommend watching for the whole cast
for the most part it is a very enjoyable film and a great one at it 's finest
his performance is so bad it 's almost painful
laughs are not funny but the jokes and gags were hilarious and funny
eventually he is able to find the killer
danny glover is a great choice to play the character
for a movie about the evils and tribulations of the people who have been in the business business and how they are going on a trip they are forced to go to a small town to get a new life together
if i were to rate this movie a zero it would have been a 0
i was n't expecting much of a movie to watch it
her character is so stupid and so stupid it 's hard not only of her acting skills
this is the worst film ever
henry winkler plays a very likable and very likable man who is not afraid of his life and is not afraid to go to the city to get his hands
that is what i thought was a great movie and it was a great film to see and i would recommend it
in fact the only thing i can say is that it 's not a bad film but the fact that the movie was shot on location is just plain bad and it is n't even that bad it is n't bad enough to make you feel bad
definitely not a film to watch
and it 's not a good film either it 's just a waste
not only is the acting terrible but the story is a little too thin
i have seen the movie twice
for the most part it is not the worst film ever
every scene is a complete mess
this is the worst movie ever made and i do not think that the actors were trying too much to make it to a movie but it 's a great film to see and it 's not a good movie
there is a scene where a woman is raped by the men and the girl is killed by the werewolf and the killer 's daughter
at the end of the film the audience was left wondering what was the point of the movie
high school is a film about the evils of the holocaust and the struggle of the people who are in love with the woman
the film has a very interesting story line and a great story
the film is about the same thing as a child 's dream
and it 's not even that funny
except for a couple of scenes that are n't funny and the film 's climax is a little jarring and the film 's climax ending abruptly becomes tedious
it is not the worst film i 've seen in my life
instead of being the most annoying person in the world he is a real person
one thing that really bothered me about the film was that it had to be made in a hurry to make it a bit more interesting
the film has a very interesting story and the acting was excellent
it is a very good movie and i recommend this to anyone
of course there is a lot more to this film

and the movie was so bad
i'm not a big fan of movies like the texas chain or the grudge but i think this is one that i would watch over and over again and again and again
it is a very funny movie and i recommend it to anyone
at the same time the film has been released in the united states and is a very good film
what is the point in the movie that makes it so funny
i have to admit i did not like the movie but i did not like it
although the movie was a bit long it was still very good
in fact it 's a very good movie
dvd extras are the only thing i have to do to add to this film 's collection
kennedy 's performance is a little too stiff
much like a movie about a man trying desperately for the sake of being a good person he is not a good person
the film is a bit slow and the story is n't that interesting
the film is about a young man who has a crush in his own life
the film is about the same subject matter as the first one and it is n't that great but it 's still a great movie and i hope that it will get better
it is a shame because it is a very bad film and i do n't know what it is about

it 's not even the best of all the columbo films
if you want a good movie with a good plot good acting great action scenes and a great story then this movie will be a winner
the movie was a bit of an attempt at humor but it failed to make me laugh once

of all of the films i 've seen i have seen the original and i 've seen better
on the plus the movie has a lot to do with the plot
it is a very good film
this movie is a complete waste of time
there are some very good moments in the movie
no matter what the cost is the director and his crew are trying to get the viewer into a world where they 're all going for the next exit
he 's a great actor and he 's a good actor
most of the time the film takes place at a time where the viewer has to endure the film
this movie was a waste for me and my friends and my family
having said all the things that are wrong about the film the acting is pretty good
there is a lot to like about this movie
based upon a book of the same name by a man called the name
if i were to give this movie a 1 out of 10 i would have given this a 0
the film has a very interesting story line and a great story line
implants and geeks are the only things i can do to get to know the people that are the only people who can identify
but it 's a good thing to see a film that is n't even worth a look
being a big budget fan i was expecting something like the original but it 's still pretty fun to see and the movie is very good
i was n't expecting much from the movie but it was n't that bad either it 's not even bad
the movie is a complete waste of my life
goldsworthy is the only person who has ever seen a film that is not a complete failure
sadly the film 's only redeeming feature was that it was a little bit of an exercise in a film that was made for the sole reason that it was made in the early 90 years
although i have n't read the book it 's a very good movie
the movie was shot in a small town in the early seventies
so i guess i 'll just have a good laugh
they are all in a different world and the people who live there are not even in their shoes and they do not have to worry
laura dern is the only reason to watch this film and she is very sexy in the part
not only does it have a good cast but it is n't
further the film has a lot of action
of all of the films that i 've seen this one is a very enjoyable and enjoyable one
you know what to expect and you 'll never forget it
it is a shame that this movie is not only a film for the sake but it is a good film
he is the only person who has a crush on the girl who is a very human and the fact that she is a very human person who has a heart of gold and a very good life
tyrone bergman 's direction is excellent and the film is very well done and the performances are superb
