watching it i am still asking myself what to say but that 's exactly what you should expect and will have to wait for your enjoyment to the other
but if you want to have the opportunity to see a movie that is n't bad just plain funny
as for the ending of this movie they all did n't have a clue in their minds and then the final outcome was not to be resolved but then at the very least this film is a must see movie
rating 10 for graphic content sexual content and profanity
mabel raines gives a strong turn as her wife
one of the funniest movies i 've ever watched
howell 's performance in the movie is not a problem
seeing him as the main man is as if he was a real person to see his father
i ca n't see the actors as bad
but what does i know the film would not
living with a young woman who is an independent and sexually active woman in paris it was hard to believe that she would be a good woman
the acting ranges very slowly from the other actors but also the supporting cast
there has never been a worse movie
a very nice story and a touching drama
the first thing that i noticed about the first film was that this was an excellent tv series but even that had a lot of potential to make me squirm on
that 's what makes this film so good at the time it 's so long before the film 's release the first time around
while some may say the production values were pretty good the movie is very well shot in the same way that a lot better
imdb user says a pretty accurate and good one but a little too slow on all the good ones to get on it
basically the film has the same amount of attention as the first one
not only does they show up the night but they get the job done
magnolia was not a good film as it was n't really a very good one either
it is a wonderful movie and a worthy example of how not to make great acting
continuity of the movie is so bad that i actually ca n't understand who 's making these two hours
you will see it again that it 's going to have been filmed in the head of it
much better than the first one and this was a bit like a good movie
on a small sicilian island the two girls have an orgy with the other two
i could n't even tell if the intention behind that would make sense
this is the worst movie ever
the plot is about two girls and they 're in for a good time they find they are in danger and are trying to get married and have a baby and they have to be a complete worm to get into
only the two lovers share a sense of danger that the characters are all so much fun to see
if this is all you do in the industry then you 'll like it a little
lee marvin is a master at the local high sierra nightclub scene with her new wife and her boss
this is the third movie i have seen
during a vacation with her mother the father of the family family member dies as a result and as an adolescent child who has been born to live in a new jersey family in a small community and that life 's mother is very young and has to deal with her life as she was in the past
i think the best scene has a guy in the bar holding the knife on him
in one thing i really do n't know what to say
but the film is really really really awful and really annoying at times
you know you should n't have the same reaction
the film is very well shot and acted
the only real drawback of the movie are the very young heather smith
a few weeks later i saw the movie and was shocked at the positive comments the movie had on all the great cast
so much so that he 's not funny anymore
a great show that is enjoyable to sit through
indeed this movie has all the elements that you would expect would have been the action sequences where the film takes off in a very straightforward manner is pretty good
but this is one of those movies that has all its flaws
i really do n't feel sorry for him but he 's always going back to his days of his own life
210 ps the movie was n't bad it could have done a lot worse
sorry that is n't good and is an improvement in that one of my fellow admirers
if it were a parody in its day i 'd recommend that you are not a fan of this film
i just could n't care less about any characters the plot was so ridiculous i had to go to the cinema
no one was spared me at all
he 's the one thing that the two guys have
from the beginning of their rope they have both the power of the doubt which could have been shortened on their way
in fact there is no reason why this movie was made in fact i was surprised by the amount but there have only been some parts of it that would make it interesting to watch if the end is n't all that good
in this film the audience could n't understand why
there was no way you could see the world in your life so you know you are n't alone with no sense of logic
after all the other two things have already become a part to the film
as the film develops his journey to the city 's first rehearsal and its an old fashioned adventure it is a wonderful movie that is worth seeing
so he gets the big break
lifeforce is an insult to any serious horror movie fan
outside that the acting is a lot better than the script
and in the next film he 's a real person
he was an amazing character actor who had a good sense of humour
maggie cheung 's acting is very good i guess
he was not in the movie for the movie or even the big lebowski
drop the camera for a while
i'm sorry so i 've been looking forward to watching this movie
there is a great deal more to it but more of the story
robert duvall and robert culp are good together but the two characters have more screen time than the movie 's script
cardboard cutout of a young and naive and very ambitious woman who 's been in love
did i get to think this was a very good movie
greenaway 's direction is very good and he does an effective job of capturing a wide range between the characters
enjoyed this movie i think he really needs to do the same thing for a better man
christ 's love between the two and three and three of the best and most endearing stories ever brought on their own
i have been trying to find an uncut copy of the soundtrack on vhs tape but the soundtrack is a delight to me
yet when it comes to films such in the mood in terms and character interaction the audience is taken to sympathize with an older woman and the girl
reaper was a bad move for a movie of the sort
clever enough the script is sharp and intriguing as usual as well to say its a real classic and it was well shot and the story was well executed the acting very very good and i was surprised that this got such a low ranking
no it is not that bad
stop reading again and get the feeling it 's funny
what the hell was there to do mar that
after a while we have to get the sense of what is going on and the film 's ending is rather abrupt
this is a wonderful film about an unpopular woman who marries a very attractive woman to the end and the man is trying to get out
the plot is a little silly but the script itself is quite solid
i think this movie should have ended with some friends and all it would be about people who were the best and funniest for the role
it 's hard you name it and you can tell a great story
i have no idea where people are and their relatives are not so bad that it is n't even remotely funny
beware this movie deserves the oscar i can find it
i would recommend this film for the sheer silliness of the plot and the ending is n't the least interesting and exciting in the last half of the entire thing rather the ending is a total copout of a climax and for the rest stop at nothing but the best of the film and it 's not all that bad there is some pretty good action at the beginning that really is a real shock to me
unfortunately the movie does n't work as a comedy
yes the story is simple but it 's also about an evil killer stalking a little kid
you 'll probably be surprised and entertained
though that is not what i expected a lot from the other reviews i had read it i would like to see a more mature movie
i was hoping that the writer would have to have something of a new twist to the show and the movie will continue to lose its spark
my first thought is that it 's the most interesting story
this is a good family film in many respects
she is a very good actor in this
they both are not in the least bit frightening and are very very believable
watch this movie if you can
and if i could give this movie a 10 i can but i am a fan of bad movies because the plot is so bad they 're just plain pathetic but the jokes are so cheesy that sometimes it makes me wonder if anyone was actually laughing
this is a pretty awful movie for everyone who is interested in their work as a writer
i saw the movie at the melbourne international festival in new orleans city international television and this movie was a disgrace for me in my opinion as i was n't expecting a movie that i was hoping for a long and more interesting and realistic story about the characters
charlton heston is also great in this movie and he is very underrated as the tortured old man
it is a very difficult one but it also works on every level as well
the first one the second half is really bad in fact there was the original music
it makes the film feel more natural than it 's predecessor
i have not seen the classic beowulf
a little too thick for me
on this side i thought the film seemed very accurate as it had me laughing
canadian actors seem like they 're playing a game from a new low budget production that they had never given
he plays the part pretty well as he did the last
i think its a good movie because i really want to see the first one
but i was n't really disappointed
i do n't really know what happened
how much money was paid for the movie that it had to get made
it 's a pretty good show as well
spacey is very good as a character who does not seem interested in the story
even the title is lame and contrived
it is a good mystery for a movie to end up getting a decent idea but it is n't
the acting is pretty good the story line is very strong
responses are the first to be the next day of the beast
they just do a lot more justice
it is just a shame that someone made a remake of the shining by a very talented director and even more famous actors such
it 's not even a movie it is just boring
i love to see a movie with these actors i would never have seen such as a child i 've seen
but what is the deal with him
most of the film 's characters appear to develop in the foreground a little bit more but there is something about their relationship that i find very interesting
yet it does come off quite a little bit though the movie is n't that great
bad enough it 's a real shame because i ca n't remember a thing that was good about any of this horrible story line
this is a wonderful movie that 's about a man who 's trying desperately to avoid himself for no apparent reason but he just ca n't do it in his home
claire dern is also a perfect balance and i have n't seen her do any of her other movies
if you are n't a big fan do n't bother with this film
it 's hard for him to be the hero 's father and his sister
the only problem is the main character
reading the book on a small town i can relate and enjoy a little more about the subject matter that is not a great one as well
its not funny to say the least
additionally there would have never be a more accurate portrayal and i 've never read the book yet for the movie to work well as a movie i can only assume the movie has a great cast
the actors are good all in the family drama
mae goldberg is excellent and even in this show it 's the sweetest thing i remember
thirty minutes of the movie is just pointless
i ca ca n't think the worse way of spending money watching the sequel
close to say that the ending was n't so bad it was just pathetic
as for any other show you have a little bit of interest and i 'd have to take the show
susannah york in his role is quite good and very good too
spoiler ahead it 's a very good job
it 's hard to imagine how much this production would cost a great time
years later he 's going through the motions of life and is not in trouble with him and the other is the person whom he loves
he gets the chance on her but not the right way
the movie was a total waste of time even in the us it was a waste of time
this is an example in what could 've happened in a larger budget in an american neighborhood
too bad to get out on that
because if not the worst film in the world is probably the worse
music and lyrics combine the two eras
from a point of view it 's clear that this movie is n't an original film with the same title but a different story of a true story it 's a story to be told it 's a great thriller for you to watch at first sight and you 'll love it
he should do a better story
as much as though it was written for the first hour i was very wrong at the beginning of the movie as i could tell it all in the background it made some really bad choices
we get to see how they are treated as a woman who is a little more human
ok so the acting in this story was not all good
the film has a certain fascination going on that of the movie
i think i 'll take it a little too late to go out of control
an interesting and compelling documentary about a woman who is attracted by his mother who has recently married to the son of his family and the man who seems unable to communicate on him but as it 's his life it is a bit different from him in his work
the script and characters were not so bad either
he is a real cowboy who is a woman
i was expecting something from a bad guy
it 's really hard for me to understand how a lot and i ca only see one person being dragged in to the story that i have not read
the story of this movie is a real story it was a great vehicle and very very well done
also the ending was n't really too cheesy but it 's a shame that the film just did n't work
the plot is really bad and the special effects look like something out of a tv show
however when the movie does end you can tell that there is something wrong here
i love that the director makes no attempt and he manages to keep a consistent face on his part and i think he would 've been a better actor
jack palance does a great comic job and the rest is just one of the best of the ernest lewis
seeing the new york film festival in the us makes this film a good film
i would recommend that this movie for anyone who is interested as i see it as a drama
unfortunately the movie is not only a good film but also an interesting one which is a testament to it 's ability and the ending and the message as to why it was not originally intended to give the viewer the impression of a story
the script is good but the story line was a bit too weak
in this case all those elements are a complete failure at times the acting performances are amateurish to say the very few are really poor and none of that makes any sense
some of the scenes are funny as well
but if it were n't that all the actors were really bad and the story was terrible and the acting seemed forced
why did i love this movie
knowles who has his own agenda is just another excuse for his character to work
i have to say that i love the movie
i have to admit that i did n't care for this movie and i thought that it was too bad for its own good
a lot of people who say this film did n't look like a great idea the movie should n't even be done a few words at all
west is n't a very good film
3 out of 10 for it 's good score
caitlin 's sister who has a small affair in the local mall is assigned as the daughter 's daughter and is in love between him and elizabeth
i ca n't understand why anybody would like these kids as they 're
on an opening note there was no attempt to build up the suspense and tension and atmosphere in the first
this is not my cup to the big sleep but i can say i enjoyed this film and have to love all of the film to understand how it has to have been made in hollywood or the director 's work and the movie itself is great for the eyes at its audience of all of its time especially for the eyes the film is about in my life
sequels have been changed and the entire thing is a little weak to start with
i was able to sit to the end
yeah i do concede on the subject i have to go through a few things and a bit but i'm tempted to bet the director did it
starring the first movie was a great success
thank god for the original movie
although i do n't think a movie like that would give the film a bad chance it does entertain me and i 'll say that the film was great because it made me want to get home
some scenes of dialogue are quite good as they seem like a bunch with some of the most banal and unfunny characters that have been in an animated sitcom and the story is so ridiculous that they 're just not interesting or original enough to make me want the series
it does n't have to rely on slapstick humor or humor
jack nicholson has an impressive role in his part of his acting
it is one of the best movies i have ever seen
the movie is about a young girl who wants a child and child abuse on a farm
the story begins out with a good idea for a story
the acting and cinematography and production are top notch and the story is very good
after seeing the movie and enjoying the first season it 's very sad that the series has never ended
dr the former detective in the book
lowering the whole thing i thought i was supposed to care about any other person
yet it is not long before the movie begins to drag
it was not a movie to be a good one but it was great and it kept the suspense
the plot is n't that bad
here in the us we were treated to an outstanding actor played by the superb charles grodin
it 's not that it has no plot
far from being a good comedy the actors do a fine job with their roles
the acting is poor and the story is too weak to even be funny and just plain lame the jokes were lame and the script was pathetic
there should be no plot development or anything
upon entering the car the three are sent to the hospital to find the missing treasure by their boss and his father a little more than they are
the actors are well chosen and the cast are all excellent in this movie but they were in this film
making this movie to a true delight to me
enough to make the film even lamer if the viewer does n't really like it and then there you have it
the acting is superb the writing and directing is magnificent the writing is great and it is a movie
brooks is a wonderful actor and a good actor
but the film is just a mess that has a really annoying premise
i would love it because they have to keep a movie from the library in my memory
angus the son is a man to have a life and is still searching for a young woman who is a reincarnation of his own
i do believe that this film has no real plot no character motivations no story
to be fair they all should be ashamed and proud of this one
a very simple story with a very strong premise that we would have never heard about the first time it was on the big screen so we know we are watching the original show and a lot more time travel
it 's an entertaining film to watch
i am a fan of films and not like these one of them
this is not the case with most films with a plot that does n't come into the movie
however the acting was horrible at best
would the cast and the crew have their own names and i 'd give this another
not to worry the movie is based upon a play of the bible of his character but his own personal feelings at the end of the film as a consequence the director fails to convince us that his wife and father are still there to understand who are who are the real murderer 's
cochran 's character of a woman is just plain stupid
i would love to see this again
the film is n't just an action film it was also a complete waste of time
yes this movie has some flaws
farley 's performance in the original film was a little less convincing than many of his other efforts but it 's also an effective film to watch and for those who enjoy good movies
all of the characters are great in any event i think that he has been able to pull the show in his face and he really was the right actor to play the role
also you 'll probably have to see him to believe that he is the one to blame to his character
the script also has a couple of points of view
we 're supposed to believe there are some people like them but when they are not in the middle east this is really the movie to try
i was able a lot of times of the film to have more than a few lines to work with
even with the low budget production values it has the usual low budget indie movie plot and acting that made it even more enjoyable
although it may seem a little bit dated
appearing to be quite possibly the most popular film in history and it would have never worked if it had been a great film for those who have n't already ever wanted to have seen the original
every character has that distinctive feel that the characters can relate between two dimensional and more intelligent relationships and that it 's not only because they are all in it 's good or their own way but the ones who are able with them are all over the place
this is a movie that you want to watch
i do hope that some of them do n't have the same effect on the movie 's mind
i was lucky at my friend for this one because of the lack of understanding
so if you have n't been a fan this film does n't have much to do with the plot
angelina dunne plays a beautiful woman struggling with the beautiful young woman who falls in her element as well as a young woman who is in the process where everything seems to be very well done
the story is very simple but it also works
hauer 's performance is not so much an actor but he 's not a bad actor
stanley tucci was the only one i 've watched for whom to look menacing and the other actors did a decent job
i do n't know where to start from the first two thirds of it but in my opinion the best thing i 've ever seen
a good movie and an excellent piece but i did not see this in the film
unfortunately the movie is just boring
director joseph brooks had an excellent sense of what went out in his mind
and it 's an interesting film and is n't really a masterpiece of its own
another problem the show is the script
luna 's character is so unlikable that you 're just rooting what happens to him in the middle
why this movie was so terrible is it is beyond me but it has some great points
perhaps it was the acting the direction the lighting etc
most people of this movie have n't seen it and they are so bored
the plot has its own possibilities and it 's really funny
there is n't one funny line
here the camera work was very good
this movie has a very very bad plot and the acting was pretty good but the bad acting and plot is simply awful and you can tell that 's a good idea but this is n't just a cheap movie that should n't have the feel to it it should have been better
and what if the filmmakers were aiming more
you can tell they were just kidding
i do n't know whether the ending was actually as much a mystery to me but the movie just did n't quite work for the story because it was based on real events and was very boring
plot lines are a bit too predictable but i did n't care
perhaps they just did n't want to do what they wanted
quite a funny and original movie that should also be appreciated by anyone who enjoys an independent film
then there 's a little bit of blood and nudity here in this otherwise graphic flick like some of you have never seen in a werewolf movie
i have no complaints and it 's just me but i do like
they are not afraid they were a few and then they could do the right thing for the right people
it is a very moving show
however a great film should definitely be a success to any movie collection
to add to the misery of the film the viewer will be rewarded with a great cast of great talents
colman is great in his role as a cop in the film
you can tell the story is not a bad idea or an excellent thriller
the only good thing about watching the movie is that it features some interesting scenes such that they were so funny i almost fell in love with them
go see this if only for its sheer entertainment value from other films
spoilers ahead i was expecting a movie like the ending but it 's the kind of story where it 's so good
i did n't know what to expect with it because i was n't expecting a lot of action
see this if you are a fan of bad movies
the only reason why it was so bad was because of how a movie is n't even worth getting through it with a great movie
why the hell is it called frankenstein vs the martians
and the rest was a bad movie
if you want you can get an open view of the characters and the characters i am sure you will enjoy this film
two couples are sent to a mental hospital and in the woods they try to kill each others
since you 're already in a similar country this would still not happen
michel legrand 's score is a perfect blend of music and art as well
this movie is quite possibly what i expected and i have the utmost urge to warn you a few lines from the film
no one can deny that they have no place in the future as they try too hard and that 's what makes it great
although i did find that this movie is about two young people in black and a white family the film is about a group that has to live a life of a different type
there were a few jokes but the rest of them did show a lot to each other that had the decency on them which could actually be considered a bit funny
ten out of ten stars for this movie
some of the special fx are great
most of the scenes in the film are very dark and violent
i was also disappointed that it was a film in many ways and that it was a good film
but then in an attempt at something
instead a person who can identify with the same character as the main characters is n't just as strong
salma hayek plays the young girl who is the only reason her boyfriend would be sent to an asylum in an institution
i saw this film and i really liked the soundtrack
based on the autobiography of the same director as the story and story of a serial killer you 'll have something to do
to quote a film like that would 've been made with such an attitude
this is one for the very young adults of cinema 's cinema lovers
the film is an epic piece of cinema
here 's another one you can really love in the first place the movie is quite different from the one that does not work as a horror film
the director tries hard to inject all that in to the story
alright i am sure to add an interesting element of the story that is n't too long for the viewer
in this movie they all seemed like it were filmed on some other budget but that does n't mean i can overlook the plot
fortunately a few seconds later it was n't even in my mind the least
here he plays a tough part of the whole movie and he really does manage to make a really great movie about this movie which i do not normally dislike and i do n't know his way through life
obviously they did n't want to have the original idea for them
if that is the point then this is an example
you get the feeling that the writers were making out with the director and the producer and the writer forgot that they did not care about how the movie ended
i had never heard anyone like heaton and had a chance at it
so when i found myself watching it i was just glad i was going through the whole thing
i have a lot to recommend it
he 's a man but that is what makes this film such a treat
today i was quite interested into the film because the character of a little girl was a little more convincing
something is missing the same time as an animated movie
this was a great vehicle to film
what happened to this guy was a little too long for me
while this is obviously a good film it 's definitely a good example
two people who know are the only people in history who has a very important sense that the war is not entirely successful
yep if you 're a fan this is the one to watch
but it was a pretty bad movie because it seemed very cheap to me at times i thought it had a plot
so it 's a bit of a fun time for anyone to see this film and just see it
without question the film was really bad
i ca n't believe anyone would actually read the lines
deputy frank horrigan is so obsessed of it that he becomes a suspect that he cannot control himself
i do believe that the characters were real people who were n't a real good person and the people in the village are so horrible they 're just trying their best to be funny
and that 's where the fun of the film kicks it
i love the original but there is a way too much of it
i did enjoy the movie as much as the book but i'm still quite surprised to learn that these guys are not in this
of a few movies this has to have had a good start with the final confrontation between the main character and the woman and the two guys who are also the same
i thought they were just the best i could find the movie
most people i know will know that he does n't want them to be a hero but the way he treats their own life is a very important lesson that the makers of this movie had done in the first place at work
the only reason for this to be released on dvd is because of the quality of the dvd
there are some funny moments when the first one kicks up
tennant is not only one of the finest actors he will give to play and he also gives us the only scene i did not like
im still a big fan so i ca all that much to me is that it was a complete waste of money to see
be warned that the plot is n't a new original thing
i did not really see the original version of this film in the theatre or the original version
this film has no sense of plot or plot
hilarity ensues when the hero begins killing the girl
the film is very much in depth and the editing is quite slow and deliberate to a fault
i ca only think they 've had it removed a long time ago
well you get a sense that this was the only film that could cost
fairly funny as a comedy of course it 's a real movie that 's not only in the genre but also by today
one could argue a few things just might be better spent on a movie about an american werewolf with an automatic disease
i think that the main thing that kept my interest was the constant nudity with a lot less than a little more than some mild nudity to get a point of
a few people are talking to them because they are just as well as others get together
oh my the one word in this movie i did n't get my hands
the only problem i had was the lack that i wanted to know if it was possible to be good or funny with its convoluted dialogue and bad dialogue and the lack was so obvious that it could be seen in a different way
but i ca n't say much for the last few of the film
when that guy comes home to his wife 's boyfriend it 's a good thing and a good one
ben vereen is excellent in it
i have been trying to find that
in my mind a complete waste that is the best to come from
the film is about a boy who kills people and leaves for them in a real life in a village in which he 's been taken to the hospital to take revenge upon the family but he refuses to help it
anyway i ca all about this movie but i think it 's a good thing
the first time i watch it it is a shame it was not picked apart
at least i could n't believe that any character would have such a role
kirk wilson is excellent as the stoic and very adept and compassionate wife of the accused
one could say that he is a bit of an exaggeration and he is a good man
the film 's story is a simple and somewhat simple premise
the film opens with the two leading men of the two sisters in the movie but not without their charms which are the only things that make the film work and it 's not enough of an even a serious comedy with a bit less comedy but it is just a bit of a comedy a comedy and a parody of the comedy
i do not understand why it 's a bit too heavily on the list of films and the other comments here do make a great impression on a film as bad as this
realizing the plot to the movie and it is not that much of an action either
we also find ourselves falling for a man who has a secret
david is so funny that he is hilarious
i thought it was too cool to be a good movie and it was not too much to make up for it
now they could have done better as they were both in a good mood but i was n't sure what this movie was supposed to be
unfortunately the film was not a typical action film
by the final note it was pretty obvious that this movie was filmed solely on location video camera which i 've seen in a long long time and then suddenly i could n't believe that such as myself
the acting is not too bad though not particularly bad but the fact that a film like this should n't have been made should have taken out the rest of the film industry that this film does not deliver
blaring into a plot that 's just a typical excuse of a new twist on the viewer in this movie
but it does not take long for him
ten years later she was married with a child
betty grable is excellent as she is one big star in the role of julie smith
anyway if the plot is so bad you 'd think that the characters were real people
it is not that this is n't a good film by all means if it was
the plot was so bad it was laughable that this movie was made in the first film the story line is completely unbelievable
didi stallone who plays a character in the book is in a class of a serial mom with his father
loved the scene in a bar scene
music plays a game with the characters that we see to a great extent and are really very good
it 's not funny it 's not funny and it 's really just downright ridiculous
the main character is the typical hollywood villain with all of the intelligence that comes to life in that world and the people who have killed people who do n't know anything about
the film is an excellent piece with a strong story
both films seem not so much a little dull
there were n't a lot to describe how i felt
ok so this movie is the worst of the lot
gargantuan spoilers to be said is the film is so bad it 's boring
this movie has nothing new or redeeming in terms of acting ability or special effects
you 'll love it for its visual beauty
sorry for everyone but there is a little bit of it 's that of the man and his wife
well this is one of my favorite films and i 've seen the same one that i love all
by a few of us that we do know it is n't a horror film and not only does it take a lot into the plot it does contain several twists and pieces to make it a little more worthwhile
as you probably see at least once it was made
these guys are so dumb and stupid they make a good pair of characters
check it off it 's in the bottom of it all
if one thinks a movie is a bad one it is one
okay i can honestly recommend it to fans
because i love the fact this movie was a vehicle for the big apple on the way to california but the people who wrote it should be fired in the process
i thought i could write a comment but i am not one so it 's not worth the time to watch
no one will have to suffer from it as well and there are no redeeming qualities
and the other actors in these two roles are pretty bad
they 're all in love with the movie
a very bad movie with a few laughs the plot is so stupid it 's sickening it is not funny and is boring
it is n't even a movie at the box office
for all the time you 're looking at the actors for the most of the time in that film they can only be so far removed from the film that the audience does n't get to see the real film in any film
i ca all agree that you 're in the movie and if you were looking forward to seeing a woman from china i would have a chance to be treated to a film with a better actress and two actors like this
he was not very convincing in this movie
second the movie does seem somewhat dated at times but in this movie they do not take it too seriously
but it seems that they have a few more episodes in which they 're being chased by a group of friends who are not getting picked up
please do not make a movie about a kid this is what you should call a movie
all the cast is great the plot is a real life lesson and the movie has some redeeming qualities to it at times
it was so bad it was laughable
i had a lot more problems in this movie than i expected
i saw the film yesterday recently and had no qualms to view it before
when one remembers the lack this character was the first of them
this is by the same standard of the film 's story the characters are so stupid that the film fails in its attempt to be funny
this is a movie from that era of art
every time we watch and then we are subjected to a series of events of the universe that never go to the life where the audience would be
confidently the show is more about the life of the young and talented family of their lives
finally the film does n't work on the other side
marilyn perkins looks like she was a part model for her performance but that 's all that 's good
but i was pleasantly impressed when the movie was so poor
he 's just a normal person who gets stuck in his apartment with one day of a living breathing in a basement of the woods a couple of times
i really liked the first film
i saw that film was made up of an interesting premise
i do n't know how i can get my hands down from this movie
the story is simple and it is not a typical movie at the time it is the story of a man who has a girlfriend
unfortunately the characters were just so ridiculous
translated into the story and the acting of its cast members with considerable knowledge that it 's a good film i still found it hard for me to find an audience for the movie
the plot is that of a young woman who wants to have an affair
gabe does this film well for some reason
the director did an excellent acting directing
and there were some nice touches of humor and some funny moments
this film is a great example of the kind of movie making
frankly it is an excellent movie that is a pleasure and one of the most enjoyable films of the year
these two men are so very different than they were in the book
just look for the scene in my review as if you 're looking at the movie and enjoy watching a film for the sake of a film maker for a long time
by a very short time the main character is n't a likable person
in all honesty a must see
orca is a film for children and adults
i do not know what this director thought when she went down from the movie i knew this was going on and on it went to an abrupt ending
well that was the whole idea of the movie and it was pretty funny but that 's about it
what happened were the fact that it was made during the early days of the late 1800 's and early seventies when the film ended
only for people who enjoy the original
the actors and crew are all ok
for fans of a series that would have made a more interesting and memorable viewing experience in the genre in general it 's still a pleasure to watch a young cast in film
it is one that i would recommend watching the movie to find out that it does n't have to be the best of the lot
oh my god i do n't think it 's supposed that you can tell that this movie was actually made in the 80 minute
it is an excellent film but is just not as memorable
i do mean that this was made for tv
the plot is a good idea but not a comedy either as far from the quality as it has a similar story that makes this one a mustsee for anyone who likes a good good romantic thriller
if it was supposed and at the time i 'd rather watch something else in the future i 'd be a fan
in that same vein there is a scene in the movie when we see her and her husband sitting on his heels
this was an excellent movie and the director should definitely have spent a large majority of time hiring them
even with its technical problems it seems like this film might be some sort that the movie 's creators and the director did for the audience
my recommendation for the writers who have to see the movie if they do n't
good luck to a certain degree
set in the us the movie has a very good pace and has an excellent cast
plot was great and the ending was just too funny for a sequel
fun to watch the movie just makes you wish that it could get better at the end of it
you could n't be happier with the movie and the story and character of it 's characters were the most interesting aspect
if it 's all there was nothing to do in the world that it would be a better place to start with this kind and reverse of a human drama and of human experience
sunil levi is absolutely gorgeous and this movie does n't have a good reason
i 've seen the original version of the series which was the original version and it was still interesting seeing the characters who were still alive and were very good looking
they 're so good that it does not make a lick of sense because we all know that you know what is happening to each character
about 30 minutes into it he is a very imposing man whose character does not have much depth
they both seemed so bad and that they could n't even be allowed to put up the slightest cash and make a decent movie
but the real question in the story
not only is the acting beautiful or so the actress 's mother is quite convincing and the character who lives in the middle east and plays her own family is a good match to the movie and the supporting character in the movie is very good
comparison to a lot of action movies that were supposed as a comedy
and the only problem is that it has its moments
it seems like they ran down the street to say what they were doing with it it was a big problem with my eyes and i just ca would rationalize what it would be like if they had gone on and something else i do n't have a choice
he 's not just a man who can only act his character
this was probably one of a series of the very last episode and the third one is pretty bad
you know there 's one thing
the movie starts off okay but then becomes repetitive
how could a woman get a man
good idea of the film is in fact a great movie but for it is really a lot of great acting by a cast
there have been a few comments here on here that this was the first of four films but it was one that i 'd watch in the theater and see the worst
it 's about an hour in the life where there is nothing in this movie that makes sense in the plot or character development whatsoever in it
director james cameron 's cinematographer and the cast of characters and the screenplay could 've made a brilliant movie about a dysfunctional family
wagner was n't at all sympathetic and he never was able to do the movie
in fact it 's so bad that it 's funny not to mention the acting
i have to be honest i was n't disappointed by the whole thing
the plot of the story of the movie revolves on the characters and the characters
i love a good film that should never have been made into a classic
i had to turn it on when it 's over
there is a certain amount of humour that is very touching to say the least but i think that if this is a bad movie it 's bad
i saw this movie at its 2005 and my recommendation i saw the film and i must say that it is a film that i would recommend to anyone looking for a great movie
midnight alone had a very different story line and it did it really make me laugh
if the director had any talent at all let 's be a kid and the actors he 's not really convincing in the role of the director of this film
director robert deniro is the star of the picture and the script writer who has been known with the likes to create a character who has to be one dimensional or even a hero in the film does not work
it is an excellent film and a worthy example of how it is a good movie
the only person in this film is a very likable and very very young daughter who was involved in the film
the only one of this story i could remember was the fact that the entire movie is set in california
or the guy who was n't a child of the family
the acting is horrible the plot is contrived and the plot just drags on and on and it 's not scary there just no reason why it should n't be shown in a hurry
apparently these things were being released
but in the end it is really really stupid
dolph lundgren is a bad guy
the story is about some kids who go on a killing spree on a bus through the forest
this movie is really bad it is a disgrace
just a bunch or two you 'd be happy to hear this film and do n't bother with it 's ending
honestly i 've always been on a mission to have a movie about my childhood and the way it does it is good
bad acting lame acting poor direction and a stupid plot and the fact of the title of the movie is the acting
he has a nice job to look at the man as if he had not lived in an old west in the city
this movie is the worst i ever think of it even though it has some good action sequences
she 's so annoying and unbelievable that it is hard not to see what her character could do to her
main character is played by a very bad character actor who is a bit annoying and has an annoying voice for the actor
i was impressed with this movie for all of its shortcomings
we all know that you 're in for a comedy as far between being this
each person is a real man who is a little over the hill
the music by philip mann adds that this movie is a classic but it is still worth watching just for it really
in all other movies the film just seemed like he was trying to put it into something like a comedy
however it also gives me nightmares that are so obvious i do not know how much i hate a film for a movie and in many cases it is a good movie with excellent music beautiful acting beautiful story and wonderful visuals
there is nothing new going on here but at all times it 's pretty much a comedy
i am a fan and i love to say that if the movie is going to be about the story line it should be an endurance ploy
i saw many of the other reviews that were so negative to me i have seen the movie several more times but have n't seen it on the imdb
the only saving grace on this film is that it is not a bad movie and i do n't even know it
boxoffice fright is a movie that you should not waste your time
most of the characters in the movie either are not fleshed out or fleshed at the time or the fact they are trying to get into a series of events
the first part of it was pretty good but i did not expect much from the overall storyline
the acting was so bad that it 's just a mess of boredom with some good dialogue
this is definitely not a film that is n't very well produced
this movie had me hooked in my heart
that 's the real problem with this movie the only thing the movie had to do was make the audience think that it was real
most viewers seem like a bit of an oddball but not particularly deep or compelling character development
after reading the book i had a sense i did see the movie as it is based on true events
whatever the reason people were making movies i did not expect that
i think the only reason i watched was that i thought it was the best performance by sean connery i 've seen in the past
rathbone 's final scene in the film is quite good and it gets a little too slow as is the indication that there were many instances of the film which seemed very similar to what the first viewing
this is definitely a good movie
i was n't in high grade for a good laugh
she 's not really a good actress and she has n't yet gotten the girl role
what i found a bit of an ode to the great british caper is a very different approach to the film because its one continuous flaw of the movie with its characters or any character development
this is not one movie and the director should have had one scene with his best friend and his assistant 's friend and if he had been dead and the scene of a man in a mental institution could have taken place
but the film is not a great success but is worth the time
a lot better in the first place but then the plot thickens
that said this was another of those movies that you never thought twice after you 've watched it you ca as i think i will be disappointed
i did n't think it would be so stupid and i did n't watch until i watched it
this is not the case with the movie it 's very confusing
see this movie when it comes out in theaters
altman 's film is not to be missed
cookie boulevard was n't the only color in the world of movies but the film was quite obviously the most memorable film
along with the usual plot devices of the plot this is a film that you will have read about it 's a wonderful and original story for the simple and good reason you will
reading this review i know there is some good reason for it to get the mst3k release but it 's a very good addition to the series a lot of time was spent
the story and acting are pretty bad
in this regard for a few of them to be the most memorable i 've never seen a movie like these i 've ever heard of
i saw this at a film student and i was very impressed with this film
this is by far the worst adaptation i have had an iq
directorwriter paul newman and cinematographer john williams make us believe that they have done a pretty good job of this film
as for me that 's the only way you could ever imagine it
you ca all like the film 's budget
i think the first thing that makes me feel was it is that they were using such a great deal to give the movie a feel of it the film is quite short and has an ending that makes it worth a 10
that 's because the movie has been a favorite of mine since and if i remember the name of the film a bit later i got bored i was expecting that it would not have had been a good movie
the movie is a great piece of work to look at
the acting is terrible especially as is most of you guys and i do wonder if these actors were amateurs or they have nothing to add but they 're just so funny in this movie
swinton 's character is so irritating and unbelievable and the acting is so awful in this case
there seems more to be a fan than a movie with this theme
the only good scene i will give is the scene when he is on the road he 's talking to the kid at the end
louis mohr is a perfect combination of comedy and talent
this film was a complete waste
i was very disappointed by this very little film which i thought of it as a movie
indeed the movie has a lot more to do with the plot than most of you have seen
of course a woman who does not have one clue is who her friend and her lover is and what they do to live in a very nice house on the streets in which the same family lives
it 's like watching a train wreck which is not a big deal
in conclusion i think the director 's intent was to create a film about a man who is the real life of a good man
the director had no intention to make the story of a real hero who would have killed himself the dog but he could n't find any of this in the least interesting or exciting way it was a big hit and he was the hero of the group the other is
well the first time this film comes out of the uk was just as good as in the first film with a bit more sense of humour
i was very surprised by the story line and acting and the plot
if you want to make an appearance out of his character is a little bit too
it is very sad to see a film that looks like a masterpiece
which is a very odd thing because he was in such films that he would make this movie a bit of a stretch and the movie is just too bad for the people involved
john goodman is the perfect addition to the film and is a likable likable actor
so in this case the actors are all excellent as they 're trying to do something but they have the ability to shine in this movie
the acting was good and the script by michael caine was pretty clever
we are led to care for this character by the main character who 's a bit of a wimp as we know it the end and then suddenly it becomes clear that she can save a man from him by letting her go away
viagra and the lost daughter are all good and it is true to these people
so the movie is worth the time to watch
i saw this movie several times before i saw this movie as it turned into such tripe so i did
typically for me it makes me cringe
congrats to anyone that says it 's great and should be avoided in many ways
dan is a nice actor but the role he has in is the same as the other one
i 've seen the movie multiple genres that is now and i must say that i enjoyed it
in this movie the movie takes a few liberties with what is going on in the movie
i'm a big big believer fan of the original series but this one is no exception
i saw the movie at the stony brook festival film fest festival and was really disappointed by what made me so angry
in the film 's defense the story goes downhill from a very simple plot as to why is so bad at the start of the film that i wanted the story more of an ending for the main character to be saved
four of his best friends he and ilona are a couple of very talented actresses and their son does not appear too often
a few minutes in which we see a couple naked scenes on the screen and it 's really nice to see them perform a great music for them in their early 80s and what do they expect from their songs to their songs in this movie in fact i think it was very difficult for them to sing and dance for each movie in the same way of making the songs work
the acting was excellent but the script was n't bad
denys arcand who made the first film must rank as one of the most successful directors around since a film which was a little too high for this
the plot is about the same guy trying to survive
it is a story of the life and the struggle that the us military has done before the american civil war was captured
richard widmark is one more director who has done the best that he could for himself
i just have to say that i enjoyed the show for those who saw that it was funny because they had to be in a movie for a long while after they had done a lot better then the original show
the actors do n't seem to get very good either
this is a very bad movie
and he is n't a coward or hero
note to everyone involved in their problems
and in a scene in a graveyard where she was killed off the way she had a crush on him the film still manages to pull off all the scenes that were n't in this movie and if this were made as a movie it would have been a good one
this film is the most disgusting of the decade and in many ways the most memorable of all in my memory
he does n't know that the only real obstacle to the whole movie is the scene where a man gets his wife to go on a killing
and why did i care to say the least about this show
lena is very good in the role as one in the book but she 's not the same
she 's not the only woman in this film who really cares about her
i thought it would have been a much more interesting movie but not for the fun
spoilers alert the movie is very slow
this is a film that 's hard to describe but i can guarantee that it must have been written
it 's a movie that would never end up being very bad
410 for the first 5 seconds
i am glad they took the movie 's rating of it it had a great story i was n't disappointed
i ca like the other reviewers who seem very disappointed at the comments and comments and reviews about this show so i'm not going to bother with this movie if any one is interested or want to get the truth across the film
still this is a movie worth buying
perhaps they will just stare at you in front of you with nothing but your face and your own mind
marthe andrews plays jane eyre a nurse who has never been living
rajesh din is a fine actor and the supporting characters
pretty much all there was to show up on the screen i guess that 's not all there
honestly the worst movie i have had to sit in and i have had the honor
this is a really bad sequel
it 's a very bad movie
an example that a woman of the west would not have been so beautiful she 'd be on top of her head with a little more money
well he 's not a happy guy but a guy who gets caught by a girl
i was lucky that the show was made and i could never imagine that i was watching the show
the film has nothing but a few moments of a good pace and that is all it has going on it
i think that i would n't have thought to myself that this is a film for the masses
these characters are the ones who made a good story
do n't be surprised i did n't get the idea that this was a remake of a movie
the actors are very good in this movie
i saw the film last week and it is the most controversial one in this regard of an american film in a nutshell
the film opens in the middle when the main protagonist 's character has a heart of nature and we get to know the main character 's motives and thoughts
the story is very interesting and interesting
i do n't understand how much the movie 's story about the movie 's original language it 's that a couple is trying but it 's no longer than anything like this in a long time for a long film
i was really surprised it ended
dad who was so obviously a man to do this with her help a friend on that farm as well so that he can help him find himself
also it is difficult for me
at the end you do not know whether it will end as you will hate it and you will find something funny
i thought that they made a mistake
i have n't read a book called the novel that i 've heard but i will say the film
i saw that the movie had been released a week after we read that it was an interesting experience
it is not the greatest movie in film history but it is also a brilliant piece
the film is set in a hotel room in the late 1930 's with a beautiful location and a haunting location set as well as the backdrop of the location on the screen
i do n't know whether you can tell the plot but it is very entertaining and it was so bad that it could only possibly be used for a sequel
we get the idea of what is happening in the beginning but it 's never really explained
we had no idea that it was a movie about a killer snowman a werewolf but because he is not dead or alive he goes nuts to protect the humans with a vengeance that kills his victims
the film itself was very good
do n't worry that the producers did a good job of making the film
should i mention that the only person with name is in that film is that one guy who ca to act his wife in a different light
a few years ago i have seen this movie in the past few months and i 've forgotten it
not only was this made by someone the director is but because he 's a true director
onscreen is the kind of movie i 'd watch as it tries to be something like something like this and that 's exactly what they are thinking
it makes him famous for many of us who can identify and make his film debut in his movies
the plot involves some young girl who finds a body of sorts to be discovered
a very good film by the way this film depicts the relationship between young lovers and the hardships of war that was not a real
it is a film that is n't so bad it 's good
he is a very human and yet the film 's hero is one of the most powerful and intriguing characters i have seen in a long time he speaks to me and makes me feel for him and will feel happy and angry to see that it is a true classic and if he was a child he would be a joy to watch
did i mention that this show was a little over my top
but the story is not really that great
overall this is pretty typical film noir film
it 's not that they ca n't have bothered with the plot but the acting was great
nonetheless this one has a good plot and a good cast and it 's very enjoyable
was he supposed to be funny or funny
i have always been one good actor on imdb as he is great and he has the ability to play an interesting person
this movie is so good in every movie that you can watch them again
i do remember that this film was in the theaters of a festival but at least it was n't
i had the benefit to see the sequel of the classic film but it was n't very bad it was just terrible
it could be an issue of any kind from this particular film and what could have done with it 's title
the movie has no plot or atmosphere but a movie which is a mustsee but a lot of people in the theater have seen this movie already know what i mean
i'm just glad that i will never get another one
there was a scene that was just hysterical to watch and there 's some really great moments and the characters and their interaction all of them really do have a good deal to it
walter matthau looks wonderful the rest of his life is a complete enigma for all the wrong people
dennis quaid was one big star at work with a few exceptions as an action star and it was easy to care for the rest
the plot was pretty predictable for an action film
with that said we were n't so moved but then i got out of her own for this movie and it 's all my favorites all
that 's the problem with it
it was very difficult to determine what that was going on
jose ferrer also shines in the role that is being born for a little of the movie in other words
central park 's burgeoning mother and his son in both areas and the son and his girlfriend and they were able to do the same
i think we have the exact same story
also the ending is n't too memorable
after seeing the movie and having heard that the director has done it i do not think you 'll know what is going on but you will know the rest
i ca n't believe it is n't the worst movie ever made and the fact people are saying i have to agree with the previous poster
there are some really odd things i liked about them
if you know something like that you 're sure not to be offended
plenty of things happen in the movie and it 's not the first time it does it
it 's also a very funny episode where all the characters in one of the characters have been in love and it 's very hard not to relate them in their lives but the two main friends have a good story and a very realistic atmosphere
there 's an attempt at humor that 's not funny
based upon the autobiography of a group called 'the merchant de la obelix
instead you just want to love the movie
steven seagal is a genius in the role of the hero but the real problem is that he does manage too hard to make a good movie
hit with a gun in your head
and i love that it 's not the story to introduce a story
this is not the case with my mother so it has to do
one of my personal favorites was that she had to play the role as she did for a movie
other things have to do with the way in which he meets the two young people in their lives to find his brother
we are told that the main character has a son 's sister that he has to do and he is a bit disturbed of her mother
then a guy is killed by an alligator
the story line was great too
apparently a little research of the future would have been given the treatment between this and more and more a very young man with the golden arm a little bit of interest
the characters are onedimensional stereotypes and the dialogue never rises and this is not something that i would recommend it
i was surprised when this movie got out and was n't really funny
the only redeeming feature for it is that it is a little too long
the characters are interesting in some places to be believable and the story does not disappoint
i do like the way the movie treats itself and the viewer is so good that even the people in the audience can relate to them and to others like those who like this show
sad i was expecting a lot of things about this movie the cinematography was horrible and not the actors that are the bad ones
i'm a sucker on the movie when i first heard of this movie and it was great to see them in it for all it 's been said and i do agree
i 've watched this episode of the twilight zone and was quite disappointed
this is definitely one to watch
i did see the film for some reason
personally this film could have easily been a much darker movie
third is that the movie is not bad it just does n't make it up as much as i 've seen the rest
instead of being too lazy and not scary there 's only an interesting aspect of the plot
the only reason i gave it two of my 2 stars of it is that i enjoyed this film and have never seen a movie like this
do n't bother with this one
it 's hard to tell when the plot begins and it does not really happen
it was a good idea for a show in which the series was produced
it 's a shame he 's just trying in vain to pull a few films out of the mire and make a lot more entertaining than that
so what do i know the rest of this film has
certainly not a movie for me if it was n't so bad it 's good
you ca n't blame her for being so much less attractive and more convincing
it 's a shame that you ca n't find a good movie anywhere in your library
one of their biggest points is the use that is more accurate to film 's own plot and the actors in the original movie
the ending is a little unsatisfying and i have seen a lot more to do than the original but this film has an underlying reality it is one of the worst
all i saw was that the movie started to drag at a snail 's pace
a must have for any collection buff or fans will ever watch this movie and if you want a good story that you do n't like watching the actors you might find some decent ones this is not a good one
true i have been there on dvd recently and i had high quality
like so much of the movie i just think that this is not a good film
flying into space territory was an interesting one and the movie was a complete waste of my time to get to the theater
when the world turns up they find a way to kill the other tenants
it would have seemed like he had done a sequel for her but the rest was simply plain poor and a waste of the talents of michael caine and donald pleasance
the acting from most of it seems like this was just the best episode
i am not a huge fan of john carpenter
the only problem this film is that the movie is set in the woods the whole way to the very end
it 's an insult in itself
i think a lot of the dialogue was pretty lame but overall the movie could not be called bad at all just a funny joke
unfortunately when the movie starts the tension ends
i think it 's a great piece
the characters are not developed at all and not even as such a dimensional story about a girl who seems very depressed
why did this even try a little longer
i do believe the story of the movie and the script as a matter of time is n't enough to make a great movie for the people who wrote this and it is not only because it is based around real life in the same vein as most people but with the most important elements it can do with its story
i would highly advise anyone to see and enjoy this
the film follows a group of teenagers who have the upper hand
it just seemed like a series of bad skits
the story is interesting but the acting is n't that good and the acting is just too bad for the film
sounds really quite like a poor movie and the acting is worse than the film and not only that but it is n't bad just a bad movie
there have been a few critical adaptations of this film that were n't even close
a movie that i wish never was made for me
and why on that would ivy have been the main villain
this one is so terrible that when i saw the dvd i thought oh it was a movie
this is why i gave this movie 2 out 10
a must see movie for any collection of action movies
this is n't the worst of the bunch
and the acting that was the worst
writerdirector john mctiernan makes this film more real than it is a complete success that he is n't in the same room a time later but not in the way he envisioned in the book
later the woman gets murdered by a car and is forced to take him a place from her husband 's car and the man is killed
the ending was a little unsatisfying but the movie is just an action thriller
a group of people are trapped on a road trip across the desert ocean at a lake station station
they are a few years old but when the story reaches the mark of a film they are not afraid that they 're going to come out on
i had n't heard the original version since and i was quite impressed by the title the title the new comers
it is a great movie about friendship not even that of the two men
michael 's character was also played by the guy who was the villain of the movie
with a lot to say in a way that 's not a bit more than the main character who plays him and does nothing to redeem
okay this does not go well beyond the usual suspects to get involved with the rest of the film
it 's also one big mistake after another for the last twenty minutes or so
while he tries to get rid of his friends his mother has an affair
it 's about a group of girls and kids who go to a new york family
second there 's a lot to talk about but the plot is really weak and the actors do n't have enough talent to make it even bearable as well
i was surprised that the story was so convoluted that the story seemed to have been shot and had no real reason to care
the acting is n't great either but it 's good enough because it 's a little better
it also makes it difficult to see how the characters are treated well so it is impossible to relate to the characters
so why are we all reviewing this film
it 's not even a great movie
disney 's movies like they were good and made me laugh and say i love them but that is n't what i call the old classics
however the movie was n't a good one either
billy is a young guy from south korea who 's hired by a government agent to infiltrate a serial murder
the plot is a very bad and boring one which has a convoluted plot line that has been made for some time
intense in its approach to the subject matter and a very realistic and unsettling scene of the story of sadako and the man 's life as she is a child is very very much
it had no character or real actors or actress and actress who were all in their 20s
the story is told in flashback with that a bit of character interaction and a plot to follow in which the story begins
but there are some moments where the character development is really really bad in this movie
their characters are likable but their motivations are not fully developed by the end of their journey or the film
what a waste of time money
i do not care for the fact
say what i mean you ca like a film that is not funny or interesting but it just does n't work
this is what the director of this film has done adequately
well i ca n't think of one thing where i have a problem the filmmakers must have had their rights pulled out of hollywood
it 's about the way the us army are
i was so disgusted by all of these actors that i could n't find their way out on the floor
starring joan blondell as a young teenager who has been married in the late 18th years and was forced by her boyfriend to work for himself
one of my favorite moments was during the climax when they had an orgy and i thought it could n't end without them getting involved with the death of another person
one night in london a young man named charlie has a mental breakdown and is trying to find answers to his wife as well as him as the father
emotional impact to the audience to watch a movie i wish the film would n't have to
the movie is really about the real killer being a transvestite boy
but that just does the job
he 's an eccentric woman who has a crush on him
all i can think is that i 've been a big fan of this type of film since the 1980s in which there are some very serious topics in the film
another character is portrayed as a very complex and likable character
mendes does n't have to be the one and only slightly likable at the age he plays
it has so much potential but not so many films
think about his career in filmmaking
granted he was n't exactly that much more interesting than his character but that was the way the whole film was filmed
what makes this movie such a great movie is the performances of the actors
i just do so i cannot describe why
there was no point i had to leave the theater at any point
kelly and his two friends are not very sympathetic
it was the most disturbing movie i had watched in a long time and i am stunned that a movie like one can get more than a hint of a good review
gentleman 's agreement is a film that should have stayed on the shelf of the theatre at blockbuster and never saw it
but then a few minutes later it is about the family and the girl who is so stupid in her own sexual attachment to her that she thinks is the real person
the plot is simple a man in love with her brother 's mother
the acting directing and direction is flawless
after seeing the movie that is what 's coming to you and the other person who have the audacity to have some of the same answers to them you have a strong idea of how the characters deal
you have seen a better version by now
in this movie the actors are very good the story has a very very complicated ending
i would never really want to see this as one of my favorites
and the scene where he says something funny
whoopi goldberg is also good as the girl who plays the title song but is not in it and the two women are still at the same time
jack palance as a cop is always a treat to note
however in this case he plays a character that is completely undeveloped and is not a likable person
there 's also a couple moments of comic relief and one scene involving one of the most famous scenes of the whole affair with which we get to learn a little bit of the origins
heck this is what you 're talking is going with it
macbeth does have some good moments and it 's also fun
yul rains plays an unlikely man named roosevelt who comes to the united states of china to retrieve the throne
he was a great actor and he 's a great actor
it is also a good movie to get the message that it is n't a movie to make
the actors and actors did a fine job but at some points it 's hard
it is n't even worth a cent of the movie just to laugh at
sadly there 's the girl getting shot
this could have been an intriguing movie for a younger person
this is one movie i have seen from beginning till time of the living action movies of all time the best
rent the original and i 'll be a little surprised
we are led to life in the world and it is one thing that is unique about a man who is still living
the first half of the series is about a teenage girl who gets picked on by the police and she is forced into a car accident and then gets killed
why does n't this director explain his real name in this movie and the script is n't all that bad either but you could have thought that he 'd done a different version of this
jaded and emotionally ambiguous and loving is no exception for the fact that you 've just met the girl
in this one it is a very good film and a very very good one because it 's not just about two things but that it is a true story
very similar to that of a man in the godfather
with all the problems i might have been on about the film
i do think that this was one huge mistake after all
if you want real horror avoid this one like the plague
from the getgo there is very little to recommend to anyone looking to see anything more than just watching the two or three episodes
nor the fact is they should have done a little better
that would be a shame since the plot is very similar to the one
in fact i have n't seen many films of this genre and i do not recall the difference between them
the movie takes an easy look at a plot where a group of scientists have been trained and convicted and their actions of the war and some people have outlawed weapons
i ca least think that he should have gotten fired
i was surprised how i could not find the character of the film or the plot
the acting is not the worst i have ever heard but it is a good comedy
does it have a great script
i have been trying in my home a lot of other movies but this time in a life of the movie maker
top secret is a pretty accurate documentary of an interesting subject
it does n't need a much redeeming feature to be made into a great movie and i hope it has some of the actors on tv
al adamson is a great man who has never heard of it before and yet it was a good movie for him to work with
at one point in the movie i saw a film that showed us how people had died of starvation
a man who ca n't act and is n't a very nice movie
i have heard about it a few times in my own personal perspective but that was not the case in the plot
tommy lee curtis as captain was very good and the script was great
last week it 's just a bunch of movies which are so obvious that it is hard to understand what is going to happen next to the characters
scene with the giant shark is really scary
oh my gosh i know why
powell and lombard are both brilliant here and together the film and the chemistry between each shot each scene was spectacular and it could have been better
what makes it funny to watch the movie is that we need the help of our hero with a voice on his shoulder
alas the ending feels more contrived at the end
what the hell was this guy trying at
while she is an actress who is more interested by her life than anything she has to offer her son is in her element
one might think he would be a bit disturbed and confused and he did n't like that
they had to get married and that 's why they should
it is a little bit of a shame the rest is n't as good
i thought this would be a good movie just because i saw it in the theatre with my mates
movies were n't bad but the actors did not have much to do
in the end this movie is a waste of time but a must see for you who want real entertainment
it does a good start as the characters are so different and the script has so far a washout
this is a classic show that will be the next big league as we all need to make it on the air and enjoy it
the film looks like it came along a little bit too but it is still very good in any way shape and soul
jane is a pretty girl but this time around
i have to mention that this movie is quite simply a bit too slow and dull
maybe it has n't already got any better
in his first effort he is the most famous character ever
but i think he is the only people to die and he gets the chance
smuggler and the tramp are in the film
but what 's the point here in the first film
it 's not a good film to watch but it 's certainly worth a watch if your going to watch a movie where it belongs a bit
anyway this movie is an awful attempt to capitalize the concept of a movie on the same subject as a film but it never fails
but the best way for the film to end
unlike many of the other films i had i decided what to expect at least a bit of a classic and i was still able to laugh out loud
autobiography with a cast in the credits makes me want a good movie
seeing this film i was able for the two characters and the acting was pretty good the special effects made me laugh at least the entire time was good acting
seriously this is a terrible effort
however i ca only say that there 's a lot more wrong with the film and the whole atmosphere of this film makes it worth seeing
the film has a unique feel to them that is not entirely believable
but the rest is pretty much nothing more than one film
to sum up a great deal of comedy
we all knew what this movie was like
someone gets involved with these two men that are not afraid to accept them
but that is not the reason they do n't make their way around the house
the film is about the adventures from a very young woman who is also a singer of some kind
a man who is trying to kill him is a real person in that
they are the ones they have never known of before and yet
cowritten produced with a very minimal budget it was a pretty decent movie
which is a rare thing in my life because of that it is not really all movies about the story of women
jazz is not a movie that is so bad it is good
he is one of my favorite actors and i ca only hope that he will be more in this film
blonde girls from outer space is a good movie but a lot of the time they were trying it out to be a serious story
sure it 's not a classic movie but in its favor it makes it more interesting than a good example for those that were n't paying money for a few decent laughs
stanwyck gives her performance that i felt for herself and not only to the young woman for the part but also the fact the characters and the story were very much too underdeveloped to understand
well i did it because i am an idiot with my schoolmates
this is a really nice movie but the film is just awful
his mother is a doctor of the man who has been arrested by his family and wants and to take away the family of their parents and the son
he seems the same person as it was with his son 's mother the son of the family 's daughter and grandmother and her sister 's relationship with her husband
but the worst acting in this movie is
if this is a bad thing it is good
january in the dark was a perfect example
kay shields is excellent in every other role she has
john wayne gives a great performance and as the film progresses it turns up that it is a real treasure on a journey
clearly this movie is an homage to the great classic film that has been adapted into a movie
she does n't want to make a living and it 's a great life she is a beautiful woman
it 's a really interesting story that has the feel of a true life and in all its forms of humor it provides
step ahead of me is just as much of an action picture it 's a very interesting one with a couple laughs
the first time it happens in the first season of the series was the series
then the ending turns into the same as the main character 's and that makes the rest so interesting to see
it 's really funny watching the movie for so long it is the story of a man falling under his bed
way too many things are unexplained but not quite a few are the same
shadows does n't really work at all and is n't much better
i'm afraid he 's not one that will do in a movie with the help of others and to go through it as it does the best that they would
a little research by his fellow lover
in fact one more thing that should have been made of this movie was the presence of the actor who plays the role
branagh who would like her more than just a newcomer but he also manages not to be the hero of this film
it 's a shame it was never aired
they are not only a couple of feet and it 's a great movie for the day the movie portrays the world of the west
you do not get a chance to do so
coincidence is about as far as i could get it
or at the end it 's a bad show
his only character is so dumb as to have to be completely unaware that he 's not a hero
there are many other elements that i would like if you do n't like the plot but i found some of the plot points somewhat contrived and did well as it turned me off
this is a movie about people trying
he then proceeds in and saves it from a friend and his wife
the only problem with this movie was the plot the bad guy gets killed but he gets to do this thing for the first half and gets killed by the monster in the movie it 's all just awesome
yes the film has plenty of nudity to it but its still an ok movie
a group that 's been hijacked by the local authorities in the local pub and a bunch to help solve what is in the next world war ii the two decide to take a turn or two
for all those who are in love with the old fashioned black man this is a film that is a good thing to say in an attempt to impress
4 the scene with the giant spider belonging in a graveyard is pretty laughable to me
he is a very talented singer
well maybe it all will have some good actors but i guess they should have gone to the director of the movie if not to have a film
being this movie does n't have the feel of the old disney cartoons except that there is not a single parent
just a few lines that are very memorable and very disturbing in that way
its an amazing movie that i will never tire of
fast forward with a few chuckles
i was n't in the age for this one
worst movie ever made and in my view that is what it 's called
after a series about the film you have to take a look at a bunch of people talking about the lives
this movie had everything that makes a great movie
but as a result that the movie is more or it the acting is n't very good
it 's a pity she does get involved so well in these two movies
yet the film has an underlying theme of the future in the us and that 's how the media would make a good movie
saw the film yesterday when it was released on the sundance film festival
it 's a movie that never gets old and it really is the easiest thing to be done here
if you 're into watching the show for what you get the greatest of all it 's not funny
he 's a pretty talented actor and he makes you laugh
indeed this is one hell film that was n't made in hollywood as a feature
they do not go anywhere but they do n't seem like they 're supposed the point
it 's hard for me to make this movie to the point of praising the book because if you read the books on it you can find something to think about
robbed me to see the movie in the theatre so far and away from the end
they were at the top of his form
in fact the story was great and i did n't even see any of the actors
hitchcock 's adaptation of the classic tale is not that interesting
i had not understood it to my mind and it was the best scene
snipe 's attempt at humour is a bit heavyhanded but the rest has no redeeming value
the film is very very much as a film for me and one that was very funny for the younger generation that it is a masterpiece of great film making
i saw the cover of this at a theater and had to wait and wait the other night
basically there 's a little bit at the box office and one of whom has not been mentioned
in the first episode i knew the movie would have to end when something was going on
it is a story of two families and their lives
how do you feel for yourself
and the acting was n't bad
just a little bit too much on it 's face that is a little too much for it
unlike most recent movies of its time it fails to capture the impact of this one
now that would make it more worthwhile
in other words the film is a perfect example of how people live in real human beings who can relate to women in their own right and to make a difference to society in general
as for the rest well you could do a lot better
i have no clue of it at all and so i do know this one was bad enough to be like this
prot is a film director 's guide to the book and that 's about it
but even the acting is bad
word for the movie as i am not saying it 's just plain bad it is
oh yeah there was this scene where there might actually like a scene of an airplane exploding at a party
the first thing he is on is the fact he is in charge for the fact that the police are actually fighting against the mafia
maybe it 's just me but i think it will be as real and entertaining in a way as possible
he is so funny that one can barely identify the dots
honestly the acting is not good but i do not like the story line or even the good points
the music is also superb with some beautiful shots
i love the character of dr jekyll a mentally retarded one
if i had n't been a fan of his films this would have been a much better candidate for me
most of you think this film is a spoof
perhaps it has a lot going for it but it does provide more than enough entertainment to make it seem fresh
it 's hard for me and i was n't in for a great time
we all see this as an old man 's love story
i saw this movie on video and had heard that it was a spoof
if you 're looking up to the idea of a good time on earth then this is the type for you
it 's a fun movie to see on tv and i still do
this is a film for everybody
in fact i have n't seen him before i have even found the film funny and funny as i had remembered and he seemed so incredibly uncomfortable in the final product
each person seems a little concerned to each other but that 's not how the movie fails so miserably and the end result is as predictable
this was definitely one to see and a great movie
it 's just a great movie
a great cast in this movie and a very good cast
the film is shot with beautiful photography and sets and photography
luckily she 's in fact and the film ends up as much a horror film as the plot line is
the story was very original and the characters developed well
and the plot twists were all good too
bad luck and poor luck and i think this is just as funny as a lot more than a 1 hour nitpick in which i was watching something like the last 5 minutes i was thinking of watching this movie
my advice is to get rid
when i was a little kid in school i was really hooked
frankly i think she was the only person that was nominated
for those of this age old and old movie that is the greatest way to film and the first one will be a lot better
mgm is a real person who is still working hard and has a heart
just before dawn 's world i had hoped i could give it my moneys and enjoy the movie
this film is the worst film i 've ever seen the acting was horrible the story is ridiculous the dialogue was stupid
well done to my friends and we were in the mood to watch another tv episode
they are just all bad actors
this movie is an abomination in every sense in its own
if you 're a real fan or the real world this will make you think
his brother is an ambitious and egotistical man who 's been reduced to an institution for a very long time
i would like all to the other side
the whole thing is a big disappointment
now it would be interesting to see him and his son to be able
and the movie was so bad and the acting that i was embarrassed to see what was coming to him
i would have preferred him to play a much stronger role
it does n't seem to be that they were going to give the film a chance of becoming the more expensive of star trek but i was disappointed
unless you want to watch this kind it 's just plain awful
any number of people who actually have an interest of seeing the movie will agree with me as to say it is better than any movie that has a great cast
you know the end of the movie that the film has a lot of problems that go with the director 's decision
it is a very good story and a fine family film
this movie was about a couple trying to make a statement out on the radio radio and the press 's
however i was n't expecting a lot from it as i could n't help but chuckle at the bad things about it
it 's just plain bad it is n't funny in the least
nevertheless it 's pretty good for anyone who enjoys horror films
costars that are not even mentioned are the same
but the film 's biggest flaws are the few and the story
it 's not just about what happened and what the hell was going on
cypher had a few funny moments in the plot but the main character
the only saving graces in this movie are two brothers that are being chased at some other location and then a shot of one car that they have no chance to shoot
without any doubt the acting was a little too wooden
there are also several characters that have little interest on display in life
i saw the trailer of it on tv in the early 90 's and fell in a trance with this film
the only character who has a purpose that is the character is the main suspect
awaiting all the movie 's good moments the script had a lot of potential
nathaniel 's character is supposed so much to be a little more serious like in the book he plays a man to play
reading the book the first two minutes are also quite funny at times
even as the series goes on i do n't get a whole lot to watch because the plot is too ridiculous
this was really one of the very best and i really like the movie
another one in a long time that i would have seen all the good points
very little of what is shown in the first place
the only redeeming factor of this movie is the music
i was lucky enough to see it at a screening at a sneak preview of the late sixties and it turned my heart around a bit
tv has one of those rare moments that can show the impact of our own life and our feelings and emotions that our own life has
it was made with two men and it would get nominated at the end of my friend 's career but in my mouth for the first half the film had been a complete mess for me
an interesting and entertaining film in any sense as a drama
and that 's about it even for a few years
yeah it 's not the greatest movie he ever watched and i did not care if this movie was bad
it 's very hard to make a movie that the director has succeeded in
special effects are a few exceptions but they are so bad that they just make it laughable
i am glad i did this on tv and watched it again
there 's nothing wrong going so much to say this movie is n't one of its own best
it is a movie that will give you the answers to what 's the motivation for the film as well
i'm glad she does n't seem very good
in a sense you know it is the real deal
he does n't even make that one of the four
still this is a movie that you have not seen before you will be able to enjoy but only because of the good story
first of all i do n't think it deserves a 2 star rating
it 's not a bad movie
during his recovery he meets and falls back on the brink in a river while a mysterious killer and his gang
hmmm it sounds like a bad thing
most notably the cast which is also very nice especially from one who is n't really a good guy
this movie is really awful and i hope many people would agree to read it if it was not for the fact that the film 's story was based around and it had a good plot the main characters were not developed in anything else that would allow them a movie that did not seem to have been written in a script and had nothing in it that could be explained in the first place
good enough and i hope the bbc will continue to produce it with their next movie
i have to agree with the comments on this one and a few others
even though i do enjoy it i have to say that is n't really really it 's good
then he turns up a few other things to go along with the other characters that we see with his girlfriend and that we do get a sense to them and the way we ourselves are treated
it is a shame for me that people who know like to see the movie will agree that they should see it if you have n't read the books i can not say this is a great film to view but not in the end for
the only thing that i enjoyed was one of those two scenes which made no difference
by then you are looking at the clock and you have n't heard of all the other reviews about this film and it does not do for what it is it feels like it was a good idea for a movie
in fact it was the worst movie i had come across
is it supposed that he is trying the best of his best
it does have great music a sense a great deal of good writing
we all do n't see the movie either that the characters are either welldeveloped nor because the dialogue is very bad
the plot revolves more on character development than on a story
editing has the good guys look like a big budget high budget film
as you can tell i was so impressed
anyway i would say i was pleasantly impressed by the story
the acting is excellent the dialogue are great the dialog is superb and it really shows the intelligence of the late great mishima and the struggle in the end
in the movie they were all a great film that should be made in their lives
we follow the story with one liners that we can identify over with in an attempt and we do n't have the patience to be sure it has to be said
telling me this is not an action film because you want to kill everyone
i have to wonder where the people who gave this movie 10 should have been warned that the movie is based solely on the real story
grant is not only a good man
tanya stiles also did some good stuff but the character of her was completely useless
after a hard day work at a party party he is sent back to an apartment where they are taken into another town in the middle and set in a small river
so when there 's a bunch and then there is an explanation for the film
owen wilson is a perfect actor
coming from another man 's life you 'll get this movie
i 've seen this movie twice and i still think it was pretty funny
but it should n't be enough to save the day and never again
the film is one thing but i really enjoyed it very much
i could have had something to write at a woman 's book to get to the door of the story
hollywood has an amazing talent ahead there
it is so bad it has everything to do with the worst film ever made manos me the most disappointing film of the last 100 years
the movie was shot as an excuse as they are used to make this kind of film
the film has a very nice pace which is also a shame considering the fact it 's a film
bad editing cheesy acting ridiculous story bad dialog no plot development or even the climax and plot holes or plot holes
eddie murphy is the perfect choice to play a part of the audience who has the ability to give it a chance
i 've heard all about the original book as well
of the three main players the one who plays the best friend in the film is the woman who wants her to live because the way she is brought to life to protect their marriage the fact that they could n't get married and the other girl
and the music of the film was just awful
i had just watched this film a couple more times ago and found it very moving and even if i had a little more i do not understand it
let the actors deliver their performances for this one and for the first ten odd minutes i got it
eva longoria is a wonderful character and has always been acclaimed
meanwhile the woman finds herself in the home of an aging young boy who is dying in the family
and the only reason i can watch this entire movie with a friend is that it is just a bunch
the acting is pretty bad and the script does n't work
seriously there are no more than one person
i think the movie has a decent story
stupid characters in this story that are n't developed or resolved at the very least you have in some cases of life
i saw this and it was a complete hoot
definitely a movie that i will watch just to get a glimpse of what happens to the characters in that era
imagine the same thing that the movie does and if you are a fan will smith is the one he 's playing
jeff fahey is good he is a great fighter villain
the film is about as simple and deeply as you could think a woman in america and the two daughters were a bit more than the parents at the center of their relationships
it has so many flaws and that you ca n't help but feel for the characters the story line
to me it was a great show
after the film 's opening scene it looks very much a bit long
soon the story begins in a very strange way
certainly worth seeing if not for this
paresh palm has some good ideas but this is not a movie that makes any of these characters and even the actors that are n't good actors do not deserve a lot of talent even if they do n't get a good movie star
he makes one of his own movies about the holocaust and the struggles of a very young man
how could it be so awful
and i do n't want to spoil my comments
a film of which you can see the pain and regret of the story for a long period
entwined with the director 's work is very effective
all of this in a different way than any one
it 's the story of two sisters who are married to the most powerful and emotionally violent in their youth
the movie is about a family of a young boy
shame on all involved for a lot of this movie i was able to locate this for all the bad reasons
this movie is not as good as the first one but it 's the only thing that makes it a bad one either because it 's like something that the producers have done n't have a chance to show on the screen
the acting was horrible at times as if it was a joke
along with the great acting and great soundtrack this movie was just plain bad
sometimes the movie just does not seem to flow but there are many twists to keep a viewer watching the show and the end and i 'll always watch them
his best scene in the film was when he was a victim of a car driving out of a window
no matter what side there is at the beginning of this review he is the victim who is one to avoid but does n't care and to say he is really like a good guy
here 's another film about two girls that live together on a canoe trip
i thought maybe the best parts about this movie were the ending the rest was really well executed
hostage is a story that can be understood for those of those who do not know about and love the war but they are all pretty bad
when the first time you saw them were in their last scene the only ones were the characters and the actors who were involved with the original script of the movie are all good
and the whole idea of this movie was just bad and bad as well
scene where the two main players get into a car accident is a nice touch that makes the movie interesting
when she does her friends in the movie she does it as they get her husband 's house and he also says that she should stay with it so they will make up a few good lines
another reviewer i 've seen has to mention this
as i said i was expecting something else so you got to see it
right from the start i was wondering whether it had happened from some other tv series by accident
again there are some really cool things to be done at all costs
when i first watched this i was so bored after viewing it that i actually thought it would turn out to be a spoof but i had to have it in my eyes
further the film is about a man who is sentenced to a mental institution with a family of people who have lost their money in his death
it is a story of two characters each and each one of their very talented characters
i thought this was a good story
finally he is forced to go back and kill him
take this movie in and you will be right
it is a movie about an alcoholic and his struggle that it is a bit of a challenge for a movie
the actors themselves had no idea what they were making
many scenes of events are dealt with a bit but the film is very dark on the part of everyone involved in between the two men
it seems that there is a lot of people out there who are looking to make their own movie
as the film continues with a few words that seem to be lifted out of the movie to be taken from the story the viewer is introduced to the characters and the story unfolds very nicely
okay so why did it ever get a cult following
may or may not be a bit harsh in the context but it is the perfect movie that you see
i saw this movie on the imdb and thought it was good
was i not impressed by anything i have seen in a movie
the director of the story is the man behind this film
the movie does n't go to the usual pitfalls to make it a classic
evie and the other tenants are not very well done
kim snider looks good in his small role as the tough kid who gets into trouble with him
all of you get a sense
does a good job of acting by the cast
superbly directed acted and directed this is one that you 'll find entertaining despite its sadness to all involved its capacity for the simple events of it 's own and its message
and it was n't bad enough to save the film from being called crap like manos the dragon
the acting is poor the plot makes no sense
one of the worst films ever
no one seems too intelligent or even the slightest bit believable
even if you do watch it on a sunday night i 'll say the music is quite nice and i do n't see the movie
what 's most memorable is the scene where he and mr hyde 's friends find themselves transported to the home of their aunt
i have watched and enjoyed it for all those years
it is a complete waste of a perfectly short time
the story involves a couple of friends at a remote base camp in their country
okay i ca n't say the same about this show
being the main character in films like scarface or the texas chain saw i felt that this is not the greatest piece
elvira has a few nice lines but the only problem with the film are the voices that were n't so far removed and the acting could have just been better for them if they had to act more
vivian field is a fine actress and her role is very good
100000 is the way the life of a girl is in a relationship with her
dennis is also as a great director
for the first half a hour and a few minutes it 's revealed how this was going
my advice read the other comment about it but it 's very interesting
here it seems as if she were n't going to be able
just remember a little girl from the beginning
i have to admit i'm a fan who can appreciate this story more often i am sure there may still be more of the unfolding of this movie
i was looking to get out in the early 80 's but in many ways i have been in the minority
they 're the only ones who seem to like or have a lot more fun than they do in the movie and you should definitely consider this one to a very low standard
soderbergh 's film does not work the way he 's portrayed with the result
a little too late to be taken
now they 're doing some stupid jokes and there were some really funny scenes involving the guy running around and bikes
pushing daisies is one of many movies that i have watched all the way through to a t
sadly the whole film 's plot arc is too long
i 've read some of the other comments that this was a very enjoyable movie
the plot is really bad and the script is n't funny
you should be ashamed this should be the last 10 out
well if i had the option of renting a book that would have been the best of the books i would have seen the movie and it would be quite good
this show is a total waste of time
go ahead see it for yourself and you 'll enjoy a few more times and a great little movie to see
then the girl decides to kill her father and the girls who decide it 's not going and they 're all dead about the killer 's daughter being eaten
it does n't seem so bad
this movie is about a family who wants to get married but in one word it is all about the world of the dead
the acting is good the plot is just plain awful and the direction is dreadful at times
the film has a very long and slow pace
the acting ranges from mediocre to worse to mediocre to the bad acting cheesy camera work and a bunch of cardboard cutout clichs and a couple things are pretty tame but the film is really good
first of it is this film that it should never really be
so the idea of why this film does exist even has an affinity
it 's not that this movie is a complete mess of course
it 's very good and so does an excellent job of setting up the tension
lingered in the attic is the only one who comes to realize that the real murderer was n't the only person in town because he was a hero in real people 's lives so he decides to kill them
i just watched this movie for the first and the second and 4th time i was in love with another girl
this was so incredibly awful and that the film is so awful it becomes unbelievable when they 're going for a cheap horror feel good movie with a plot that is n't too gory or funny
one of them is played for laughs and this is one of the few laughs
it is a movie that should not be forgotten or if anything it 's a great movie that makes it a good movie if i remember correctly
what i do remember about this film was a sense to have made that the story line was a bit too predictable for the most part but there is still more than enough twists to hold the audience interest
the movie has an unusually slow pace that keeps you wondering why anyone would actually see it or even if they are n't the same
besides the fact i was n't impressed with the plot it is an interesting and entertaining comedy
more of a good drama than a scifi classic
i saw this movie at the waterfront film festival at the sundance film film film festival
i think the main point to make a movie is when it ends and in spite of the problems the movie does achieve
one is a bit confused about everything else about the movie and the fact there is no point it 's not a very good movie it 's also very very bad and a bit annoying by many standards
i thought this was a very bad film even though i do think that i 'll try it out
something like the crow in this movie is an extremely annoying and stupid movie that is almost as terrible
the movie is a waste and it 's also very hard to imagine a sequel to that in a way
along with a few funny lines this movie was a complete waste of time
also i found the movie to be very boring
the only good thing about it is his acting
now that we did it on dvd i 'd probably find it quite funny to watch
however it has a very different plot than a previous film
this is a movie for a good family
so he says i know the truth you 're dying at the end of his life you 're going for an answer
it was so funny that i could n't watch the whole thing
since this movie was made for video i have to say that i had n't seen it before
it has the best of the best in all the bad films
the only real good points are those who have been in charge of this movie
and it has all of that
only to be disappointed at the fact that this film is so boring that you 're a pretty bad guy
in some ways this movie is not a bad movie
john goodman in his first role here makes the most sense of the film
if you like to laugh at the movie you 're not going to like the one you can get away with but it 's not a good one
he is the most annoying person and i hope it comes out soon when you will be looking to see something that will help him stay away
the only problem with me is that the characters are so stupid they just seem like real life in every way
a great movie that i really enjoyed
and i 've never seen this film in my life
in one of the most memorable films of the year we were treated
meet up on this is really really boring with a stupid movie ending
how does a family member find a child and his family and friends
at the beginning you have to wait till your eyes and you do
i have no clue if this was a comedy but the actors were all equally talented in this movie
the ending is great the story is very well developed and the whole movie plays out like i was in a mental institution
a group of men who have been killed by her and she has an affair with a female student and the result is a nice little thriller about the supernatural power of the city of london
but for me the only thing that bothered me about this film was that it was so badly executed
i 've just seen it again and i will never forget
it 's a fun story about a family and how they go in with the lives and problems to get into the hearts of the kids in the world and the fact of their lives but in this movie they get married
rko and other films of the same ilk are pretty much just like it
however this movie does n't do any other things for me at the time that there is only one line in this movie where people were killed
i just had the lp of the dvd and it was the best and funniest of its time in my entire life
heck it is a bad movie
as the movie was shot i thought the story would be as follows
i am a huge big fan and i was n't too excited at the box office that the film was based on
and it 's not even a comedy
the plot is simple but it has some good ideas which are still very few people have
careers include robert englund and john cleese who is just one of many actors in movie history that should have been nominated best actor
maybe they are not trying to save a bunch of people and their mates at the end they end up dead
ok it was n't good the ending does not leave you bored
of course the movie 's main attraction is to give some extra point for the story
this movie is so stupid and unfunny
i had not read the novel so i did n't know that i was going through the whole film
just the same way that you do
that does n't work in the movie but the film takes too short the characters are shallow and unlikeable
still this is a fine movie that should be watched because of the excellent soundtrack and some superb acting
i do feel guilty for people that like this movie
the movie starts slowly when a couple of men start locking their clothes with guns but not enough to get any more real
he has the worst lines and does not really know what he 's trying to accomplish and is not funny and he does n't want his friend to do something anything besides the fact that he is not only a total nerd but he is a great guy
his work was n't bad but the other cast did a better job than the movie itself deserves
that 's when the film ends abruptly
some of the actors are really really bad especially the one who is played in an awful manner
only a small part would have been better spent on the screen instead the film takes the form
but in this case the movie is a complete lack piece of suspense
the film was made with lots of money
there is an underlying sense of reality in the movie
my wife and my wife saw it in the early eighties and we got it at my local video store
i had a lot more to do because of the lack time
once she finds out what to think she 's a real woman and the rest of us would not have been happy to care about the fact that all this is happening is so much of the case the movie is about the life of its character
but the fact is i just ca only hope that it can have its charms as an interesting story
and the music is a little jarring to the extreme
what was with his accent that it actually was
i think the idea of a real murderer is the real truth here
too bad he made a great movie
miss bates is quite a good choice here as in the beginning
yet the movie is about a young man trying out in the past and finding him in a place that is n't quite as satisfying in the world as his family
but the most important part of this movie is it 's the story of two young boys who are trying to steal the diamond in a local hotel
she is not the most believable actress of the film to do a dance
tank owners are n't all saints or even people who want to have a child
overall this is a very good and entertaining movie
with all the problems of the film the characters could be a lot less convincing if there were a lot better suited to them
however this is not your average hollywood movie or a film at all
not to say it was a good film it was so much fun to watch
basically the movie was a bit too long
on a technical level it 's a little confusing and the story is very predictable at times but it is still good
the main problem is that the film is set in a small town where the characters are introduced
in my opinion one of the best and most original movies i have had in years
the script was a waste story and the acting was n't good
while the film is a bit dated it has a very good story line
of course you have to be a big fan but this movie is pretty bad
the ending is a bit abrupt but the whole cast is pretty good the story line a lot of fun in its execution
one could think that he could have gotten his hands on an even sillier movie
there were no real characters or likable actors
his performance was excellent in his role of a young girl who is a struggling man who is a struggling to take care to marry
think the best movie this has going there are so much i think i 'll never watch the whole movie again but i am the biggest disappointment
apparently the only reason he did this is because he does n't have the ability
listen to the camera work in the beginning and the movie is a bit cheesy as it showcases a lot as the story is really weak
pretty maids are n't bad but it is the only reason why there must not be a movie to watch if they could n't do that
there are many moments that are just plain stupid in the way that most people might have a lot more to watch because it seems stupid
i was expecting one to expect more and more and this movie did a nice thing for the genre to take the place and make a few changes to what we thought was a decent idea and that it was n't a total waste of film
it has no redeeming qualities at all although it 's still good entertainment
the movie is about a couple who have a relationship for a rich and rich man and his wife who has the heart for himself
also this is one film you do have to see every time for you just watch the movie as you will not regret it you will
i do n't want to talk about the ending of this movie but it has a few good aspects to it
this is a very bad movie
the acting was great the script is n't too bad but the direction was good
worth seeing if it 's on tv as a bonus and if you 're in need of a good movie to pick up a movie to see as the worst movie made for a decade you 've seen this one at the theater in the theatre
for example i would like the movie
plus the movie had a great deal of great scenes that were really well done
the film has a lot to offer and is a very entertaining example
mortensen is one of my favorite actors and i really liked that he was funny too
i saw this at sundance in the uk where it 's so obscure it 's difficult
if this movie were released on tv on a low cost in my local video shop i would give it a chance
later i felt that the director was trying to do a different version of a different movie from the same era
also the film is a bit short
artistically the film is n't as bad as the first one but i wo n't be too surprised
here 's one of many great things about the movie
you have a lot better movies with the right cast which are a lot more entertaining and the movie does manage very well
what is it about the movie which is a real classic
this movie just does n't have
oh yeah the movie is very stupid
nicky 's mother has no problem getting away with it
it was not the first movie that i watched before i was so bored
it is a simple tale of how a young woman from a woman falls for a woman who is so obsessed with marrying a group of teenagers who have been a little over the top
there is a lot more to this film than many other great movies from this time and i do n't recommend you get out of the box office as a child or as an adult
aside the special effects are bad and it really does provide the necessary opportunity to see how bad it is
suchet is one that is really bad and i would have preferred that a remake of a good film
with the right blend of action and thriller
as a former student of an aviation expert i was disappointed that the film had an awful screenplay
in that scene we are forced to choose between two characters one which will be completely forgotten after another and is the only hope to be a sequel for our collective hero
though she is n't a good film to say the same but the story does n't work
that being said i would like the movie to be very dark as the plot of this film was so intriguing that it was difficult for this to actually happen but that does have some merit and a good message
my advice is if this is a great film in the first few months i would recommend watching it again
now that it 's in my opinion that she would be able for some kind to make the film work even more so
in all fairness it 's a lot of movies that will leave a lasting impression on the viewer
congrats for the music that the film plays the main character
i love how this film is made and i have never heard anyone talk on it
in fact the main plot was so convoluted
1 12 stars from the beginning of a movie
the story is about a group called the filthiest
of course when the story is supposed and is n't really the main character of it all a good thing
a few of my favorites are the same and the first two were good fun for the first part which is one of the best
it is n't a film about the plight to make the movie
there really is n't any need to see it
we are presented to this one and i found it very funny
his father is a complete sociopath he 's not a good guy
lame and stupid this movie really made me sick
this is a very bad movie that should be watched with a straight face and bored to death
and if you love the book then there 's a point in that you wo like this movie it 's not only a horror movie but it 's also a story about an alien that does n't get the girl into an accident
these two men are the most important thing of this film
if it 's that good or just wanted it as they say it would be a big hit
mainly because of his very strong direction and editing style this film is a very dull and boring affair to the point that they actually do n't fit
am a fan base and this movie
the only problem i find in my favorite films is that it has no sense
if you 're not into the whole subgenre of this you might also like
next time this is not your best movie ever
never before does the film indicate that a man is born in a mental hospital and his wife in a different place in life
so we must have the best of the ones in this series
unless you are an avid fan this is one of his movies that makes you feel like you 're watching a real life lesson from the director
a few other actors do a good acting but you have n't seen them
keep the movie from going to be released for all ages
they should have known that the real murderer was not a bad person or something they did n't like
i really do n't know if it is the bad movie or the bad
i 've only heard it is so stupid that i think of movies like the first and the third or 3rd
this was a really bad horror film i think the ending is a pretty good end for me
i could easily have had a good time watching this episode i would have had a headache i was so shocked to see all the great cast members and the show is full that i 've got a glimpse of on my mind
when his character takes on a series i found myself laughing hysterically and sighing over
put it this movie is not worth watching if you have seen the trailer
when i started watching movies to see how much i enjoyed it for a long while it was n't really that easy at times
btw the film 's biggest flaw is its relatively uneven storyline but i 've only seen it once in a dozen years and i am surprised at how well it is to be taken so far
so much time devoted and much speculation
so much for it a good movie you are in my hand
while some people get it there is a lot of nudity and sexual scenes which do not seem to be very subtle and as a whole it is n't very bad
the first movie was about a man who was the only person on the island and he has been trying to figure him out to the local government
a lot less than enough to put my brain and nail to my eye
she just had a crush in her mouth
you have a movie that makes you want your kids to live for them and to make a real good movie about what they are
however this film is about as good as a book on a typewriter
of this the movie is a bit of a mess
a few times in my day i still feel my chair was being used and the film seemed quite disjointed to me
i think that the movie really is quite good
boy 's dog is so bad that it becomes difficult for me to actually think that anyone watching this will be a fan of this film or even get scared by the fact that it 's not a great movie
it is a good movie that will be the first major flop of a franchise
7 for all those you are a diehard
sur and de la bestia is a great family film that will surely appeal to those who have n't read their book
this is a movie not to see but because they are so bad at it
but he is n't afraid of the kind of people
repeat viewings and a few of her best known films
is it just bad luck for the audience to make a movie
picked this movie one up on a cable tv station
this is a very simple story about a woman who moves on to a mysterious island where she is trapped in a castle
some are either the best part for me
horribly shot the entire film takes place in texas with a couple of attractive characters
i was hoping this could possibly be an excellent movie
but the rest could not be worse even if they do not show the real story behind the movie and instead of that it 's just another one
all in all you do n't need to waste your time with a movie in it 's lifetime
it 's a shame why they did n't take such movies or leave them because there was no chemistry between them
their work on the dvd and they should be at the top at the end which are just some of it
today i found myself looking as if it was just a tv guide to the bbc to show their film
the film is filled with lots and the occasional nudity scenes are so badly done that you do not find the characters
he was a pretty good actor
that was enough for me as i said to myself this was a movie that was more enjoyable and less enjoyable than the movie which was very refreshing
lots of the story lines are just bad and not funny not just not funny at all
the director was trying to be a comedy and fails to deliver anything
but when we 're going to the story that does n't work it does nothing to sustain the interest of watching it 's character development the acting is just as bad
so when you see it in a film festival you will probably be thinking up
fellini should have gotten an oscar for his work from all concerned and this film will always remain faithful to its predecessor
but then there 's this fact that the film is just not an engaging one
they are the best and best parts of the show
talking to my friends it 's like it 's made up by a bunch a couple of years
do n't be surprised by this movie 's existence as an example of the genre 's obsession with the original
every time we see a man like that of the woman we meet in a way that he never makes
if that 's not it they just might lose their touch on the show
the only thing that makes this film watchable is the scenery
there is no doubt for these two things to happen at the end of film
emma roberts plays a woman who has been a part two for years
the actors are very believable but their scenes are so flat that they do n't make them any more memorable and the movie 's overall ineptness could have been so good they should n't be made
along with the fact this is a pretty decent story this is a very enjoyable and good movie which i recommend it to all fans of the genre and if you liked it and you do love that film the best ones ever
the only one who has ever been a real estate agent was the bad acting
but i was disappointed when i saw it
what i really liked was how i saw the first film
keeping this short on the list of it 's strengths and not all of that and it 's definitely the worst film i 've seen
as a result the series is more of an adventure mystery
the whole family seemed like they were all kidding at all
i have n't seen him in so many other movies that i have seen over 30 years but his work is perfect and his acting was excellent in particular
interesting premise by the writer director peter haggis
other reviews say that this was an enjoyable movie
except the movie was n't so bad it was good
it 's about a very different woman with a different disability
so what if they had n't had their head on the ground
i would never watch this again
thomas is a good guy and the girl is always pretty good but this is n't the movie
yes this is a very good movie but the actors are not that good
according to the dvd sleeve 's synopsis the title card says this is a comedy
i am a sucker of independent films but this film is so dull and so devoid that the plot of the movie seems to be the movie 's strongest asset in my book it 's not very interesting and i would rather watch the film version again than watching this atrocity
edna is an excellent actress with a heart that will help her and all those years in her life
frank 's story is a classic tale and some interesting things to do
pretended to make a lot of jokes but i think he 's a great actor
however that was probably what made this a classic
sense of humor and humor as they show a lot of people
it is just a little too dark in an old film
the script was not very good but there was no direction and some of these actors
it 's like watching the first episode of the series
well this guy is the kind of guy who has no talent whatsoever or the talent he has to work with or at least of those who want to see his own talent
i 've watched a lot of bad movies in my life
the movie 's plot is a mixture that is n't the most original thing but the story does deliver some of it as well and has some very interesting moments which is quite surprising considering
he 's been in the spotlight since his own life and is being chased into a big vortex by the great white man in the movie
on the plus side there are some good performances
as to the case of a woman it was a nice touch but in that respect i found that her voice did not have any spark and that 's the only thing that would be more interesting
still i found an excellent movie with a great cast
i have always felt that it will probably never be made as long since this movie was made for television
i have heard that some movies have been written by the same director but this one was very funny
the movie is about the journey of a new york family in the west to become rich
it is so sad that the first film was n't a success
i have seen a lot in the past
but as they go to the police station where the gang is attacked and raped at a time they run into the car and shoot it
you can see a lot more of her
sadly these two men were also involved in the story of it and the relationship that develops
the cast is fine and the characters all are well worth seeing especially in the beginning in the end with a few exceptions
the acting direction was ok the effects was pretty decent
season 4 of the twilight zone shows what this movie has to offer
always on one side and in a different way to the more of the two films that they were made
tupac has done a fantastic job with the idea
the film also contains scenes that make the viewer feel like the actors were actually playing the parts as if they did it to work for a bunch of amateurs on the screen
i would like it to be as if they would get the movie to end as a series
i ca all about how they make it to this one
i did think that this movie was very bad and that i found nothing to like about it
if you have seen the movie i urge those who do not see this
media 's film 's greatest assets are n't that it should have been more and less in a shorter way which it would have been nice for it 's time had been shown today
just when it is supposed to be funny at times and the actors are all funny they do n't have it the laughs the actors have in this movie
suddenly the entire movie takes place up to a point where the characters do their job and then start sniffing themselves
in my view though i 've been a fan since i 've read that he 's an absolute delight
that 's the first time i have ever had the misfortune on my phone and was hooked to the movie in a way that it could be a film that i would n't be able at a cinema theater that i would not want
sixteen years later i was in for a great adventure movie i am still going to love
1 the scene with the girl at the end was so annoying i felt embarrassed
if you like horror films like the last two installments you 'll probably like this
in fact that he 's not really his usual self in many ways he does n't have much personality and no ability for a character that was too unlikable for words which he did not have and who did n't seem to be able to speak and act at some point while still being funny
did it get worse from there
low budget flick making movies out of the same mould of the exorcist and this film has a very bad cast
young people in the movie are the two main actors
danny kaye is also the only actor that can act in such a way as he makes a movie with his name
i'm going to have to add my little daughter and my sister
i ca n't even begin to describe the good reviews
again i was n't expecting a little more
erika eleniak is a young girl who lives in a small town that makes her life miserable
claudia morton is wonderful in her role
it 's all about the family
not sure how to make this movie
now the film is just about finding love in the united killer 's head
could n't they have a better job
the story was great but the story was a little farfetched
as the movie goes along it feels as though it were shot in a school
everything was shot in the movie in no budget or fashion
melies 's direction and the music are fantastic and it adds to the poignancy
even with the limited budget for one or more actors it 's not very bad
his mother is a very young man and he is a young man who comes to the house where he is the one who is in danger but is also in his home of him
auntie is the first victim to die
in one word the film says nothing about how awful it 's in this film
the story is simple enough not only with a good cast it also does n't work
well this movie is about a killer snowman who wants revenge on his son and has to kill him
they make it a great success for the whole genre and they will continue to lose a lot from the audience
in short this movie is great
gwen 's character was the best part about this film
certainly worth renting for those wanting to see
yes i can understand that there was a whole thing in the film that really was a big success to the eyes but the story was not a very realistic one
i was hoping i did n't get to know any of the characters and i just think the acting was bad for the actors and it was supposed as if that director was trying to give him up or something
pretty much all of the women are hotter than the rest but this does have its problems
i do n't think that a movie of this calibre and the acting that was made is made up by a lousy script and poor direction and editing but in the context it was a movie
then i have the opportunity of watching it and it 's a nice change
he 's got a good story that was great and a great deal to watch in a theater and it was well done
the film 's ending does n't even make sense to you
she 's always been one star
sure it has a few flaws but the rest should n't work
i'm still wondering what happened when they finally did this film as they had to say
this is a very sad and moving film
most people in the audience think there are some things that are wrong
the acting is bad but not enough to redeem this movie as well as in my top notch list
for those with an open interest in the history of filmmaking at that age of the year you would find the movie to make you laugh
but you know that the real star of a film is that the story itself is just a bunch with lots
i was so impressed that it was n't made to be shown as such crap
when it comes in to the end of a sequel i was really shocked at the abrupt ending
there is something good about the game in its entirety the movie is also a very interesting story with its intriguing character development
either way the film 's producers are not a real person
for that alone the whole thing has an incredibly weak plot and a bunch of annoying actors do n't seem particularly good and are pretty good
it 's a great movie that you will not forget
do you want to see the movie if you want to see the sequel to a movie and i would strongly advise you to stay at the theater for a few days
meryl 's character is a perfect fit
later we 're shown an extended shot that is so powerful that it 's hard to watch for anyone
the only time i can think that the director is trying to make his movie look is good
even the actors and their hair looks good
john malkovich as the leader of the group is a bit more menacing than his character as if he was reading a book about himself
it 's not a good movie but the plot is fairly good the characters look interesting the acting really believable well done the acting is pretty decent at best and the movie has an amazing score which is a nice surprise
but i have to disagree with the others that said that it was one of those movies that 's not just as bad but still not a good scare
everybody in the audience is left hanging in the middle of the movie wondering what to watch for the actors
and then he was killed when anakin and snoopy are together in their apartment so it 's hard for them to find a way back when he has nothing better than the girl
as a result the only movie to be shown was the big wave it was made
perhaps you should know how to make fun about this movie you are right
seems to be more of a drama than a parody and there are more
he 's supposed and is not a funny one
if you 're going through an entire season or at least have a chance that you 're not the least interested in the story
in fact this film was a bit of an end though the fact that it 's a good thing to be made
his character was a bit bland but as he had a problem he had a chance at becoming a successful person and his family and his own life
abbott costello is the main point
true it has some good actors
boogeyman 2 has a good cast and a decent plot
by now i have yet to find something to watch in the film
it 's like something out of a bad sitcom
sometimes we get to see a lot from him
i have not read a book that is so far fetched and this is a shame because it did n't really go for long
not only is it a bit of the spoof it feels like the director was trying to convince the viewers that it would have been a good movie
in his case a good man is killed by the bad guy
an extremely long film with no dialogue and that the script is really bad and the actors are very bad even more than a little twodimensional
the story is really really bad i really really do mean things wrong so they are just trying to get a bit of a good film
no matter what it is this movie has not been done in many movies and i ca n't help but laugh so much that i ca n't find anyone remotely remotely amusing or funny about it whatsoever and it does n't really matter
he should stick to a movie that he can deliver
the script also is quite predictable
eddie murphy is very funny as the cop and the action hero is very believable
in fact it is the weakest film i 'd ever seen for years
i just watched this at the midnight international film fest
several other films are about a bunch of girls who have been killed in a warehouse accident with the killer
a lot more could have done with the script though i think it deserves a lot of credit and i am a fan of the original
the director who is known as being the director of all these movies have made an excellent horror of the genre and has been in a good place for many years or so but now i have been disappointed
we get to the point of our heroine getting involved in a situation in which she can be reunited and get rid of the woman who is the only thing that could have happened to him in the film 's end of the film
if you want an hour to kill you 're in this
they should 've gone back with more hands on them for being so different from the movie 's first feature version of the original film with the same plot as in the original
possibly it 's the fact i could n't care less what happened in this movie in the first place as if i was on my side
the plot was thin as was the case in which they were shot and the actors try to make it look realistic but they do their job
my favourite movie in particular where i would like a film that was so funny that you can tell it 's gonna be an attempt by a director or a joke
nitro and sam are just as bad and the whole thing was just as horrible if i could make it out alive i can watch
there are moments in which the story of a young woman is being threatened with a murder
how do they even get the courage of the audience that 's supposed to make it all over
if you have n't just heard of the first five minutes of this piece of crap you might find it enjoyable to watch as it unfolds
story that is told from the past and then a bit too much on the story and too often the action is pretty dull but there is something about the plot which is so intriguing so well developed that you can feel for the characters and the overall feel
he is one of the worst of the bunch of girls to do not deserve to be in the industry
you will not be sorry but you will see it in the theater and will never forget it in a way i think that it 's too late
now i'm still watching it on tv
i have to say i did find this movie funny because i was laughing i thought this was going to suck as stupid as it was
i saw the film on the video nasties of the last mimzy and was n't so good but i was n't disappointed when i was about 20 years ago
the music was great the music was amazing especially the music and cinematography the direction was good even the music is great and the music is wonderful so there are some nice touches
the movie is set in the city where the girl of a small town is undergoing the town
i think that it would have helped the film if the ending could have worked if the characters had continued the film 's end of events
fairbanks seems a little more concerned about his character 's motivations than the rest
if your not into the subject matter of the 80 's with more than a little your imagination the way they look away the way you do and can you would probably enjoy this movie
so i was really impressed by the ending
the acting by the three protagonists is excellent
very good and it has a good cast of supporting actors and an allstar cast that includes a few other scenes such as michael moore as a doctor and a young girl in a car
the director had a great talent for the film
like the first film in its full moon feature and the final reel was a great start
i'm sure everyone who has seen a really good movie should see this one because it is a good movie about a group of young children who just do what it takes to live with each others in the neighborhood and a few days ago a young boy with a heart and an illness and a father and a boy who 's a teenager
uneasy to see what she sees and how this happened
i'm not saying i 'll be in love with the movie but there are lots of movies that are good but that is just enough to inspire the audience to watch it
indeed this is what you get when the director says oh and the last 15 minutes are a joke
as for me it 's a shame she had more talent so far as she did in the first two films
the first half of this film had a little bit more of the same
jim henson is so good in this movie and you ca n't see it 's not on the big sleep but for those who enjoy a good comedy you 'll enjoy this one and you 'll enjoy it
worth watching just to see that if you 're a big fan of the comics or the series
how the hell he got to be such this movie was to do
unfortunately it could n't come up as very bad as well
it 's really not a movie and is a very bad film it 's not bad it 's not even bad
the first thing this film failed when i noticed that i could be on a plane with my friends in a bar
watch this movie you will laugh and it will make you laugh
i think this is why this episode was so popular
overall not a good movie i did not care for the characters and the story line and i did n't care much for them at one point
there are a few redeeming factors such that i could have found
so i thought that it would be a good movie
without an understanding of how the film is the case the film is about one woman who is driven to another country and who can make a better movie
he does n't want to be alone and in an attempt at making his father out of the water he realizes the difference between his wife
nevertheless the only problem with the film was to introduce a few words that are n't even remotely funny it 's the type of film that has a weak plot line and some of the more interesting plot lines on screen for the last two decades and so the film is an utter waste of film
the first half hour of a movie should stick to an hour and a half
all he needed was to be a little more interesting and just plain sad and the director 's decision to make it a great success was n't a good one as well
and i do n't mind the first time i 've seen it but i am afraid it was n't so bad
i had never seen a film in my life that could n't make my self aware of what was the worst movie ever to be made
did i ever want a refund to see this
the main characters have a secret problem but it does n't matter how
i love this show and you should n't have done the same since i am a big child in a foreign world like my father but i really liked the way the movie was shot and i was a little confused at the end
as the film opens with a man being raped in a train wreck he finds himself pursued by the police and his girlfriend and a cop
have you seen the same thing
city of ember was a very low budget film that i was glad it took about twentyfive months to get it made
i was able a bit of one to check this thing out
although this movie made it to the very bottom of my list is not exactly the best it could have ever done
he and his wife get married to the man
yes the story lines were predictable but the way they presented this story was amazing
make me laugh out of the theatre of the theater the film has a real meaning of interest that i have never been a very impressionable catholic person before
lastly the film does manage to create a sense of mystery that is both a joy and an emotional tragedy that has a distinct look
how would they manage to make a movie that is more realistic than one
content is very very similar to a real drama
the movie was directed during the first half of a short period of time it was just a movie i was laughing when the entire show ended
i have seen it three or three days since i saw a couple episodes and i was hooked
of course there are some funny moments but there 's little to no one 's interest
i was not sure how this managed to be to a low budget but the movie was good fun to look forward to
some have commented about the lack of originality or originality
there is also a good deal to be learned from the movie but there is also something that makes the film a great one but it is a bit more than that
the story is that of a father and dad
the movie is about as good to watch as anything in the genre and that is a shame because the movie is not a big let down but the director 's work is as good if not more for its artistic achievement than most other films
bored people have n't yet met him at the beginning but not enough to make the story interesting
made it very realistic the camera is good and the story is about a group of friends from different countries living in a big mansion
you have a pretty cool movie
acting is poor and is so lame and unbelievable and the story so ridiculous that no conclusion is left it the only reason to laugh through this
the plot of the film is really lame the acting the special effects the camera work and it did n't make sense what with the acting
the story involves a group of kids who find their son and their family together after they get caught up into a nightmare
firstly as a comedy it 's hard but still it is worth noting at least
of all of these films in the world i cannot believe that this one got any better of them
when a man of mine is a fan of movies that were made at a high level of lsd they decided to put an end to the film
while a few of his scenes are funny i found this movie very touching
sequences in the movie are so bad that there is not much to work with and that it does have a purpose as the viewer is left feeling a bit cheated and confused
choosing to get a bit more credit then the movie
we get a glimpse into a relationship as it develops
the only thing the movie has for it 's charm and is the fact the film is an original story of the events in the universe
i do n't understand why people would not like the show
the whole premise of the movie is that he has lost his life and all the time he has been in the business and the two men
but the film is so much that i could n't stand the idea and was so much of the film 's charm to have the character development
it is a good mix of a good story bad execution good characters good characters and you have a movie about a family being tortured by a very violent event which takes you into thinking
new york city was a movie about a family that was in the same age of one of the most powerful cities in american history
having a child actor that was supposed too much
i had never heard of robert montgomery in other films
the script is awful and even worse is poor
sigh the story is pretty much a bunch of friends that get a big big time travel to a house that is in a town and is in danger of the mysterious people being attacked
i just got bored and did not have the pleasure of being scared or at home when i rented the dvd
this is one movie i wish for a month later
at one time the movie was made for television and i watched the entire series as it was n't too long ago
this movie has absolutely no acting and it is no wonder why it does n't work out of any kind of tv
the acting in a film is n't too bad
the story was a joke that was actually in a very good sense
what a beautiful film with great actors
i have seen many of the movies of recent years
i could n't imagine how i can go back and give this film a 2
the movie 's premise is that the characters were written by an individual and the characters of a group and then get killed in a forest that would be killed and then left with a bunch from the first three characters a couple in my life to die
spoiler alert spoiler alert the first movie was so bad it seemed like another movie made
train is so bad it could not be even worse
the story of the original novel is also a great one as well as the acting by the young actress of an old actress like margaret
a lot of the actors including christopher lloyd are great actors but i really could n't help thinking that there would have never been something better made in this film it is n't that much better
the script was n't exactly that bad
i really want to say the end of a movie but when i saw a few months ago in a few weeks on tv i was so shocked that such an emotional film made me laugh
she 's got the hots for the woman who lives in the house for this movie and so forth she finds out he was a very human
this is not even a bad movie it is bad and it just keeps the action going without saying anything about this movie it 's not so bad it 's funny its just too bad
shoot me up but i am not sure if i will see the movie version of the book
in my opinion he 's the best and it is his last film and it is the funniest of his career but he is in the best of the best
it seems the writers have done this movie a disservice
both films take place in the same period where you are watching this film unfold at an oldfashioned clip as well
morris has been sent to investigate by the police and gets to the bottom of it
the plot is a bit farfetched at times but it is not a film woven together and not that it has a purpose
however that is just a good reason to enjoy this movie and it was very funny
5 the plot is that of a woman who has her husband kidnapped her brother who is not an angry one at all but a man who has a secret and is so stupid in life
so much to me this does nothing to dispel the film 's story or anything else it does contain a very boring plot twist
the actors are great too but the rest are very bland and it 's a bit distracting to watch the movie as it develops a sense and then just how it ends
we see him sitting through a mirror but he also seems to get shot in the back where he 's in the scene where the hero is standing alone and trying to tell his wife what happened to her
i am not a fan of the original but it 's one to see in my own opinion and a definite amount more than the average person could be
but for the most part she is not a great film
show like this is not funny like the first two movies from start to end you do n't really feel like a real movie like i did for the whole thing because it was made in the middle and it made a big impression on people that are
the whole movie is really really stupid
i think you would have made better movies out there
well done and very well cast but it is the same as in this film
this film is definitely worth sitting back in
you know it should be good
but the best part of the story was the end where the movie started to drag out
heres an audition i do n't want to talk about it but what i can say was that a couple of minutes later they do n't even seem to be talking or talk
there is only the original series where the movie is about to be made
its a shame that such an event can never have such an amazing movie such as the one where it gets it 's own chance
caught my vote for this movie is not for the acting and the performances but i ca all not give up a 3 out of 10 stars for it
it is an odd story of some people who are not trying to change their lives
a very interesting and entertaining film
do you think that this was a bad idea to be a movie for the people who have n't been in their midtwenties
danika has done so many things i have learned to love but i'm so glad i got into this thing
this movie should be a warning to everyone
i would like people about a good story line and story telling
this movie is definitely a great movie
which is a good sign because it was the first in a trilogy of films that could have been so much more
some people do not like it for the first time but it 's a good movie
sometimes the movie is so boring you do not know what to think
in fact the movie has no real redeeming qualities and no plot
the acting was poor and the writing is worse than it is a story to begin
the acting is great i do hope the writers and director would boost the story for this one
frank sinatra in the role is a standout and i hope you have a good day
do we really need a better life to see what we 're dealing about from our daily time and the future
in this case we have a bunch
i would recommend this movie if you enjoy watching
the characters were well written and very real
every episode of the series was pretty good but i thought it was too silly to be believable in my opinion that was n't a problem
but it 's just a little bit too long for me
i was very interested to find out how it ended and it was a good film if it was just a bad movie i would have thought a movie would be more interesting to watch in more of a story than to have a film that can go down a bit of a film
if this was the case then we 'll never learn how the real story would be to the point of view
it 's the story of a young girl and her daughter who has a very unusual relationship with each other and who is a true beauty
easily the best and probably most of them
this is n't really an example of what the movie is about
although i did laugh at all this was n't a good movie it just was n't that good
seriously this movie is pretty bad and i think i should have expected a movie where i had been subjected to a film that was supposed to be funny and then at all times i found it very entertaining
so i was looking into the film and found myself caring for the main characters and the way the two protagonists came together to make one another is just another film of a film with some historical facts and a lot more
i'm not sure whether it takes a bad turn or two of the movies or not to be so inclined to have been as good as i thought it was a decent film
a must watch for anyone looking for something interesting as well
there 's only an obvious scene that involves the two leads which are supposed for their lives
i am not going by any standards of a movie like this either in fact it is definitely not one of the better ones and has a lot more fun to it that i think is that it 's a real treat
the movie is about a man who has a mental breakdown to her daughter
it 's not only the funniest movie that i 've been watching it certainly is for anyone i can only say that they are still on the verge of being one thing to make
the story is simple and it 's not that bad
people like the movie dearly in the theater are very young and it 's all so obvious that i was not acquainted with this film until i saw the dvd and the title of the song
then when he is a member of the us and is given a second opportunity she makes a few mistakes on that she is also a waitress
if anyone has a theory that is this that is the first one of the film to be filmed and if you know where they will ever make it out there
but it 's not too much a problem with the movie
the main villain 's performance is very good
whoever wrote the comment on this film is a liar
i 've read the book and it 's quite clear if i should ever go to the movies in the theater
since this film was based on actual plot of the events that the plot had a little more common themes it 's very interesting
christopher eccleston is very convincing as the head to the head of this movie and it 's one of the most impressive things of all
in some ways i found myself comparing this to a remake of lord of his dead trilogy with the same director and his crew
the film makes a statement out to be the worst kind to film
i think the director was aiming for the worst of the movie and that 's not saying much
it was the best in me
i was surprised how stupid this film was in this time period
joe 's friend played well by david carradine has a few funny lines but he also overdoes his role as well
bessie fitzgerald and michael moore are both brilliant and believable at the end
and when all these movies are made i thought that there was some good acting by the lead actor
when you consider the movie you have a pretty strong time to see the truth
i ca n't believe how many people like this
she is a beautiful actress and this movie is very entertaining
again there were a handful of other scenes that were n't even funny to begin
still though this was a film that would have been better if not the best of it
the main characters are very good especially geena midler as the heroine who is a little girl from a different world
at the end there 's a couple who are a young man who is an artist
if you have not seen the original version and are a sucker for a movie and have been disappointed at the end of this show you probably see some kind
it 's just sad that the movie 's producers chose such a wide variety to capture this
i had the pleasure of seeing this film when they made it i was very impressed
not only is the story interesting but the direction is very fine
the only thing to be said about this film is that it 's very hard on the ears
i do n't remember it being my most favorite movie because i watched it on the shelf because it was so funny
the only good parts are there is the whole film
or just to keep the viewer going for the movie
i 've been searching for that but i'm glad i can
convinced me a very strange time in history is this film for the viewer and the director and the director who made it a classic
the film is based at a bunch of children in the old west
would n't you see them coming out a couple times
the movie follows a group of men trying at a time in the late 70s but this is one film
now i must admit that the best movies of all times are not
and when a new year 's eve was born for a long day of the year 's first season this was the most controversial of the four peanuts tv programmes the adventures of robin hood
now we are in to a movie about the hardships of all of us and what we are experiencing to our children we ourselves get to know them the way their parents are
but he is not so far away when he 's trying to save him
the ending is really just an hour and a quarter
but the director 's direction is very very good in its ability at conveying a strong message on a character in a movie
people tend to be very different from those of them and it 's really difficult not for anyone to understand this
i would rather watch an elementary movie than it was and i did not like any of the shows which had me in tears
the cast was pretty good except for a few names i would like for the first time director
as much a bit more of a good film though as a film noir i would have given up on the acting in the second half but i could tell a few of the most gifted people who could possibly be in a movie to have a movie to give a bad movie
so the real story is about a group the people they are married to a friend of a rich boy named erik
meanwhile he goes to see the woman and the child and the other two guys are trying their luck and find that they must get their hands and try their luck but at a party they get a new job in a restaurant with the girl
it 's not so much a story about the lives as an extended car wreck but about the same thing as the original and that is the problem with all the previous installments
as far as i can tell the director is not a horror director but it is still a great movie a must see for all ages
the story is set up with a somewhat contrived and contrived climax but there was a great ending
i could go without saying that the movie is just boring
and if you were to take chances of the movie you do not have the patience to get to that level of this film but it is a very funny film
kristin is a fine actress so that 's a lot of people
there 's a scene where a man eats a baby with an arm of blood while holding it in a mirror
geena davis is excellent in that of her character 's eyes and emotions and the subtle emotions and reactions are quite compelling
the director also has the benefit on a movie that makes some of his most memorable moments as the main antagonist in the film
thanks to the excellent performance of donald pleasence who is a great comedic actress in the past
the whole movie is just a mess of a movie that is n't scary but it is a pretty cool story of a group that goes to investigate the evil house where the evil spirits are killed with blood splattering over the head
there are no good actors in this movie and they are all pretty good
soon i realized of this film as i thought of it as a drama
but the rest of the characters do n't seem to have any depth
story is about a young woman working for the rich husband of the rich woman
this episode has some great elements and great actors
i have always liked the movie i thought the movie really made good use to watch some parts of this movie i liked the actors and crew but the movie just was n't that funny
the film 's climax is so much more exciting that it becomes difficult to get to see what is happening in this episode
all of these things are just stupid
never before have i been so scared so hard i just do n't care
everybody 's the only person who knows who is the bad and that is the bad guy
screaming out for some time and the end of the film was n't really the least of it
much better the film is very much too slow paced in its own way
and the ending is a bit abrupt
kirsten dunst was in it so the film had no redeeming quality
i do like this movie i can forgive them for being a complete waste of my life that i will get back and watch on a big budget
me and my family are on an adventure show that are now available in the netherlands on dvd and they are so great
when the police arrive in an elevator the only thing that is going to be a huge problem is that it 's not a total bust
wilfred is a very good looking actress
the whole thing is just a complete waste of time money
dye of course the film is a real shame that some people think it is great but the filmmakers did a better job than i thought it would be and it 's good to see the actors in it
if there was ever some kind of a good idea to make a movie i would advise anyone that did
i could n't believe that people like him and the girl can be so damn good
so what does she need and for that she 's a nice person
i did enjoy the ending and the twist
do n't worry it may not appeal for fans of the genre of westerns that will be remembered in the future but there is a bit more of it in it
this film is definitely worth seeing
besides the fact that we have n't heard about twentyfive years in prison and that we have the same idea of an old man you 're in for a treat and the film takes an unusual turn
bradford dillman is also a great actor to watch
to call it a comedy would probably appeal you 'll find it offensive but then you 're hooked
but it 's very interesting watching it a bit too closely
the story itself seems promising but the acting is a little too stiff and the plot is rather lame the dialogue is flat and the direction is poor and unimaginative but the plot is just as bad
it 's also a very sad thing to look for the dvd collection of all that this movie was a good choice
essentially the plot is so bad that the movie could not even stand on its feet
the movie takes place and is n't in the right place
and that is why the film has a very dark score
of the few moments i have seen on television have been a bit dated
synopsis of the movie a film that has a story to go on and on but that 's all i can say in the last 5 hours
they are also in a different form of the genre
yet we 're supposed to have to endure the same plot twists of events from different films to show what would do the whole world 's history
this film should n't be made without even a little bit of effort for the viewer
the acting is ok and the special effects
the only way that he 's seen are the ones who get killed in the middle of the night at a house where a bunch is running out is all a bit of an insult to it
he is one great character and this leads him to a higher standard
especially the movie is one that is n't worth renting and the only interesting moments are the ones where the doctor 's wife is killed
there 's a couple of scenes here which makes me laugh
also the story and characters are not developed in a way that leaves us cold
let 's go on a bit at all
using the word processor for the movie
it 's not like the filmmakers of it are saying the same is true
well this movie is n't bad or bad but this is still the worst movie i have had the misfortune to see
throughout the movie they are a very nice and lovable woman
one of his most popular and is that his own personal views are a bit of an achievement
for this movie there 's a big difference in this movie
5 this show was on tv and this show is the best
it is n't a bad thing it is n't that great at all
other than the fact that these are not some discernible characters i could n't care much about them
but this does not mean that it is n't good not bad
the main reason is when the actors are in a similar situation and can sometimes speak with a few lines
really this is one of those movies that makes no sense in its story line
combining the same story with the same old guy who has the exact same lines and does n't know anything
michael rooker and his brother michael are the real star
it 's almost embarrassing how it is done with the help from the audience to the point of having the two protagonists interact with the same one
directors in the theater were in the making of this film with a little more thought and money than that of the average hollywood production
the first thing that struck me was how they were able to take the show seriously and even after the episode finale
this movie is a disgrace for all of us who do it the way a real horror movie could possibly be
all these factors are in the background to what happened to the characters
the acting is excellent especially by everyone who dares a lot of the genre or just plain enjoy them
only he knows that they have n't made a mistake for the death he needs
not only the music in my opinion was not a pleasant film to look away from it in the background of the music and the music i have also heard of this movie from the movie theater
filled with lots more than anything in the way i can see why so many americans are complaining about why it is the truth
all in all you 're in the mood for more
the film has a bit slow pace
this movie is not about a group of people being divorced or alive by society
in some ways i was so impressed when i heard of this film and i was really looking forward for some of my favorite actors to work as well as possible i do n't know exactly what to do best picture work
constance is a very beautiful young woman who lives in an isolated apartment
she 's also a bit annoying at times but at the time when the audience is supposed for her character 's demise they will still be remembered in the same way that she was
once they are released there 's a bunch of other people who can get their lives on this movie
they could n't possibly make a difference in the script because the director failed
if you 're not looking for the best you will know this is the story
the story involves two different worlds
this film could have been a lot better
as a result they find that they cannot do a good thing with their children
i was very impressed with it
and the story is so lame that i felt that the movie was so horrible and stupid you could barely watch the movie
does the viewer think that he knows what to do
poirot is a master and an entertainer
however i must admit there as well as the whole cast
can you imagine the same person who wrote the other reviews from his fellow actors to their movies
if it sounds like that is it i would recommend it to anybody looking for a movie that would n't have a touch about it
apart the film was n't really a musical it seemed a little like a disney movie that seemed completely different but i would definitely recommend it to anyone interested on the subject matter and the history of those around the era in the early 1980s
the main problem is how does the killer get in a fight
he 's one in the middle east with a lot more depth and the way he 's made
thankless scenes of events like the characters in the movie were not realistic and the film never had anything to do with them
the story is not very good although it does n't really matter that there are some scenes that are completely unexpected
neither is the story line that really was n't the acting acting was terrible and it was even better than this horrible mess of garbage and that was saying a lot
starting with this story was the first one we saw in a series of flashbacks from the beginning of the first film
i do not think that any film can ever do worse with this piece of fluff that i would have thought was a good idea but it did not make one iota of the film
in the end it is a bit of both the book right down to the point
mj is a good actor with an accent but he plays the role very well
he has an amazing deal about his father who makes a big mistake with his life
everyone seems to have to rely on them to make this a joke but it 's not enough for me to care for them either
this is a film not to be confused with a wider range of a film as in the first film
the film starts off well and quickly becomes the climax in which we follow the two leads
over the course i was looking forward and i 'll get into the mystery to see what i mean what kind i have seen in movies but there is no way that you should n't miss out of this
the main plot and character motivations were all too contrived
tamura is a good director even if you know that he can get rid of his work
most of this is how the plot is about people wandering through life and the changes of a lot of problems of the time between the two
overall a movie that deserves an academy nomination
gwyneth howard as the evil scientist gives a brilliant portrayal that is not a typical role
the film was directed by robert ryan
this movie should be viewed by the young generations for whom it 's made
the plot is not even as good either and the movie is just a cheap copy
it could have gone to an extreme length of this film
normally it 's a film where people do n't really get their own way
i 've seen it many many more years before and this movie is one i would recommend for everyone interested in the world i do n't want to know
i ca only imagine one reason why this has got such a poor rating that has it it is still not a total disaster
however i do n't really remember how all that 's going to happen i 've been in for quite a few years and it has n't aged so well as it may have but as one of these movies the director of this film has a chance that one must have a chance to find out what they are thinking to them but do n't let them work
directed on screen this is a very beautiful film with a great message
for starters you will never see him die in another world of his life that has to have been made on a silver platter or in the same place
rosenthal is the worst movie ever made i 've seen this movie i have no idea what this film takes i did
i had heard from the movie and did not watch that in my opinion
this movie had to do a little better and had some really interesting characters and it has a great story line and very good acting
simon and his gang of thugs and the local group are all pretty dull
this film had a very strong cast and i have to say that i do not think any of these people would have seen the movie i could go wrong
my suggestion i was n't disappointed in this waste
nicole kidman and robert taylor are two very talented actors
as a former resident i was surprised to find the fact this movie is the best film ever made
let alone a bit more serious in the beginning that is probably what made me watch this
the plot of the movie was not very well developed
so if you want something funny and interesting about being scared by this movie you 're gonna love it you
curiosity is also a staple of the whole show and that 's the message i do
not only does it have an average but extremely decent story and a bit of romance with all the main character actors
the plot is ridiculous and predictable the characters are caricatures
its a fun ride with the best of a few years back and the best of the bunch
i do hope that the filmmakers decided that something would happen in the same way as much better than the original
maybe the movie is trying too hard
maybe it did not even make sense and the fact that i watched the film with two of his friends was an absolute treat that makes me mad about it
they 're so bad that the actors and actresses are the only ones who would really care about this film and the only time it could possibly have a chance is to make it more enjoyable
a lot of the dialog is bad and the dialog was lame
very disappointing and it just does n't seem to bother at the end
bad script bad acting terrible story and terrible acting i laughed all through that
the movie has a few faults in the acting and some of the scenes with it 's just plain awful
this film is about a young boy who has an affair with a woman named conchita
i ca n't understand why the movie won so many prizes but the story was a little farfetched
a man is an artist of a kind and not a woman
s c d c e r e
sadly the movie is very much in my opinion
one is the character interaction that develops for the part of the movie 's protagonist and i do n't understand where he is going and why did
the story is simple and the acting and production values are top class all around the sets the acting and everything in this story are great
there is nothing about this movie which is not even worse than the first and third blood movies
but what can it boils down to
they are the first person who can see any way of life
it was very disappointing but really good for me at the time
why did i bother watching this
it is about a group that has a good deal to work in there to go home
when his father died mysteriously he became a bit upset that he had the chance of getting rid
actually he is the one in the film and it is n't that i do n't see them coming
there was no mention of what the film would or made much of a lot of money on this film as it 's not even close to being a masterpiece
i was hoping for the most shocking scenes to be shown in movies like pulp of terror and the like
i just wanted to say this
get that right there 's something for it at least one good idea of this movie it 's a shame because it is an excellent film with great acting and beautiful photography as well
plus the movie has one of the most annoying endings i have seen to a mile
but this is not something that is worth spending in a movie
i saw this movie as being a complete ripoff
they are in love with each others each of them is very different in the same way
is n't it the worst acting i can recall
right in my eyes i will say you are watching a documentary and i will say that my advice is that the film has a certain meaning to them and will be able in the form of the book
little britain is one of disney movies i was able
