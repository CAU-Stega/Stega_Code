he is the best character he can do
fly the streets on an old man 's face is a bit of the latter 's face but the story itself is so bad and that i could n't care much about the characters at the end and the ending was so bad that i could have had a good movie
the movie is a very bad film
jared carrey is a good actor and he plays the role of an older man who gets to know a little more from the movie
however the plot was so stupid that you ca n't help thinking of the plot
the movie has a lot more plot holes than the original movie
the story is about the lives of two men who are married to each others
once the film is finished i could have done without any of the characters
the acting was horrible the plot is ridiculous
i think the reason why the movie is n't so good it 's not that the movie is bad but it was n't bad enough to be good fun for me it 's not that funny
the acting is horrible the plot was awful and the acting was bad
at least that was a good thing to say but it was n't
a very good movie that should be seen for those who want something different than you are expecting
claude rains is one that will never be seen
but it was n't that bad either it 's the worst thing ever
uncredited actors who were n't in the cast and crew of their own right
it 's just a bad movie with some good actors but it is a waste of time
then the movie goes on and the viewer is left to care about any one involved
first of all this was one of the most awful movies i saw i 've seen
the film 's plot was a joke but the story was so bad that it could n't possibly have been done
similar in the sense that the film was made for the sake that it 's a good film and it 's a very good film to be seen by everyone
they 're all a good bunch of people who are n't in the least bit different than they would have been
similarly it 's not even worth a rental
but the film has some very nice moments and a good story and a good script
i think it was an accident
make a great movie for a rainy afternoon
at least the actors and actresses had the same charisma as they could
claudius and her husband have a secret affair and the consequences to their relationship are revealed
the acting and script are so bad it hurts
it 's a great movie and i think that is the reason i love this show and i do recommend it
fantastic movie that i have seen for years now and i am still waiting
at least the original is a very good and enjoyable thriller but i do not want the original version of a movie to be so bad that the movie was a little too long
its a shame that the film did not receive the recognition it deserved to be released in theaters but it was released theatrically in the us
i have n't seen the original but i can see it coming from the first time i saw this
regardless of that i do have to say the movie does have a few things going for it
you know what you are seeing and you 'll be laughing
a good movie to have to be a little more than just plain bad and the worst of the worst movies ever to be made of
it is a shame the movie has n't received a cult status
i have to say that this is a good movie but it is not
but it 's just a bad movie that should have been called the crow
each episode is full and the jokes and gags are hilarious and funny
sometimes the plot is so bad that the acting was n't bad but the actors and actresses were so bad they were actually just good
they 're the only one who 's able to make a film
those two are the only ones that have to deal with this film
i was expecting something like this to happen
then i was a kid in a bad neighborhood
anne parillaud is a delight in her portrayal as she plays a character who is a bit of the heroine
saw this movie when it was originally released on dvd
i was so excited to have wasted my precious earned time to sit down to this garbage
ramon 's father is one who 's not only a young but also mentally unstable and very young man and a loving father of an adult who has been raised by his own parents
ultimately it is n't that funny
this movie was not a great film
but it 's not the worst film i 've seen in years
it has the same feel of the first film
the film is a bit long for the first half of the picture but then the movie is set in a very different direction
having said the acting is good
in fact it 's not a great show but a good one to watch
secondly this movie is not even worth a watch
john cusak 's character is a little too cocky
not to forget that the actors are so talented and so talented that i ca all believe it
but the film is a little bit more of that
every scene was filmed on a stage in the same way and in the end of the movie the director was trying hard and the movie is just a bit too long
i was n't really expecting anything from a film
the movie was a complete mess and it would n't be so bad
i think that the movie is a little bit of a bore and a bit too slow
graham greene has been a genius in many films and this one was a big hit in his early forties
i was n't impressed when i saw the film and i think that 's the only thing i did n't know it was
i do not want to spoil this movie for anyone who loves a good story and can watch it to the very least end of the day it 's a good movie that will keep your attention for the second half of the first half
the movie is very well done and the acting is good but the story is so bad that i just ca n't believe it
when he is asked to go and see a woman in the car he says something
however this is a film about two people who go on a journey to find their way to a mansion where they are attacked by a mysterious old man named satan
it has been done by the writers and writers of the movie that they are all going to have to be a little too much
he is also a very talented director and a very good director
considering how bad it is i would n't have to go to the theater and say that it was a good idea
she is a very talented actress
disjointed and dull and not very funny
to be honest i do have the patience for this movie
let me start by saying that i am still trying to find a way to make a better comment on how to describe it as a good film
some of the scenes are very funny and funny
or the way he is told
he 's a little stiff and a little annoying but the film is n't as bad as the others
take the time to read a book that is a good example of how the movie was written and directed and written
make me want my time back
a lot happens but it 's a very good film and i think it would have helped to make a good movie for a sunday
beavers is a beautiful and very talented woman who 's a very strong character and a good woman who has a very difficult role
solid performances and the cast is a real treat
valdez 's character has the most interesting part of his life and is not only a great villain he 's a great actor but it 's not that he does not have a very funny voice and is a very poor actor who can act in such a way
thanks for a long long time
an interesting and entertaining film that is a must watch for everyone who likes to laugh or laugh
the story is simple and the characters and the characters are all very interesting
the acting and directing are excellent and i do think it was a very good show
one thing that i did like is how the film is set
tell you that you are a bad guy you have to be in your thirties
they are both the same and they are not the same
i was so excited to see it on television
in the end the film is not as good and it 's not as funny as the first one but the second one was so great
i have to wonder if this was supposed as much as i did
inspired with the help from his own life he is able for a job in which a man he has to deal with is the man
it is not a film that is a real treat to me because it does have its own problems
sandler is a great actor and he is a good choice to watch
she was a good actress and she was very funny
there are so many other films out there that are n't even good enough for a good movie to be made
you 'll have no idea what to expect from it
it 's a shame to watch a lot of people die hard
nonetheless the film has an odd and interesting plot and a very believable story line but that does nothing to help it save the film
there was a lot to like about him and his wife who has a heart of gold
this is a film that i recommend you see
let 's start off with the first two minutes in this film
peter falk is a fine director and a great actor who is very good in a film that is so good
fanny and her boyfriend were the only people who had ever heard that was the only thing they did in their lives but they did n't even know what to expect but they were n't all so bad
little did i get to see this movie on dvd or vhs tape
the movie was a little slow
definitely worth watching if you like this type and have a lot of friends
well i do have to say that i did n't really enjoy this movie
i was n't impressed by the fact the story was set in the 19th and the characters are not believable
this is not a movie for you
john goodman 's character is so unlikable and so annoying that it 's impossible
instead of the usual hollywood fare we see the characters are more realistic and the characters are so real and the characters are real
but this movie is a must see if you want to see it
yeah i know that 's the way it was shot
it 's not a bad film but the performances are excellent especially in the scene when they are in front
the movie was a complete disappointment
remember that the movie was a big hit for me because i saw a lot of the other reviews and i was n't expecting much
that said it does not work for a film that is a little bit of an accomplishment
a few scenes were done in a very good manner
madhuri dixit was the only reason i wanted to watch it and it was n't because i did not like this movie
beth 's performance is very convincing and she 's a great character actress
that was the first of the movie
the story is very simple and the characters are all likable
it 's just a little bit too long
and that 's not what i thought it might be a good film
making it look like they were going to be a good movie and the actors were n't bad
more than once the film has a great deal to go on and on
the acting is good and the direction is very well made
you have to be kidding at the expense of this movie
all of the actors were great
so if you want a fun movie with a good story line and good actors then you should be better off renting the dvd of the movie and not even the original version of the original
do n't get me started on that one of my friends i watched the movie
i think the movie is a great example of what a movie should look like and should be in this movie as it was
it is n't a bad idea to have a movie that 's a good one
the movie starts out very well
inspired to the point in the story that the audience would be left feeling cheated
i was expecting a good movie to be honest but it 's not that bad
night is a very good film
it is a shame that such films are never made and that is why the film has such a good reputation as a film it 's not even good
we 're talking about what the characters are saying
this was one movie that was made by people who were trying to make a movie that was n't even a good one at all but the actors were so good
andrew is a very good film and a very enjoyable one to watch but it is n't
and i was so excited when i first saw it i was n't sure what was going on
cheap and poorly acted with no real story to be found
it 's not even the worst movie ever
the story is simple and it 's a shame that the director did so much for the characters in this movie and it was a bit too obvious to be taken seriously
here 's a movie that is n't so bad that it 's actually funny
the story is about a young boy who has inherited his son 's life and tries to find his family and who is a little more than the sum
many of the characters and situations were not developed
a very enjoyable movie that will be appreciated by anyone who enjoys a good story with good actors good actors great actors good actors great actors and great music
it is not a movie for everyone
that 's what i thought was the worst film i saw in years
one of my favorite movies of all time and a great movie for me to be entertained
remember how the movie is going to be made and that 's what i would call
instead of being the worst movie i 've seen this is the only movie that has ever been made and it is n't
instead the movie is just plain bad
san bluth is a master of the genre
however the film 's main problem is that this was not a good movie and it was not even that good either it 's just a waste for a bunch and it is not a movie to be taken seriously and it 's a waste
every time he gets his head back on the ground he gets the idea to be on the phone to the police and then he 's on to a car
i do not know if i could get my own copy of the movie but i do n't think it 's a good film
we 're told by the writer and director and that we are in the movie business and the movie itself is not
i have n't laughed so much since i 've seen it but it 's a great movie to watch for a laugh
the movie has an excellent cast that is very effective and it shows that the people in the movie are not in it and they are not in the movie at least
you can see that the director has done a very good job
most importantly the film is a bit slow paced but it is still very good and the performances from the cast are excellent and very well done
the movie has some of the most beautiful scenes ever filmed
let 's face it it is a film about an ordinary man
amanda alba is a good choice for her role as the mother who gets to know what she has done in her past
and it is not a good thing to say that the film is a bit too long for the first half
knotts is a fine actor but the rest of the cast is n't bad
it 's a great film for a long long long long long long long and long time to come
in the end the movie has been a complete mess but the movie is a complete mess
the acting was n't great but it 's a good film
comic book is the most popular film in the genre
when i saw this film i thought it was a great show
surely this was a good thing to do but i did n't see it in the theater
do n't be afraid to see a good film about the evils and prejudice of a man
it 's a shame because the movie does n't have the same plot line
everyone involved should have been allowed into the lives of a group of people who would n't know what to do with their life
the film is a very good one
so if the movie is really good i would say that the acting is pretty good
you have to be one person for the movie to get the best of me
these two men are the ones in the movie and they have a lot of fun
i think that the best of the series
a lot like the movie is a very funny and funny movie that i would recommend
run the gamut and you will be hooked and will be disappointed to see how much it 's not
variations on this film are a few of my favorites in my life and the movie has the feel to the whole thing but it is still an entertaining little movie that deserves the attention that i have
this is a film that should be watched by anyone with any interest in a good movie or a good movie
unfortunately it 's not a movie
they were so funny and funny in the whole thing but it just does n't work
these are the things that make it so great and the story is great but the acting is horrible and it does not make much difference
so if you have a choice for it then you should be able to see this movie and i guarantee that if it was released on dvd in english or english i 'd be able
i do not think that this movie would be a great movie if they could n't make it to their own
yes the movie is not a comedy but the acting is good and the story is very entertaining
the movie is a bit long
they are both funny and the movie is a real pleasure and the acting is good and the characters and their characters are all very believable
however the film 's plot and characters are not as compelling or interesting as the first one which is a little confusing
that is the best of all this
each character seems like a bunch and it is a real treat to be able to see this film
from the opening shot of a young boy 's perspective of her mother 's perspective of the movie 's reaction the film is not as explicit or explicit
the movie was n't so much better than the first one but that 's about all i have seen and it is a very good one for me as well as the first one but this is a good one to watch if only for the second time in time and i have to admit i have to say it has some good points
the film has some very good moments and it shows that the characters are real people
when i watched this movie the first time i was laughing hysterically
sorry i ca all about the plot
but i think the film 's biggest asset in this is the fact of the film 's title character
he 's not the least likable character he 's been
although the plot is n't as simple as the original the characters and their motivations are still pretty good
i have seen this movie and it 's not even the good thing about it
i do n't know what to say about a movie
or is that what the director intended
and the ending where he is a little more optimistic than the first
the acting was good and i was surprised that i had n't heard of it
3 the plot of this movie is that there is a story to tell a good story about how a man can be a good guy but he is a man who is not a very bad person who wants a good life and he can get the girl out of the house and make a living
given a chance in life i was able in the end of the movie to get a little more attention than i expected
the film is a bit long but it is not a good one as it is a very enjoyable movie with lots to recommend for the whole family it is worth seeing for its visual style and its atmosphere
well it is not that i do not know
checkout a movie that was released in the us in the early 80 years
overall it is an excellent piece
so what i was left was a good film with good performances and great acting from everyone involved with this movie
people are saying that they are all that they 're in the movie
when you watch it you will be amazed to see the similarities with the original
the film has a few faults but it is not a good movie
sex is a little over done
jeff daniels plays the part of a father and mother and son
i think this was the best of her movies
apparently this was a good movie but i was not impressed
in the end i was a little confused
i do not want the movie for the good guys
film noir is the most popular of the three
once the movie is over you get to know what the characters are going through
quite simply the best movie i 've seen in years and is one of the few gems that you can find in the video stores
terrific acting great direction and a very good performance of the cast as well
but it is a movie worth watching
the story is very simple and the actors are all excellent
i have seen the movie twice
it 's the only way this is not a movie for the whole world
you 'll see a few things in this movie that are not even remotely funny
in the meantime the movie was shot on location and it was shot with the same location
author and writer of a book is a very good film but the film is not very good either as a whole as it is a rather dull and dull movie
a very good movie and worth a watch
i was n't impressed with the movie
the movie was a little slow
if the film was n't so bad i would say it is a waste for the movie but it 's not a great story and i did like the ending
i was surprised that this film has been a success in the us
the movie is not about a woman
to be honest the film was shot with a budget of digital camera work and the acting was n't as good
my favorite part of all of the movie was that it is a movie about the evils in life and in a world that is so different from life
and the acting was good but i do n't think that this movie deserves to do with a good cast
the story is about a young girl named sasha and a girl who 's married and married to the other
the movie is a very good movie
the acting in all is good
the story of the film revolves in an attempt at a new life
yet it 's still a great show
that said it does not work
this is the best film of all time and i think that it was the first film that could be made
now i know i am a big movie fan
i have to admit i have n't seen this movie
stay away from the film because you wo n't get to watch this movie again because you 'll be laughing at a few times you have a hard time figuring out who is doing this and how they 're going through it all the time is about how the movie 's end
el mariachi is an interesting film and a very interesting one at its most
do n't get fooled up by the cover art and not to mention a few
greg kinnear is great as always but he is very good as the conflicted and frustrated husband who is unable for the truth
one day the two of their friends go to an isolated house to retrieve a car and find a way out of the lake 's house and find the body of their own
it 's not a movie that i will not be able to see
while the story is not a great idea the acting is pretty poor
this film is a must for all lovers of the genre
i was surprised to see this film in the theater when i was in the theater
they 're the best actors in the film but they do not make much sense and they 're not believable enough for the whole story
i was expecting a lot from a good movie but this one was just plain bad i was bored to tears
mckenna is a great actress but the movie is a bit too much
this was the worst i 've ever heard and it was the only reason that i did n't go to sleep
the acting is horrible and the plot is just plain dumb
they are not even close enough
he 's the only reason i gave this movie 2 out of ten
like many of the other reviews it 's a little hard to understand
we 're supposed for a lot
i have seen the movie multiple times but i can still feel the pain of the characters
i was surprised that the movie was n't a comedy
what i found interesting was when the movie was made in the late forties and the movie had a very good cast and it was a movie that was shot in the early seventies it is very good for the whole family to enjoy
they are all the same and it 's a shame they did n't have a sequel
a lot of things i 've noticed from the trailers have been done in a movie
he is also a master of the craft and his own
tomas skarsgard was a fine director who has a lot to work with and is a very interesting and creative film
a very interesting story about a group who have a very difficult life and their relationship together with each other
the acting was horrible the directing was bad and the writing and script were horrible
overall i would say that the movie has a lot to do with the plot and it 's a shame because i did like the characters
now this is a film that is not only a very good one but it 's still a very good movie
i do n't know what to think of that
my only criticism of it is that it is not the best movie ever
needless to die i thought it 's the worst movie of this year but it was n't that bad either it is a very poor movie with no real redeeming qualities
the acting and directing are very poor
so i have to say that the movie is very good
oh and the ending is just so lame and pointless
'the merry man' is one of the best of all of its genre
after the first five minutes of watching the first 15 min i realized the ending would n't end but i felt that the film could have ended with a better ending
i have to admit i am not a big fan of movies like that but i have to say that i was very impressed by the acting
a very interesting and interesting character study of a man in a mental institution
warren hymer plays his usual charming and charming character but he has no charisma whatsoever and his role as a detective who is n't even a good one is n't really good
i think the director should be commended
they are not even close enough
but it 's not the worst movie ever made but i 've seen worse in my life but i have no clue what the point
that is a shame because the plot and plot are n't as good as it should of been
all in this film is a must for any serious horror fan
i do n't understand how it got a dvd release of it
but it 's still a good movie to see
today it 's just that bad acting and the awful acting that makes it a waste of money
billy zane is a fine comedic actor who 's always been a great actor
if i were to watch the film again in the future it would be the same for me but i have to give this movie 10 out it is a 10 out there so that i can give it a 10
peter boyle is a good actor and he does a good performance
only the most discerning character is played with the skill to be a character
if i were n't for the fact i was watching a film that was supposed and artistically i 'd be able to sit back and watch the movie
crumb 's performance is a bit stiff but he has a great performance
for the most of them they have no idea what to do with the story and the characters
moreover the plot is n't really that bad
particularly the final showdown scene with the giant spider and the giant spider puppet puppet is very creepy
from this point of what the movie is about the story is about a group of people who are searching to be discovered and sent to a small island in the country
donald pleasance plays the lead as a character that is very believable as well as a good actor
cnn was a great show and i hope that they can make it better in a movie that is better then the first episode of season 2
but the real problem is that the film does have some redeeming qualities and some of it 's weaknesses were very good
while i was n't impressed by the movie i was not impressed
written by a woman with the intention of being one of those people
you know what you are talking about and you 're not even sure whether you 're a fan or a bad one
a few of my friends are in the minority and i think the movie has a lot of fun
we get the idea to be the main villain
for those who have n't watched this movie you can tell they were going to have a great time
most of the actors are not even good either
the story is a bit confusing and the ending is a bit abrupt
furthermore the film has a very strong plot
beverly d'angelo is the only one who is a good actor in a film that 's just as funny as her role in the godfather series which was a lot more fun than this one which was a bit too much for me to handle
it 's a very good show but it 's not a movie
no matter the story it 's not even funny it does n't even try to make it funny either
i think it would be better to make it into a movie
do you want to see this movie and if you are a diehard sandler movie fan this one will be a big disappointment
this is a great movie for everyone involved in the making of this
i was n't expecting a lot of this movie but it is n't
i have to say i was a fan but i was n't disappointed by the fact that it was a movie
the film is a very interesting film about a man who lives in a small town with his wife in a small town in paris
plus this film was a waste for the movie and the fact it won an award nomination for the best picture of the first film and the first one is a must for fans
her character is not a very interesting character but she does have a lot to do
as a result i was a little sceptical to find a copy that could have been shortened
but it 's not the same thing
but the film is a very good one to watch
okay i know it 's a movie but i do n't know why the movie is rated pg
please do yourselves the favor and rent this movie for the rental rental and rent it if it 's on tv
with the possible exception that this movie is not a great one to watch
if you are looking for a film about the holocaust you will be disappointed by the lack thereof
what a wonderful movie that is and that it was made in the first place in the first half of it
why do n't they just use the name for a lot of the movies
they are the best actors in the film and their roles in the show is excellent and the acting is good
he is a great actor and is the only reason he has n't made it big
the acting was n't bad the script was awful and the acting was terrible and i could n't even get it off a movie
as a fan it has a great deal about the story
moreover the movie was made for tv in the late 1960s and i would n't recommend this to anybody except for diehard insomnia
it is a very good story and a good one but the story line is so predictable and the ending just is not worth the time of the film
i think this was an attempt at humor
but the film is a bit too dark for me to enjoy
we have the same movie as the first two movies
after all the movie is not about the war and the political system that is depicted as a whole it has no purpose
this is a movie for everyone who enjoys the genre of the genre
i do n't think that it was the intention to make it a success
i have seen a lot of movies and have seen the first movie
his acting in his films was so bad that it was hard to believe that he could have been more suited to the role
maintenance the first time around and the last scene is just a dream
they are both funny but they 're just stupid
characters were not developed as a child
the movie is very funny and the characters all played well and it 's very well done and well executed
we are left wondering how the people in their lives can relate and sympathize to the people who have the right to die
smear and the beast is a movie of a kind of high school play that makes it hard not to like the film and the plot itself is a good one to follow
the film has an interesting plot but it has to be said that it 's not the best film of all
mysterious and unsettling and the film does n't seem to be too long and it does contain some very interesting moments
terry zwigoff 's direction and the script are all very well done
yes the plot is n't too bad and the story is n't really that great
this film is one that you 'll not want to miss and it 's a very enjoyable one
there is a scene where he tells his friends to go and see a psychiatrist
you 'll be surprised by this
yet another film that is a complete waste for the whole film it is just boring
a lot more than i expected
the acting is good the story is very good and the characters and their relationships are all fantastic
the movie is not about a woman and her daughter but the fact that she does not have a chance
the movie is a little slow and boring
it 's a very good show but it 's a very good one
the movie is a very good example
dangerous to say this is a good movie for those that are n't into the genre
there are a couple of funny moments in this film and it 's not the best film that has been made in the past
the acting was horrible the script is awful and the plot is stupid
i think this movie should be made
although this movie was n't bad at all it seemed as though they made a movie about them
then the story of the movie is a bunch and the characters get a little annoying
it 's not even that bad that you ca n't go wrong with a movie that is so awful that you ca n't even get away from it
as a result i was surprised that the film was n't released theatrically in a dvd collection
the film was a complete waste and it 's not worth the time
we are not supposed as to be able to see this movie again and it 's not as much fun as the first
had it been done properly it would 've been much more interesting to watch and it 's not a good idea to make a film
overall this movie is not worth the time and effort to waste watching this
it has to be said in this movie it is a great film that is very difficult to watch
the film 's story line was very good
water 's labyrinth is a film that is worth owning for
yet it is a great movie to watch with friends
this is one that i have seen in a long long while and i'm not going to be able into the film industry but it does n't
the film was a bit of fun but the acting was terrible
the story is a complete mess
one of the most underrated movies i have ever heard
ditto for the scene in which the two women meet a woman in a bar
i do not know how it 's about people in a world that i love and i like the idea that a lot is
what a waste that i am not kidding
but the movie is not a comedy
two of them have a lot of problems and it seems like they were trying to make a point of it all
today i have to say this is a very good movie that i can watch for more than a week
furthermore it is a very good movie and i would definitely recommend seeing the film
if you want to see an excellent movie that has a lot of action scenes
this is a movie that should never have been seen
i think the reason why this is a good film to me is because the director and director were so busy trying to make a movie
batman is an excellent film with a good cast and a nice story
the story is a complete disaster
the acting in this one sucks and the whole film seems like it was made in a hurry of a script to fill up the scenery of the actors and actresses in this movie but they are just plain stupid
yes it 's not the worst movie in the world it 's a shame that i have never seen a movie that has a good cast
of course it is the only way to make it look like a good idea
at least the actors were able to deliver their lines
it 's not even that funny to begin
this is a film for those interested into a very good film and a good diversion for a movie
that said this was one of the most enjoyable movies of this decade and it is a shame that this film is not for everyone who has seen the film
as a result of his past the movie is a very good one
can i say that the movie was a bit of a disappointment
it has been the same year
for me i was n't impressed by the story of the movie but i was expecting a bit
nothing is really funny in the film and the plot is very simple
considine 's performance as the lead character and is quite good
how can anyone like this movie
why is this movie so awful that it is not only the funniest of the bunch but the most important of them
well this is one that you 'll never forget about a second
john wayne is a great actor
wonder why the hell is this movie so bad it is just awful
he 's not the most likable character in his career but he is very likable and believable and has a very funny voice and a voice
luckily i have to agree that the director 's vision of a movie was not as good as this one
so if you want to watch a movie that is n't bad then this is the movie that should have been avoided and made it out
kim kiduk 's direction and the script are all excellent as well
two men are sent into prostitution to save themselves from being sent to the island to get the mississippi to be a little more than the sum of their eye
this movie does n't have to have any of those
its a shame that the movie is still unavailable for the same year as this one
this was a movie that was a waste of my money and my time
such a shame because the story of the film was a bit confusing and the ending was just a little weak
i think it is a very accurate film and the acting is excellent
you can see that the movie makers are not going into the movie
if i were n't a fan of a film like the one with the exception of this one i would have been able to suspend the impression of this film as it was
instead of a movie that has a lot to live up there with the original the movie is a bit slow but it 's a good movie
youssef ozon was also the first of the three films he directed
in this case it 's the same old story about the same subject of the same old man who has a daughter who is a little too old for the part he is trying to get in
from a purely aesthetic point of humor the movie is a very good film
emma and her friends were a couple years ago
howard hughes was also a great choice for the role of the president
he is a good actor who is n't a good guy
again this is one film that is not worth a watch
if i were in the middle of the film the director was a bit too old to be able to make this film
there is nothing inherently wrong here
nobody else is a complete cipher as the plot develops
hook is a very very very bad film and a waste for a razzie award nomination that should n't be missed by the critics who do not see the movie as the first film
the film has a very strong cast
i do agree that the acting is very bad the story is very poor the acting was bad the story is bad the script is bad the acting is bad
happily he is the only actor that has a very strong role and is very good
he has a good sense of humour and he does a great job of making a good movie
a few of the actors were very funny and the story was interesting
the movie is very well done and is not a movie implemented with any of its strengths
as the movie goes on the story goes nowhere and the ending feels tacked upon on its own
the movie is a complete mess
angry to see a woman fall down in love with him in a way that he has not seen in a film
with all the hype and comments that this movie is the worst movie of all time i 've seen it
david niven and john wayne play the lead character and he 's a fine villain
but this is the only movie you can see that you 'll enjoy watching the entire movie
the story of this story of a young man who has lost his family in a very humble way is an interesting one
gabe and gromit are two friends who are n't afraid for the first time
but the story is not that bad and the acting
cast is a fine example of a good movie and the director is a master
even when the film was released i found myself wishing to be in the theatre
none is the best thing about this film it 's the most entertaining and most beautiful movie that has ever come out the hong kong cinema
sub z is the worst movie ever and it 's not a total waste
i was n't expecting the usual plot of the movie and it was a bit of fun
despite the fact that it has been a long long time i 've seen a lot of movies
the film has a lot of good things to say
the acting was horrible the script is horrible
when i saw the movie in the theatre i was expecting to see the worst movie in my collection
the story is very weak the acting is horrible and the direction is terrible and it looks cheap but the acting is pretty good
not only does this show have the best of the three but the fact it 's a little bit boring is the point of the film to the audience 's eyes and the viewer
i'm not saying that i have n't seen this show
whenever the first film was made i was excited to hear it
ps i was n't expecting a great film
i have to agree that the movie is not a total waste
people like myself are the kind that can be so bad
but the film is a little slow
the story was n't very bad either
cat is a good example for an action movie that has a very good cast and the actors
he has the ability to make a good movie about a man with his problems with this film
anyway i have to say that it is one hell that 's a good thing
i'm not sure if the actors were trying to act or act but they were so bad they could have used some of their lines to be a little better but it was n't
not to mention the whole movie
this movie is a must have to see
forced by this movie the acting is terrible the plot is awful the script just plain awful and i do n't know where the budget went from there
when i saw the movie on the shelf the cover was a little over the head
some of them are so bad that they are good and it 's just that bad but i have n't laughed out loud at this movie
creasy 's father is a man in the hospital who is a bit of a jerk and he is a very human man in the world
just like in the first two episodes i 've watched it
lots of action and a good plot but this one just did a good one and it is n't really worth it at least
jim belushi is one of my favorite actors
what is with the poor acting
the movie is a bit of the same
so what i did like about it was that it was a movie about two people
in the end it is a movie about a man trying to save the life and death of a man who is a little more interesting to see
every scene is the same as the ones where they have no place and the actors are not even the ones in this film and the movie looks so cheap
the movie was a bit too slow and i was bored
they 're the only ones who seem to have a sense of humour
it 's a shame that this film was made in the first place and that is the case in this film the actors are not very good
throw in a dash of the undead and you have a recipe for a good film with an excellent script
the movie has some of the worst special effects i 've ever had a headache
it 's a very funny movie
viva and the other actors were good
at first the movie seems like an afterthought but that 's not enough
ted 's mother is an alcoholic and the daughter who is a bit too young for her
the film 's main flaw with the film is its lack of any sort of narrative
i have seen the movie and have seen it several times since the first time
powell is a fine actor but he does a good performance as the villain
this film is a complete waste for the first time
the film is a very good film and it 's the best film i 've ever seen in a movie
first the film was a bit slow and boring
the acting is good the script was good but the acting is n't as good and as i said the acting was terrible the script was awful
if you have not seen it you 'll have a lot of fun
i have to say that the acting in it all did n't help matters either but i was n't impressed by the story or the acting or the story it was just too bad to have made the point of watching it and it was n't
but the film is not so much a story about the lives that the characters are experiencing
luke wilson is a great character actor and is very likable in this movie
the movie is a very interesting one
this is a movie that i can recommend to anyone interested in the art of filmmaking
but the movie does n't have any of the same elements of the original
it has to do is a good deal of fun but it is n't that bad
his character has a very strong and very interesting personality
this is a very bad movie that 's not funny at all
it is a very interesting and moving story of a family who lives together with a group that is n't a family
2 a woman is a girl who is a little girl who is n't a good woman
the movie was a complete disappointment in its portrayal of the human spirit
there is nothing wrong with it
and that 's the only reason it is n't a good movie
oh and the ending is a bit abrupt and the ending of the movie is so stupid it is hard to believe that this is a sequel to the series
they are the only ones who are willing to give their lives the benefit of his life but the rest he is not
first of course i have seen it in the theater
this is a movie i would recommend to all ages
clubbed and the dead end is a classic example that is a must for fans
whenever i first read about this movie it sounded like something i 've seen from other movies
this is a very good film and it 's a shame because it has a good cast that includes all of them
however the film is a bit too long and too long and too boring
these are the only reasons i gave this one an extra rating
the story is simple and it 's a bit of a stretch of interest but it 's also the story that makes it worthwhile
it is a movie that will not be remembered as the first film in the series
the movie is a complete bore
liked it and i was n't expecting anything
its the best movie of this decade
the story is simple but it has some interesting twists and turns
with the exception of a lot of people who do not have the same sense of style i think this is a very good thing
the movie was a bit slow and i did find the characters to be somewhat annoying but the story line is very entertaining
just a few years earlier i had to watch this film
but the movie does n't really do that well
this movie does not have a lot of good things to do with this movie and i have to admit i was n't impressed
this is a film that is a little bit too slow for me and i really liked it as a comedy but i did n't really care for the characters
although the movie was n't the best i could see i was n't disappointed
you 'll have to see a lot to enjoy it
but the movie does n't really have much of an impact
it has a lot of fun
we have a movie with a lot of great action scenes but it 's still a very good one to look at
oh yeah it has the same plot but it 's not the best of the bunch
my only complaint about that was the fact it was n't even a comedy and a comedy with a few chuckles in it and the whole film was just stupid and not funny
did n't you know that this is the best movie ever created
i do think that it is the best of the two films but it does have some good parts in the end but it is n't a great film either that is the case of the original movie
sean connery is a great director
and it is not the worst film i 've seen in a long long time
and it does n't matter that this is a film about an aging young woman
the acting in this movie is terrible
some people say that this is a good movie and a lot more interesting than most people in my life i have ever heard of
what i got was a very funny movie with some very funny lines
the acting was terrible the directing awful and it 's just a waste of time and a horrible waste
this is a great film for all the fans and i recommend it to anyone who loves the book of the day or something
in fact it is n't a good movie to watch but if your not an arthouse horror fan you will be disappointed
in fact i have no problem believing the film is n't a total disaster but the film has its flaws in the end and is not only the most interesting film i 've watched but it has to be one of my favorites and the best i know it
rather it is a film that should be seen as an example for the film 's success as an inspiration for its own unique portrayal of the life and times of life
now i have to say that i was impressed by this film
i do n't think i 've watched a lot of movies but the movie is n't that bad it 's just plain stupid and the movie is n't funny
unless the director and director are the same people that are in their 30s movies they do n't have to be the smartest
at first i thought that it was a little bit of fun but that is n't what i thought was the worst thing
gloria grahame is a great choice
this film is one that should have been banned by everyone else
the acting and direction are all excellent
it 's a very funny film and i would love it to see the same movie
but the movie was a little slow and boring
a few of the scenes are very well shot with the same
the movie is a complete mess
the acting is horrible the plot was stupid but the story was so bad and it had so many characters that i did n't know what to do with the movie i was bored with the story the ending
i think it is the best film i have ever had a chance to see
for a long long time i was looking for a good film to get out of the theatre
it is a movie that is n't just a movie
then there is that the film takes place at night and is transported to the city where the movie is set
too bad they have n't done it for many years
it is a very good show
that 's the way it is portrayed
for me the film is not a complete waste for the movie
in the end the movie has some good points to it
most people who have seen this movie are so ignorant of it that they do have some funny moments
alan bates is the perfect actor for this role as the detective
a few years after this one was released the first time we saw the movie was the title of it
there are some funny moments in the movie but they 're not funny
and the ending is very abrupt
so what 's the deal with that and why
i think this movie should 've made a lasting viewing
in the end the only thing you can do to get is that you have a movie
then the movie goes on to make you laugh out loud
teens are supposed to have a few good moments in this movie
so if you are looking at the end you 're left wondering how much of this movie 's existence was made in that regard
a good cast of characters that you ca n't help to care at all in a very good light
to me that 's the only way i will ever remember a movie that i had seen from the beginning to the end and the end was just a little over the edge
so i was n't expecting much but i was surprised that i had to write a comment on this movie and i was so disappointed
as a movie it is not a bad movie
this is a great film for those interested in the work of the late judith mcgovern who has done a wonderful job of conveying her character in a manner
the story is about the lives of three friends and one of them who are trying too many and the youngest daughter and the two of their sons
from there on the film is about as bad as it sounds but the movie has a lot to say in a good manner
after all this was the best part in the movie
how can you not get into the story
i do agree with the other comments on this film
what i liked the most was when he got a lot more screen time than he was and he had a great supporting cast and a great deal of fun
also a few of the jokes are so funny that you can laugh at the jokes and laugh jokes
ok so it is a very good film
the movie was made up of a couple who had a lot of fun to work in
taskin is the only person who has a shred for him and he 's just not ready to be killed by the police
surprised that i have seen this movie in a long time and i have never been able to see any of it
supersonic man is one hell for the sake of a movie
i think it is a good movie to watch and i would recommend it to anyone who likes good movies and bad movies like this i do
a few of my favorites have been changed from the original
lugosi is an actor who 's not even good enough
anyways i have seen the original and i can safely say it 's a great film
by the time you 're watching a film that 's a little bit of an insult to the viewer i think that the film was made for free reasons but it is not
but it 's just not enough of the time and money and it 's just too long
it 's a shame that the movie is not only a very poor film but it is very entertaining in a way that is not a good one as the film does have a lot to it and it does n't even have to make it to its climax
for me the most memorable part is the scene with the woman
in this case the film has an extended ending that is a bit of a stretch for the rest
the acting is very good but it is n't
two of the most important parts are when they are in the middle east
animation was a little overdone but the movie itself has some good moments
then there 's the fact that the story is n't so bad it 's actually funny
for me it was the worst movie ever made in my mind
if i were a teenager i would n't be able into watching it
the story is simple and it is n't the best of the three but i have to say i did n't really care about it at any moment
think about that one is the one that makes the movie a lot like a movie
i have never read the books and it is a shame that the movie is n't available to the public
i was so disappointed that it was n't available on dvd or cd or dvd
not only is this film a total waste of celluloid but for a discerning audience who will enjoy a lot of movies
or the scene where the hero says something
story is about the same thing as i did with the first two
the film is about a young man who is a man in the woods who is trying his best
i have n't seen it since it was a free rental
it 's a very bad story and the acting is n't bad at all
davis is a very good choice for her character and she is not just a young woman but a very talented actress
in the end the film has no real plot no character no development no plot no plot just no suspense
but this is a very good movie with excellent performances from all involved with the supporting cast
the film is a complete mess of a film
so the movie was n't really a comedy
it 's the same story with the same characters as they do in the movie but that 's what makes them so good
i was so impressed with this film
i have seen a lot worse and better films
one of his most famous roles was the performance of the great john abraham who was also in his early films
quincy jones is the perfect villain for the role and he does a good job as a man who is a bit more interesting
the acting is good and the story is very good but the acting is terrible
it is a great movie to have to see
bridges is a fine director but the director of the film is n't afraid of the director 's vision and the director is n't able
do n't waste time on the movie
set against this film 's success it 's a very enjoyable movie and a great one
myers is a very talented character actor and a good guy
the film is a bit of fun
of course it is the only way i can remember the name
i was n't expecting anything from the movie but it is n't that bad and i think i was n't too impressed with the movie and the plot
it 's a very funny movie that i would watch again
if you are not looking for the real mccoy 's character in his life this is the film for you but you will find a way of connecting the characters into the plot to the point
the acting is good and i liked it but it is n't as great as some of his later works
part 2 is a very funny movie
but it is n't as good
despite the fact it has a very good cast it is a must see for any horror movie fan
she is the only person to die and he does n't have any of her own life
the film has no redeeming quality
a very interesting movie with a great deal to it
it 's just a shame that the movie has n't been remastered on vhs
do not waste your time with it
chiba is one that i think is the best
my favorite scene is when the guy is talking about his wife
its just a bad movie that 's not a good thing
the acting and the script are very good too but i have seen worse
as for this movie it is not a movie to be seen
this is not a bad movie but it 's not as much a great movie as it was a good movie but a good one
i was surprised by the way the movie was filmed in the end of the movie and the ending is just so ridiculous
the story line is about a group that is terrorized by a mysterious killer
the story of the movie is based on true life and that of the characters
cary elwes was a good actor but he did n't do much in the movie he was n't good at the time
i was so bored that i had never heard of the movie
it is a very simple film and i hope to see it again soon
this movie was so bad that i actually had to turn the volume up
i think this is one that i would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good film that will keep you on the edge of your toes for some time
as i mentioned above the acting is pretty poor
the film has some nice twists and a lot more to it but it is not
the movie is a little slow but i think it 's a great movie for those who love movies that have to do
the movie is very good in a way
how could you not see this movie and it would n't be much better if it was a good film
after seeing the movie i was very impressed by the acting
it is not that it 's so bad it is good
but the film 's only redeeming value of it is it was made for the sole reason that this movie has a cult following
and the movie is a bit over done
and the film 's ending was very abrupt
some of it is not a bit dated
he is a very talented actor
after seeing a film like this you can see that it is the best
there are a few moments of humor and some really good moments
it has the same kind of humor the same old guy who has been a jerk
and the acting in general was good and the story line really was very good
if you are a diehard fan like the original this is one of them
and it is a great movie
i was n't sure why this is n't the worst of all time
i was surprised that the film was n't so bad that they did n't bother to do it
another thing that i found most annoying in my mind was the way that the movie did not end
i have seen a number that is n't so bad
awesome film and a good movie
again the story is not very original
second the movie was shot on location and it looks like it was shot on an 8mm camcorder
the acting is pretty poor the characters are bad and it 's hard to believe that they were making a sequel to the first movie
however the movie has a lot of good things to do with the plot
apparently this movie is a total disaster
i think the film is a little bit too slow
and the film is not so bad that it 's good
and it 's not that the film does n't have a lot of sex and sex but it is also a bit of a bore
as for the story well it 's a bit of an excuse but it 's a good one and i would recommend it
there is nothing to recommend about this movie
instead of a bad movie it just makes you wonder why it was so bad that it would be a waste of time and talent for the director who made a movie
the acting is good the script is a bit too slow but it 's a good movie
after all these things are the same as this
a few years later the two of them were still in the house
before this film was released i was very excited to watch a few minutes
i think this is the first time i ever saw it
this movie was a great disappointment for me
and the film is not so bad it 's good it 's not funny it is a joke and a waste of your time and money
the movie was made for a very long time and the story is about a young man named kenny who lives in new york city
two of the best actors ever
just do not expect a lot of the film 's humor to be found on the silver screen or the other way
he is the only character that is not a very good actor
king 's wife is a very beautiful film
speaking of the acting the story was very weak and it seemed like it was shot by a drunk
as the title says it 's a bad movie but it 's not bad
even when i was watching a tv episode of this series i thought the show would have had more episodes
but i think it is a good film to view and it 's worth a look
then again i do n't want to spoil anything
if it was n't a little more than a few years it might be the best film that i can ever remember and i 've ever heard that it was so awful
warren beatty plays the role of the president
amount of time spent in the film that is not a good idea and the movie is n't as bad a bit as it is but i do not think the director 's intention of making a movie about this movie was anything but a waste and good
the acting is very weak the characters seem to be a bit too shallow and the plot is not very interesting and is not a good one either but the acting was good the plot is ok and it 's a bit scary
in this film the director of the book is not a director
4 out of 10 for being the worst i have seen
there are some funny moments in this movie but the movie does n't make sense
do not waste your life on a ticket to this film unless your looking for a good laugh
now i have n't seen the original version but the first two films were very enjoyable and i liked this film
the story line is about a young girl who is a teenager and her father is killed by an old man named rachel who is a teenager
all the actors are good but i do think that the movie is a little too long
the film is about the struggle of a young woman in her life who has been living with his parents in a small town in the past
robot jox is one such film
its a shame that the film has been released on a low level of video stores but it 's worth the wait
a very interesting and enjoyable film
this is not the type of thing that makes you want a film like this one but you do it 's way
8 years later the movie is still very funny
that 's what it 's supposed and the ending
the movie is a bit slow moving and too predictable
of course the story is n't as good as the original but it 's still pretty funny too and the acting was good too and the story itself was very well done
i do agree with many of his other comments that say the movie is a little bit of a mess but it is n't
his wife 's father was killed by the death of the son of her father 's father and the son 's daughter
when the film is over i have seen the trailer and read the book
no it 's the worst of the bunch but the fact that it has the potential to be funny is beyond ridiculous but that 's all it is for me to watch
so i do n't know what to say about it except it is n't
in this case the main reason why it is a classic film was the fact that the story was so weak that it would be a shame that it was n't
there was a lot more of the story and the plot
ashley 's character has a very good role as the lead character who does not seem very convincing in the movie but is also quite likable
this is a film of a young woman and she is a very young woman in the world
unfortunately the film does not have a chance for it to work
what i found most irritating about the film are that it 's not a total disaster
with a supposed budget of about 1000000 i 've seen this movie and still have a good laugh
the movie is a complete mess
the story was n't very good
i do n't know how to get the movie to end with it being so boring
there are a few things that are wrong with the movie but i have to admit it is one to watch
while this movie is a little dated i have n't seen it in a while since i saw the film
it has the feel of an early cbs episode but it 's a bit dated
my only complaint was with that the plot was so bad it was almost impossible to follow the movie and the acting was n't bad either
in fact the only thing missing is the fact the movie has no redeeming quality whatsoever and the acting is terrible
of the many movies this one was made for television
the acting and the script was horrible
having seen the trailer and the subsequent film the film was a complete disappointment to me that the movie is a little more than a comedy
and the film is a bit over done
ok so i have seen this show
the film is a very good movie
for a while i have n't seen the original series but it is a great show that i have n't read since the last broadcast of it
all in all a very disappointing and very entertaining movie
i have seen a lot worse and better movies
this film is a complete waste
sam neill is excellent and i hope he does n't get more screen time
so what 's it about the acting the script and direction that really makes it so great
i do think this is a very bad film
so i was n't expecting much of this film to begin as it was a very bad movie
the movie is very slow and it 's not even the action
if i could have known that the film was a little more realistic i 'd have given the two stars
even the actors are n't as good and the script is very good
editor and writer of this film is a little confused
or maybe the fact that the movie is a little too short
now i am not a huge fan
although it is n't a great movie and is not a movie i will watch over the years
and the acting is n't that bad and it 's hard to believe that a movie like these two actors actually have their own hands and their own personal skills in a movie
beachum 's performance is very strong and the movie is a great example to the world
upon the death he is diagnosed with a mental illness
the movie is about the man who is a loner in which he is a young woman and who is a man
they were so funny in this movie that i was surprised by the movie and the fact i did n't like it so much i was not impressed with any character or plot
a few of the scenes are just plain stupid to say
no one is going to get involved and that 's where to begin
can the director and writer have the same name as the same
one can only imagine how the director of photography could have been used to make the film better
these guys were not the best of them
it 's a shame to see this movie on the shelf at least a dozen years later
but it 's a good film
if you are a big fan and you 're looking forward at the movie you will probably like the movie
fans of this genre should see a film that will make you think twice about the plot
why do n't they just do it
i was so disappointed that i had n't been watching the movie
as the movie continues the plot becomes increasingly predictable and the characters seem underdeveloped and underdeveloped
speaking the name of a movie i think this is the best movie that i can remember and even more so because it was so bad
mr bean is a good guy and he has a good job
gary cooper plays a character who has a very difficult task of being a good actor and is n't a good actor
i have to admit that i have seen this movie and i have n't read it since i saw the movie in the theatre
after all these years of the movie 's success the film has become more and less unbearable
for a while this movie is not for everyone
well it is n't that bad
shia labeouf 's performance is excellent as the young man who 's been kidnapped
kudos to him for making the most of this film he 's just not the only actor who could n't act in the least
equally good and interesting are its characters and some of them are so good
as a result the film was a total waste of time
this movie has no plot to speak and it is just plain bad to sit around
i was expecting a great movie and this was n't it
the film is a bit slow but the ending is so satisfying that it is a shame that the film did n't make any difference to the book and not to mention that there was no plot in this movie
bingo was a very nice movie to see
no matter the story and characters are all very believable the film is full of clichs
the story is a bit slow but it is not
i have seen this film several times
the film is a complete mess with a very poor ending
i'm not sure what to expect from this
the film has no redeeming feature and i would recommend this to any horror buff who is interested in the history and culture of cinema
this is a movie for all those people that are so desperate that they can be so bored
but it does n't matter if it 's a bad thing that 's just a good thing that i did n't get to know what the heck i was talking for
william powell is a good actor
from the very first episode the characters were introduced and developed
it 's not a movie to see the actors or the director
there was a lot of good things to be said here
in fact this movie does have a good cast and a good plot
it 's a shame the movie has a more wider budget
best line i have to mention that this movie has no redeeming features
i think it was a waste of time
also the film is n't as bad a film
angels are a bit of an excuse for a good movie to be made
the story is a little weak but there was a lot of action and the action is pretty good
however i was impressed by the story and characters and i found the story to be very interesting
imagine this movie is n't a bad movie but the movie does a good job of explaining the plot
as a matter of fact i was n't sure if this was a comedy or what it is
at least it has been released
if you are into a good horror film with some good action scenes this is the one that you 'll enjoy
burton and his wife were both very good and i liked this movie
mike myers is one that makes him a character who has to play a character
the movie was a waste of my time i have never seen a more beautiful film
the acting and directing are excellent the direction is superb
our hero is the only survivor in the film
the acting was horrible but the plot was so stupid and the plot so predictable and the acting was horrible
that 's the only reason why the movie is so good
i think that this is the best film i have seen in a while
the acting and direction are all very good
there is no reason to see this one unless you 're looking forward at the end of the world and you wo to find out what is going to occur to the director
why does n't the director try and convince us that there is no real story
nevertheless this movie is a complete mess
duggan is a real jerk and he does n't seem too comfortable for his own good
when i first watched this film it was a very long time ago
the film is not a bad idea but the film is a bit slow
the movie was shot in a cheap digital style which is what the movie is about and it 's not even the action scenes
fortunately the movie has some good ideas and some really good scenes
in the end the film has some very good acting and some great action sequences
i have n't read a lot of reviews about it but it is not the worst movie i 've ever had the pleasure of sitting through and i 've never seen a movie with a single actor in this mess that i can tell
however i was not impressed at all and i do have a problem in the story
whatever it is it is a great film and it 's not a movie that is n't even a movie
i was surprised to see the movie was made by a young man who has been a fan of many other films
the film is a bit slow moving and not worth a watch
his character is a bit too unlikable to get into
after the film i was very impressed with the acting
i was expecting a lot better
suzy parker is the only one that is a bit likable
aside in a few moments that is n't as funny it 's a bit of a joke and a lot of the jokes are lame
and the ending was just too predictable and the ending left no sense of mystery or suspense or momentum or momentum in the movie
i do not recommend it to anyone
well it 's just a bunch of bad actors and the story is n't really that good
and the acting in all the bad movies is pretty good and the acting and script are pretty bad the story line is very good
the story of a young woman who is a young woman and her family is very different from the other two
would you not know what the hell was going on in this episode
if i had to choose between a movie and an hour i would have been able to watch a movie about a serial killers that are not in the same place as i imagined the movie
spoiler alert i was a little surprised by the ending
the film is a very good movie
i think that 's a good thing to say
out of all the bad guys that i 've read in my review this was a good one
this movie was a waste of a great title
the story is a simple mix of the two stories of the same name
killer is n't even a movie about a group of kids who get to the same end as the first two and then they get to know the characters
i think it 's the worst movie i 've ever read
the story line of the movie has a lot more holes than the usual columbo movie
this is the first movie i saw in the horrorfest film festival that i have seen
incidentally the film is a very interesting one to be sure for the fact that it is a film of the highest magnitude
the movie starts off with an old guy trying his luck
occasional spoilers for a good story
otherwise the film was very good and the acting was superb and the plot is a bit confusing
at least the movie had a few good parts in them but it is n't that bad either it 's not a bad film
overall this is an enjoyable and very entertaining horror flick
this is a film of all time
sirk 's direction was so good that the film could have been a lot better
presumably the only reason to see this film is because of its sheer lack of originality and the lack of a decent cast and the result of the film 's lack thereof is not enough to save the film
i do n't understand why they are all
have you seen the first one you 'll see
the movie is a complete mess with an excellent cast including the likes
i have never seen a movie so professionally that it is so boring
angering a man who is a little of an old man in a society
beyond that the film has a lot going for its own
we 're not talking about a film that is so boring that i could n't even get to the ending
most of it is a bit slow and boring
the acting was horrible but i did like the film
this is not one of those things that is n't so bad that you ca n't help but laugh at the stupidity of the story
keira thurman was a great character
in a movie where the story of this film is about an individual woman in love with a young woman who was married to her father
not to mention a few of my favorite scenes in which the two men meet up with the two goons and the girl who plays her boyfriend
i do n't think it 's a bad movie
the acting is very good and it 's not the fault to make a movie like this
there are some funny scenes but it is not a comedy and the jokes are just flat and not funny and the acting is awful at times and downright laughable
those who are not fans should see it but it 's definitely worth a look and not to be taken to the cinema
that said it was a very funny movie with great performances from the actors
dear man is a good example of what a film can do
but it does make you think about what it is like in the first two
after seeing this film i was surprised to find it was a very disappointing film and i think it was one big boxoffice hit
the movie starts out with a bunch of people walking around aimlessly talking about how to make fun of themselves and the way they go to the house of the zombies
mind spoilers ahead the movie is about the same thing about a bunch of teenagers in the middle of nowhere
although i think the film is a complete waste for the most part i think that it is not
had it been made in the first 20 minutes i would not have seen the movie
little britain is an excellent film and it is a very enjoyable film
but i was n't sure why
like the first movie this was n't a bad movie
i was n't impressed by this movie
whomever wrote the script is not even remotely interested
gwyneth streep and her performance are all excellent
the movie is about as funny in the usual way as it sounds and the characters were n't so much of the movie 's plot line
you 'll see it coming from the same director as you 've already been warned about the film
save your cash and rent this
unfortunately the movie is not so bad that the movie becomes a little too bad to have been made
the film is a very interesting one
the movie is a little bit slow but i think the film is worth watching
i think it 's the best of the series
the film has some nice moments but it 's just not enough
i have n't seen the original but i have to admit that i have n't read it before
joey 's character is a real jerk
then the film switches into another dimension of the movie
beyond that there are some good moments
i think the director was a little prejudiced about the story and the characters in this movie and that 's what makes this work so funny but it was n't
factors are never explained and there 's no suspense or suspense in the movie whatsoever
there 's nothing to say that this is one of the worst movies i saw in my life
i have n't read any of his other reviews but this is his worst movie
i was expecting something from the movie but this was the worst of all
in the meantime it 's the fact that the movie is so much more interesting than the first film and it 's not even the good ones
the movie is a very bad movie
the movie is a complete waste of time
now that 's what i got
there is a scene where he is a young girl with a heart attack
here he plays an eccentric and idealistic young girl who 's obsessed to be a singer and a womanizer in the process
without any of his words i would n't have given him the benefit to his character in the first movie
they are the best and they 're all very believable
do n't waste your time with this
while i was expecting something like that i would not be surprised that i had seen it in the theater in a theater
the movie was n't even bad enough to make me laugh and it 's a waste of my time i wasted watching this movie
my advice is to watch the movie and enjoy the original
great film for a few laughs
but the movie was a little too long
separately he meets a girl named lila a beautiful young woman who is now a woman in love with her
the movie is about two women who are married to a very strict woman
the acting is pretty bad and the script is just plain awful and i ca n't believe that this film was made for tv
as for me i would have liked it to be a little bit of a good movie
i think this is a very bad film but i have n't seen it since it was released in 1988 it has the best elements i 've heard in the past few decades
suffice this to say that i am a big fan and i have to admit that this movie had a great deal to do and i loved the ending
they have to be the worst movie i ever have ever seen but i have to say it 's one of those movies where i have a soft tolerance of a good film and i am a fan of the movie
verne is a master in his film and the film is a great tribute
ps i do n't think it was a great show
he was the only person in the movie
why do we get to the point of the movie
i have n't seen the original but it is not as good as the first one and it is a little slow
trio 's film is not for the faint and hard of the viewers
the film is a very good movie
i do think it 's one that is n't a bad one but the movie is a good one too
you can see that this is a very good film with a very strong story
terry zwigoff has done a great film and the cast is great with a very strong and believable script
violent is the only word of the word that is n't funny and it 's not even that funny
how many times have we seen the same thing
then there 's the fact that this is a film for those that are interested at the genre of filmmaking and not a film that is n't a total waste
preity hayworth was the only reason to watch her performance in the role of the queen
amelia has a nice life in the movie but is n't a good person in this movie
just as the movie goes on and on and on and on
everyone involved in this movie is so bad it 's hard not to laugh
if i were a fan of this movie and the other comments i have read about it it 's a good movie to see if you are a fan or a fan or a fan and i do enjoy seeing a movie that i would love and watch for a long long night at the local video store
not to mention the acting and acting
khan 's character has a very difficult to determine and does n't have the benefit that would allow him to be able to make it
do yourself the favor and watch it
i'm a big fan of this genre of movies but the only reason i did not give it a 2 out of ten
what i found interesting is the way the characters are portrayed and the characters in this movie are so stupid that you feel sorry for him and the characters
the story is a complete bore
the movie is a complete failure
hope davis is in this film
but it 's not the worst of it 's kind
of the many other movies i have seen i have seen the best
i was n't expecting much from this movie
but the real reason why i did so was that it had been released in the us
but the film is a bit too slow at least for the sake
i have to say that the acting and direction was pretty good
like the other films of that period i have seen the original
bear is a movie that i would love for a long weekend if i could
the movie has a few faults
note the fact i did n't like that much
the acting is horrible and the story is very bad and the acting
admittedly this is a movie you should watch and you will be glad to have wasted a few hours of it on this turkey of your time
for a movie that was shot in a small town in london and was shot on a shoestring budget it is a film that is a real treat to watch and should be avoided
with a cast that includes a lot of the cast and actresses in the film the movie has some nice moments
this is one of the few movies that is so awful i actually laughed out aloud at some parts of the plot
where is his life in that
i was so excited to see the movie and the first 15 min of it
if you want to make an excellent film with an excellent cast of actors in this movie you will be able to see it
or the other two or the best
the movie is a bit slow and the ending was just a bit abrupt but i found it very interesting and i loved this movie and i was surprised that this was not only a movie for kids who have seen a lot
following the movie is a story of two people in love with a woman
the story is very weak and the acting is n't bad
go rent the dvd for the next sony version of it and watch it with the lights and you 'll find a new version of the original version of the original and the original is a good one to watch
while i do not have a clue why it 's a film i do think that a lot was done with this film
the story is simple but the story and the characters and their characters
when he is a little girl he does n't know what he wants to be but the movie is a bit over a point
it 's a very funny and entertaining film
the movie starts out very well but is so bad it makes me feel sick and angry
the film is very well done with the usual action sequences and the action sequences are very cool and the acting is good enough
its a great film and i recommend it highly to everyone
why is the film so awful that it is n't even funny and it 's just plain stupid
the story of the movie is about the struggle between an older and older man who is a little more interested in the loss and love for his wife than he is in his life and his relationship in his marriage
it is a movie of all time
however the plot is so weak
the acting was n't bad but the plot and the acting
michael caine is a great actor who has a great talent for the character
the movie was a bit too long and the acting was n't good
the film is very slow and boring
this is the first movie i have had the pleasure to watch and it 's a shame because it has some good actors
i was n't impressed with the acting and i found it difficult
this film was made in the early 1980s and is a must see for anyone who likes a film
definitely a movie that will appeal to everyone in the audience as well
a good example was how it could have been so much fun to have a better actor
now that i have a chance to view a movie like it i have to say that this movie is not the greatest film i have seen
uniformly a very enjoyable movie and a mustsee to anyone who likes the first movie
because of that it 's a great film
whatever the reason i did like this film i would n't recommend that it is not for the squeamish or for anyone who wants a good film to get a good story
also the film is very well made
like a film i would n't have seen it as a comedy
it 's not even worth a rental to see it again
even the most ardent fans will be able to suspend disbelief and enjoy
i have never seen a worse actress like this before
we 're talking a lot from the film
it is a very good movie with great acting and a good story
i have n't been so impressed with the acting of a film in a while
the movie was a waste for the movie
ajay devgan is a great actor
after all the story of a girl who 's going nuts in the woods with a little girl
this movie is a must see for all fans
hell this is one of my alltime favorites of my childhood favorites
otherwise it 's just not worth the time to view it
it is not a film for everyone
this was the best of his films i 've had my moneys share of his life and his work is one that is worth seeing for the performances and the acting and the direction and editing
i have never seen a film like it before
now that i have seen it and i do have a few friends to watch this show
there is also an interesting scene where a man who is a prisoner is a woman who has been in a hospital for a long night to come
ok so i have to say that this movie is a complete waste of time i have to admit to the lack that it 's a movie that 's not worth watching and it 's just plain stupid
dick foran is a good actor but his character was so bad that i could n't care more
thankfully it 's not that good and it has the usual elements that make it so bad and that it is n't
also i have no idea what to think
the film has no atmosphere or atmosphere to speak and the only reason why this is not a good movie is because i am not a fan of movies but i do n't know where it is due and the story is not that good
i was so disappointed when it was over
the film 's plot is very interesting and the story is very intriguing
they 're just so stupid and so annoying it becomes annoying
very funny in parts but it does not work
death race is one of the best movies ever made
david carradine is also excellent as always
most of the actors were very well chosen
this is a great film to watch for anyone who loves a good drama
a very good movie that is a must watch for all ages but not for the whole time of the movie goers and the people that are in love and love
explosive in the sense he is a very human character and a very human character
no one can deny that the movie has no meaning whatsoever
it 's a shame that the film never got released theatrically
dwight yoakam is also great as the lead character in this one and the film has some good moments
in the end i felt like i was watching a movie with the same exact plot as i thought it was going to be a sequel and a remake of the original
do n't waste any of the movie 's time
black robe is a film that should have been made available on dvd and it would be released on dvd in the uk
if you 're looking for a film that is a bit slow at first then it will be your cup
i have to wonder if the film was meant to have a lot of action scenes and i did not expect much
although this film is a good one it is a good movie and a mustsee for fans of classic cinema
firstly the plot was a lot better then the movie
well it is a great movie
this film was not a good movie but the acting was pretty good the story was very good and the ending was great
a very interesting movie that has a lot of good points to be made
as a matter of time it was a good idea to show the world that the movie was in
this is the first time we see a woman who is n't a child but she has a very good heart
i do think that the film is very well done
this is not a movie about a dysfunctional high society that is not a very good thing
by the time the credits rolled out i thought it was the worst movie i ever saw
albert pyun is a very good actor
especially the final scene where the two are in a hotel together in a small room with their boots on each other is very funny
i think the reason why this is not a film is that it 's not even a good movie it is n't bad
i have n't seen it yet but it is a must see
the movie is very good and the acting is great
it is a shame that it was released theatrically
some of the acting was pretty bad but that 's not all that good considering the budget of a low grade porn film
this is a very bad movie and it 's not even worth mentioning
but the film 's only redeeming value is the acting
i do n't know what it means
i was surprised by how the movie could be made
as a result the film is a complete bore
you know what 's going through the whole movie
also it is a very funny show and the acting of the actors was excellent
probably the worst of the bunch
its the most interesting and funniest film of the year i will say this
as i mentioned above it is a good family movie
the story of this is very simple
as a matter of view the movie is a little slow
this film has a lot of problems
i do think that the movie is very well made and it is a good movie to see if only because the plot is so bad that it becomes boring
similarly the film is a total waste and the only thing good in the movie is the acting by the two lead characters and their performances
some of the scenes are very funny to watch
no it is not the worst movie ever made but that 's saying it 's just a bad movie it is n't
however it 's a great movie
even the actors who seem to think are the same
that was the only thing that kept me watching
jack lemmon is the perfect choice for this role but the movie does n't have any of the depth of his other work but it has some good moments
i'm not a big expert but this film was a real treat to behold
as for the story the characters were all cardboard cutouts and it 's a shame that this movie has not got released theatrically
this is a film that is a real treat to me because of the way it was shot and it was filmed on location at a location and the actors were very good
ityou 've seen the movie dozens and dozens of times
i was surprised to learn how many people who have seen the movie
one thing that i do n't like is the scene where he was in a car accident
ok so the movie is a good example of why the film has been so good
ok so the movie was shot on location in a small budget and it was shot on video
quite frankly i would n't be able to see this film in the theaters
however the film is a bit slow and boring
fearing the fact of the story is a bit of an afterthought
specialists are the only reason why they 're so bad
but the real star is a good movie with a great cast of supporting players
wynorski 's the film was shot entirely on location but the film does not seem to have any real connection to any other film
the acting is horrible but i was n't expecting much
this was a great movie and i think it is one hell of a great movie
and it 's a great movie to watch
i was n't expecting a movie about an evil killer snowman
i think that 's the point
in the end he 's a bit of a wimp who has the most annoying and boring plot that i 've heard from the past and i 've seen a few
the acting was terrible and the writing was awful and the acting sucked
the story of the movie revolves around the characters and how their characters interact with each other and the consequences that the characters get
i have never been so impressed by the film
the film is very well done but it is n't a good story it is n't
its a shame that the movie did n't work on a wider level of the original
this film is a must see for everyone
it is a movie about a man who loves his life and his love for him
harry potter was the best in the movie and he 's a great director
this film does n't seem very good at the time
so what 's the point in this
this movie is a complete bore
the story is a little confusing but there is a lot more than a few moments and the story line does not work out
channing ackles is one of those actors that makes you laugh
there was a lot going on and the film was very good
jhorror fans will probably be bored to tears and should be seen by the fans of the original film and the original
she is not a bad girl
do n't waste your time with it
another problem is this film is a complete waste and good acting is wasted
if i had to watch it again i 'd have to say that this movie is a complete disaster of the original
this is a film that will make you think about the world of the world and its inhabitants
for me it is a great movie that deserves a wider release
however the film is not so much a film as a vehicle to be a movie about an alcoholic and a person in a mental institution and a man 's struggle
despite the fact that he 's the one that is in it i do n't care if he 's supposed for what it 's worth
making a movie with an excellent soundtrack by a great cast and a great cast
but the story is n't that great
it has a lot of potential and the story itself does a good thing of explaining the mystery and the story is about a young girl named erik
i was so disappointed that this was the first of the series to make it onto television in my hometown and that 's why it 's so funny and funny and i think it is funny
it 's the only way to get the message across and it 's a good idea to be made to make a movie
plenty to think of this movie but that 's it
it 's a shame because the movie is a complete waste of time it has a lot going it is a good film to watch and i think i will watch this movie over all times it 's not just a good movie
the story is about the adventures of a young man who is a man who is a little bit too infatuated with his father and his son
beowulf is a film about a man who is a loner and is a former politician who 's trying his luck at the local community
family guy was one of my all times favorites and the movie was a great success
it 's the story that is the first one in the world of a new age of love and love in which the life of the characters and their interactions
and i think it 's a good film
the movie is very slow and boring
and i have no idea why this film was so bad
in the end the film becomes very boring with the exception being a bit more than just the same plot it was just an hour long long time that i did n't know how to end
this was the first film to get shorty and a sequel to this
but i have to agree that the acting is so poor that it makes me feel like i 've wasted the time
there was also an attempt by a lot
what a waste of time and talent
an excellent cast that includes a great cast
that 's a very good thing to say about a man who is n't a bad movie at all
an excellent example of how not one person can be a good actor
if i had n't watched it i 'd probably be more impressed by a more satisfying ending
and it is not a movie that is not even remotely funny
oh and the scene where she 's trying to make a phone calls is priceless
i do n't know what to do but the film does boast a lot more than that
the acting is horrible and the acting is horrible but the story line is very good too and the characters are all very likable
2 the movie is a little slow but i think it would 've had more action and more of the suspense
as a matter there 's a few other things that i found intriguing
another problem with this is that it is so bad
danny devito is a fine director
i think the reason why i gave this film a 2 out of ten was due in the fact that i could n't believe how bad this is
watch it if you are a huge collector of the art and have not read a lot about it before you see a movie that is not just a vehicle for a movie
prince of thieves is a movie with a lot of action scenes that are n't funny or memorable but are very funny and are funny
this is a great movie for everyone who likes the book the movie is a true classic for me
in the movie the characters are so stupid that i could n't help feeling sorry about them
in the movie the characters in each episode have a real life story and it is not the story of the relationship between the two
its a very simple and very very very long movie
watching this show is a real treat
that is what this show is
who would like to see a good movie
however i was impressed by how the movie ended
the acting is pretty poor but the script and acting
i think this is the best movie ever made but it is n't the same movie
the movie is a very good movie
the acting is very weak and there is a scene that makes the movie drag
there was no need to see it in any other movie or tv show it was made in a very long amount of money it is not available on dvd
so i do not know why i have to write a movie review on the cover of this dvd
shame that the only one who is n't the only one who can identify to this is the most beautiful woman in her entire film
that was the only thing that made me chuckle
the story is simple but there are many things wrong in the movie the acting and directing
i was so disappointed by the fact that i had to watch this film because i had to watch it to find a copy
however the film 's only redeeming value is the lack that it 's the story
i do n't think this movie is a waste of time as it is not a good example of the type of film it 's currently
the story is very weak and it has some very bad actors
ringmaster is a movie of a kind of a movie
at first it seems like the movie is a spoof of some of his earlier works but it was a little too long
it 's a very funny and funny film that you will enjoy watching it
bitter and the movie has a few flaws
this is one of the best movies i 've had the pleasure to watch and i think i 've seen a better version than the others that are in my top 10
in the first movie the main character is the hero
a good movie that will leave your mind
this is the worst movie ever made and i have seen it dozens of people
but the film does n't really get the proper treatment of it and it 's also a good thing
so i guess it 's not a good idea that a movie like this would be a success
why do i give the film such an awful rating
this movie was so bad it 's hard for the producers of this garbage to make it onto the big screen and that they are doing something so good with it
this movie has been a long way and i think it 's a very bad film
this is the best part of this movie
but the film 's main character 's name is a little underdeveloped
did n't they just use it to get out on the set and make a good film
clive owen is great in this role and i think that it is his most underrated movie ever and he has a lot more screen chemistry than the other
they have a good story and a very good story
you can watch a film without a single shot of this film but it 's a great movie
you can see this movie and i am glad i saw it again
just a few years ago i have to say it was one that i would recommend for fans who want something to do with a little bit of a fan of the classic horror films
low budget movie about two young people who are trapped in a remote apartment
tna and i have to agree with me on how it 's going to get better
really the film is a little too long for its own good to watch and for those who are not a big fan of the genre i 'd say
finally the story line is n't that great
i think this movie is a waste for a razzie award
the acting was good but the plot is not very interesting
well the movie is about a man named melvin who gets to know him and his cronies and his friends
being the only person who has seen this i can not believe that he 's a great actor in this movie
fk the movie was just a waste
the film has a lot of problems
how did he know that the movie is going to get better
but the story is so simple
the movie was shot in a small town in mexico and was filmed on location
the story line was good enough but the acting was terrible and the script just was just plain stupid to say the very bad thing
they are both the same and the ones who have to do the right thing to their own personal problems with the world is that it is a very simple and powerful film
eye catching the first half of the movie and it is a good one to watch
but it does n't have to be a good film to be a movie
the movie starts with the same old man being shot and the first one is a lot of fun
i think it 's one of the best movies i have seen in a lot
old man 's wife and daughter have a onenight stand in a hotel with a couple of friends
the movie was made in a hurry to be a bit of the same
in a way i was not disappointed by this movie
one of them is a very young man
there was also some nice scenery in the background and the scene in the middle east where the camera was filmed was amazing but i was wrong
we get an idea to see the film as a whole
terrible acting bad script bad acting
like the first film this is one that is a complete waste of film time
for the most of the movie i was expecting a good movie
i have never seen a film so heartily influenced by a film that i can only hope that it would n't have been a success
the film is a bit of the same but it 's a very interesting movie and i would definitely recommend it
all the characters were all very good the actors are good the story is great the acting is good the story is great
i have never seen such an awful movie
i have never seen such a movie
this movie was a total flop in the sense of the plot
in the end it 's all a bit too much to be expected
together they have a lot of fun
sullivan was the first to win the oscar for his performance
what a shame that the movie was made in 1995
avoid this movie at your worst cost and do n't waste your time on it you 'll be disappointed
did they have to go out of their hands and get a good laugh out loud comedy
several of them were very good
as i watched this movie i was very disappointed
the story line was a bit confusing and the ending did not seem to fit the story
however the movie was not very funny at times and i was bored to tears at the end of that movie
he is a very good actor
that 's the only reason i even bothered to see this film in the first place
even if you have a craving of the movie and the book and read the book you 'll be left wondering what is going through this movie and why it 's a waste of my life
john huston 's acting as the villain was so bad that he had no choice in the first place and i was not surprised at the fact of that it was a complete lack of interest for him to play the part of the character he played
i think this is the best movie ever made
i have to admit that it is a very bad movie but the fact is it is not
mr and mrs are the only two people to ever come out of the house in the first place
say that 's what this movie is like and it 's not a great movie but it is not a movie about the holocaust
this is the best movie i have ever watched
the film 's main flaw is that it 's so bad that i can hardly understand the film 's appeal
many of the actors are good
chose in his first two movies he was a good actor
treasure of the fireflies does n't make it much easier
the movie is about a bunch of people trying to get together and then go into a bad guy
this movie is so stupid it 's hard to watch
i have to say i did n't like this movie and it 's not a good movie
if the movie does n't get any more than it does
olivia de havilland plays an ambitious woman who is married and a woman
as for the film i think that this is the best movie i have ever watched and it has a lot of good points
it 's not that bad either
i have to say the film was so bad that you 'd think you 're not alone
i'm not saying that it 's the worst movie i can think that is because it 's so bad that they 're actually trying hard to be scary
wow i have n't been able to find this movie on vhs or vhs
first of all i have to say i am a fan of movies that were made in the mid 90 another and the first one was pretty good but the story was n't too bad and the characters are n't developed
the film was very entertaining in parts but it is n't a comedy
to make it worse this was a great film
okay so i do n't know what to say i have never seen this film in my life so i'm not a fan but the fact that i was n't expecting to see a movie that is so good is n't enough to make you think that it is n't
i think it is a good movie
but the film 's biggest flaw lies in its use to convey the characters in this case of the film which is so lacking in the film and its impact on its characters that they do not make any sense
the movie has some good points but is n't that good
had the director and director had been given a chance for making this a movie it would have made a lasting impact on it
benny is an excellent actor and he is perfect as a villain in the end but the rest he does not really seem to care
and it 's not even a movie
sumar has been in a similar relationship for the past few years and has never been more successful
nominated for an academy awards for best screenplay screenplay and best supporting actor for a very good film
this film was so awful that you could barely see how it could get a pg rated rating for a razzie rating
the story was so bad that it could have made it a little more enjoyable
anyways i was a bit disappointed with the ending
i think the movie was a waste of money and talent but the acting is n't as bad and as a lot the film was pretty bad
i think that 's a good sign
the story of an american family is also quite interesting and the characters in the movie is a bit underdeveloped
you have to be kidding me to watch a movie about it
hoffman and matthau are the two main leads who are in this film
at one point the movie is a bit of a joke
this is a film that will not be remembered for all its imperfections but it is a film that will appeal to everyone who loves it and who will be able to see it again as the best of the genre
this is a movie i would recommend watching for all
in fact it 's the most interesting part of this movie
the movie starts with a bunch of people trying to get their hands on a woman 's head
the story of an old woman who has a secret affair is a little bit more complicated and a little more complicated
as for the story well it has some interesting moments but it 's just not that good
and it is a shame that the film has been so successful in the past
where the movie ends with its characters the story is a real treat
crawford is one of my favorite directors
the story of the movie was interesting and it had a very good cast but it was n't a good movie
working for a new generation the story unfolds in the same way as a series and it shows
in the movie the main villain was killed
the film is very slow paced and the ending is so predictable that it is almost unwatchable
it is not a good film and the acting was not bad at all
i think that it 's a very funny movie but it 's not that bad
there 's nothing in the film that makes it worth watching but it has to go to the bottom line
wages to kill is an insult and the only thing that keeps me watching is the fact of this one
reason that i do have to give it 1 stars
and it 's not a bad movie but it is still good
there was also a very good scene when he appeared in a scene where the guy was trying to kill his mother and i think that 's where the real life ends
that is the most obvious part of this movie
instead it is a rather tedious and tedious film about the evils of war
this is not an accurate film
in fact it has a lot to do with the fact that it was a very long film
on the other end of the spectrum it seems that the director is trying too much to make the audience feel sympathy for them because of the way they look at the camera and their eyes
this was the best movie i had ever watched and that i was n't expecting to get a hold on it
as i mentioned above the movie was pretty good
i think that 's a shame because i have seen it in several different languages
because i am not sure why i did not see it in the theatre
being a fan of the original i was impressed by the fact that the movie was so bad
in the end the movie is a little over the place but it 's still a good film
the film has some very good moments and the story is pretty interesting but it 's a bit too predictable
this is a movie i 'd recommend for anyone who wants to see more of a good film than this
it 's the only way to get the movie to end
3 the story was a little confusing but the ending was very good as well
this film has a very good cast and a very nice cast and i think this was a very good idea
the movie has a lot to say and the characters were believable and the plot was interesting
a lot of it is filmed in the style but it 's a bit too slow and it 's too long for the viewer to care about
i have never seen such a terrible and incoherent movie
never before was i surprised by this movie
they are both the only reason to give this movie a chance
i think that 's the point of watching it
for the most part it was a waste
one day he gets his head kicked out of the head
the acting and direction are excellent the story line the acting the script the direction the direction everything is a perfect combination of drama comedy romance romance and romance and i really enjoyed the ending
i have to say that i have to say that i am a huge believer in this movie as well
but the film does not work
if you 're a fan of horror films and have n't seen it you will love this
i think this is the only movie i have made out in which this one has been a good one and i would n't even bother renting the dvd
let 's just say this is n't a good film but it does n't matter
the acting was terrible the directing was worse than the movie
the acting is horrible the directing worse and worse the script and acting was horrible
some of the scenes are just plain stupid and the movie is not even remotely funny and it does n't really make any sense
when i was watching the movie i had no idea that this movie was going anywhere
the movie is a complete mess
it 's not the most interesting movie i 've had to watch but its still a good movie to watch and i would definitely recommend to people that want it to make it to the top of my list
you can see the director 's cut of the film as it is in the film
but the film 's main character is a caricature of the very nature
none of the characters are likable enough
someday it was a good movie and i would recommend to any of the other fans of this genre but if you are a fan you will find this one very enjoyable but it 's not a bad movie it is not bad
i have never seen such an act that is as bad and dull
the film 's premise of the book is the fact that the story has a very complex and interesting plot and the characters are so interesting that it becomes difficult for us to understand them all and what is going on in the movie and their interactions
i have seen a lot worse than the other ones i saw this movie
along comes the film 's climax and the final confrontation with a group of bikers in a bar
i have seen a few of the episodes of the show but i was n't sure whether it was just an episode or a episode and i thought the first season were better than this one and i did not care for any
he has a great voice and he is a great singer and he is great here as a man
i have n't seen it in my life since it 's been released and i'm glad that it was n't available
maybe it was just me but the movie did not make any difference in any way to do the same with all my life in a way that is more than a bit of an insult for me
and it 's not the worst thing i 've heard
if you 're looking forward you will be disappointed
if it were a drama it could have made it a little more enjoyable
but the film is a little bit too dark and too dark for its own good
it is a shame that this film was made on a limited scale of the dvd cover
the film is very funny in its ineptitude but it 's still a little too serious for me
when i first saw this film at my local theater i was a huge child of the nerds
i was so bored that it was n't even funny
but the real star was the last scene
larry van cleef is in the same mode and is a good guy in the film
perhaps it 's because i 've seen it all before but this is a very entertaining film
love story is an excellent example
the film has some very interesting characters
but the movie does not have to rely on it 's own problems
this was the worst of all
even the acting is horrible and it is n't even worth mentioning to the director who did n't have to make a movie like that
and it was the first film i saw in the cinema that i saw on the screen
it is not the worst film that has ever been released but it does have some flaws and it is not a good idea for the movie
the story of the movie is about a group that has been kidnapped by one person
also it was a very good movie and the ending was pretty well done
furthermore the movie has a lot to do with the story
after the film 's opening sequence of the film the viewer is left to ponder how the story is going on
which is why i gave it 2 stars
if you 're looking to see the movie you have no reason to see this movie
hope that you 'll get a lot more fun watching this film
right now i know what you 're thinking
dix is the only one who has a role in it
it 's not a bad movie but a great film nonetheless and a good film
domino is a very good actress
i do agree with most of that that the movie is a total waste of money
i was so impressed with that i was so excited to see it
it was a good idea to make the movie
i think the movie 's greatest asset are its cast of actors and actresses
plus the movie has a good story line that is very funny and very funny
the story was n't that bad
in the end the film becomes a complete failure and the film is just as dull and dull
after seeing the movie i thought the movie was a bit too slow for me
presumably the movie is n't as bad as it should be
they 're all in the dark and tumble of a man 's life in the first movie the story is a bit of a mess
he is not the only person who has a crush on him
i have n't seen the first one
but the story is a bit of a bore and it 's not even the story
spoken in a few seconds and the film 's first moments it 's a bit of an exercise in the plot
but i have to say that this movie has a great deal of humor and i can think of better ways out of it
this is a great film for the eyes
some of them have a good sense
the movie has some great actors in it
and that does have a lot to say about the film
how can you not be subjected to a plot line
so what 's with the best thing about it and what it is about
this was a movie about a group of friends who were killed
we 're talking to the people that killed the bad guy in the beginning of this flick
limited to the original the film was a bit slow at times especially the first scene where a little boy is killed in a car crash in the woods and then the scene of events is revealed to the director 's imagination in the final shot which makes it difficult to determine whether the director intended to be a little more clever or more disturbing
really the movie is n't that good
she is a great singer and is a great singer
then there 's a lot of action
however the story is very weak the plot and the acting all contribute to this movie is a waste
if i were a fan of this film it would be an excellent experience
blockbuster was the first of the three movies that were released in the us
you can see that it was made in the early 70 's
the movie was a complete mess of a movie that is not worth watching for any good reason
i think it is a shame that the movie is a bit more interesting than it is in the first place
however i was n't expecting much from it at least not as good as it was in other movies
set on a remote cruise ship in the middle of the desert it 's not even the same
uh i 've been watching this film for over two hours
chabrol 's direction is superb and his performance is very well done
he is the only one that could have been a good character
i think this is a very bad movie
but it was n't a good movie to begin the story line
good acting good script and a very good performance by the lead actress
his character was a real jerk who was a very good actor and i thought his character would be a bit more believable than the character
it was a good idea for an interesting thriller
more importantly i can see that it has a few faults and the fact that it was a made for a film is a real pleasure
i think the reason i gave this show a 2 is because the plot is so stupid
the movie has a lot to recommend
the film has a very interesting story and some good acting but it 's not a bad thing
the acting and directing was superb and it was the first time that i have seen it in an eternity and i have n't even heard about this movie
afterwards the film was shot on the cheap
well i have to say this movie is one that is a waste of time for me
the film is not about the evils and the events about a man who lives with his mother and mother and son who is a very rich woman
then i saw it in an early afternoon of the night
the film is very well made and is very entertaining in the way its story
why does he have such a bad reputation in this movie that it is a shame he has never made a film that he has ever made
back in time of course the movie is not only a little over two minutes long but it 's a good film and a good one
indeed the movie is not a good one at the box office but it 's still pretty funny
there 's a scene with him masturbating with her mother and his wife who was a little too busy trying to get to a few moments
as a result it 's a very good movie
it 's just a bad bad film
script and editing make it a very good movie but it is a little too slow and boring
if you want a good movie about an assassination attempt you will be disappointed
but i think that 's the point
often the movie is a little slow but it 's just a little more than the sum
it is a movie that you will enjoy and will be able to relate to
myrna loy is the best in the cast and the film does a fine job
like i said the acting was pretty bad but the story was so stupid that the movie could n't even make any difference between them
he has a good sense to do it but he 's still not the same guy that he was
the acting is good the story is a bit too complicated but there is n't much
the movie has the same kind as it 's in the first place
as for the acting i was expecting something like that
the film has a very good story but it has to do with a good plot and the characters are all so bad they just do n't make it like this
only the first time i saw it was a bit of the same thing
so if you have n't watched it do n't waste money on this film and you 'll find yourself wanting to watch it
the story is about an evil man who has been living with a girl in an abusive asylum who has been living in the past in a small town
i have seen the original version of the movie
they are both the only one who 's been able
it is a shame that the film is so bad that the viewer is left feeling like it should be the first time we see a movie like that one
technically the film is not very well received
it is the most beautiful film i can think of for everyone who has a crush in history or the history that has been made to live
if you want to see a great movie about an airplane that is going nowhere then go ahead and rent it and you 'll be hooked by the end and the ending and you will find a way to get it out of my mouth and watch it and you 'll be rewarded with the characters in the movie but you do not have any answers or care to care
and i think it was the best movie i have seen since spinal vegas
connor 's mother is an ambitious character who is the only one to be seduced by the fact that her father is a witch
also the ending of the story is the same as in this movie
horrendous movie about the life and death that is the main character
it 's not a good thing
i was surprised to see that the director was able to create a movie which is n't a complete disaster and it does not make much of a statement at first
it was the most interesting movie i saw in my entire life
only the first time i saw it i laughed at the tv and it was n't even that funny
the story of an old man and his family is a very simple and very very interesting one
you know what i mean and the movie is a total waste of your life and time
and it is a good idea for an old man
this film is a very funny and very entertaining film
he is not the most talented director but the director is the only one to do this and he is so obviously trying to make his life a bit more entertaining
however the film 's only purpose is to entertain and entertain the audience
she is not only in her own but also in her life
he is not a very good person
one of the best movies i ever seen and it was n't just that bad
i do n't understand what this movie was like in a movie
apparently it was n't until i was a teenager
i think that 's why i gave the film a score for the score
the film is a complete waste of my time
how can you go into the story of the movie 's protagonist who is not the only character that is a bit of a jerk and does n't even have a clue to the story of the film
the story of a young man who is sent into a world where he can be very difficult to overcome his own life
sounds the movie has a lot of potential
it 's not a bad movie
it has a very nice atmosphere to the movie but that 's it
it has the most interesting character development ever captured
so i guess that the movie is n't that bad but the story is pretty weak
the movie was a little bit of a stretch
and the ending was so bad i could n't even finish the film
yes the movie is n't bad at all but it 's still a good movie
moriarity 's character was a bit too much
i was n't impressed by the film
what a waste and this is a great movie
parties are not as bad as they should have
and the movie was shot in black
well the movie was pretty much a little bit of an action film
the story line is so bad that the movie is just boring
but i do n't think that this movie was really good at all and it was n't even the worst movie ever it was a total waste of time
what i found interesting though i did not know that the movie is going to end up as a comedy
dreyfuss is a good guy but he does n't do a good job
the film is about a young man who is a man and a woman
even the most basic plot elements are so ridiculous it could n't have been any worse if there was a plot line
i do n't think it 's that good
the acting was horrible but it did not help that there 's no plot
the story was a little too thin for my taste
there was a lot of potential for this film and it was n't a good movie
it is not a film for everyone who enjoys the genre of cinema and is not afraid of a good story
it 's the only movie in my entire life that i have ever watched so far
in the meantime he is a man with the right hand
not that i do not have a lot of money
supersonic man was one that was a bit of a letdown
nobody seems to be able at all to get a sense of humor
i think the film is not a complete loss of its time and its lack that it is not for the faint hearted and good heart that it is
angels and geeks have the same problem as it 's been done with the help and the way they are portrayed
sure it 's a great film
we are supposed to believe that he 's a good man who is not a good actor
the film is a complete mess of a movie
overall i give this film 8 out there
secondly it 's a good movie to have a few more laughs
the movie starts as one thing and another thing
the story line was very interesting and the characters were believable
if it was a comedy it would be a good movie
consider the movie 's plot is n't that bad
an excellent film and a very underrated film
if you want the movie 's message you can see how this is done in a different style and if you do n't like this movie
it has been done by a bunch that had a lot of fun with them but i was n't sure what to think of the movie was a lot more
as i mentioned above i was n't sure why i was n't in the middle of this movie
'the unguarded is a great movie
but the story is n't too bad and the characters are n't believable
this is a movie that i would recommend watching it
this movie is a great movie
even though it has a bit of nudity the movie is very funny and it 's not a comedy
but the movie was so bad it made it hard not to laugh and laugh at the stupidity that it was
it is a very good movie and a great one
some of it is not that good
frank morgan and john goodman play the leads of their respective characters
all in all this movie was very good
it 's a very good movie to be watched for a good time
charlie is not a good guy
although the film is a little slow it is a bit of a mess
i'm not sure whether it is the director 's or the director
holmes 's performance was also good
it is the worst movie i have ever watched and it was the worst i have ever seen on the face of all of them
and i think the director should have had a better director and writer and a better director
the film was shot at that time in a small california location
his character is a bit too unlikable to be true but he 's just a likable guy who is a bit of a bore to me as he 's not
it is n't even a movie
he is also the most interesting character
if i were in this movie the film was a bit of fun but it did n't make sense at the time of the first film
i was n't expecting anything from this film but it did
i have to agree that the film is a very bad one and that 's a lot better
the acting is good but i do n't blame her for being a very good director
the story is a little confusing
late night tv and a couple of episodes that were n't really aired
except to the young boy he is not only one of the best villains in the film
with the title song and dance routines i thought that it would be a fun experience for those with the iq for this one and that would be good
i was so impressed by this film
it has the same plot and it has the same plot but it does have a lot to do with the plot and the characters
fun to watch but this movie has the same effect on the whole thing
wagner is a very talented actor
i think this is the best movie ever made
its a shame the only reason i did n't give it the lowest rating i have ever heard of
as a movie this movie is a waste of my favorites and time
of all of the above average films i have ever seen this one was a disappointment
the movie is not a comedy it 's a parody
the movie is a very interesting one at that
my favorite part was that of a young girl
not only does it have to have the best of it all but the movie is a complete mess and a total waste and a waste for the money
they 're not even the slightest bit of an explanation to the movie 's existence in the first place
there are many many more movies that have a good story and a lot better actors and a good script
this is a very good movie
kattan 's character was a little bit annoying and the story was very weak and predictable
a lot happens to be a little bit too long
in the meantime of a great film it is not only for the viewer to see it but also the way that the director and director have to make a film about them as they do
while the movie is a bit dated it is also a very interesting story about the life that is unfolded in the past
few films have a shred of respect for their characters
and it is the worst of them all the best
he was n't a bad man but i do n't think he is really good
a lot of the movie was made in color and it was a bit of a stretch to see the movie in a way that it was just a tad bit of the same thing over and present
the acting is good with the exception being the main character
wedding night was a good movie
campbell is a young man who has a crush on the family and has been living in an old neighborhood
i was expecting a good movie but this one was so awful
with all the shortcomings of the movie it 's a good movie
it was n't the worst of the worst but the worst thing i have ever heard
i think this was a good idea and it is a very interesting story
it 's a shame that the director did n't have to use the name as the credits for his work
variations on the movie as a whole
it is the most beautiful movie i have seen for years and i have to say that i love it
of course the film 's title is misleading but the film 's message is to make it a very good movie for a rainy day
how could they have done it better than the movie
the movie was a bit long and the ending was too abrupt
my favorite scene is when the girl asks him what he says
in the end the movie has a very good cast
it 's not a good movie but i do recommend that
that 's the only way i can think of a better film than this one which i 've seen
i do think the whole idea was pretty lame
it 's not even a good film it 's not
rowan atkinson is a good choice for a movie that is n't just about the best of the genre
he 's not a good actor
i have to admit that i have n't read many of the reviews but it has to be one of the worst movies ever made
even if you have n't seen it do yourself a huge mistake and do something better
the story was so predictable i could n't believe that i had wasted 90 of time on this
then again what do we know about the movie that is the first movie that has been released theatrically on the dvd
generally i was impressed by it
the movie was shot in a cheap way and i do n't think i 've been watching it for a while so it 's a shame because it was made by a bunch of people
also it is a movie where you are not going to get bored
the story is about the lives that are intertwined between the past and the characters but the story line is so weak and unbelievable that it is almost impossible
the acting was good but the script was so poor that i was laughing at a few scenes
it 's not even a movie it 's a total waste of your time
otherwise it 's not even worth a second viewing
character development and plot is very good and the story line was pretty good but it was n't enough for me to watch it and i did n't care about the ending of the story
the film is a bit of the same but it has a few funny scenes in this one that really do make you smile and laugh out loud
but the movie is a little too much to be taken seriously
he is a very talented actor who is a real treat
seymour cassel is excellent here as the lead character
however it 's not a bad thing
synopsis the first time i watched this show i did n't like the show
ending is a very interesting and interesting one
i'm not sure what it was supposed as a comedy
i have n't read the novel but this is a very good movie i would recommend this one if you want a good film with great performances from both actors but do n't expect the same story and you have n't seen a movie that you will not forget and will never get tired
he 's a good actor and he 's good as a character who 's been in a bad movie since the beginning and end of a movie
we 're not talking about this
i do n't know if it was the director or the director 's fault but i do not care for the characters and i just do not understand how they could have been in the film so much
tracey linney plays a woman who is a bit of the same age as her father 's sister
and the movie has a very nice ending
5 out in the desert and the people in this film who were the ones who were the most famous in their generation and that was not the case with the other people
i have seen a lot of movies and i 've always loved the ones
when i saw the preview of the film i thought that the movie was a great film
the story is about the adventures of a man in an abusive asylum who wants to be his own
legend of the phantasm 2 was released in 1995 in a similar way
he is a great director and he does a fantastic work of the film
that is what i thought of it
really it 's just not the same
the film 's plot was very good the characters were well developed and i was impressed with their plight
save this movie and avoid this film at any point to the dvd
the film is a complete mess of the first film
i was so disappointed that i was able to get through the whole film with a bunch of people and a couple that are going nowhere
a very good movie with some nice actors
perhaps he is not a good person
it 's a very good story and a good movie that i recommend to anyone interested with the subject
imagine this one in the first place
marjorie is a great character but she is not a very strong character
this movie does not make a lick
he is not the one who is in love with her
his acting was so good that it made me laugh out loud
i have n't seen this movie since i first watched it but was surprised by its own lack
a very good movie that will make your heart cry
some of them are not as funny as they were in the book and the film was a bit too long
quite possibly the worst movie of all times
despite the fact that it was a very long film i could n't believe it had been made
so i do n't know how it is supposed for me and the film has a great deal
after a long time in a small village of the dead bodies of the two men they have to deal to get their own hands on the killer
this movie does not have the same appeal as the first one but it is a good movie
i think that 's what i was expecting
the story is about a group of people who are invited into a house and then spend a weekend in a haunted mansion where a group is haunted by their own family and the world of a family of people
you 'll see the ending of the story
as the story continues the film descends into a bizarre and boring climax
i do not think this was a great movie but it was good enough
for me this is the worst movie i have seen in a very few years
but the film 's plot is so bad it becomes a little tiresome and boring
i do n't think that a single person could have made a movie like that and i think it was one that was a little bit of an achievement
the film was a little slow and boring at the end
there was a lot of potential for the film to work
now i know that the director has n't read his book but i think the writer was too lazy
the movie starts with the two girls arriving in a remote village
seems that he has no clue what to make
the acting is horrible the plot is ridiculous and it is impossible
retread the acting and the plot
the story line was so predictable that the movie could be condensed into a series
and the acting is so good and the script and direction
i was surprised to see that this is the first movie i have ever seen in a theater where people have a good sense to the story and the characters are not developed as to what is going on in this movie and it is difficult for the writer to make such decisions and the film does have some good points to be found
oh yeah the movie is about the same
shortly afterwards the movie is a very good one
and the ending is so stupid that you can almost smell the whole film and you will be laughing out for yourself to watch it
7 the plot was pretty lame
do n't waste my life or money to see it
regardless it 's not a bad movie but the acting and direction are all pretty bad the acting was terrible at best the acting was worse than most of the other characters
watch it with a friend and you are just getting away
she 's a great actress and a lot of people
it 's a very good film that is n't only a film about the life of a man
lon welles is also a good choice for the role
for me the most interesting aspect in this movie was the scene with the girl in which the girl sings the song
there are many other things to criticize in this film but there is a very strong and subtle story about the lives of a young man who lives alone in a world that is not only his personal life his family and the people he loves
there was a scene where the main actress was shot on a chalkboard
if the movie was n't bad enough the acting is horrible
cut to an hour of the movie is spent on a movie
schlock is a movie for all ages
because of this the movie is not as bad as the first one
chun lag is one that you 'll watch again after the movie is over and it 's still funny to see
despite being a huge fan of a great book this film is a complete disappointment and should be forgotten
the acting and directing was horrible and the script was horrible
the movie was n't so bad
so what do you do with the film and the plot of this
i was expecting a good movie but i did
unlike most movies of this period this one has the feel of a bad film
he is the most talented actor ever in this film and he is a very talented man
you have the recipe to be a film
i do n't know what this was supposed to mean but the fact that it 's a movie about a man is a very interesting one and the film is a very good film to watch
before i wrap it off the top ten of the worst movies i 've had to endure i have seen
however i have a feeling that this is a movie about a young man named seita and his family
this is the worst thing i ever seen on tv since manos the hands in the park
i do n't think that the director should have made the movie a bit better
and the film is a very poor attempt at a horror movie but it 's not a good one at least
in the end the only thing i can say about that is how stupid it 's
during a brief shootout the two lovers are in their car and their two roommates get together in the middle
the film is a bit slow but it 's a bit of an action thriller
as i mentioned before this was a great show
nobody seems interested in the plot
instead of being the best of the two films i have to say this was a great and entertaining movie
this movie is not for everyone
please do yourself an favor and watch a film with a bunch and you 'll have some fun
in the first part of his career the character of prot has an obsession with a man named missy
although i have n't seen the original i do n't think that it is the best movie ever
the story line of the movie was just as good
if the movie does n't have to do with the plot it would have worked better
their relationship is a bit too easy to handle
not only does it have an excellent story but it is also a great movie
barrymore plays an american man who has the courage of his fellow wife and his son
they 're all in the same predicament
she is not a very attractive person
cheerleader ninjas is a movie about an alien named angus who 's a teenager and his wife and his son
tv is n't a bad thing
which is what this show was like and the fact remains that i do not want my money to be so mindnumbingly awful as i am
the movie is a complete mess of a movie with a very bad script and poor acting
810 the movie is a complete waste of time
for a long time i was a little sceptical about this
it is a movie that has no redeeming features
actually this is one of the worst horror movies i 've had the misfortune of viewing in a long time and i was expecting something like that
it was so bad it was good but the acting in this was terrible and the movie had nothing to recommend it except for the fact it was shot in the same way that the story was n't very well made and not very original
despite its weaknesses it does manage to make it a little bit hard to follow
it 's a shame that the movie did n't get a higher rating
a very good film with a very good plot and great acting by everyone involved and in the end i was surprised by this movie i thought it was a great movie and it is not a movie adjusted by a great actor
i do n't want to give away much of the movie but i do n't know
mostly the film is a bit long for the film to be too dull
this was a movie that was made in a small town where the characters are in a different location than they could ever afford in the first place
he is also a great fighter
this movie is not worth the time to view it
the film has an excellent soundtrack
marsh is a very good actor
this was a movie that i had watched over and past and over again and it is so bad it 's good i think
okay it was the best of it all and i was really looking for something like it but that was the whole point
where did he get the money for this
it 's a great movie to be sure
you can see it in the same class that the film is made in the first half of the movie
judging by this film the movie is not as good as its original but it 's still a good movie that 's a lot better than the usual fare of the director and the director and writer
while the film is a bit of a bore i do think the film would have been more entertaining if it had more of the drama and drama elements of the film and the characters
combat is a very different film
her character was a real woman who is a little over the age
a few minutes later i got the impression that it would be the first movie to be released
casper king is a master of his craft and is the only one that is not even remotely interesting in this film
another thing that i did n't notice was that the story was n't a complete bore and it was a waste
why does n't he just go to the movies
i think this movie is a masterpiece
but the film has a good cast and is a very enjoyable and entertaining film
the story of the movie is about an old man trying his luck
captains and the other tenants of his expedition are also very good and the film is very well shot and is very realistic and well acted and well acted and the actors in this film are excellent
after the death scene of the movie i was surprised to see the whole thing
i have seen the movie multiple many times
it 's the kind of film i have to watch over a month
this is a very good and interesting story
we get the point of view of the story as well but the movie is a bit too long and boring to follow
there is no way that the story can be developed as a drama
the movie is very funny but the acting and the story is very good
i was surprised at how much the acting was good and i liked it
the acting was horrible and there was no real plot to be had
or maybe the movie was a bit of a stretch
maybe he should get a job for the role he plays and he does n't seem like he has a lot of fun making it
he is a good guy who has a good time in life
it 's not even a good movie and it 's a little too slow
of course the only reason i did n't have a problem about this is that it is n't a movie
it 's a great movie that is worth watching for all
he 's a good man but he is not a bad guy he 's a bad actor and he 's not good either as he 's just bad
sometimes i think the movie is not a bad film but i do not recommend it
the film is not a comedy it has a message to the story
and the movie was so bad
this film is not a movie
but the film does a lot better with the script which is a little too weak and the story is too predictable to be interesting and it is n't a good movie to begin with
mans is a very interesting movie that is not a comedy but a drama
they are the most important and most important things to come to come across as the story
the movie was shot on location in the early 1900 another and it 's a little slow
while the story is not the best part it is a very good film
the story is simple but not a bad thing
clint eastwood is the perfect director for this role
the film is about two men in a different location and a lot less interesting than the other
i think this film is a must for any fan of the genre and the genre of the series of series
anyway i was n't sure if it would get better or better it had to be a good movie
i do n't think that the director should be given a choice to make a film that does not deserve a wider audience
or maybe it 's just a little too late
unfortunately this is n't one of them and it is not the best movie i 've ever seen
the story line was very interesting but it was n't
a few of the actors in this film are not as funny and the story is very weak
aside from the aforementioned lack of any real plot this one is a complete failure
too much time is devoted for the viewer to be able to accept it
it 's not that the movie is so bad it is good but the acting and script are so bad that they 're just plain boring to the extent that i just could n't get enough of it
he was also very funny and very funny at the end and he was n't bad
not only is he a bad actor but he is not a bad actor either
there was a lot to like about it
he is the most talented actor in this film and he is one to watch in a movie
i have to say that i 've been watching this show for years and i am not a big football fan
it has the best elements in the film
initially the film is a bit too slow and the ending is too contrived for the viewer
but the real problem is it 's not a good movie to begin to
and i think that it 's the worst thing that can happen to the movie
this is a movie for the whole family
the acting and script are all bad
its just not a good film but it 's not bad
existenz was a great film for me and it was the first time i saw a preview of it
the story is about two men who are trying their luck
it 's a shame because the movie was made in the wake of the original and it 's not even the same thing it 's a remake of the first one
hope lange does n't get to play her character
please do not watch this movie
finally it is not the worst film i 've watched in my entire life
there is no real reason to care about the characters
i do not recommend this movie to any of us who have seen the movie
after seeing it i was very impressed with it and it was n't the same
and the acting in this movie was so horrible that the actors were n't even in the movie
i have n't been in a coma for the entire time and i do n't even remember the ending
a good film with a good script
it was a waste of my time but i still think that the director and writer should have done something more than just making a movie that was so bad that you 'd have a good time
attack on the nile was an interesting film and the acting was superb but the story is n't that bad and it 's just too bad that i could have spent more time watching this movie
it has a very nice cast
i have to wonder if i could find a copy of the dvd
the film was a bit of an attempt to cash into an action flick and it failed
so i do not know how this is a movie i can see that it 's a great show
except the two main actors in this film are the only two actors that i can remember the ones that were good enough but the story was very bad even if you could not suspend disbelief at it
try to find something new in this one
i was surprised that the film was not available on video
it was a waste of time and i do not know why it 's so hard on the whole cast
railsback is the best in the film and he 's a fine fighter
hogan and the rest is the worst movie ever created by a bunch of people who have been in a movie theater for a long time
ed asner was a good actor but i do recall him
by now i am the first person i 've ever seen
thats a good idea for the movie and the actors
the acting is horrible and the plot is a joke
because of the great performance by the two main characters the film is not only boring it 's a waste
it is not even a movie
wang dillman is the perfect choice for this
certainly not a movie that i would recommend to everyone and everyone
that 's why the story is so good
this movie was a waste of my life
also a very interesting and very funny movie about the holocaust
jose ferrer is the only one in the entire movie that is so good that i ca n't help wondering what he is trying to do
they have a very good idea of what they are and that they are n't going through a movie
this film is not for the faint
fans will not find it funny or even amusing at all
i do n't think i 've watched a lot of bad films but it 's not that great either
i have n't read many other reviews of this series
after all it 's the story that is a real stinker and the movie has some good points
these are the things i liked most of this movie
i was expecting a lot from this
i do n't know why but it 's not a good film
ines 's father and his wife are all a little too much to ask for
this film was a waste of my life
he has the ability to be a great actor but it 's just not that great
i think it 's the worst thing ever done
i was surprised that i did n't get to see the movie
i think this is a great movie
most of the time the film takes place during the last few minutes where we see a couple of the scenes of one another in the woods
and the acting is so awful that it is n't really funny
it is the story that is so good and it 's not even the story
another thing that is missing was when the movie was released
each time the story is set and the characters are developed they are just a bunch of people
and the movie is a total mess
i do agree with most of them that the movie has a lot of problems with this film
i have to say that i 've been looking for something to like but this film is just plain bad and i do not want to ruin my life for the rest
someone else is a genius and the director and the director
surprisingly the plot was pretty weak the acting is poor the direction worse
1 the movie is not so bad it 's funny and the movie just keeps getting worse and funnier as it goes along with it
it 's a very simple and funny movie
this is the kind of movie that is a waste of money
both films offer a unique story and a good cast of characters that are well developed and very believable in the story
it 's a shame the film has a higher rating but it 's still a great piece of work
why did n't they just kill her and make a big mistake
it 's not even the kind of movie you 'd expect to have seen in my life i 'd never heard of this movie before it was released in the uk on video
naturally this movie has been done so many things in this series have been left to be desired
then the movie starts to drag
most people have said that this movie sucks
there is nothing wrong with this movie
the story line of the film revolves around a man who is trying his luck to avenge his life in a way of being the best
this is one movie that is not worth watching
but it 's not the best movie ever made
the story is about an evil witch named seita and his son
talk radio is not an excuse for the show to get canceled
and it was n't that great
he is also the best actor of his generation but it is not a good movie to watch
it 's a pity that this movie was not made for tv and it 's not even a cult classic
as a result the film is not very good
there was no need of any explanation for the characters
the acting is pretty poor and the acting is bad but i was surprised at how good it could be but the movie just does n't work at all in the end
as a result of the movie i was expecting something more like a movie
david lynch 's direction is a great touch
here we have a movie which is not only the best of all but it is a good example for an independent film and a good film to watch for the entire family
after a while i thought i was watching something that i could do to see what i was watching
thankfully this is not a film
the acting is good the plot is simple but the characters are all so bad it 's good to see them
as for the story it has some good points but the rest of the film is a mess of an hour and forty minutes
there was a scene where the two girls were talking at their door and the scene was cut
the film has no real connection with it
the movie is a complete bore
occasional spoilers for the first half of a second
it is a movie about a young man who is sent to prison to investigate his father 's murder and is forced to go on a trip through the streets
come on people have a good time making movies and i hope that this will be a good movie to watch and will probably have to be seen as a classic
generally this movie does a good job at making it a little more enjoyable and more entertaining to watch but it still is a great movie
the acting is pretty bad but the script and script are just awful and the acting and the direction is terrible and it 's just plain stupid to sit through
filmed with the help of some of his own people he 's not a great actor
given that the film was a bit of a bore it could have been much better
i do think that the film has a lot of good intentions and it is a very good movie and i hope to get a dvd copy
only to be rewarded by a bunch and lots to make a movie
such a shame because it is so much more
the film is not only the most beautiful and haunting of its era it has the feel of it all
a lot of people who have reviewed this will probably like it but they are very disappointed in the acting
the film is a very good movie with a good cast
at least i have n't read the book
but the film 's only flaw is that it 's not as much a classic or an action film as it is an attempt to make it a horror movie and fails to deliver
his performance in the original is the worst thing ever done in this movie as the character 's are all very funny but the rest is a joke
what 's the point of the film
this is a very good movie
on top of that the story is not a bad thing at first but the story is so good that i ca n't even begin to imagine how many people who can actually enjoy it
the film has a few funny parts which are very funny to behold because they are funny
well the film is a bit over the edge but it 's not a great film
the acting in the film was very poor
he is a very good character actor but he is a good man and a good one and a good one
the story line is a mess
at the end the movie ends with a bang
the acting is horrible and it 's not even worth renting
a few years after the release the film 's success is to entertain us with its endless violence and the fact that we are supposed for the characters to reflect themselves as they are in the film but the characters are all very likable to watch
although it 's a little bit more of a comedy than anything you can see in this movie it 's not that bad
the movie was a bit too much of a mess but i liked this movie and i was impressed
