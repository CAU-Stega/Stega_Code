i was n't impressed with the movie
introverted characters and situations that are n't even remotely funny

the film is about the same thing about a
if you want to watch a movie about a group that has a lot of money then this is the movie to
there are some very funny scenes in the film
if i were to rate it a 1 it should be a 10
but it 's a great film
emmanuelle chriqui plays the role as the mother of a young woman who is in love with her

but it 's a great film
and the ending was a bit too predictable and the story is just plain
guy kibbee plays a man with no charisma and a sense that the film 's only purpose is that it 's not even a comedy
the film has some of its moments that are n't
there are some very good scenes in this movie and it is
but the movie is not a complete
final thoughts are the best of the movie and it 's not the best movie i 've ever seen but it 's a good movie
the movie was a waste of time and i would have to agree with the reviewer who said it 's not a bad film

of all the movies i 've seen this one has the feeling of a great
but the film is a bit too long

the film has some good points but the story is

this movie was so bad that i could n't believe that it would be so

sutherland 's character is a caricature

on a technical level the acting was superb and the story
the film is about the struggle of the people in a world where they are not afraid of being a child and
when the film is over the end credits have to
this movie was so bad that i could not even laugh
or maybe the fact that it was a long way to make it a little more interesting
from the opening sequence to the end of the

the film is about the struggle of the two
how can you go wrong with the movie
but the film is a bit slow and the ending was so predictable

it 's a very good movie
so the movie was made for the sake that the film
the film has a very good story and the acting is superb and the story line is very good
despite the fact that the movie was shot in a very tight location it was a nice touch
when i first saw this film i was a bit sceptical of the film and the fact it
i have to say i was very impressed with this movie and i was surprised to find out

it 's not even the best of the series
but the movie was n't bad enough
i was surprised to see this film
the movie was shot in the same way as the first film

the film is about a group that has been sent into a world war camp in
she 's a little more convincing and a lot more than she 's
there is a lot to be said about this

i was surprised to see that the film was made for
in fact the film was shot in the early seventies
ricco 's character was a little too unlikable to be believable but the story was so stupid that i was n't expecting much
anyway the film has a lot to offer and
but it is not a movie
every time i watch this movie it is so sad to see a movie that is not even close

it 's a shame because the film is so boring and so boring that it 's hard
it is not the best movie ever made
the film is a complete mess of the original
however i was surprised that the movie did not get released
well i guess i 'll be a little more forgiving of the movie
with a few twists and turns and some of them you can see the similarities between them and the characters are so
the film has a lot of potential to make it worth watching but the movie does
i have seen the movie and i have to admit i was
what is the point of this movie
this movie is not a good one
it 's a shame that the film has been so much
the movie is a bit of an insult
also the film has a lot to offer and is a bit too long for the whole movie

they are all very good actors and actresses
connery 's performance is the only one that i can recall him as a man who was a bit of an
david lynch 's film was a great film that i enjoyed
plus the movie was a bit too slow
whilst the film was shot in the seventies it 's not a movie that you can see in the cinema
a lot of people have said that the movie is so boring and so stupid that i could n't even get
luckily the film 's biggest success was that the director had
the movie is about the same thing as the
first of the film 's plot is about a young woman who has been kidnapped and abused by a woman
phoebe 's father and son have a relationship with each other and
in fact the film is a bit too long for the most extreme of the movie to be a complete mess
that is what makes it a great movie and it 's not just
she is the only person that has to be killed
that is what i thought it was
with the exception being a bit of the same thing i did not like the film and the plot is
i have to say i did n't enjoy this movie
this movie is not a good movie
this movie was so bad that it
so i guess it was a good idea
the movie was a waste of time and money and money to make
or the fact it 's not the best of the bunch

my advice is that you 'll find this film on video
do n't worry about the movie because you
it 's a very funny movie and it 's not just the fact that the movie is set in a small city in new
compelled for the movie 's success
let me say this is the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune

the film is a complete waste of my time and money
it is a very funny movie
then the movie starts with a bang and a few scenes of the movie are shot
the film is a bit of a bore but the acting and the acting is superb
in fact it 's a very bad movie
in fact the only thing that makes this film is the fact it is a film about a young man who is attracted
but it is not the worst movie i
like the first film the characters are so stupid and the plot is so contrived
unless you are a diehard fan like myself and have seen it in a few years i 'd say
however the film is not as good as it should be
having seen this film several times and have watched it
but it 's not a good movie and it is not
it is a very good movie and i think that the movie is very well
however i was n't impressed with the film

unfortunately the film is a bit too long for its own good

maybe the movie was made in the early 70 's
michael caine plays a young man who is diagnosed with his past and is forced by his family to find a new job
in the end the movie is not a good
ford is a great actor and i have to say
also i think that the director should have had the director 's commentary on this film as
it is a very good movie and it 's a great movie to see
this movie was a waste for me
however the movie was a little too long

but it 's a good thing to watch

and it is a shame because the film is a little slow
scarlett is a very good character and she is very believable in her portrayal of the character

this movie was so awful it 's
i was n't expecting much of a film
they 're all in a bad movie and it 's a shame that the movie has n't got

bad acting bad direction bad editing
just as a movie is a good idea to make a good

4 out of 5 stars for the acting
not to mention the acting is horrible

scott 's performance is very good and the movie has some good moments
when the movie was released it was released in theaters

thinking about the film and the fact it is
examples of the film are the fact that the director has no clue how to make a movie
this is a movie that i can watch over all
i was surprised that the movie was made
both the story of the film is very good
funny and entertaining but it 's a
he is a very talented actor and a very good
there is a lot of violence in the film but it is

it 's not even a movie it
ted danson plays the role as a cocky and cynical man who is
closed to a point of nausea is the story
our hero is a very good actor and he is very convincing in the role of the detective

it 's a very funny movie
i have to say i was very impressed by this film and
i was surprised that this film was made in a hurry
and the movie was so bad that it was actually funny
ok i have seen this movie several years ago
the movie is about a group of people trying to find their
this movie was a complete disappointment to me and the acting
i have to say that this is a great film and i recommend it for
starting in a small town in the country where the young girl has
for the most part the acting is superb
everyone else in the cast including a cameo by john wayne as a drunken
the film is about a young man who has
at the end the movie ends with a very abrupt climax that is n't really explained at the beginning of the movie
some of the scenes were so funny that i could
other reviewers here seem to be saying that this is a very bad movie but
if you 're a fan of the genre and have seen a lot more of them

and it 's a shame because it 's not a good movie to begin to
each character is a caricature and the story
like the other reviewers i have seen this film and i do not
but the film is a little slow and boring
a few years later i saw the movie on the
im a fan and i do not know how this film is going for the same
oh yeah i do concede that this is the best
anyone who thinks that the movie is supposed to be a comedy is a bit of a joke
anyway i have seen a lot worse movies

so i was expecting a good film but this one was
there are some very funny moments but it 's not
there is no reason to see this film
why did n't he try and make the film
it is not the best movie ever made
could have done without the aid
the movie was shot on location and the acting was pretty bad
the film is a complete waste
the film has some of the worst acting ever assembled
i have to say i was n't disappointed
i have to say that this is one of my favorite movies of the
it 's a very funny film
the movie is about a group of young men who have a relationship together
this movie was a waste for the first two minutes
i was surprised that the film did n't get a theatrical dvd release but it 's
the film has a very good story line and a great cast
i have to say that this is a very good film
and the ending was a bit abrupt
in the first film the characters are not very likable
pitching the same story and the same characters as in the first one
since the film was made for the first half of the film it was a
it 's not a bad film but the acting and the acting are so bad it 's funny to see them
and the movie was a complete mess
since the film is a bit too much for a thriller it 's a bit too long and it is not
no matter what the cost of this film is it 's a waste
now i have to admit i did not enjoy this movie
if you 're a fan like me and have a good sense to
a lot more of the same
the film is about a group that has been sent to a remote island where they are hunted down by a group that is a gateway of the earth to find the
but it 's a good thing to see this

robert englund was a good choice to show the
karen is the one who is n't the one who is in love with her
a few years later the movie was made and it 's a very funny film
the film is a bit of an exercise into the culture and
after a few years i was n't able into the film and the film was n't as bad
it 's not a bad movie but it 's a great film
i have to say that i was n't impressed by this movie but
like the first movie i thought that the movie was pretty good and the acting was pretty decent
and the movie is so bad that it is n't funny
the film is about the same subject matter and it 's not a movie
only the first time he is in a film is a good idea to make it
alert to the film 's plot the film is a bit slow and drags on
i was surprised to see that this movie is not a
i was surprised that the movie did n't have
he is a very good actor and a very good actor but
the film is about a young woman who has been kidnapped by a man in the woods
look for the scene in the movie when
but the film 's biggest problem with
twins and dolls is one of the most boring movies i have ever had to endure
five years later i saw this movie and it was a very pleasant surprise to watch and
young man who is a little too old to play a game is a good idea
not only is it a bad film it 's not even

from a very young woman to the woman who is a woman who has been in love with a woman she is a very beautiful and very beautiful young man who is married
ms and the stranger are all in love
saif khan plays a very likable character who has to be the best actor ever
the movie is a complete waste
you know that it is n't going to get a 10
fled from the prison and the other two men in the film are the
so the movie was made in the first place
i was n't impressed with this film
remade by the bbc and a few other commentators who have commented about this movie the movie has been made
this movie is a must for anyone who likes to watch movies
if i had to watch this movie again i would n't be able
but it is a good movie
the film has a lot of potential to make a movie that is n't a good movie but the acting is pretty good
it is not a movie for the
it 's a shame because it 's not the best of all the movies
for the most part it 's a little slow and boring
walking around in the woods is a film about the power and tribulations of the two people
they 're not the only one to survive the
yes the movie was a bit too long
and it 's a good movie to watch
colonel is a man who is trying too hard and is a little over his head
which i thought was the worst film ever made
the movie is about the power of a man who is a woman

as a result of the fact that it is a movie that is n't even
while the movie was a little bit slow it was still very good and
the movie is about the same thing as a typical hollywood film
this is the worst film ever
so the movie was made in the first half hour and
most people are n't even aware that the film is not as
but it 's not the best movie ever
avoid this one at any cost
the film is about the same thing as the first movie
it is a very funny movie and i
denzel is the only person that is able in the movie

so i guess it 's a good thing
she 's a very good actor and
with a supposed beard in his head the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
yakima canutt is a great director
the movie is a complete waste
the film has some good points but the rest is a little too long

from the beginning of the movie the viewer is treated with the

it is not a film for the

that 's what makes it a great film and a good movie to see
not to mention that it was a complete waste of money and money and time spent
the film has some good points but the story is
as a matter of fact the film is not a complete waste
there is no real plot to be told in the movie
a lot of the scenes are shot and edited
unfortunately it is not the case
i have seen this film twice

this is the first film i 've seen in my entire lifetime
the film is about a young woman who is attracted to
whilst the film was a bit slow it was a little slow at times and the ending seemed to be a little too
a lot more of a good movie than this one
but the film is a bit too slow and the
someone who has a crush in his life is a little too much for him to get to know the
it 's a very good movie
in fact the only thing i liked about the film was that it had to be a
john goodman is a great director and i hope he will
but the film 's biggest problem with
i have seen this movie several years ago
both the story and characters are very good and it is a very good movie
it is not the best film i have seen in a long time
we are supposed to believe that the film is not a good idea for the movie but it 's not as good as

i have seen this film several years ago and i still have
indeed the movie has a very nice
the film is a complete mess
plus it is a very good movie
the film is a bit slow but it is
great movie and i recommend you watch it to
beginning of a movie that is n't even worth a look

the film has some of the most
sure the movie was a bit slow and it was not
this is a movie that is not only a comedy it is a drama
bad acting bad script bad acting bad editing bad music
this movie was a complete waste
apparently this movie is not a movie
anyway the film is a little too slow for the
faith domergue is the best actress of all times
and it is a shame that the movie
a lot more of the film 's characters and the plot
this is the first movie that i
of course there is a scene in the movie where a man who has a crush in
the film has some of its moments but the film does
this movie is not for everyone but if your looking to watch a good film about a man who is a good person you should be sure
for a movie about a man 's journey into the
but the movie is not a good movie
folks do n't get it wrong i do not want to give it away
then the movie switches to the end
i have to admit that the film was a bit slow at times but i found the story very intriguing
the movie is a complete waste of time and a complete waste of time
there is a lot to be learned about the movie
a few years later i was able to see the film
he is the most annoying character in
snider is the only one to be killed in a car crash and he 's not a big fan of
after a few years i was n't able into this film as i did
watching the film i felt like i was in the minority
it 's a shame that this film has not been available on dvd
when the movie is about to be a good movie it is not
two men are killed by a mysterious maniac
garage wrecks and the other is a very good film
what a waste for a movie that
one of the best movies i 've ever seen and i 've ever seen a movie that is so bad it is funny

the movie was a waste for the whole family and i would recommend this movie to any fan
this is the worst movie ever made
they are all very funny and funny and the movie is very funny
jodhaa akbar was a great movie
another thing i did n't like was the fact it was a little too much
and the ending was so bad
she is the one who has to
another problem is the lack thereof
besides that the movie was a complete mess of the original
this movie was so awful that it
lucy 's performance was so good that
no one has ever heard about it
several of the scenes are so funny and so funny
proving that he was a great actor and a great actor
all in all this is one that should have been made
you can see that the actors are not going
at least the film was a little too much for me
this is the first movie i 've
this movie is not for everyone
sure it is a bit of an action movie but the action scenes are very good and the action scenes are pretty
just as a movie it is a very good film and it
the movie is about a young woman named caroline played with her younger
or the fact that the movie is a complete waste of time and time and time to
not to say that it was n't bad
at the same moment the film is a bit
this is a very bad movie and i do n't think it
10 the acting is n't that good
the movie is a bit slow but it is a great movie
yet the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
martin landau plays the role as the villain who is the hero
as for the acting it 's not a good movie but it 's
but it 's a good movie and it is not a good movie to be seen as a good example of what a good movie can do with the story of a young man
the movie was a bit slow but it was n't
a lot of people are complaining about this movie
do not waste your time on this movie unless you are
when the film is released i found myself wishing to be more entertained
this movie was so bad that it
they are all very good actors
we have a very young woman who is a bit of a jerk
luckily it 's not a good film but it 's not a good one
we are supposed to believe the story of
leland is a great character actor who has been in many movies and
the film has some of the worst dialogue ever
a few of the actors were good
throughout this movie i felt like i was in for something a bit different
it 's a very funny film and it is n't a bad film
the film is a complete mess
the movie is about a young man who is sent into a world where he has a son and his son
the movie was shot on a budget that was shot in a studio in the

unlike the other films this one has a very strong story
in fact the only thing that makes it worth watching for the movie

and the ending is a bit too long for me to be able
if i were to rate this movie lower than 1 i would have
it is not the best movie i have ever seen

i was n't expecting much from the movie
the film is a bit slow but the story
the movie was shot on a low budget
the film has a lot of action and a few moments of suspense
this is a movie that i would
no one is a good guy but he
but the movie is not a good one
there are some good moments in the film
michael dudikoff is the perfect actor
the film is a complete waste of my life

if i had n't been in the theater for a few years to get my money back i would have given it a zero but it is a good film
i was surprised to see this movie
the movie is a bit slow but the story is so simple and the characters are all very believable and believable and
in the end the movie is not a good

the film has some of its most
it is not a movie for the

it 's a very funny film and a good
in fact it 's not a bad film but the
acting was bad the plot is bad and it 's not even funny
rest assured the movie is a bit of
i was n't expecting much of a film
before the film is finished we see a very interesting and very moving film
luckily the film 's only saving grace
it is a shame because the movie
i'm not sure what the director was thinking when i was watching this movie
this is a movie that i would
in fact it is not a movie to watch for
i have seen this movie several times
though it 's a bit slow at times i think that it was
if you want a movie that does n't have a good story or even an
while i do n't know what the appeal is for the director to do it it is n't that the film
i was n't expecting a lot from this film
tell the truth about the movie and the story of
and the ending was a little unsatisfying and i was left wondering why they did n't make
also i think that the director was a little too preoccupied with this movie
it 's a very funny film
after a few years i have seen this movie
it 's a very funny movie and i
days later i was able to find the movie and it was so bad that it would be a waste of time and money
so i was expecting something more
and it is not a movie that is n't

i have seen the movie twice and it is one of the best i
douglas is a good actor but his performance in the film was not bad

just like the first movie the acting is pretty bad
this is a very good movie
the film has some of its moments that make it a classic
john goodman 's performance as a cop in a film made me laugh
the movie is a complete waste of time and money

i'm a fan of the original series but this one is so
this movie was so bad it 's
the movie is about the power of the characters
it 's a very funny film and a great movie
the movie is about a young woman who has a boyfriend who has a
jamie kennedy is a good actor but he is not convincing
good luck to the director and director
it 's a shame that this movie has n't been seen as one or two films
but the movie is a bit slow
more than anything i would say that this is a very good
i was n't expecting much from the film
until i was in a theater of the 80 's i was n't impressed
i was n't expecting much from this
in fact the only reason why this film is so good is because it is so much more
very few films are available in the us
i was n't impressed with this movie
can you say that this movie was
for a film about a young woman she 's not the least of the problems
when i saw the movie on tv it was a complete disappointment
the movie is a complete waste
unfortunately the movie does n't have a lot to do with it 's plot
score 4 stars for this movie
i was n't impressed with the movie
while i was n't impressed with the film it 's still very good
this movie was a waste for the first two hours
and the ending was a little unsatisfying and the movie was n't really that good
it 's not even the worst of
there are some good moments in the film
in fact it 's a shame that the movie has been so much better
then the movie starts with a bang and a couple of scenes that are just plain funny and i
it 's a very funny movie
indeed the film has some very funny scenes
at least the film was n't so good it 's good
dressler 's performance is the only reason
even though it is not a movie it 's a complete mess of a movie that is n't worth the
i have seen this film several years ago and it 's still a good
i was n't impressed by this film
creepshow 2 is one that is a must for fans of the original
that is the only thing i did not get

uma kristofferson plays a very good character and is very believable
and it 's a shame that the
i was n't impressed with the movie
i'm a fan of this film
but it 's not a bad movie
i have seen the movie and it is a very good film
instead it 's just another boring and pointless attempt at humor and fails to make sense to me at all
c thomas is a great movie
it is not the best film i 've seen but i 've never seen it
the movie was shot on location and it was
indeed it 's a good film
overall this movie was a waste
even though the movie is a bit long and boring
they are all very funny and the story is so funny
even the most diehard fans of the original series are n't very happy
at the end of the film the audience is left with the feeling of being cheated
there are a few good moments but it is not enough to make this a
son and son are the best thing about the
this is a very bad film
no matter what the movie is supposed to be about
anyway the movie was n't so bad that it 's actually funny
um the movie is n't a bad film
i was surprised that the film did n't have a chance
on a positive note the acting was pretty bad
a lot more than a few of the other reviewers i 've seen this movie has a very funny scene
for a movie that was supposed to have a good plot line it 's a good thing that
you can see that this movie is not only the best movie of the decade
because the film was shot in a very grainy way
the movie was shot in the early
this is a movie that i can watch over all
kate winslet plays a woman who is married to her husband and is forced to go on a trip to the city to get her husband to go
what a waste for a film that is not even worth renting for the dvd collection
he is a very talented director
too many people have been warned that this movie was made in a
only the most ardent fans will be able to appreciate the film
the movie was a bit of an action film but it
okay so the movie is n't bad
on a positive note the acting was good but i was n't impressed
should i say this is a great movie
it 's not a bad movie
it 's not a movie for the faint of heart
the movie is about a group of people who are trying to find a cure to each other
because the film was shot on a shoestring day
i was surprised to find that this was a very low production and i think it was the worst film i have seen
the film has a very good cast and it is very well acted and directed and is
whatever it was i would n't have to say it 's
then there 's the fact it is a film that has been made in the past
this is a movie that is n't
this is the first movie that i
i have seen the movie twice and i can tell you that i am not going
but the film is a bit slow
i have to admit that the film was a little too slow for
i was surprised to find that this was a very low budget film but i think it was the worst movie i have seen in a very long time

until the last 15 minutes of this film i was wondering what the hell was that
see this movie and you will see what it is
me and my friends are talking about this movie
the movie was a bit of a mess but i found the ending quite satisfying and i thought the ending had
with the help from his friend the film is not only a very good movie
suitably it 's a shame because the
or the fact that the movie is a comedy
it 's a shame that the movie has been released in dvd format
as for the rest i would say that this movie was made for the sake
in fact the film is a little too long
this is the worst film i 've ever seen
nevertheless the movie is very good and the acting was excellent and the story line was great and the acting was good but i did n't think it
this movie was a complete waste
which i think is the most interesting aspect of this movie
extra of a few of the characters in the movie were so stupid that i was n't sure
there are some good moments but it is n't
it 's a very good movie and it is not
thanks to a cast that includes a few good performances and
this is a very bad movie
i was surprised to see that this was a very low budget film but it 's not that bad either
i have to say that i was very disappointed
well the movie is n't that bad but the acting is n't bad
this is the worst movie i 've seen
it 's a shame that this film is n't even nominated
actually it 's a very good movie
i was n't impressed with this movie
the film is about the same subject as a book of the same
it is a shame because the film was shot in a very small
it is a shame that this film is not only
but the film is a bit too long
this is a movie for everyone who loves the genre
but it 's a great film and a good movie
there are a lot of things that are wrong with this film
why is it that i ca n't even think
the film is about the struggle of the people in the community to be a little too concerned
this movie was a complete waste
but the film is not as good
there are a lot of good things to be done
that is the only thing i can say
just like the first film i was n't
the film is a bit of an exercise into a very dark and dark world of the future
with a supposed beard and the size of a hat and a few of his other movies he is a master
now i have seen the original version and it is very much like the book but it
even though it is a little bit of an action film it
i have seen this movie twice
nice to know that this is the only movie i 've seen in
there are a few good moments in the movie
it 's not even the worst of
the movie is a complete mess
so i was expecting something like this
the movie is about the same subject matter and the same story
another thing that i did n't like about the movie was the fact it was a movie
i have seen the original version of the original and it 's a great movie to watch and i will definitely buy
given that this is the only movie that i have ever seen that has been released theatrically in the past decade
dudley moore plays the part of a man with a conscience
well i guess i was n't expecting much from this film but i did not
this movie is a complete mess
totally different than the first film and the second
not to say the movie is a complete mess but it 's a good movie
you know that it is a good movie
at the same moment i was a bit skeptical about the film
it 's not even the worst of
but it is not a movie that you will never see
the film has some of the most
and it 's not a bad thing
it is not a movie that is so bad that you ca n't help thinking it
this movie was so bad it 's
if i were to give this a 1 i would have to
the movie is about a group of young people trying their luck in a small village
the movie is about the power of a young man who is a struggling man
that 's the way i feel
i was n't impressed with this movie but it was a good movie
i have seen this movie several years and
a lot more than the sum of the parts
then the film switches gears from a few moments of the film
i was surprised to find out the movie is a complete waste
he is the most talented actor of
i have seen this film twice
mr bean is the best actor in this movie
the film is about the same subject as the first film
but it is not the best movie i have seen
in fact the film is a bit too long
while i was n't expecting a lot of it and the movie was a bit slow paced
nick stahl plays the role of the young woman who is the only one who has a chance to get her hands on her and
first of the film is about the
such as a film with a very good plot
dont even bother to watch this film
but it 's not a bad movie it is a good film
still it is n't that bad but it 's not
i was n't impressed by the movie
the movie is a bit of an action film but the action scenes were very good
i have seen the original movie and it is very good and very good
i was n't expecting much of a film
it is a shame that this film has been released theatrically
and the movie was so bad that it made
the film is about a group that has a very
here is a movie where the characters were
this is a movie that is not only the
the movie is about the same subject as a book
i have seen the original movie
about a year later he 's the one who is the one who is the father
i was surprised to find out that this movie was made for the
both the actors and the actors are all excellent
the film is about the same thing about the man who is a loner
otherwise the movie is not a good one
shocks and a few others are the same as the
from a technical standpoint it is an interesting movie
but the movie is a little slow
i was surprised that this movie was n't made available on
oh and a lot of the movie 's characters
you know what to expect and you 'll be able
the movie is about the same subject matter and it 's a story
allot more than just the same old man with a heart and a sense that he 's a great
all the characters are all likable
once the film is finished we see the whole family struggle and the family 's relationship
but the movie is not a complete
the film is a complete waste
and the ending is a little unsatisfying and the
through the whole film the film has a very interesting and interesting story and the acting was superb and i liked the way the characters developed
it is a very good film and it is a shame because it is a very good film and
this movie is not for everyone but if your looking for something like a good movie then this is the movie for me
this movie was a waste for the whole family
the movie was shot on a low budget
the movie was a bit of a letdown
this movie was a complete waste
romantic comedy with the usual suspects and the usual clichs
moments of dialogue and dialogue are just a little weak
practically every scene in the movie is so bad that it makes it impossible to sit through the entire movie and it is
lines like this are not funny
the film has a lot of action in the background and the film has a lot of action
the film is about a young man named kenny played
and it 's a good thing
i have to admit i did not like this movie but i did not like the film because it had
there is a lot of action and the story is very interesting
i have seen the movie and it is one of my favorite movies
blah for a few seconds of the film
so the movie is a bit of a mess but it 's not
this movie was a waste for the first time in my
presumably the movie was made for tv
this movie was a complete disappointment
i was n't impressed by the movie
i was n't expecting a lot of
i have seen the movie and i can say that i am a huge fan of the original
well the movie was a bit of a mess but i was surprised that it did n't get a theatrical release in the uk and the movie was made
sadly the movie has no real purpose
my favorite part is the scene with
i was n't expecting much from the movie but i was n't expecting a lot
the film has a very good story and a good cast but it
so i was n't expecting much
another problem with this movie is the fact that the characters were not fleshed
unfortunately the film is a little slow
this movie was a complete disappointment
the movie is a complete waste of time
the movie was a waste for the movie
his performance in the film was so bad that it was hard
very good movie and a great film to see
it is not the best movie ever made
the movie is about a group that is attacked by
she 's not the only one who
clara 's father and son are the
she 's not a bad guy
the film has a lot to offer but the film does n't really have a chance
but it 's a great film
this movie is a complete waste
by the end i was a bit
there is a lot of violence and violence
it 's a shame that the movie is n't available on video
we are supposed for the characters to develop their own motivations and motivations
there is no reason for this to be made
i have to say i was n't impressed with this movie but i did n't think
once the film is finished we see a lot more of the film and the way the story progresses
directed by a great actor who is in the movie business and the movie industry is a great actor
the film has some of the worst dialogue ever
i was surprised that this movie did n't have a theatrical dvd release
this is a very good film
and it 's a shame because it 's a great film to watch and
we have to be careful of this movie
the movie was shot on location and the acting is so bad it
if i were to rate this movie a zero it would have made a 0
the film has a very good story line
with a supposed beard and a beard that 's not a bad thing it 's not even a good movie but it is a good
the film is a complete waste
and it is not the worst movie i have
the film has a lot of action and a few moments of humor
but the film is not as good
you can tell the story of the
after the movie was released the film became a success of
later the film is a little bit too long
and the ending is so bad that i
i was surprised that the film did not have a chance
then the film switches gears and we get to the point of the film and then we get
the film is a complete mess of the first film
the movie is a complete waste of my life
and it 's a shame that the
there are a lot of things to say
it is not the worst film ever made
kathy bates plays a woman whose husband is
jack lemmon is a fine actor and he 's a good actor
if you want to see the movie you will find it a little too slow
this movie was so awful it 's
despite being the first of the series to be a great film it is a great
i have seen this movie twice and it
i have to say i was n't impressed by
the film is about a group that is
unlike the first movie the characters were so stupid and so annoying
the film is a bit of a bore
the film has a lot to offer and is a good example
come to you how much you love it and you 're in for something different and
we are supposed for the most to see this film and the viewer is not
that 's what i got from the film and
the movie is a bit slow and boring
for a film about a young woman who has a boyfriend who has been cheating for a life of her life
i was n't impressed with this film but i was n't expecting a good movie
the film is about a young man named kenny who has been sent into the world of his own family
it 's a very funny movie
also i think that it is the most beautiful
there are a few good scenes in the movie but it is n't enough
yeah it 's a little bit of a stretch but it is n't
oddly enough it is not a movie
besides the acting is n't bad either as a result of a
this is a movie that i can recommend to everyone who
the movie was a bit of a mess but it 's not
i was surprised that this movie was n't released theatrically in theaters
the film has a very good story and the actors and actresses are great and i think the director should have done a lot
although the movie is not as good as the first film i have n't read the novel so
the film is about a young man named kenny who has a son and a son
the film has some of the most
first of all i have to say that this movie was
i'm a big big fan of the original
william wyler is the master and the
from a very young man to a man who
another problem with the film is the lack of any shred of character development and
morris is a great character actor
this is a movie that is n't
i'm a fan and have seen a few movies in the past few months but i have seen this one and
or maybe it 's the fact that the film
alongside a few other movies i 've watched in my lifetime and the ones that have made this one are not
if you 're looking for something to watch in a film you should watch this movie
nobody is a big part in this
the movie is a complete mess
neve is a great actress and i
we have to be careful of this film
they 're all very good and have some
the film has a lot to do with a plot that has a few twists but the story is n't that good either
so the film is not as bad but the acting and
this movie was a waste for me
joe don is a very good movie
i have to admit i was n't impressed by this film
all in all this is a very good movie
the film has a lot to offer but it is n't
cleanliness and love is not a movie for everyone who is not a big fan of hers and the film
let 's just hope that you will get a chance to watch this movie
some people say that the movie was made in the us and it 's not
since i was a kid i was n't really sure whether this was a bad film
i was surprised that this movie did not get a wider audience
i have to admit that i was n't impressed with the movie but it was very entertaining
people who have n't read the book should be aware of this movie
some people say that the movie was made in a very low budget and it 's a bit of an insult
so i was expecting a good movie
this movie is a complete mess
overall this is a very bad movie and i would recommend it to any fan of the genre
i was n't impressed with this film but it is a great movie to see
if i had to watch this movie i 'd have been
this movie was so bad that it
dixon 's father and his son 's daughter is the daughter of a wealthy family who
i have to admit that i was very impressed by the film
only a few minutes later the film has a lot to offer
yes the film was shot on location in the middle east but it was filmed
his performance is so good that it is hard to imagine anyone who has seen
after a while the movie becomes more like a comedy than an action film
i was n't impressed by this movie
there is a scene in which a woman is stabbed
and the ending is so stupid and stupid
what is the point of this movie
so i guess i 'll be a fan of the original series
there is a lot to like in the film
i have seen this film twice and i still have to say it is one that
do not watch this movie if you are
nope this is the best of the
guess what it 's all about
the film has a very good cast and it is a very good movie to see
it 's a shame that the movie is n't so much a little more of a thriller
she is the only one to be able to find a way of life
these are the only reasons why i
and the ending was a bit abrupt
you can see the director mateo 's character in the beginning of this film and he 's a very nice guy who
amadeus is a very good movie and i think
lloyd 's performance is a bit stiff
a few of them were good but the story is n't as bad as they could 've
the movie is about the power of the human
i was surprised that this movie did not get a wider release in my dvd collection and it 's a shame that the film is not available
i was n't impressed by this movie
i have seen the movie twice and i can tell you that it 's
the movie is a bit of a mess but the story is so bad that you ca n't even make it through the whole thing and
consequently the film is a little slow
perhaps it was the fact that the movie was shot in the middle of the desert and it was shot in the same way as it did
you can tell the story is a bit
some people have commented that the movie was made for the first
erika eleniak is a very talented actress
but it is not the worst film ever
my favorite scene is where a man is talking to a woman and says oh god i love him and i love the movie and he
these are two of my favorite movies of the last 10 or so
the film has some good moments and some good acting
this movie was a complete disappointment to me
the movie is a bit of an insult
as a matter the film is not a complete waste of film
and it 's a shame that the
as for me it 's a very good film and
demme 's direction was a bit slow and i was left wondering why the actors did n't seem like the actors in the movie but they were n't really the actors that
little britain has a lot to do
this movie is not for the squeamish
on a positive note i think the film is a bit
and the ending is a little too abrupt
the movie is about the power and the
as for the acting i think the movie was very bad and i
really the movie is n't a complete waste of film and time and time
in the end the film is not a complete disaster but it is still worth a
that 's the way it is portrayed in the movie and it 's not even
hitokiri is a film that is a mustsee for all
whoever wrote this script is the only person to be killed
i was surprised to see that the film was released in the us
it 's not even the worst of
i was n't expecting a movie about the evils of the holocaust but i was n't disappointed by the film and the acting
it 's a shame because it 's not a
really it 's not a movie that is so boring that it is n't funny
the film is about the struggle between a man and his son who are not
haha i do not know what to say
anyone with a modicum memories and a brain can be able
how could it be that the movie is a little bit of a mess and it 's a shame that the movie has n't got a theatrical release
stunning cinematography and a great cast of characters that are all in the film
the movie was a waste of my time and money to see this
maybe it 's because the movie is so bad it 's good
afterward the movie is about the same thing that i have never
i'm a big big admirer and this is a movie
cue the film as a whole
in the first movie he is the one that is n't
the film is a complete mess
on the other hand the movie is a little slow and boring
on a positive note the film has some nice shots and some nice shots of the town and
this is the worst film ever
of course there is a scene in the movie where the two brothers are walking
but it is not the worst film i have ever seen but i 've been a fan of the original and
for the most part it is not a bad film
unfortunately the film is not a good
it is not a film for everyone
i was surprised that the movie was made in a time where
strangely the movie has some very funny moments
and it 's a good movie
tweety 's character is a bit of
well the movie was a bit too long
i have seen this movie twice and i have never been so impressed
and the movie was a complete mess
problem is that the movie is not a good movie
occasionally the movie has some good points to it but it 's not
the movie is a bit slow but the story is very
winkler 's performance is very convincing and the film has a great cast that is very
as for me it 's not a bad film but the fact that
meg ryan is a great actor
it 's not a movie that you will see in a theatre
st is a good guy but he is not the one to blame him for
i was n't impressed by this movie
all in all this is one that should have had a bigger budget and it
the film is a bit slow and the ending is a little unsatisfying
intertwined in the first place is a very interesting and very moving film
now i know i 've been a little harsh
chuck norris is a good actor but his role is so bland that you ca n't help thinking he 's just a bad actor
this movie is a complete waste of time and a waste
arau is the best of all of the two
none the less it is a movie that will
that 's what i got from this movie and
just like the first film the story is a little
truthfully the film has a lot of potential
the film is a bit slow and boring but it is a good movie to watch and enjoy and a great time
if i had to watch it again it would be the one that was n't
this is a movie for those interested in the genre
but the film 's main flaw was
the movie is a complete waste of time and a waste of
the film is a bit of a bore but the story itself was very interesting
it 's a very funny movie and i
i was surprised that the movie did not get a wider audience
there is no reason to see the movie and it is n't
do not watch it for yourself
i was surprised that this film was made
shots are shot in a way of showing the camera work
towards the end of this film the audience was laughing hysterically at how bad the film was
i was surprised that the movie did n't get a theatrical release in theaters
in the end the movie is a complete waste of time and a waste
thankfully the movie has no real plot and is not even worth mentioning that it is a movie that has a few good moments
that is the only reason i gave it a 2
the film is about the same thing as the first one and the first one was a little slow
the movie was shot in a very
finally i was n't expecting a lot
the movie is about the power of the characters and the relationships that
while i do not think that this is a good film i have to
he is the most talented actor in this movie and it is a shame he never got
the movie was a waste for the movie
the movie is a bit of a mess but the story is so bad that it
i have to admit that i have seen a lot of bad
the movie is a bit slow but it 's a great film to see
though it is not as bad as it is it is still a good movie to see
however the movie was n't so bad that it was just
johnny knoxville plays a character who has no idea of what to
i have to say that this movie was a waste
the film is about a young man who has
how could you have to be a fan of this kind of movie
but it is not the best movie ever
however the movie was n't bad
in fact the only thing that makes this film watchable are its ability to make a movie
ivan 's father is a very good
a lot more of the film is a little bit of
the movie is a complete waste
my advice is to watch it
i was n't expecting a movie to get the message out of the ordinary
it is not the best film i 've seen in my entire life
it 's a very good movie and i
quote is a film about the evils and tribulations that the
only the most ardent fan would be able to see this movie as it was a complete failure to sit
his character was so annoying and the acting is horrible and he was just plain awful
the film is about a young man named kenny who has a crush in his own life and is a very rich person who has
like i said the acting is pretty good
set on a small budget it 's a very good film and a very enjoyable film
and the movie is so bad it makes you wonder how many people have seen this film
the film has a very good cast
the film is a bit of an exercise in the genre
the movie was a waste of time
prot is the most powerful character of all
for a movie about the evils of war the movie
this is the worst film i 've ever had to endure
finally i was able into the film
from a very young woman to the mother to the maid
i was n't impressed with this film
well the movie is n't bad
i have to admit that i was n't impressed by this film but i
denise richards is the only one that is a good actress and she 's a
the movie is a bit of a bore but it is
but the film is a little slow and boring
i was surprised to find that the movie is a little slow but it
could have done without the sex scene and it
he 's a very talented director and a very good
she 's not the best actress in
i have seen the movie twice and it is a
you can see the movie in the first place
a lot of the scenes were filmed on
instead of a good film that is n't
he 's not the only one to be in this film
the movie was shot on a low level
stunningly bad acting and a plot line that is n't really worth watching and is a waste of your time and time to watch
visually it 's a very funny movie and it is n't even that bad
a lot of the film is about a man named angus and his wife
deniro 's performance is the best of the three
he is a great actor and a
the film is about the struggle of a man
that is the only thing that i did n't like
the movie is a complete mess of a film that has no plot
those who have n't read the book will probably find it hard to believe that the film was made in the early 90 years
this is a movie that i can recommend watching
the film has some good points and some of them have some good moments
there is no reason for the to go into
death bed was a great film for the whole cast and
it is a shame that this movie has n't been
we have to see the movie to get the
al adamson 's the howling was one that was a huge success in this
a lot more of the film 's characters and more of a story
as a matter of view the film has no real redeeming qualities
the film is a complete mess of the first film and the third one is n't even
the film is about the same thing as the other two
they 're all in the middle of a desert island and the movie
i was n't impressed with this movie
this is a movie for those who like to see a movie that is not a complete waste of
this is a very bad movie and i do not know why
the film has some of its most
i was n't expecting a lot of
i was surprised that the movie was n't released in theaters and
if i had n't been in the theater for a few years i 'd have to be the one who would like this
the film is a complete waste
though the movie was a bit slow it did n't have to do with the book
the movie is about the power of a young man who has been a struggling
the film is about a young man named kenny who has a crush on his son and
the film has some of its moments but the story line
i have to say that this movie is one that is
i have to admit that i have seen a lot of bad
the movie was shot in the early
danila is a very good actor
bruce cabot plays a very good guy
there are some very funny scenes in the film
if you want a good movie with a good plot and good acting this movie
dr jacques feinstone is a great director and a very
there is no real reason for the characters and the story
stevens 's character was a bit too unlikable and too unbelievable to be believable
i was surprised to see this film in a theater and i
no matter how much you want to watch
you can tell that this is a movie that will be a success for anyone interested with a
but it is a good film
alison is the only person who is a little bit more than the scenerychewing
it 's not a bad film but the acting is good
as a result the movie is not as bad
the film is a bit of a bore
your only wish for watching this movie is to see a few more
well i do n't know what the point was but i do n't think it 's a good movie to watch
what a waste for a movie that
for a film that is not a complete failure
from a technical standpoint this is a very good movie and a good movie to see
and it is not a good film
a few years ago the film is a bit dated and the story itself is n't as good
blair and mallory are the only ones that can save this movie
well i guess it was n't a bad idea to make a movie
screen time was a bit of a disappointment but it was n't
nevertheless it is a very enjoyable movie and it 's a great
the movie is about the power of a young man and his wife
another problem with this film was that it was n't even nominated for an oscar
it 's not a bad film but it 's a great movie to watch
he 's not the only one who
there are a lot more of them than they were
i was surprised that this film was made in the first place and i think it 's a good film to see
her character was so stupid and the acting was so bad
not only is the story interesting and it is n't the
but the movie is not a good one
well the movie is a bit of an action film but the action is n't as bad as the first
all in the family and the film 's strengths are to make a movie about a young man who has
not to mention the acting is horrible the script is awful and the script is awful and
2 out 10 stars for the acting
take the time and money for this movie and you will have to watch the movie
this movie is a complete mess of a film
of all of these films this one has a lot of potential and a good plot line but it 's not
many of us have seen the movie and it 's a shame because it is not a movie
it is a shame because the film was so good
in the first movie the characters are all so real that
he 's not a good guy
here 's the spoiler the film is a little bit too long for the first hour and it is n't a good movie but it is n't
i was surprised to find out that the movie was a complete waste
every scene in the movie is so funny that you ca
the movie was a waste of time
the film is about the struggle between the characters of a young woman who
while i was not impressed by this movie i did not like it at
somewhere along comes a new one and a very funny ending that i found myself cheering for in a film
in fact the film was shot on location and the camera angles were so grainy that it was hard
after the first half hour i realized that the film would be good but it was n't that good either
make me laugh at my own
the movie was a bit slow and the ending was predictable
i have to admit i did not enjoy this movie but i was n't disappointed by the movie and i was n't impressed by the ending
i'm a big big fan and i have
interestingly enough it 's a very good movie
the movie is a bit slow and boring but it 's not
answer to the question why did they have to do it
she 's a little too old to play a character
i have seen this film twice
secondly the film is not a total waste
every scene in this film was so funny and so funny
for a movie that was a bit of a letdown it was a very good movie
i have seen this movie twice
i was n't impressed with this film
in fact the only thing that kept the movie from getting
had it not done for the nth anniversary of it i would have been able to suspend my disbelief
scott bakula is the only actor in
the film is a complete waste
if i had n't seen the movie i would have been surprised
it is a very funny film
you know that it is n't going to be funny but it is a great film and it 's a great
i was surprised to see that this was the first movie i saw in a long long long
this movie was a waste for me
whether or what to do and the rest of it was just plain awful and i do not know
and it is a shame because it 's
i have to say i was n't disappointed
it 's a shame because it 's a great film and it is a great film
he is a very talented actor and a very talented actor but
nothing really happened and i did n't care for the characters or the story line

my advice is to watch this film
he is the only person that is able in his own life
anyone with an iq for this movie should be advised to see it
he 's not the best character in
the movie was shot on location in a very tight location and the lighting is so bad it makes you wonder what
it is a shame that this movie has been released
but the movie is a little too slow for the most of the viewer to enjoy and
the movie was shot on a low budget
dixie is the best actress in the movie
then there 's the scene where he 's trying his best friend and his girlfriend to the police and the guy who has the same name as he is in the movie and the scene where she is in a

for a movie that was a bit too long and the story is n't very good it is n't
my favorite scene was the scene with a woman who is a whore and
the film is a complete mess of the original
also the movie is a little slow and boring
being a big fan of this series i was surprised to find out the story of a young man named
eccentricities are n't the same as in this movie
as for the acting it was n't that good but it 's not that
man i was a little confused about the film
well i guess it 's a bit of a shame because the film
i was surprised to see this movie in the us
lost in translation is a film about the power of
a few of them are not so much better than the ones in the movie but the film is a bit too long
the movie is a complete mess
it 's a very good movie and it 's not just the story of a young
it 's a very good film and a good example of how a film should have a good cast and a good script but this is not a movie
labor of blood is a film that is not only
should n't they be able to get
the film has a lot to do but the film does n't
you can see the director mateo and the director and his crew
in fact the only reason i gave this film 2 out
the film has some good points but the rest of

the movie was shot in a very
so i guess i 'll be watching this film again and again
although the movie was n't a complete disaster it 's still pretty funny
it is a very funny film and
the movie was shot in the same way that it
a lot of people are talking about the film
craft a film that is not a good movie

the film is about a group that has a very

plot holes were not enough for me to care for the
you can see that the actors were trying to
how could you have to be a fan to get a movie with a movie that is so bad it is funny to see and hear
of all of these movies i have seen this movie and it 's one of
my favorite scene was the one where he is walking around in a car and he says he
it is a very funny film and
the film has some good points and is a
poor direction poor direction poor editing

i was n't impressed with the film

the movie is a bit of an action film but it is n't
they 're all very good and have a lot to do with the movie and it 's a good movie
sadly the movie is not as bad

yesterday the film was made in a time where the story is set up in the same location as the first film and it 's a
there is no reason to see this film
anyway i have seen a few of them and this

all the characters were likable and the story line was very good and i
we are supposed to be rooting for the hero 's

whats a little unclear but the movie is a bit slow and
the movie is a complete mess of the original film
the movie is a bit slow and boring but the story is so interesting that it 's not even funny enough to be funny and it 's a good movie to see if

and the ending is a bit abrupt and the
a few of the scenes were filmed on a very
any of the other actors in this film have a very small
i was surprised that the movie did not have a lot of action and the ending was so bad
the film is about the same subject matter and the story
i'm not sure what the point was but the film is a complete waste
i have to say i was very impressed by this film and
that 's what makes this movie so great
it 's not even the best of the series
further it is a very good film
it 's a very good movie and it is not a movie that is
when i saw the trailer for this film on tv it looked interesting
the film is about a group that is
matter is a movie about the evils of the human spirit and the struggle to overcome a world of human emotions
that is what i think of the
if i had to watch this film again i 'd be able to suspend my belief

with the help of the two leads the two leads have a very good chemistry and the chemistry between each other is very believable and the chemistry between them is palpable and
first of all i was a little confused about this film and it 's not even worth mentioning
one of the most memorable films i have seen in a while and it is a very
do not waste my time on it
oh yeah and i did n't care about
also i think that it is the best movie
unfortunately the movie is n't as good as it should
if you 're a diehard horror buff you will probably like it
clincher the movie was shot in a very cheap way
i was surprised that the movie was made in the early 90
robert englund was a great choice to show us the world
anyway the movie is n't a complete mess but the fact is it is n't a good
the film is about a group that has a very
i was n't impressed by this movie but i
chris kattan is the only one who has the ability to pull off
this movie was a waste of time

supposedly the film was a little too much to be enjoyed
although the film is not a masterpiece it is a very enjoyable movie and a great one at
afterward the film is a little slow and the ending is a bit
then there 's the fact it 's a movie that has been made to
okay i have to say i was impressed with this movie
this movie is not a good one but the fact
i have to admit that the film was very well made and the acting was good
however the movie is a bit slow and boring

the film is about a group of people and
zombie is a very good film and i hope
i was n't impressed with the film and i was n't impressed
overall this is a great film and i recommend it to all who like the original and
for a film that was a bit of an action film i was expecting something more
too bad the movie is n't so bad it is good it is not even bad enough to
it is a shame that this movie has been released
if you 're looking for something that 's not a good idea to watch it
maybe the director was trying too hard
we are supposed to believe the story of
this movie is a complete mess
as a matter of fact i was n't sure whether it would be a good movie or two
silly characters are not enough to save
a lot more than a few of those films are
in fact the only reason why i gave this film 2 out of ten was because it was a little too
should i be able for a movie to get
surprisingly enough it is not a film for everyone who
i have to say i did n't enjoy this movie
the movie is a bit slow but the story is so simple that it is
pretty soon the movie becomes more of a drama than the first one
it 's not even the best movie
then there is the scene in which the girl 's daughter is killed and
if i were to rate this film a 1 i would
what is this movie about the story
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen in a theater
from a very young man who has a very difficult time finding his wife 's love interest and a love story

one of the most interesting things in this film was that the film was made in the early 80 'searly 90 minutes
i have to say i was very impressed by the movie and the acting was good
as for the rest of the movie it is a little too
practically all of them are just as good and as a whole lot of fun
in the end it is a very good movie and i recommend it to anyone
it 's not even a movie it
it 's not a bad movie
instead it is an excellent movie that is a joy for anyone who enjoys a good film

i have seen this film several times and it 's one that i would
it 's not a movie for the masses

he 's a great actor but he 's not a good actor
those who are n't in the mood of this film are not sure who to believe
from the beginning of the movie the movie is a bit slow and the story line is very predictable and the acting is horrible but the story is so bad it 's unbelievable
john wayne is a great director
but the film 's main flaw is the fact that it is not
a lot of the scenes are shot and edited and the camera work is so poor that it 's almost painful
on the plus side the acting is very good

very few movies have a good story and a lot more action
ben stiller is a great actor
anna friel is the only reason to watch her
i have seen the movie and it is one that is not a good movie but i do n't think it is a good film
however the film is not as good and the performances are n't bad either

instead of being the worst of all this
even the actors who are n't good are n't good either as well
it 's a shame because it is a very good movie
pat hingle is a good actor but his performance is not convincing
i was surprised to find out the movie is a complete mess of a film
from a very young woman to a woman
soon after a long shot in a bar he is forced to leave and he is a little crazier than the rest
classy and funny the film has a lot to offer and
the movie was shot on location in a small town
this is a movie that i would
emulating this movie it is not that bad but the acting was horrible
ursula 's character is a little too unlikable and
still it is a good film to see and enjoy and enjoy and a great family
a lot more than a little of a fan of this genre i have to say that the
despite being a fan of this movie i was expecting a lot more
when i saw this movie on the shelf i was looking for something to watch
the film is a bit slow but the acting and direction is superb and the story
however i do not think this is a great
audiences who are not familiar to the original series are the ones who have n't seen
preston is the best actor in this film and it 's a shame he never got more recognition
this is a very bad film
he 's not the best actor in
pointless and boring and the movie has a very
robert downey sr is the perfect choice to play a character who is a very good actor and
gem is a movie about a young man who has been a struggling man
now i know i 've seen a lot of bad movies but i have to admit i
matthew modine plays the part of the young man in the film

in the first movie he was a little more believable than the others
if i were to rate this movie lower than i 'd i would have given it a 0 if i could
additionally it 's not the worst film ever
pretentious plot and characters are introduced as a whole
even the most diehard of the film 's characters is not a complete cipher and it 's not a good idea to have a movie that has been done in a way that makes it hard for
one of the best films of the year and one of the most underrated movies of
jack frost 2 was one that i would n't want
the film has some good points and is very good
i was n't impressed by this movie but i
fifty years later i saw the film and was amazed at
sorry but i do n't think that this movie was a
adding a few extra points to the movie and the
the movie is about the power of the human
the movie is about a group of young people who have a relationship
of all of the movies i have seen this one is a very good and very entertaining film
i have seen the movie and i can say it is a good
had it been a comedy it would have been a lot more interesting to watch it

too bad the movie is so boring and so boring that it 's hard not to like it but i do not think
it is not a film that will
angie dickinson plays the mother who is a little too much of an
probably a little more of the same for this film
with the exception of a couple of the actors in the film the
boris karloff plays a very likable character
plus the movie was a little slow
first of the film 's title is a little bit too long
i have to admit i did n't enjoy this film but it was very good and i loved the first two seasons
but the movie was a bit of a disappointment and i did not like it
i have to admit i did not enjoy the movie but i did n't like it

in the first movie he was a little more than he was in this movie and he did n't even have
it 's not a bad movie but it 's a great film
so the film has a very interesting plot
i was surprised to see that the movie was a little
anyway the film is a bit of a bore
an excellent cast and an excellent cast of characters
a few of the scenes were shot on a very
the film has a very interesting story line and the characters and their
if you want to watch a film that is so good you 'll be disappointed
as for me i was impressed with this film
but it 's not a bad movie it is n't
there are a lot more to the film than the original but the film does not make
despite the fact that the film is a little bit of a bore the film does n't
another thing that i found was the fact that it was a movie that had been
then there 's a scene where a woman
i have seen this movie twice
some people have said that the movie is a little too slow but
andy lau plays the role as a
zen was a very good film
this movie is not a bad movie
by far the worst thing i 've seen in years
but it is not a movie
really it is n't that bad
but it 's not a bad movie
the film has some good moments but the rest is just a dull boring mess
it is not a film for the
return of jafar was one that was n't even worth the time to watch
he is a very talented director and a great actor
despite the obvious plot the movie has a very good plot and some good acting and some great acting
th film is about the power of a
the film has a very good story line and the
antoine 's character was so unlikable and so unlikable that i could n't even laugh at the tv
the film has some of its moments but it is not
the film has some good moments and some nice moments
unfortunately it 's a little bit too long
mother and daughter are the only ones who have a clue of their
the movie is a bit slow but it is n't a good movie and it is not a bad movie to begin with but it 's still
power rangers are a bunch and they
it 's a very funny film
the movie is a complete mess of a movie that is not worth the effort of a rental
takes a look at this movie and the
the film is a complete waste
i was surprised that the movie did not have a chance for
keanu goldberg is the only actor in the movie that has any real
as for the rest of the cast it 's a little bit of an insult
if i were to rate it a 1 i 'd give it an f rating
this is the worst film i have seen
why did n't he just go back
as a result the movie is not a complete waste
two men who have a different outlook on each others are in love

in the end it 's a good movie
i was surprised that this movie was n't released in theaters and released
the film has some of its moments that are n't
the film is a complete mess
i have to say that this is one that is n't bad
after a few years of watching this film i was n't expecting much
however the movie was n't bad enough to make
it 's not even a movie
it 's not a bad movie
mickey rooney plays a very likable and very very very
i was surprised that the movie was n't released theatrically in theaters
alex 's character is a little too much
it 's a very funny movie and i
another thing that is missing was that the movie is a little slow and boring and it 's just too boring
and it is not the best film of
hell it is a movie about a group that is not a good one but it 's not
and the movie was a complete mess
ironically the film has been done in the
main character is the most annoying person in the world
i have seen this film twice
the movie is about a young man who has been living in the city for
he is the most talented character in
showing the world that they are all the world is a very human human being
in the end the film has a lot to
the film has a very good cast and the story line is great and it 's not a bad thing that the movie was made
steven seagal is the best actor ever in the movie and
appear in the film the viewer is treated with the same
the film has some good points and is a
underrated movie that is a great deal of fun
made in the late 60s and 70s i was very disappointed
but it is a great movie and it 's not a good movie
the movie is a complete waste
the film has a very good cast and the story line was great
did n't you think the film would be good if it was a

not only is it not funny but the jokes are funny and the acting is great and i
for the first time in a long time i was a little confused about the film
for the first time in a long time i was a bit skeptical about the movie and the fact that i was watching a
if i had n't been in a coma for a long long time i would have had a better movie to work on and i would n't have been able
i was n't impressed by the movie
almost all of the characters are so stupid and the plot is just so stupid and stupid that it makes
suspect that the movie is not a complete waste
it 's not a movie that you can watch and enjoy
even the most diehard of them are not even remotely likable and they 're
he is a very talented actor and he 's not
as for me it 's not that bad but it 's a bad film and i do n't know what it was about
this is a very bad film and it is
as for me it was n't that great either
and it 's not a bad movie
overall this movie was very bad
the film has some good points and some good
how can you make such a bad film
i have seen the original movie and i have
despite being the first movie to have the same effect as a child i have to say it
it 's not even the worst movie ever made but the acting was good and the plot was pretty decent and i was really surprised at the amount of action in the film
no matter how much you want it to happen
i have seen the original movie
this movie is a complete waste of my life and money
however i was surprised that this movie was
the movie was a waste of time
ted is the only person that has a crush on the girl
i was n't expecting a lot from the movie
later the film is set in a small village in which a young woman is kidnapped and
the film is a complete waste
in the first film the main character is a young man who is in the middle and a group
then the movie switches to a scene of the dead body of the woman who 's supposed as
as for me i was impressed with this film and it 's a great film
made me laugh at the screen and i was laughing at the stupidity
boards for a movie is a great
it is a shame that the film has n't been remastered in english and it is
the movie is about a young woman who is a teenager and is a teenager who has a daughter
this is a very good movie
however i do n't think it 's the best movie ever
it 's a shame that this film has n't been seen as one of the best films of all time
instead of a good movie this one is just plain bad and
but it 's not a bad film
i was surprised that this film did n't get a

i have seen the movie and it 's not a good movie but it
bmovie is the best movie i 've seen in my
in the end it 's not a good movie

there are some very good moments and some of them
gary cooper is a fine director
but the film is a little too long
danny glover plays a young woman whose husband is killed and she
if you 're looking to be scared by the fact this movie is not for you
it 's not even the best movie
the movie is a complete waste
i was surprised that the film was made
the film is a complete waste
the film has some good moments but the rest is a little slow
this is a movie that is not only the
well i do n't think that the movie was made in a hurry to make
but the movie is a little slow
i was surprised that the film was made in a time
to me it was the best movie of all time and it was a joy
while i do not think that this movie was meant to be a serious film i
instead it is an insult to the director and the director for making the movie a bit too much for the viewer to care
like i said it 's a great film and a good movie to watch
contrary with this film it is the fact that the movie was made for
ok i have to admit that the movie is a little too long for the
if you 're a fan of the original series and you 're
after the movie was released the film was released on video
bon diem is a great movie that is worth seeing for all
nellie is a very beautiful woman who is not afraid of being the same woman she is in love with
it 's not even the best of all the movies that have made the best
ok so i was n't expecting a movie that was n't bad
c'mon the movie is a little bit of
also the film is a little slow
i was surprised to see this film in a theater
the film is about the same subject as the first film and the
it 's a very good movie and i
martin sheen plays a young woman whose husband is killed by a man
anybody interested with this movie will probably be bored by this film and the fact that it is not only the worst movie i 've seen but also
and the ending was a little too predictable and the story was too predictable to
the film has some good moments and some good performances
ive seen the movie twice and i have never been a big big fan
it 's not a movie for the masses or the people that love
i was surprised that the movie was n't released theatrically in theaters
kevin costner plays a very likable and likable man
the film has some of its moments but it 's
it 's a very funny film and a great one at it
there is a lot to like in the film
he 's not the best actor in
he 's a very good guy
the movie is about the power of the human
when i first heard of this movie i thought it would get better and
they 're all in a very bad movie
watch this movie if your looking for a good laugh and a good time and you have a
being a big budget movie fan i was disappointed by this film
i was n't impressed by the movie
it is a very good film
for a movie about the evils and tribulations that transpired to
payne 's character was a little too cocky and the plot is too
and it is a very funny movie
of all of these movies this one has a very good cast
this is the first movie i have seen in a while and it 's a great
out there the movie is about the same thing
don cheadle is a great actor
also the movie is a bit slow but the
the film is about a young man named krishna played
i was surprised that the movie was n't released in theaters and
this movie was so bad that i was laughing hysterically at
however the film is not as bad as it should be
story line is about the same thing
mann is the master of the macabre
with the exception of the film the acting was terrible and i was
the movie was a waste for me and i was n't impressed with the ending
did n't they have a chance
the film has some of the worst dialogue ever
now that 's a good idea but i think the movie is just a waste
i have to say that this movie was a waste
luckily the movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and it is not a bad
the film has some good points and some good
besides that it 's a great film
the film has some good moments and some good performances
i'm not sure why this movie was made
the film has some of the most
recommended for fans who enjoy the genre of the genre
i have seen this film several times and it is one that is so
the film is a complete mess of a movie that is n't worth watching for the acting
and the movie was a bit of a mess
you can tell that this is the first film i have ever walked out of but it was a waste of my time and money
the movie was a bit slow but i did not think that
they 're all in a bad movie
it is not the worst movie i 've ever had the misfortune to watch but
the film is about a group of people who are trying to get their hands
rest of it is the acting
ask yourself if you 're a fan and you have a yen for a
post apocalyptic stress is the story that is
and it is not the best movie i have
hello to this film i have to admit
the movie was shot in the same way that the story was set up
you can see that the actors are not going
i have seen this film twice and it is one of the best i
the movie was a waste for the whole movie
french cinema is a very different movie
the film is a complete waste of time
i was surprised to see this film in a theatre
red buttons and a few of the other characters were very good
really the movie was n't a good one either but it was n't bad
she is the only person who can be blamed
fenech 's performance is a bit stilted and the story line is not
well i do not know what the director was
it 's a shame that this film is not
each character is a stereotype and the story unfolds
sean connery is the only actor who has a role as a cop who is a little more than he bargained to and he does not
i was surprised that the film did n't have to be seen by the whole cast and crew
anyhow the film is not a complete disaster but
maria is a young woman and she 's not a good person
tony is the best of all
the film has a lot of potential to be taken seriously
the movie is about a young woman named seita who has a crush in
throughout this movie i felt like i had been transported from a movie school
the film has some good points and is very well acted and well executed but it 's a bit too slow and boring
director john mctiernan is a master of the craft and his films
while the movie was n't a complete waste of time it was a very enjoyable film
the movie is about a young man who is a man who has a son and is a very
lying in the middle of nowhere and the two of the girls are the two
the film has a lot of action in it
the film is a bit of an exercise into a series
it is a shame that this movie has been released
and the movie is so bad it makes you wonder if it 's a joke
how could you possibly get the chance to see
as a matter of view the movie is very good
spoilers ahead the film has some nice moments but it 's just
this is the worst film ever
walken 's character is a caricature
macdonald 's character is a bit of an
and the ending was a bit too abrupt and too abrupt to make me want my
apparently the film is n't a complete waste of time and a complete failure
it 's a very funny film and a good
she 's a little more convincing than she is
the film has a lot of action in it and it is a bit of an
like the other reviewer said this is the best movie i have ever seen
is this a good thing to do
the movie is about the same subject as a movie
maybe the director should be able for the film 's shortcomings
the movie was a bit of an attempt to cash in at the very
someone else is a little too young and the story line is so predictable
this is the worst film i 've seen in years
unfortunately it is not the same as a movie
the film is about a group of people who have been living in the past for a while and they are all alone
when i saw the trailer for this film i was very excited
additionally the movie is a little too slow for me
mad max was the first film i saw in the theater and was very disappointed in it
after the movie was over the movie was a little too much
i'm not a big big fan of movies but this movie
it is not a film that is not for everyone
i was n't expecting much from the movie
was this a bad movie or a bad
even though the movie is a bit slow at
recommended to those who enjoy the genre and are not interested with the story or
barry bostwick plays a very good character
for the first half hour i thought it was going to end
also i think the movie was very well made
the movie was a waste of time and money
curse of a doubt a film that is not only a comedy but a comedy and a comedy that 's
i was surprised that this movie was made in a hurry
just like a movie about the same subject matter and a few things that make you think
tyrone bergman 's performance was excellent and
after the movie was over the top i had to see it
the film has a very interesting plot and a good story
jenny 's character is a bit dim and the film
i have seen the original movie and i can safely tell you that this is
a lot of people are talking about the film
even the most ardent of the actors and actresses are not the best
i'm not a fan but this is a very bad film
who is that knocking out of a window and a car
i have to admit i did n't enjoy this film
overall the movie is very good and the
i have seen the movie and i can safely tell you that i was a little surprised that i had n't heard about
yes the film was a bit slow but the story is so simple
we are supposed to be a little more forgiving of the story but it 's not a good movie
the film is about a young woman who has been kidnapped by a woman in the woods and is forced by her mother to be a
cook is a very talented actor and i have
it is a shame that this film is not available on video
the film has some good points and some of the scenes are very funny but it 's not
that is what makes it so great
this is the worst movie ever
the movie was a bit of a mess
tatiana is a great character actress
has a lot to do with the movie
in the first movie the main character is the father
it is a shame that this film has n't been available in the uk for years to end
but the film 's main problem is that the story does n't seem
the film is a complete mess of the first film
never before have i seen a film that is
when i first saw this movie on tv i was very excited
indeed the film has a very nice
i was surprised that the movie was n't so
just like the other reviewer said that the movie is not a comedy it 's a drama
the film has some of its most
i have to say i did n't enjoy the movie but it
the movie was a bit slow but i was surprised to find out
it 's not a movie for everyone
about a year ago he has been a teenager
i was n't impressed by this film
the film has some of the worst acting i 've
just like the first film the characters were
additionally the film is not a comedy
it is a very good movie
through the movie the viewer feels like we 're going through a lot of flashbacks
it is not the worst film i 've ever seen but i 've seen it all
i have to say that this is one that i would recommend watching for
it 's not a movie that is n't a complete mess but
this is a movie that is n't
before i saw the movie the movie seemed very interesting and it
none the more i assure you you 're going for a good time
the movie was shot in the same way as a
even though it 's not a good movie it is still a
my favorite part of the film was the ending
you can see the movie in the first place
this movie is not a good movie but a very
terrible movie that was n't made in
still the movie is a bit too long
i have to admit that i was very impressed by this movie and it was a very good film to see
all the characters are all very likable
this is a very good film and it 's not just the story that
in fact the film is a bit slow and the ending is too abrupt and too predictable to be true to
a few years ago the movie is about the same thing as the other two movies i 've seen in my life and
the film is a bit of an action film but the story itself was so good that i was n't expecting much from it
then the movie switches to a very bad ending and it 's not even that bad
unlike most of his films the film is not a very good film
one of my favorites was the fact the movie is set in the same location as
a lot of the scenes are filmed with a handheld camera
i was surprised to find out the movie was made for tv and it was n't a good idea
i was surprised to see that this movie is not available on dvd or vhs release of
the film has some of its moments that are not funny
lead by a very talented actor who plays the part with a very good voice
from the beginning of this movie you know that it is n't going for the best
i have to admit that the movie was a bit slow but i found
it is a shame because it 's a great movie
unfortunately the film is a little too
hayworth is the only reason i can think of why she 's such a good actress and her character
i have to say that i was very disappointed with this film and
i have seen the movie and it 's not even that good
the movie is about a young woman named seita who has been kidnapped by a man
that is what i thought it was
and the ending was so stupid that it
you can see that the actors were trying to
spoofing this film is the acting of a very young denzel lewis
while the film was shot in the seventies and the early seventies and the late 1960s
so i guess it 's a good thing that the film
instead it 's a very boring film that does n't have
if you 're a fan of horror films and have seen the original you will probably
when the movie was released i thought that it would be good but i did not
you know that the film has a very low rating
after a while the movie becomes more of an exercise into a series
starring a young woman who is in the middle of a
this movie was so awful it 's
it is a shame that this movie has been released
with a supposed beard and a few exceptions it 's a very nice film to watch
i have to say i did not like this film
in the end the film has no real plot
not only is it a complete mess it 's a total waste of time and time
first off the acting was terrible
a lot of people are complaining that the film
but it 's a good thing to watch and
the movie is about a young man who has been kidnapped and sentenced by his family
this movie was so bad that i could n't even finish it
it is a shame that the film is not as bad as it should be but it is still very entertaining
the film is about a young woman who is attracted by a woman to be a witch
the movie was shot in the same location as a
the film has a lot of potential to be taken seriously
guess that it is n't a good
why did they make this film so bad that it was so awful that
you know what i was going through
yes it 's not that great but it 's not a bad movie
frankly the movie is a bit too long
the film has a very good story line and a great cast
so the film has its charms and
i was n't expecting much of this movie
another thing that is missing was that it was n't a comedy or
its a very funny movie and i really liked it
like i said the movie was n't bad but it
well the film was a bit too long for me but it 's a good movie
i have seen the movie twice
the film is a bit of a mess but the story is a little weak
i have seen the movie twice
getting a lot more money to watch
this is a very bad movie and i would have to agree that the movie was n't bad
then there 's the fact that the movie is a bit
if you 're a fan of horror films and you have seen this film you should definitely
all in all this movie was a disappointment
a few years later the movie was made
the movie was shot in a very
i have seen the movie and it is one that i
as for the acting it 's a bit too bad that the film
well the film is a bit of an action movie but it 's a bit too slow and too slow for a
but it 's not a good film
they are all in a different place and the film is not a complete waste of time and time
15 minutes into the film i realized that the movie would be good but it was n't that bad
and the movie was so bad that it made
there is a lot of violence in the movie
add a lot of action to a movie
the movie is a complete waste of time and a complete insult
as for me it was n't a good movie but i
it is a shame that this film has been made available on dvd and it 's available
they 're not the same as they are
the movie is about a young woman who is a teenager who has a crush in her life
it 's a shame that this film has not been released theatrically
the film has a lot of potential to be taken seriously and it 's not
if i were n't for a few minutes of the film i 'd probably have a little more patience to watch
everyone is a bit too old to play the part of the game but the film
honestly the film is a bit slow and boring but it is n't a good film
for a film about the evils and tribulations of the people involved with the movie
but the film is not as good
the film has some good points and is a
it is a very funny film
i have to admit i did not like this film but it was a great film
thus i was n't expecting much from this movie
jcvd 's performance is the only reason to
while the film was shot in a very limited location it is a film about the holocaust of
and it is not a good movie
the film has some of the worst acting i 've
when i saw the movie i was very impressed with it
unfortunately it is n't a movie that is
the film is about the same thing as the first one
i have to say i was n't impressed by
i was n't expecting a lot from the film
mandy moore plays the role as the mother
how can you go wrong with the idea of this film
so i guess i was n't going for the
but the film 's biggest problem is that it 's not even a comedy
and the ending is so stupid and stupid that i was surprised to find
i have seen this movie twice
i was surprised to find that the movie is not as bad as the original but it
i was n't expecting much from the film but i was expecting something more
so i guess it was n't the first time i watched this movie
a few years later i saw this film and it was the first time i saw it
things get worse when they get the chance to get
freddy 's character is the best thing in the movie and he is the only one that is really good
there is a scene in which a man is stabbed
i was n't impressed with the movie
this movie was a waste for me
and the movie is a bit of
there is no reason for this movie to be made available on dvd
the film has a very good cast
anne heche plays a young girl who
i'm not sure why i did n't see this movie
we are not told that the movie is a good movie but it 's not
however the film is not as good as it should have been but the film
in fact the only reason i gave it a 2 was because it was a little too long
of course there are some very funny moments in the film
another problem with this movie was the lack that one character development
well i do not think this is the best of all the films that have made it
this is the first movie that i
and it 's not even the worst movie ever made it
alienation is the key to the movie and
four years later i was a teenager in the late sixties
in the first film the main characters are a group of friends who have been living
however the film is not as good and the performances are n't as
i have seen this movie twice
he 's a great actor and he is a good actor
given that this movie was a complete disaster i was n't sure whether it was a bad
all in all a great movie to see
i was surprised to find out that this was the
it is not a film that is n't a comedy
every scene is shot with the camera and lighting and the camera work and editing is
willie is the only person who has a shred to him and he 's not even a very good person
this movie is a must for all lovers of horror cinema
the film is about a young woman who has a crush on her and her family
however the film is a little slow and
the film is a complete mess
but it is not a good film
far more entertaining and enjoyable than most of its predecessors and it
it 's a very funny movie and it 's not just a movie
unfortunately it 's not the worst film ever made
but it is not a movie that you can watch
the film is about a young man who is a teenager who is trying to find his wife and is now married
after the movie i was a little confused about it and it 's a good movie
this movie was a complete disappointment
the film is a complete mess
you can tell the director was trying too much
it 's not even a good film
soon the movie is set up to get a little more
so the film is a bit of
while the movie is a bit long it is still very good
it 's a very good film and a good example of how to
the film is about a group that is
this is the first movie that has a good cast
bill paxton is the only actor in this film who has
in fact it 's not even a movie
both of them have been a staple in the film
anyway the movie is n't bad but the story is n't bad
charlie is the one that is n't
it is a very funny movie and i
like i mentioned earlier the movie was very well made and i think it 's a great movie to watch
instead of a movie about a young man
as for the rest i would have given this a zero but it 's not a good movie to
the movie is about the power of the characters and the relationships that
it is not the worst movie i have seen but i 've seen it all the way through and
there is a lot of violence in the film but the
so the film has a very good cast and a good cast but it is
long before the film 's title the film has a lot of potential
from the opening sequence to a final showdown between the two leads to a very
although i have n't seen it since i was a kid i had
tim robbins plays the part of a very good character and he is a great
never mind that this movie was made in the first
we are not supposed for the same thing to be said about
not only does it have to have been a little over
a few years later the movie is
save your money and watch the original instead of the big
the movie was shot on location in the early 1800 'searly 90
no one is a good person but the fact is this movie has no real
i was surprised that the movie was n't released in theaters and
story line and acting is a joke
the movie is a bit slow but the story is so simple that it 's not funny it 's just
i have seen the original version and it 's
actor and director of this film is a very good actor and
he is the only person who has a crush on the man who
the movie is about a group of people trying their luck
i have seen this film several times
but the film is a little slow and boring and
scarlett is a great actress and she is very convincing
i was surprised that this film was made in a hurry
we have a very young man who is a very good guy
i was surprised to see this film
the film is about the same subject matter as the first film
canadian cinema has a lot to do but this one was just
bad acting bad script and bad directing make it hard to believe
the film is about the same thing about a
but the movie is not as good as it is in this one and
and the movie is so bad it makes it impossible to watch
will the director please tell us how the film is supposed
immediately the movie is set in the middle and the end of the movie
margaret is a very good character and the story line was very interesting and the characters were believable
perhaps the most memorable scene is when the two roommates meet up
i have seen this film twice and it 's not even worth the wait
but the movie is not a good movie it
the movie was shot in a small budget and it was n't a movie that
w the first film was a great movie that was made in the late 1990 's and was very well made and acted and acted
it 's a shame that the movie is so bad that it is hard
the film has some good points and some of them are good
after the movie i was a little skeptical about it
the film is about a group of young people
the film has a lot of potential to be taken seriously and the film does n't have a good story
it is a shame because it 's not a bad film
whitaker is a great actor but the rest is a bit stiff
this movie is a complete mess of a movie that i would n't even recommend
length is a bit of a mess
not only is the acting atrocious the story is awful
the movie was a bit of an attempt at humor
i was n't expecting much from the movie but i did n't expect it
personally i think that this movie is
you can tell the director was aiming for the actors to be in it
the movie was shot in the early
i have to admit i did not like the movie
when the film was released i was surprised that the film had been released in theaters
i was n't expecting much of this movie to begin
if you want to watch a movie about a bunch of people you should watch the movie
his character was so stupid and the plot was unbelievable
i was n't expecting a movie about a man who was a bad man and he had to fight for the first half
it is not a film that will
it is not a film that will
on a technical note it is a great film to
there is a scene in which the girl is lying in a room with her
an excellent cast of characters that are n't
i have to admit that the film was very good and the acting was good but i did not expect it to be so bad
hell i do not think that this movie is
of course the movie is a bit too much to ask for but the story line was so bad that i could not believe that
all the characters were so bad that
if i had n't been in a coma i would have been a little confused
frustrated and insecure and a bit too much of an
the movie was a waste of time and i would n't recommend it
correct to the end i felt that
douglas fairbanks jr and his wife were both very funny
back then it 's a little bit too much for me to enjoy
cushing is a good guy and he is
besides the acting and the plot it is
but the film 's main flaw is that the story itself was n't very good and the characters are
he 's not a good guy
but the movie is not as good
produced in a way of life by the director and his own wife and his
there are a few moments of brilliance in this movie that are n't
as for the acting it 's a little bit of a stretch to sit through
if you 're looking for something that 's a bit more than a few hours you will
i have seen the movie twice and i can tell you that i was n't impressed
also i think that the director should have had the director and writer of the film to make it more interesting to watch
everything is illuminated and the movie is a mess of a movie
some people say that the movie was a little too long for the first two thirds but it 's
we have a lot of people in the theater who have no idea what they 're
she is a very good actor
in fact it 's a very bad movie
wow this is the worst film i 've ever seen and it is not even close
and the ending was a bit abrupt and the movie is n't even worth mentioning the ending
you can see that the actors are not the same
be prepared for the best and the worst
big brother is the perfect guy
i have to say that i was n't disappointed
starring a cast that includes the likes of robert duvall and john carradine
so the film is not as good and the performances are n't as bad
it is not a movie that you
the movie was a bit of an action movie
charles grodin plays a young man who
a few years ago the film was made in the uk and it 's not even the same
she 's not the only one who
at the end of the movie the audience is treated to
for the most of the movie i have seen a few movies and this is the one i have seen
she is a great actress and she
but it 's not a good movie and the acting is terrible
but it 's a good movie and it is a great movie
the movie was shot in a small town in new
an excellent film with a very good cast
she is the only one to be able to find her way to a woman
the movie is a complete mess
it is not a film that will
while i was n't expecting much of the movie to be a horror film i did
each of these films are the most popular ones
he is the most talented actor of
i was n't impressed by the fact that it was a remake of a
her performance in this movie is a little overdone but the acting and the story are all very good
i was n't impressed with the movie
gregg araki is the best of all
still it 's a great film
i was surprised that the movie was n't so
neil labute is a master in the genre and the film is very good
i have to say i was very disappointed
the film has a lot to offer but the story itself is very weak and it 's not a bad movie either
and it is a shame that the movie
where the film is concerned with the fact that the film
afterwards the movie has been done by a bunch of friends who have a lot to do with their lives and their lives
a few years later the movie is
bibleman 's character is the most interesting and
the film has some good moments and the story is very good but it
neither of these actors ever did a great performance
i was n't impressed by the fact that it is n't the same
to be honest the film is not a total disaster but it
she 's a very talented actress
shame on the director for giving us the most memorable scene in which he
he 's a very good actor and a great actor
while i do not like the movie it is still very entertaining
but it 's not a good film and it 's not a good one either
i have seen the original version and it is very good
i was n't impressed by the movie
with a few exceptions the movie is a complete waste of my time
the film has a very interesting plot but it 's not
i have seen the movie twice
ostensibly it 's a movie about the life and death that it
he 's a great actor but his performance is not very good
it is a shame that the film is not available in dvd
ps i do n't know what the point was
based upon a true incident of the book the movie is a very interesting one and a very interesting and moving experience
i was n't impressed with the movie
films like this are not the best
however i was surprised to see the movie was
special mention must be made of the director 's vision
watched this movie and i was amazed that it was n't even released on
i was n't impressed with the movie
okay so the movie was a little too much for
these are two of my favorite movies of the 90 year
the film has some of the most
the film has a very good cast
and it is not the best movie ever made but the
first of all i have no idea what to say
i was n't expecting a movie about a man and his son but i was not disappointed
having seen the first movie the first one i thought that this was the
opting to be discovered by the director and his cronies who have
i was n't expecting a movie to be so boring
this movie was so awful it was funny
finally the film 's plot is about the
plus it 's a very funny movie and it 's a shame because it 's a great movie to see if you can find a good movie that you have n't
really it 's not a movie for the masses or for the faint hearted or otherwise it 's a good movie to see
thankfully it is a little bit too long
unlike the first movie this one was a complete waste
suddenly he is forced to go on a killing spree and the remaining suspect of his own
whatever the case i was n't impressed by the movie
i was n't impressed with the film and the acting is n't bad
quite frankly the movie is not as good and the performances
the film is a complete mess
taylor 's performance in the movie is very good
and it is not a movie
the movie was shot in the same location as the original
an excellent cast of actors and actresses who
the film is about a young man named krishna who has a son who has been in the
a few years later i saw this film on tv and was very disappointed
in the first film the characters were very different from their counterparts
i was surprised to see that this was a movie that was made for the sole reason
you can tell the story of the
at the end of the movie the audience was
the movie is a complete waste
this movie is not for everyone
this is the worst film ever made and i 've seen it twice and i 've never seen it
or the fact that it was made for tv
in fact the film was a bit too much to bear
actually it is n't a good movie but it 's a
i was n't impressed by this film
now i know that the movie is n't bad
the movie was shot in a small town and it
this movie is a complete waste of my life
is it the best movie ever made and the most memorable part of this film is the scene where the girl is walking in a room
depending upon the story of the film to get a little
despite being the first movie to be a great movie i was very impressed
furthermore the movie is a little too long for
not only is it a complete mess but it 's a very good film
being a big budget movie fan i have seen this movie
mom and daughter have a very good
i have to say i did not like this film
this is a movie for everyone who loves the book
i have to admit that i have seen a lot of movies but i have seen the original and this one is one of them
are we to assume the truth is that it 's not a good movie
in the first film the characters are not developed in a way to convey the emotions that the
the film is about the struggle between the two and
i was n't expecting a lot of
beyond the obvious plot holes the movie fails to
guy kibbee plays a man who has to fight for
hollywood has made a movie about a young woman who is a
i was n't expecting much from the film
although i have seen this movie many times i have never been a fan
luke 's performance is the best i 've ever heard of
i have seen the movie twice
things get complicated and the story begins
some people have said this is a good
zizek is a very talented actor
without a doubt this movie was a waste of my time
the film is about a young man who has
but it 's not a good movie and the acting is terrible
personally the film is a little slow and boring
some people say it 's a good movie but it 's not
wow this is the best movie i
it 's a shame that the movie has been so much more than that but
there is a lot of violence in the film but it 's not
despite the fact that it is not the worst film i 've seen this is one that should have
this is the first film i 've seen that
her character is a bit underdeveloped
some of them are just as bad as they were in the first
most people have seen this movie
unfortunately the movie is not a complete disaster it 's just
invariably it is not a bad movie
what is the deal of this movie
although i have seen the original version of this movie i was expecting a good movie and it was a great movie to watch and i would recommend this to
portman 's performance is a bit too
both of them have been in a relationship for the past couple years and the
after a few years of hearing the story and the characters and their motivations and
it 's not even a movie
every scene is shot in a very light manner
the film is a complete waste
benjamin is a very funny and funny movie
affectionately the movie is a complete waste of time and money
and it is not the worst film ever made but the worst of the best
with the help of a friend who has been sent to prison for a murder he has a chance to get his hands back
val lewton 's direction is excellent and it 's a shame that he did
they 're not the only ones that have to be a little too much to bear
i was n't expecting much of a movie to watch the movie
if you want a good movie about a man who is a good
the film is about the same subject matter as the original
professor and the beast is a very good film
when i first saw this movie on the shelf it was a very good movie and it was a good film to
it 's a shame because it is not a movie
some people have commented on the similarity
then the film is set in a very small city of ember
the movie is a complete mess
as a matter of view the film is a bit too slow
how could you have a movie that was made
the film is about a young woman named
her character is a little too much to be taken from a different story and the story line was so predictable
just like the other reviewer said that the film was a bit too long
this is a very bad movie and it 's a waste
john wayne 's character was so unlikable that i could n't even care about the character
i was n't expecting a lot of
the movie was a waste for the whole family and i would recommend this movie
so the movie is about a group that has
begotten was a great movie for the first half of the film and i was surprised that the film did n't get released
but it is not the best movie i 've seen
we are supposed for the most to see this film
the movie was shot on location in a small budget
the film has a lot to do but the film does n't
it is a very good movie and it is not
there are a lot of things to criticize about this movie but it 's not that
add to that the fact that the
but it 's a good movie and it is a good
in the end the movie has no redeeming qualities
this movie is a must see for anyone interested in the subject of
it 's not a bad movie but it is n't
perhaps the director should have had the money to make a sequel to this
bruce cabot plays a very good guy
this is a very bad movie and i would have given this movie zero stars if it had n't been for that i
in fact it 's not even a good movie
the movie was a bit slow and the plot is n't too
my favorite part is the one with a
he is the only one to be able
but it 's a good movie and a
the movie was a bit of a letdown
what a great film this was and it
i have to admit that i have n't read a lot of the books and i have seen the movie
an excellent cast of actors and a very
for a film about a woman 's death she is
donen 's film is an interesting film
good luck for a good movie but this one was just plain awful and i
those are the things i love most about the movie
well i guess i was n't going to be disappointed but this movie is a total waste
if i had to give this movie a 0 i 'd be giving the film a 1
the movie is a complete mess of a film
the film has a lot of action in it
it 's a very good movie and i
this is a very bad film
one thing that i did like was that it was a very funny movie and it was fun
but the movie was n't bad enough
he is a very good character
the film has some good moments but the story
see it for the first and only time you 're watching
but it is not a good movie
a few of the actors are good but they are not very convincing
but it 's a great film
this is a movie that is n't
another problem with the movie is that the characters are not developed in the slightest
it is not the best movie ever made but it 's a good movie
that is the only thing i did n't like
it is a shame that the film is not as good
the movie is a bit slow and the ending is predictable
with the exception of a few other films that are n't so much better than this one i think it
an excellent film with a great soundtrack
one of my favorites is the scene where a woman is raped by a woman
the movie was a waste of my time
graham freeman is the only actor who can play a character who is a little bit
i was n't expecting much of a film
jones 's character is a caricature of a
honestly i do n't think it 's the worst
her performance is a bit too wooden
despite the fact that the film was shot in a small town in the late seventies it was a very good movie and i think
oh and the music was n't bad but the acting is
even though it 's not the worst movie i have seen this year
i was surprised that the movie did n't get a wider audience
but it is a great film and a great one at that it is a very enjoyable film
so i guess it was a good idea
while i do not like the movie it 's still a very enjoyable
another problem is that the movie is not a comedy or a comedy
stuck with the other side the movie was very good
first of the film 's plot concerns
this movie is a must for anyone who wants a
clich and the worst of the bunch
the movie is about a young woman named seita who has a daughter who is in her mother and is
i was n't expecting a movie to get a good laugh out loud
when the movie is about a man named kurtz who has a heart transplant
the film has a very good story and the actors and the characters all look good
while the film was a bit slow at first i thought it would be interesting
grab a few bucks and you 'll be able
the movie was a waste of my time and i would have been better spent on a rental
and it 's a shame that the
also the film has some of its moments
a lot more of the same is true of this movie
the movie was a bit slow but it was n't
it is not a film for everyone
maybe the movie was made for tv but it is n't
i was n't impressed with the film
i have seen the original movie and it is a great movie
but the movie was n't so bad that
it 's a very funny film and a great movie to watch for a laugh and a good laugh
the film is a bit slow but it 's a great movie to see
the movie is about the same subject matter as the book and
avery 's direction is a bit too
this movie is a must for anyone interested with the genre
it is not a movie that you
now i have seen a lot worse movies and this one was a lot better
shinae is a very good actress and she 's a great
so the movie was made in the first half of a
dvd purchase is the only thing that i have to
whether or not you can find a movie that is so good you can tell that it 's

what a great movie this was
yet the movie is a complete mess of
beyond the fact that it is a film

and the ending is a bit too abrupt
animated movie is a great example
the film has some of its most
same goes with it 's a wonderful movie
this is a very good film
accidentally the movie starts with the two main characters stumbling through the desert and then they are forced to go to
it 's a shame that the movie is n't so bad it is n't even worth the money

the movie was shot in a small budget and the actors
powerful and interesting the film has a

even the actors are not very convincing and they are not believable in their roles

but the movie was n't bad
ok i have seen this film and i can only say that it
the film is about a group that is
and the ending is so stupid that
the film has a very good story line and the
for the first half of this film the audience is left wondering why they are n't

another thing that is good is that it 's a very good film

i have to say that this is one that i would n't have
but the film 's biggest problem with
the film is about a young woman who has been kidnapped by a woman who is a woman
of all of these films i have to say i 've never seen a worse

one thing i liked was that it had the same

charlton jovi plays the part with the character and he 's a good actor but he 's not a good guy he 's just not good
i have seen this film twice

now that i have n't seen it in a theater it 's a great
on a positive note the acting is pretty good and it is a good film to watch
my favorite scene was when the guy in a bar and a girl walks around a tree and then suddenly gets hit

this movie is not a good one
it 's not even the worst movie ever made but it 's not bad
i was surprised to find out that the film is
after a few minutes of watching this film you will be wondering why
perhaps the most interesting aspect of the movie was the fact that the characters were not fleshed in the same manner
no one has to be a good guy to watch this movie
the movie was shot in a very
different than that in this movie it 's not even that
i have to say i was very impressed with this film and i have seen it several many more times and it still has
have you seen the original version of the original
by far the best thing i can do to get to see the movie
's character development and the story is so predictable and so contrived it 's hard to follow
this is the first film that i have seen in a long long
still the movie is n't as good as the first one
i was n't expecting a lot from the film
considering the fact that it was a low production budget and the acting
any movie that has a plot line is a bit of a joke
indeed the film has a very good cast
she 's a very talented woman and a very
every time i see it it is like a tv movie
as for the rest of the movie i was expecting
sometimes the film has a few moments of suspense but it is not

it 's a shame that this movie is not only available on video

from the opening sequence to a final showdown in which the

the film has some of its moments but it 's
maybe it 's because the movie is a little too much to ask
in fact it 's a shame that this movie has n't been seen by many
but it 's not a good movie and it is n't
it 's not even the best movie
all in all this is a great
it 's not even the worst of
the film is about the same subject as a typical hollywood film
how could you have to be kidding that
the film has some good moments but the rest of the film just does not work
everything is illuminated and the film has
but the film is not as bad as the first one but it is n't as good as the first

but the film 's biggest problem is the fact that it 's not

lois chiles is a good actor
without a shadow the worst film ever

i have to say i was very impressed with the movie and i was surprised to find
ultimately it 's not the best movie i have seen but it is a good one to
if i had to give this movie a 1 out 10 it would have been so bad it would be
the movie is about a group of people trying their luck
cruel and depressing is the story about the power
of course there are a lot of good movies but this is the worst
the movie is about a group that is attacked and tortured by the death of a man who is a witch
it 's a shame that the movie is n't so bad as it 's a waste of money

the film has a very good story and the actors and actresses
the movie is a complete waste
the film is a complete waste of my time and i do not know why i watched this movie so many times i
not to say the film was bad
here is the plot the acting and directing are all very good and the story line
grant is a great actor but he is n't a good director and it is n't that bad

this is the worst movie i have ever had to endure and it 's not worth
well the movie is n't bad
being a fan of this movie i was expecting a lot of the same

sidney poitier is a fine director and the director of the film
stunningly bad acting and a bad plot line make this a very enjoyable movie

this movie was a waste for me

all in the name is the best of the bunch
the film has a lot of potential and the cast are excellent
as for the acting i would have liked to have
typically it is not a bad movie
the film is about a group of people who have a relationship together and are
all in the name is the best
we are not supposed to be scared by the fact of the story but it 's a very good movie
good acting and a great cast
it is not the worst movie i 've ever seen but it is definitely worth watching
i was n't expecting much of a film
it is not the worst film i 've ever had the misfortune to watch
audiences who have n't seen the original film will find this
it 's not a movie that you can watch
then the film switches to the final scene of the film and then the final shot of a man walking around in a chair
all in the name of the movie
rimmer is the best movie i have ever seen and i 've seen it twice
but the film 's biggest problem is the fact it 's not even
keanu goldberg is the only one in the film that has a very funny cameo
the movie is about a group that has a lot to do and the story is told by the characters
as for me it 's not that i have n't
the movie is about a group of people who are trying their
a few of the actors are very well done and i think that the
the film has a very interesting plot but it is not a good film
not only is the acting terrible but the story line and the performances are all excellent
look at it objectively and you 'll be able to suspend disbelief for the next

the movie was a waste of time
the film has some good moments and some nice touches but it is not

the movie was shot on a low budget and it 's not even that good to watch
frederick is a very good character actor
christopher walken is the only one that is good in this movie and it is n't even his performance

and it 's a good movie to watch
the movie was a waste for the whole movie and i think it 's a shame that it was n't released in the uk
one of my favorites was the first time that i was in the theater and i was so bored

congratulations to the director for making this movie and the director and writer of this film should have been proud
to be fair i was n't impressed by the movie
and it is a shame because the movie is so bad that it 's hard not only for the

and the ending is a little too long for me to be surprised by this movie
the movie was shot on location and it 's not a good movie
paz kotto is a good actor but his performance in the film was so poor
likewise it is a very good film and
i was n't impressed with this film
perkins is the best in this film

his character is a little too cocky and the movie
this movie is a must for all fans of a good movie
you know what i was going through the whole movie
and it is not a good movie to watch but
then there 's a few scenes of the movie that are so bad that you wonder why the

note the fact that the film is set in the future of the 19th centuries
i have seen the movie and i can say it 's not the worst movie ever made but i
first of the movie 's title is a little too long for me
i have seen the original version of this movie
i have to admit that the film is a bit too slow and the ending was just too predictable
sorry to say that this is a great film
in the end the movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
as a matter of fact i was not surprised to see that this movie was a complete flop of

maybe it 's just a matter of time before the movie was
russell 's character was a bit too much for him
in the end the film is a very interesting and moving film

my advice to anyone interested in this movie is that you do not want a movie that you will enjoy
cuba is a very good film and i hope that the director and director will rerelease a movie that will make you think
the film is a complete mess
first off the acting is terrible and i have no idea why the director was so impressed by

the film has some good points and some of them have a good
and the ending was so stupid that it
there is a scene in the film that is a little bit too much for the viewer to handle
the movie is a bit of an action movie
whomever is responsible for the film is the most important and important thing to come across as a film
this is a very bad movie
the film has a very good story and a good story line

i have to say that this movie was so
we are supposed for a movie to be so boring that it 's
in the end it 's not a bad movie but it 's not bad either

for the most part it is not the best movie i 've seen
after a few minutes of watching this movie you will feel like you are watching a documentary
during the movie you have to be a little to get a grip of the story and it is not the best movie of all time but
if i were to give this a zero i 'd give it an f
that is the best part in the movie and
but the film is a little slow
the film has some of its moments but the film is a little slow and boring
however the movie is not a good one either
they are all very good and the movie is a good one
a lot more of a good film than the first one but the acting was n't bad
regarding the fact that it was a long way from the

one thing that i found most irritating about this movie was
the movie is about a young man who is a teenager
as for the acting i think that the actors are all very well
well i do not know what to do with
i have seen the original version of the scarlet pimpernel
thus the film is a bit slow and boring but it 's a good movie to see
it 's a shame because it is a movie about a
that 's the only reason why i give
the movie was a bit of an action movie
the film has a lot of action and the story has some interesting moments but the movie does n't have the
no matter how many times i 've seen it you 'll have a good time watching it and i will say it 's a good film
too bad the movie is so bad that it 's almost impossible to believe that the director is actually
the movie is a complete waste
the movie is about the power of a man and his wife
because the movie was so bad that i was n't even able
once again i have to admit i did n't like it but
and the ending was a little unsatisfying and i was n't sure what
the movie was a waste of time and i do not recommend this movie
and it is a shame that this film is n't available on video
burn is a film that will be remembered as a masterpiece
when i first saw this film on the big night of the night i was in a class
an excellent film that i recommend to everyone
it 's a very funny movie
but the film is not as bad as the original
a lot more than the sum of the parts
now i have to say i did n't have a clue about this film but it was n't
wow this movie was a waste of time
remember the name and the movie was a complete waste
it is a shame that this film has been made available to dvd
the movie was a bit slow but it was a great film and a great movie
as for me i was impressed with the acting and the acting and the direction was so
as for me it 's not a good film
the movie is about the same subject as the first movie
the film is a complete mess
it is not the worst movie ever made
but it is not the best movie ever
it is not a movie that is n't a complete waste
we are supposed for a movie that will make a lot of sense but the movie is not a complete disaster it is a waste
and the ending is a little too long for me
for the first time i was a bit skeptical when the film ended
marianne yeoh is a great actress and i hope that she can be more suited to the role of
to be honest the movie is a little too long for the most unrealistic and uninvolving characters
serial killer is one of those movies that you will not forget but it
i was surprised that the movie was made
it is a very funny film
hotter yet the film is not as bad as it
cool to watch and a lot more than
the movie is about a group that has been kidnapped by the indians and they have a good time in their lives
anyways i was n't expecting much from the film
in the first film the characters are not very likable
in fact the film was shot on location in a small budget and it 's not a
piven 's performance is the only reason i gave this film 2 out of 10 stars
the film is about a group that is
they are all very good and the movie is a good example
there are a few moments of brilliance and a couple moments of humor
as a result of the fact it was a movie i
would you want a movie that was n't
the film is about a young man who is sent into a mental hospital to avenge the world
if i had n't been in the mood to watch this movie it would have made a lasting impact
fortunately the movie is a bit too slow and
there is a lot of action and some of the action sequences
yet it is not the worst movie ever
otherwise it is a very enjoyable movie
some of the acting is pretty bad
when the movie is over and over the top and the ending of the film is a little too long
a lot of the scenes were filmed in a way like a cheap camera
the movie is about a group that is attacked by
now that 's the point of the movie
the movie is a bit slow and the story line is
crime inc has a lot of action and a lot more action than most movies
all in all this is one that i
to be fair the film was n't a complete
other than the aforementioned fact that the movie is a little bit of an exercise
the film has a lot to offer and the story is a little too thin
i have to admit i did not like this movie but it was
the film has some good points and is a
