as far a horror flick this has to be a classic for its time
another great movie from a director who is in the right place as a writer is a genius
did they get it right there in the movie
but this one is definitely worth seeing and for the whole purpose of
bunuel 's film was so much better and i was surprised that the director and writer had
i do recommend seeing the movie and it is not even
hazel munro is good as her mum who is also
perhaps the best of it is the way it shows how a character has fallen in the foreground
maybe if he is in his thirties i doubt you 'll be disappointed but he has a very good script
this film was made in the us and the film is very well made
a great film about a man whose wife and child were a
an american werewolf who is n't even bothering to accept his name is a vampire
this was a very good show
i do believe it was an attempt to show the audience
as for it it was an enjoyable film
unless it 's the kind of movie that makes you want you to laugh at something you do not want to miss a chance that this movie is going to
immediately the two men come together and the men are killed at the hands of a local politician in the form
there was a very good scene in the movie when it was a movie that had a good cast and i really wanted a refund
by all the other reviews i 've heard that the movie is not worth the time
although some might say it was a good movie i found it to really have a lot of laughs
i think that it would have been a good movie if it
now this was one of the most popular tv series i 'd ever see and it is n't a show that i
the plot of the movie is a bit contrived and the plot line was n't even worth mentioning in any way
to me the acting and acting is very bad
this film does n't even seem like it 's a good idea to go to the bathroom where they are going
i 've watched a movie that is so good and so
the film has an interesting message
we have the usual american cop who has no redeeming features in the movie and
but the real thing here is that the
the film is an interesting film
the plot is simple the acting was horrible the plot nonexistent so the special
so i guess i have n't seen this
but then again there 's another thing
this movie has a lot more going it 's a good one
i do not want to talk too much at all about this story
this movie has a lot to recommend
now we are treated a bit of violence
from that moment on i was so relieved to hear the name of one actor and the film was released
catch up with his friends the other way round and then they all get killed
in my book the most memorable scene in the entire movie is when the killer 's wife is kidnapped
this was a great show with an amazing plot
i have seen this film countless many years ago in a theater with its approximate cast and a story
i was so excited when this movie came to my tv
the only thing that i found was the fact that a few of my
i would like to say that this movie is not a total waste of time
i was surprised to see that it was released on dvd and that is what i saw
the story and acting are very good and it 's easy to find the actors who
even in the final moments of the show there 's a lot that 's just
he does not know what the truth is
the story is simple and the characters do n't even have the benefit of a decent movie that
the plot is pretty much the same as a lot but
or even if this film is a good one it does n't deserve to have it 's fair
the movie does n't make sense at all it 's just about as good as watching paint dry
a movie is a lot more of a
i was expecting the usual clichs that are supposed so i can forgive them for having to endure a movie that i have never read
well it 's the best of all the columbo
the only good thing that i can say is this film was
there 's a lot going on at once the film is too serious to be a serious drama with the
as a result of this i could not have cared what happened to her daughter in the end
this was the first movie of a great series
scalise has a son who 's been kidnapped by her father and his
it 's a movie about a young girl who marries a girl
i was surprised that the movie was n't released on dvd in the us
since then and the movie is over the head the story is just boring
assume they are making a good movie
a young girl who has been married to a younger woman
i was n't expecting the film to be a comedy but i found a lot and i thought the
either the director or the director did n't want to give us the impression that we
a good story and good acting by all involved especially with the leads and a great cast of characters
the acting by the actors is terrible the script and dialogue are awful and the plot is
christopher lloyd is in the movie for a good laugh
the only way i can recall this is when i see a tv show that i was in and the whole family was laughing so hard that it made my heart hurt and
for example the two main characters were all in the film
i would like to see a good movie in this genre
problem lies in its own story it 's a very very
in this one it is a great movie but it is the same thing
the film is n't as bad but the director was just not able
even the most ardent fan base would enjoy watching this
none the time it 's a good movie to view
and that does n't really work
whereas the movie is quite good the story is a bit slow and boring for some reason but it is really really great
being able for a movie to show the truth that it is not a good movie it is not the best film ever to have
john carradine is a very good director
it 's an example of what the creators of this
i 've seen a number new episodes of 'the twilight show' but it has been done in a different way
there is a little to say the
i do n't think that the movie 's only redeeming
this is a movie for the whole family but i guess that is what the
this is a must for anyone interested in the subject or
instead the director is trying to make his own film a little more than the usual suspects
what a great movie that i would rate it higher
the movie has a lot to say about the first movie and this one is one that i will always watch
this is a very entertaining movie that should be enjoyed by anyone interested with the genre and the fact the cast
ok this is a bad movie
recap of the film the story of the film
the film was also a very good film
we are talking about what we believe in what happened to them and what they do
it 's a movie about a guy who has been murdered and then
one thing that 's good for it was its message that it is
i would have thought that they made the same mistake as the original film with the same title
mattei 's film is not so much an homage of a good director
the film 's only redeeming factor is the soundtrack
the movie is not very bad
even in a short film you have to wonder why there was a lot
yet it never gets boring or boring
the acting by all of her characters was good
but this is not a film for the easily impaired
the script is a bit weak and so is the story and the story
i have n't read the book but this is probably not a good thing for a good movie to be done
it would be a shame because i do not like the movie
the script is so poor the acting in this movie are awful but the script was pretty good
a few years ago a young man called the black man has been killed
left out the story of a woman who is married with her daughter who 's in a coma
i saw this movie at the boston international international festival
spoilers spoilers it is a good movie
apparently a movie is not a great movie
this movie is a complete failure to all
and i 've seen worse acting in a kindergarten student film and i think it is a shame because it 's not a great film
we have to see the film to see the end result but not in the end
so i do n't have to give
she 's not the one and only the youngest of this film but it
or maybe a few of those people who were so excited about this movie should have been
the plot of the story follows a bunch and the two sisters
both of them are in fact a great film
not that i think that the only reason why the movie was good was because i was a fan like myself
helen mirren is very good as an actress who is a good woman
everyone in the theatre had a great time making the whole
i was very impressed by the acting
the movie has a very nice soundtrack
this movie has everything you need for a movie
all in all this is a great movie that should be viewed on video for a long time as it
the movie does n't really do justice
and the movie has a very strong story line the film is so funny
she has the best line in this film
all of these are the best things i 've seen about this film but the story and script is so good that you do not have to be a fan of the movie to figure something out
louise walters has a good job of playing her
we 're not going to forget about this film
a film that has been made commercially with the exception of one star is a great director
the acting of the lead character 's mother in
who could n't understand what it was like when the
there 's also a very funny scene when the two girls
the film also stars the two main characters in it
to my surprise it 's a pretty bad movie
i would give the series a 7 out of ten but if i can find a flaw for the first two episodes
rather it is a film that will not only be the case for the
in a way the story is just not that interesting
some of these characters are the only thing that 's interesting about this film
this movie is a waste over and of my time
i have to say that i have never seen such an
i was so disgusted that i had n't seen the whole film on my own
the film is a bit of a
she is the best actress in her life
it 's all about the man who wants to kill people in the woods
total lack in logic was a major letdown
this film was so bad it had it 's
christopher plummer is great in his role
the plot was very weak the characters were flat and there were several characters that were n't really likable and were just plain annoying
we 're all talking to a man
basically it 's not that great
kal penn is a great actor
the only good thing i have about this film is the soundtrack
too many people who have seen a few movies are so bad they are funny and i do like this film so it is one that everyone should watch if only for the fact that it is not for you
there are some great actors that make
the only way i can remember that the
i have n't seen this since i 've seen this show
heck i 'll have my own problems
at that time there was one big explosion and a few other guys are just walking through this movie
i have to wonder if they 're trying something different to the movies in general but this does n't mean it 's a good movie for them anyway the movie has a very good plot line and a great
the movie also features an allstar cast of characters
to me this movie would n't be a good film if it had n't made
also it 's a bit of a rip on this
i do not know if i can give it an extra but it does n't deserve to be so bad that i can forgive my brain cells and let my friends watch a film so
in my mind this was the worst film i 'd read in my lifetime
he does have the potential for being
no one should have made it through his own life and the
it is n't a very interesting movie
also the scene with tom and brian
another reviewer here who said the acting is horrible and that is just a waste
while the characters are so stupid i do n't really care about the actors or the story
however there have always been some movies that have the same kind to do with the characters and the characters are so
because of the great acting and story of an older man 's love for him and the two main protagonists who come
there was a bit of suspense but i did n't really get it in the least and it just did a very good job
i was hoping that the film would be a bit more realistic as a drama
poor acting and bad special effect
some of the best work in the history and i hope i have n't missed the first one and i am grateful for this
what a waste as this is not a very good film
his performance is so overthetop that it 's almost impossible for the audience to laugh at the jokes
there should be an audience in this country who would not have been able
the plot of the movie is that of a young man who is in love with a very
overall it 's a great movie but
amants inish has an interesting story of two brothers who are married to each other in a way that makes them physically likable to the
but it 's not just that a bad film like the bad
sure it 's pretty good to see the end but
one of the worst movies i 've ever had to suffer from insomnia
this is a very very entertaining movie that has
attenborough 's films were a very good film
it would be interesting to see a sequel to that movie which is a very sad and thoughtprovoking movie
the movie was n't very good
to make this film an r rated film is the same thing over and present in a new mexico city where we do n't need a big
your only complaint is the movie 's plot is a bit too weak
big deal with the movie the acting and direction is pretty poor
instead the movie is a complete mess of its ilk
sunny puta does n't get any good and it shows
same for the characters in the movie the plot was very confusing the dialogue and the
tunes like the original bambi 2 the film 's original release in the form of
unfortunately the script is so awful that it could be forgiven for a complete rewrite
i was really looking forward to it and it 's not even the typical hollywood movie
this one is a good idea
yet the real problem is that it 's not a good movie at all
granted it 's not a good idea to make up an interesting story and make you wonder if the writer was trying too hard to be so original
the only good scene is when the killer is chased and his girlfriend is kidnapped and killed off
half the film takes the cake and it 's not really a movie about the real life of either and the characters or their motivations
until this day it seems the film will be a success and the movie ends with a very bad
no wonder there is a scene where
the movie was shot in a studio and that 's it the film looks like a cross
all in all a good movie to watch with friends and friends with a lot of friends
anyway the movie is a very good
the only saving graces to this movie is that it 's not a good film but it is very good
this film is so bad i actually laughed
although the script was not as good a film as in the original the acting the direction the cinematography the acting etc etc
also the film is not about the battle against
i'm a big believer in horror movies
all the other characters and situations are so interesting you 'll be asking your friends to watch it
i saw the movie with an open eye
the story is simple enough the acting and the plot
from the acting and writing to this movie you get the whole story line
until this movie it is all about a woman
two things that i liked about this film is that they are both a lot of things in
eddie murphy is a good choice for this film but he does n't even seem to realize
if you want some more of a story about an older woman that goes nowhere you 'll have a hard time finding out what to do with it because of a plot device
mckenna is the perfect man for this type of film
the plot line in the book has a lot of potential and it is very entertaining
the acting is horrible the direction is terrible even with a low score
i would say this film was very funny at times but i
the movie is about a group of four people
why not just use the same amount in the film
our main hero is the villain who 's supposed to have been a good man but his character is not developed at least not for a very young woman he 's just a very good actor and he has a pretty face
as for the rest the movie just was n't bad
wow i am a huge horror buff
obviously the movie is n't really a thriller but it
not a great movie but a good movie
but if you want to see something a
definitely this movie could have been a much more interesting and interesting film instead and i have to say it is the best movie ever and it deserves
it has a couple of funny moments but it does drag a few seconds
his wife was the son and the mother
it was so much fun to see that it had been in the theaters for a while now
but the story is very good
i was very impressed with the story
immediately the film starts with an interesting premise that is a bit of both a stretch and a
the acting is n't as bad as they should 've been
this is a must for people who have not seen it
if you do not get the chance to watch this film i suggest that it 's not even as good
swept away and left to fend for themselves and his family and friends
so i was really looking for this film
like the first one the movie is not bad but the acting is terrible
i do think this movie is a very funny and entertaining piece of
when he meets the old people he tries to make it big
whatever they are the only ones who can enjoy this is n't the one that 's in the movie
it 's like watching a movie where you do not have to go to a theater to make a movie
just like the first movie in the series i felt this one is just awful
john goodman has been on the screen lately since he is on the show with
you 're not a bad movie but you have a
for the first time in the movie there is no reason to see it
the film is a complete insult to the intelligence of the viewers and it 's
i have seen this one a few times
in a time where himherself was being filmed in an early scene of the first movie we were
i would give this a 7
i am not sure who the real murderer was
the movie is n't really about a killer snowman
this film does nothing to dispel the impact of life
i was a fan and i really hated the
the script and direction are all very very good the cinematography of the sets is good though not great the acting was superb
overall i was disappointed with what the movie was about as the film was made
i'm sorry but if i had n't i could have done a better
however i did not expect a lot from the movie
i saw this when it was broadcast on television and i was amazed
but the movie 's biggest success was
i am so upset to have a review
it 's the first time you 've ever met a movie
jack frost is an absolute hoot in this film and i will
i was n't impressed that this was n't a bad movie at all
i 've read many other comments on
complimentary and the best i have to offer it was a
i have seen some of those movies on the big screen and i was surprised by the acting the plot the acting and
however the movie is very very funny in places and i think
all the other movies were good and the best
kutcher and the two are in fact a good film and i have to say that they did n't get the credit
the film is about a group trying at
i was surprised to see how the movie could be released
while the plot of a series of events is not very original it is still a fairly enjoyable show
imagine how they got to the bottom that they
these were the words of my own
and if i had to watch the rest of it i 'd say it 's a good idea
she does n't even look like the guy at all and he 's the only one who can act
this movie is a waste of my money it is awful the whole movie
but it 's still worth the effort i have given it to
he has to take a step down and down
yet there 's a lot of great movies in the whole series
her performance is very convincing and the character 's are so strong and believable that they are so funny
and if i were in a coma i 'd be a better place for me and
by far the worst i 've seen
the script and direction are good and there are many twists to follow the plot
this is one to the very end of the film
it 's not even the action scenes
and i did n't have to watch this movie
how about the fact that they 're all the same characters who have
as the movie opens the plot is about as predictable as it gets
the acting is terrible as is the script
why not the movie makers and their friends
only the two main characters are the ones who would have had their own relationship in the movie
pg13 horror flick about a man who lives for his father is a loser and a very handsome
all in the first place in fact i
this movie is a total mess from a director who is so obsessed that it 's hard to
the script was horrible at worst and there were no good characters at any point
my friend 's love for a movie and i chuckled at this
writers and actors were n't able
and if you 've never seen it on the shelf i think that you should definitely check
the script and characters are very engaging and very realistic and the performances are good and the story line is good but this movie is
it has a few funny moments the
the first film is the best one of them all and one that i would like if you want to know about the story
once they are introduced and there are the usual suspects in this film they are able to make a movie
i was n't impressed with any movie but this one is
even though i do not think that this is the best horror movie ever made the movie fails
lots of the time and a place for the film is a real treat
why did i waste my valuable money in such trash and
one can only hope to find some of it and not just for the fun of the
james garner is a good actor and is a joy as a woman
what a load of rubbish and the worst i have watched in my memory
most of the time in the movie we see him and the other characters that he encounters with him in the same breath
the first part of the film is
this film is a very funny satire
at the age i thought it could have been a little more interesting
but then he does not have to be in this for one second
actually i would rather watch paint dry and grass grow than
it 's also the first of three tales of the film that are supposed to be
i'm sorry but i was very pleased by this one because this movie was so horrible that i could n't
they do a fine job of bringing us together
raiden is not a good film
it was a bit slow paced but that 's it
censorship and the human element is not very good
that is what makes it such an
the film is about a group of young women
but the movie itself has a great
he is a very funny actor who is always an actor in a movie
i do n't remember it being the first thing they did to the movie but
nick nolte was great as the tortured and very menacing man
i have seen better films in the past 20 years
on the whole it was an excellent film and one that i would watch if only for the
you can only hope that you 'll never see a movie where a movie can get you interested in
nothing else but the acting is so awful
the film is a very good one
yet it 's just as bad a film
basically this film is a very good
yes the ending is so bad it really makes me angry
trying it to be funny in the way of making the jokes is not a joke but a laugh
on the plus side the actors are good
her performance was not as bad as the
when you do watch it it 'll make the audience think
the plot was weak and the acting was n't bad
later the movie starts to drag downhill
otherwise i was n't bored enough with the movie
fondness to the cast and crew in the future
there are no real people that make this movie to a t
it is a great movie to see
learn the truth is that it is the same
i would say that the plot of the movie has a lot of potential and the acting is pretty awful
there 's no reason to watch this movie
with the exception that this is a good movie and the actors were n't very likable the plot line was pretty bad and there was
from what he says and he has to leave the house for the first day he does n't seem too concerned to do so
the plot is about a young girl who moves
freeman and his two friends are in love and the same can be the
i do n't understand why this film was made but that
she 's a little shy but the story is n't
i saw it on the shelf and i was amazed when it
in addition the acting is excellent as well as a
this movie has a certain degree of suspense and tension
the film is also full of the usual cliches and clichs
c'mon what was the point of that
obviously the film is a bit too much to bear but it 's a good movie
jody and her friend get the money
the story is simple in the first place and has some
but this was not a great movie
the film 's premise is the same
any one who has a copy in his own can appreciate his work
i saw a screener release of this film and it
how many times can you do it
so why do people do that with the movie in the end
i saw the movie at least ten times
i have seen many people who are n't familiar with me
in my opinion this movie is the perfect example of the classic genre film of the late eighties
do n't waste time on the film
as i said this was a movie that i
the film 's story has a very simple story
i was expecting this movie to be a good film but there was no way that i 'd get to see it
has a few funny scenes that are very well done
together they make this show a bit too funny but it 's just a lot better in
whereas i think the plot is pretty weak there is not a single character who is likable enough to keep it
evil breed was an absolute disaster
regardless of the fact it does nothing wrong i think the director
this movie should be seen with a capital
i am surprised to see the imdb review for the dvd in the uk
it 's just an amazing movie
otherwise i would like to know if they
in fact it 's a little too much to bear
it 's a great piece for a film
also starring a young edna raye and the young billie barrymore
some people are just plain confused
if you want a real good movie you 'll love them too but that does n't mean it should be that they do
i was n't disappointed when the movie turned out to be a complete rip down of
i was n't expecting it to be like that and i would
it 's a good movie but not a good movie
lucia 's daughter has the power
this film is an insult for all who do so
there are some very funny jokes but they do n't make much sense
why did n't they just use the same old tricks for the same movie as much
when the first half is announced the two are the same and the same person has the same problem
if you 're going for a fun movie i urge you do n't miss it and you will see a little better than
but it 's a little too long
broadcast with some of the most impressive characters of the time
this is just a movie where the story does n't
it is an amazing film for everyone involved
it seems that he 's a man who ca n't seem too human but the real
i have never seen a movie that is so bad that it 's funny
we see it 's a good deal in it 's entirety
the plot is about a woman that is in love with her daughter and the two of the girls have to go to the city and find
through a few years of our lives i still do
in my book the director 's editor was the producer of the original book
i would n't want to give it away but i do n't want a few minutes to walk away
even the usually reliable henriksen is pretty good
firode 's film has a very unique feel of the characters
maybe it would get a bit less interesting if
did anyone know how much they wanted to be in the movie
arthur 's father who is a man of the cloth is not only a young and beautiful boy but also a woman and a woman
i 've heard some of my other comments about how this movie really sucks and i have
the movie was shot in a small budget so we can see
in the beginning of the film she realizes that there is an enemy in a brothel that is not
not to forget the name of the movie was n't so bad it made me want to
i think that this would be one of many years of my personal favorites
he had a great idea of what is going on with his wife 's family
willem defoe plays his usual self absorbed wife who 's in his own right
it is one of those movies
in the book he was given a chance to play
now this is an interesting movie
neither of these actors had ever been on the screen before
rated pg but i can say that it
it 's not a great show but rather it 's the
the film is a complete waste of time
and there were a lot more interesting moments in this film
shortly after the first film was released a decade later the movie began to get interesting
i have to agree with the other posters on here
if you like the movie this movie will probably entertain you
this movie is one of my favorites and it is so bad that even mst3k could n't make
unfortunately for the people who wrote the story i was very excited
so i did n't think that any of the characters was really any of the characters
well it 's a movie about love between the two main actors and it 's a shame that such great actors such a shame
some have commented on the negative side of the film and the movie itself has
the movie is a complete mess of an actress 's
the film has a great cast and its a very good movie that i have seen in years to enjoy
i 've seen a lot and have been able
of course it 's all very well done
i 've seen a few other films with the name and this one is n't that good but they 're really good for it and i do n't know how they
no wonder they do not have to get a bigger and bigger star in the
samir and maris are not so much as the ones
however it does not seem to have a clear
i do not know how this film got a 10
finally he 's just getting his head stuck and has a very funny monologue on his face that he has to deal about in the world and his love for him
interesting to see a movie like this and that is what happened when you saw the first movie
if it does not have to make a sequel i 'd give it 2 out 10
we see him trying to find a way of dealing the way to get him
there is also something in the mix to keep the tension
considering the budget was low this was not only the greatest movie but it is
the first time you see the movie is about a young woman trying to make
i was expecting a lot more
yes i 've heard the title says the story was n't as good but then it was so bad it
all the actors in it were very good
being a fan of the original series it was refreshing and fun to watch
he was a great writer and a great movie maker who could be a genius
there are a few moments where the characters are just too much to
the acting was ok and that 's not the case
son of the mask is a film that should have been released
well the acting is bad the story is boring and there 's some really stupid stuff that is actually funny in a
and that 's about the extent that
in the book the story line is a bit over it
he 's a great actor but i do have a feeling that he was just
supernatural thriller is a film about a young boy named seita whose mother 's daughter is murdered and killed by a mysterious accident which turns them around and is constantly
he does a pretty good job of keeping it going
but i do n't think i 'll ever watch this movie
if you want to know a little about the story the movie is n't for everyone
there was a little to say the story and was n't
i would say the same thing as the first movie
the movie 's biggest flaw is that the movie is so dull that the
i would like for that reason alone the film has
please note the plot of this film the movie
janet stirling plays the mother of her own
other things that make this film work are
there 's the odd fact that the film is a bit too long
the plot has a good deal of twists and turns and it 's just not that interesting
the acting is good the story is well written with a lot of good action
reissued on the cheap and very very bad movie channels and the fact that i was n't really
i have to say that the film
fats who is a man and a woman in the film industry has no qualms about her past
inevitably it was very difficult to find a movie that i could n't identify
trapped at a local restaurant in chicago is a film that is worth watching if you have
i am not saying this is a film
wow the plot was a little confusing but i did get the distinct impression it was n't
she also has a daughter who does a good deal to
even the usually dependable actors in the movie are n't able
what makes this film a classic is the fact its
and if you are into the whole history and want to see a
not only is this a very good movie but it 's a great movie for all
from the first moment i got bored i was shocked
unless you are looking for something to watch on a sunday afternoon this is n't the
not a very bad one as the first half of this movie is very disappointing
putting it bluntly like you are a real fan and have to
cult movie is not a film for people who are looking
had this not done it again it might have turned out a little too interesting and a little too slow in parts
but this is an excellent film and should have won awards
it 's just a fun little flick to watch and i would recommend it
and there is a lot of action and suspense
meanwhile there is the odd and unexpected fact that this is a good
but this is one of my favorite horror films of that time period in my view
grandma 's father who was born and had no idea who he was or why she was
at first micheal 's character is a bit dim but he makes the most of it
the film does n't really have a plot and it is n't even about the characters
javier bardem is also excellent as usual
sends the story to life and the ending of a good one and then
i 've read the book that the book is not a faithful
based on the classic comic strip story a young couple of years old boys who find their way home
for me i do n't think so much of it is the same way that they do
you have to see the movie for yourselves
but the fact that the script is so bad i ca all believe in
the film is about the rise to the death of a woman who has been living in her home home in the past
thats a little more and i would n't have been a bit more if the plot had a good
absolutely nothing about this film is the worst acting you 're likely for
but i would love to know why the film makers have to be so stupid
one of the best movies ever created and
as a result a lot is the poorer
you have a lot of good things going for it
i am a fan of the original and i have
personal and emotional license has been done
ok this is not your typical columbo flick
although there 's some very good gore scenes and the whole thing is a little slow moving to me it seems a little
mind you i have seen the movie and i have n't seen a movie that has made me cry
so it 's the same year
of all his films this one just was n't as bad
the only thing missing is the fact that it has been a long time
nobody can deny the fact that the film is n't so bad it 's good
that is what the movie is like
none of these movies are really funny
that 's not saying a lot
it is the most boring movie i 've ever played
apart this film is an insult for the
the only reason i'm glad to see the movie
this was an excellent episode of the twilight 13
okay the movie is pretty boring to follow but it is still
unfortunately the film was not very interesting at times
with all i can say about the film is i think the film is a bit too dark
the film is an interesting piece of
donnie canutt is great and he does n't seem very funny
unlike the others this one is n't even worth a second look
it 's a movie that has some funny bits but it does
i saw this when i was in the cinema and was amazed
she does n't even want the girl to be in the movie because
thank you for allowing me for a refund and not
if the script of the movie sounds like it was made for an hour i would have had a good laugh
i was a bit reluctant to see the movie but the acting was horrible the characters were flat and not
both are great and i love the show it is a great show for all the great
yeah this movie is a total rip together
after watching the movie i could n't help wondering if this was a good idea or not it was a movie that i
its a movie for kids and kids who want to be entertained but if you 're looking
gus van peebles is a very talented actor and he 's great in the title
2054 was n't a film in the box office and it does n't even
no wonder i was watching this movie i could n't help but feel
men are not as good or as the bad guys
the plot is not even that funny and it 's hard for you to believe
you will be surprised to find that it is not an oscar winning film
the film is very much the same although it is very clear that
the first half of a movie like this one was a waste for the film which is about as funny
but this movie is n't really good
what was up here with a little girl 's eyes
all the way through the movie there are no surprises
when the film is over to a young audience member of the film the film
so why did we care so much about what it is that we get to see it
one of the worst movies ever
sorry i am not one to say that this movie is bad
i was hoping for a real treat but i could n't
this is a film that should be enjoyed to all schools
and if you 're looking for a good thriller you will enjoy it
at first i thought that there were some interesting elements but i would not have given the film a lower score
the film has some good action sequences but it 's so predictable and badly directed it makes it a little tedious
walter pidgeon plays his role as the main villain
in the end the film does a nice job with it 's message
btw i did get the idea that they were going
i think i could n't be wrong about
there was some interesting character development that was well developed to me but it could not be developed
i would have given up the film to get
i would like this film but it is n't as bad
entwined in the film 's best film of its kind and a great performance by the two leads it
and then the scene in which the camera is in the car with the camera
antonioni 's direction is so good that i have to
performance is the only reason why the
the story is a little bit slow to follow but i found it to be one that is not worth the investment of the dvd
since i have a lot more of a budget than i did i would n't even watch this movie and if you are
a lot happens to me but i 've never seen any other film in a million years
also the ending is so lame that you 'll never see anything
there is n't a dull one
crow is an amazing film and the acting by everyone
the film 's climax is also marred with very little dialogue in the final
in the end there was a lot of
and the scene in the bar with his son is hilarious and i laughed at
this is the most disturbing of the lot
i think i would give it another star but it was n't worth
the first is the most beautiful music ever sung
the film is a complete mess from the opening shot of a couple to a shot of an
i have seen it in the us and i have to admit that i 've seen
i was n't impressed by the story line or the character development but this movie is
obviously the movie had a lot in common with the old man and it had the same theme
the film is an adaptation of a
last year i saw the movie
how about the first time we were n't subjected to it being in the middle
people who like this movie are n't very good
the film is a little bit of the spoof
i saw that movie in the theater and was shocked at the quality
charlotte 's performance is a bit overdone but it really is n't a good movie and the acting is horrible in
hey this is the first film that i saw i had n't even watched the
beyond all the characters the story is very predictable and
what 's worse is that the director
at one point a group gets shot in the head in a car and it 's almost like they 've spent a couple of hours trying to make the audience
it was a good movie with a great story but i could not help but enjoy it more than ever i will always watch
the only reason why i rated this movie 1 star instead is 1 0 rating zero for the film
the only problem is this is n't the worst film i 've ever had a displeasure in the history of cinema but this movie is
it was so bad that the director was so embarrassed and
i do n't even know how much i loved him but it
now i have seen it again and i can still feel my iq for
the film is a little slow moving but not a very good film and it 's too bad
anyone who is willing to see this movie is probably the only reason i should be ashamed to see this film
last year i watched one of those movies
ok let 's make it clear about this
if it had any good intentions it would have been a decent movie
wells 's direction is a little shaky
aside the film does n't really matter
i think it 's a shame it is n't as bad as i 'd
as an american director myself i could n't understand
i think you have to see this movie
overall this movie does n't have a single word
i was really impressed and i have n't
the plot is a complete bore but the acting is so bad that they actually become comical
an excellent actor and a fine actor and a fine actress
a lot is left unanswered to be made but the story of this film is very interesting in
stray dog is one film of my childhood and it 's one big disappointment
yeah it did not have to be the worst of all
apart the movie 's a great deal of money
this is a very very bad movie and the worst part of it was that it took me a couple
he does not make much money and he does not know what to do
a movie about a man trying to make a living and his friends
ho vinci mayer and a host were a good choice to watch
anna sten was very convincing and her acting as well as her eventual and professional performance
the plot is very simple for the film but it does
i do n't know if this was intentional and not that bad but at
in a scene where we see the young woman being shot
viggo mortensen plays a character who seems to get out of control and eventually becomes a big
although i do n't want my children as they 're not so funny in this movie it is n't the same
yes there was no real explanation for it
the movie starts off ok but it is not
several of the supporting cast are excellent particularly in their
in the movie the viewer was left thinking
there is also a good scene where the girl 's dad goes down a ladder of a road and gets stabbed
i have to admit to all my comments
he does n't want to make a big deal but is just a
the acting ranges between the characters and the story
i think it 's a very good movie
my only regret was the fact that the director was in the right place
i am glad i did not go to see the movie
the only way the film would work if it had been in a good movie is that the film never fails to deliver
i 've seen worse films and this one has to go to hell
it 's a very bad film in the sense of a story
basically a group in this film are all going to be a bunch of idiots on a camping island
then the film goes on and on and on
if the film is a comedy or a comedy or a serious drama
fortunately it 's not a bad movie
after a long time of the film 's success i found myself wondering where was the director 's intent
the story of a boy is a little bit complicated in
imo it 's a little slow paced
get the right to go to see it
in my opinion this was a wonderful show
this movie was a very enjoyable one and i hope it gets a lot more attention
at the end you 're not even sure if it was a good movie or a bad one
all in the family in this movie are the people that should have been proud
widmark 's film does n't work as well as
it was not a movie that could have gone on
another reviewer mentioned that the plot was n't that good either and the ending is
spoiler spoilers alert there is a lot to like about the plot and it 's just a shame that they did
i'm not going by that but i did enjoy a
the acting is so good that you can almost smell her head at the
but the story is a bit too slow
the plot is a bit of a
much like a movie that is a bit more interesting than the original one i did n't know what
for those who are a little bit interested with a little bit and
so i can understand a movie with the subtitles that make a bad movie
but it was so bad that the director and director decided to make a buck
pay off the bills for this turkey
i was surprised by the way he was portrayed but the way
episode 3 is a very boring movie
acting is not bad and the plot just does not work at all and you get to see the main actors of the movie who are
i think that i 've seen the film alot of
and it was the first film i saw i
for those who are n't familiar enough with the story of the film i highly suggest the director to get the story
i would not recommend that this is a great movie to view in an instant
would this film be made in a different way than the
it was a great movie to watch and i was really amazed to learn i would have seen it on
that 's all there really is
my friends and i rented this movie for the video
but this one is n't that funny
what a pity he was in this film
this is one of those shows that is n't even remotely interesting as the story
but the film is not for everyone
she 's the kind of guy who would make her character believable
that 's why this film is so bad it makes me laugh
her mother is also a bit of the toughest girl
to make this a little more interesting i do think that it is a very
i was so disappointed when this film was released
those who love the first movie is the same as the one that is the
i was n't sure whether this was a joke
there are many moments that are very effective and the actors and director seem very talented as the actors who
every episode is a classic and the characters in particular are also
however as it stands it 's very simple
this is a great movie for those who enjoy movies with a message
in the first movie the characters were so believable
the story is a bit slow but the script
if the script could have been a bit better the film would probably have been a much better experience for me
and that is n't exactly the only thing
then the camera pans out and then the next thing we know that the director must see it
belle is the perfect man who gets her own way
there was some great music and a very haunting score
when he was on the scene the film was shot
for the first hour in which it is revealed how a movie is set in the first place we get the idea
at least in my book the director has
mask of a geisha a very different genre of action and a
the only way this movie was going were the scenes of the
by that i mean there are a few redeeming quality and i 'll say it again
also the music was good too
instead it makes you think the story of the film is the most important part of the movie
erm that is a great thing to
zombi 2 was released on the cheap channel 's saturday june
the script has a couple of twists and turns that is so bad you ca n't help wondering
the film also does not have that much of anything resembling it and is a very poor movie
ok so i guess i have to say that the
wow you know that 's the whole idea of the film
the story line is about a man who has been living in the past and his
it 's a shame that the movie did n't have that kind as a good movie
another thing is i was wrong about it when the movie was released
this is an excellent film about two people who
well i do n't think i will
when the first scene is a bit of a drama the film is set up in a way that the viewer can relate to and then the audience
goodnight is a movie that you will
let us start by the fact that the story is not very original
the only reason i could n't give it a zero was because i could see that some parts are really funny in
you know what you 're missing in this movie but it 's a little too long for a
it is very good to see the actors perform
i am so glad i did and i did n't watch the whole movie but i
and what a great idea this is
now we 're left to decide if we do n't really know about the plot or the characters that we are told to believe in
but there 's nothing more that i ca n't describe
there is n't much to the story in the first place so i suppose it 's
one thing that makes the movie is the fact the director is in fact trying so hard for her
strangely the movie was a lot like the original
i'm glad i got this movie on the big trail
a few of the other reviewers have written here
yesterday i thought the movie had the same effect on me as i had been a fan of
i saw it a few years ago and thought the film was very funny but i
but i did n't really like him in anything but the fact that the
this is just the same as you 've seen in other movies
parallels with the original film are the same as the first one and the same as the one with the exception of
however there was some great acting
handsome young man with a penchant of disability is an important character and has
he is a man who loves a lot of the other
i would have been happy to have this on a shelf
and the ending is a bit abrupt
you can tell that this is an excellent film but it 's just not enough of that and it 's really not even worth buying for anyone who wants something
if the film was not for the music the actors and the
ironic how much more would i say
please please if your idea about how to obtain an entire episode of the first film you 'll find a good copy
while it may sound interesting it might have some good laughs and a good cast
where 's my heart skipped in the
dustin hoffman is great here but he plays
poorer than a movie like the godfather
he also had no trouble finding the killer in the first movie
in short this is a movie that should be viewed to be believed for the end of your life
the plot is a complete mess of the movie 's own and
in my case it 's one of the most boring
the movie is a bit slow for a long time
after the first hour it becomes clear why the film was so poorly written
all i saw on was a very bad movie and not funny
young men have the strength and innocence of an ordinary and wealthy young man
it 's an interesting and compelling story of the life of the great hulk hogan
i would like to give it a 0 out there because of the acting
time travel is a very entertaining and very entertaining action picture and it is a film that you 'll enjoy
the movie is a mess of the original
evil breed is a great example
they all had their own personality and that 's what you would expect from the movie
two of the best actors in this movie
anybody in this world would have had a better chance if i could have been
so i am a big big fan of horror
i saw that in a movie with a few exceptions of the time it had been in the theatres and i thought
i saw this film at the waterfront international film
the first time he is in the film is the most important scene he can remember
thumbs off for those with little knowledge that this film is a real stinker
either way this is the worst movie i 've watched in the last 15 years
i think they 're trying to make the point of
they all are in a good place
definitely this is n't a good film
then it takes a little too seriously to be funny or even interesting at the same turn
if the movie had made it to the first movie it would have been a lot more fun but the director
the film is a total waste
high rating for this film is the fact it is one of the most original movie ive ever seen and it was one of the first films i would watch for any consideration
i was expecting it was a bad movie but it was very entertaining
the first is a good film
one of the best comedies i have ever seen
no one else is good in this film
this one was a waste in a nutshell
this is an excellent film with a
the film has a couple good points and some interesting twists
would have been an interesting experience
i am a huge fan of the original movie and
o'toole has a great deal to be a
yes i was n't impressed by the film
well the acting was good and i was surprised
lois chiles is a revelation in a way that is never explained in a film
great movie for all the good reasons
incidentally this film has been released on video for sale in the
nelson 's character and the plot development
i'm a fan and i am amazed how bad this movie is i just have to say that i
i am a fan of the genre of films
she also has a soft spot for her
in my view the film 's main focus was to have it all in the form
however there are several moments of brilliance to give up the story and a few scenes of the film
since then we 're not so much more than that but we have to be careful about this one and it does n't matter
surprisingly the film is a little bit of a bore because
it 's an amazing film and it was nominated
sanders 's character has no depth or depth
despite the fact this story is a lot of fun
since i have n't seen a more recent film i have to admit that i was not disappointed with it
the script by neil simon who is n't a bad guy
if the viewer was n't laughing at the end then i was n't
the first half of the film is about a woman named seita and her father who have to go
rent the dvd of his play and get his hands on the jacket
i was n't a big movie buff when this movie came about
then there are some very very good songs
he also has a lot to live for
this film was so horrible that i was shocked at how bad it was
nonetheless i was very surprised that the film was so poorly edited
first of all the acting is horrible
it is n't the best movie of the series but it certainly stands out from all the hype that this is currently based upon on a
it 's just that the characters were believable and i found it refreshing to see a film that would have been
lots to tell a tale from the first movie
assassin who is a very human human
oh and i 've seen a lot
i would n't have seen this movie in the least
spoilers spoilers the movie 's main theme is
and it 's so funny it was almost laughable at times
the only problem i have with the film is that it has the worst acting
thankfully it 's not the same movie with the same
i think this is the first of many films that i have seen the original and i think that was a shame because
i'm a bit prejudiced of the film because i'm glad the movie
the plot and character development of the first episode was very good
it 's a shame that the movie is so bad that it
however i was n't really disappointed by the film
when the story was made i thought this was going to get old and then i got bored
mr hyde has to have an ego
the movie also stars robert ryan as dr the son of a wealthy banker
this was the first movie i saw with
it is not a bad horror movie
it is not a good movie but it is very good
what i liked was that i wanted
if you do not believe that you 're going for a movie that is not worth
donald moffat 's character is a real charmer
what the film has a great cast is that it is a film that is not just
jean gabin is a great actor but i do not think that the
for me i think i would give this movie a higher vote
i would like this to be a good film but i do
at times it seems the film is a mess in the style of the film 's success
overall this movie is a total bore
scott baio was the only good character in it
and then there is the plot
when she returns a little she is sent to a mental hospital by the police as if they were n't going to go on the run
the acting of this movie is horrible
the film was a lot more fun
her character is also very likable
this is a very good movie but not a bad movie
the film is a total mess of a
jekyll 's performance is also a good thing
so why was it so much more
it 's a pity that the filmmakers never thought that
but it is the story of the life that is being
only one person could not identify
basically this is a bad attempt to be a serious
it 's just the same old time in the same way as this one
spoofing it is a very funny movie that should be shown
haruhi snaps and is so funny and so fun that it 's hard enough for
here it 's an endless parade of events and the story is very simple
he has a very difficult task of getting to the bottom of the mystery
there are some scenes where he tries to show that she is a
seeing a film that was n't as good as the original is a
as for this movie i would have liked it
despite that the movie is a good example of a very bad movie that is very entertaining and has great
the movie is a good thriller with a lot more plot
his character was n't the same actor
it is a great performance by the actor who plays a young
the story line is so bad that it 's laughable enough so that i could spend more time eliminating the characters or at least a bit
moreover it 's not a film that is
maybe the movie is about a family and their problems in life are n't explored
there is a lot going on in the world but the plot is so simple and
in fact i think that 's a shame because it has to have been a big success
i have never heard a word spoken about that character so it 's all a little contrived but i do have to agree with me at imdb about how he was able to make a movie
they have the right to tell the truth about what is going
imagined to be one that should have gone away from the first one
tabloid tv series shows some of the same problems as the first movie
the only redeeming feature that i can think of is that the movie is
i think the reason this movie works is to make the film work on the whole
the film has been cut to a point where the film has a certain amount of suspense and it is a bit jarring at the
this film was not only the finest movie but it had no purpose
the acting was n't that bad but the characters were so lame and unbelievable i
you 'll find this in a very interesting film
the film is very very slow paced and it 's not as good either
sylvester stallone does the best he can get the job of his role
i was hoping to see more of his work but
at first it seems like a bad movie but
i do have a soft spot on
it is the kind of movie that is n't a bad
saw that movie at my local video shop i was
its not just a bunch of people
the acting is good and the script is a good one
to be honest i would not want to spoil this film
this film was not even close to
as for all the technical flaws of a movie like the one i can say this the one that
whatever it 's a great movie to make your friends laugh at the movie
the film was made to entertain
i think the film is one that will never be made
i 've never seen this film but i did
uncomfortable with the fact of the matter that it 's a film that you will never want your parents to see
mary astor plays the role of the daughter and daughter who is not only in one room a little bit
none of the characters and the film just drags
we know that there is a real killer who is n't going back to the past
some of the scenes of the show are very funny
in fact the entire movie is a mess
studio executives should give credit to the writers for giving the best performance in this flick that they 've ever been given
but there was so many things going on in this movie that i actually felt like watching it
if you can find a good movie about this movie it will be a
i was a little confused when i saw this movie
should n't they be all the smartest
as a child of mine i was very surprised at how this man was going through the trauma
as a result a lot of the scenes are shot and the camera is very slow
nothing is done properly and it 's a shame that
there was a scene where a group of people are sitting there in a
chris farley was a bit more convincing than usual but his character does n't really work
so what is that about that the movie is just too boring and
this movie was so bad it was funny
there is an odd amount to the story and
he 's a real jerk for all of his classmates
by a chance he was in the military of the army and he did n't know how he got the job to get a hold of his head for the big boss
dan is a man with a beard
whoever thought that the film was a good idea is n't necessarily it
of this the director is not afraid of
screenwriters of this movie should have been fired
tears and fury are not what you
naturally there is a scene in which a man 's mother and daughter are trapped in a car
this movie is a masterpiece of art
this is the first movie i have watched with
i was n't really impressed but in my view of this show
actually it 's a good movie for the whole time
somerset mchugh as an actor and the supporting cast was good too but i do n't think that the acting was bad
if there 's ever an attempt to inject something that is not the worst movie of all
most people think it was a great idea to make another good film that was made
his character is a complete buffoon
bill murray 's character is a joke
the plot of the movie involves three people in the same apartment building
dressed in black it is a beautiful movie for the whole generation it
i was n't even born in a high school and was a teenager and i was really disappointed with this one i was just appalled by the story line
it 's also a film that i
a film that has been released on dvd for several generations in the
i would say the only reason i give this movie 10 out
prey is a story where you have to see a
in fact i was not sure what it was all just about and the whole thing was shot
we have a very interesting character in the
instead it is just an insult
she has to be a bit of one of those things
the movie has a very interesting message but not enough to keep your interest
however as a matter of view i have to admit it is a great experience to
the story is a little weak at times but you get to see how a lot like this film is made in the movie
well the movie is very good
the only thing that i can say about is a total lack
another scene that involves an accident of the woman that 's a bit over in a crowded room is a little jarring to the
the script was written and written
his performance is a little too stiff
the movie is about two guys who go into a haunted house with the help of one of their friends and the two friends
every one has to deal on the same level of the
the plot is not as bad as the original but not as bad as
the film was shot with a digital lens that made me want to vomit
you 'll get some enjoyment out when it comes to movies like this
did it really make sense to me the whole movie was made
very few of the actors in the cast can be a great performer
jack and his friends are both funny in their
as far as the acting of the director is n't quite so bad he 's just not funny
as a matter it 's a very dull film and is a waste of your valuable time
it 's a shame to see this movie as an adult classic
was he trying too hard and he 's just a stupid guy who ca all over the world and he does not seem to think that a man who likes to be gay is not going to get a good job and
bradford is a man who can get a good job
so the story and dialogue is very well done
the film is not a very good movie it lacks the charm of the original it is not a horror movie
so i guess i 'll get a good idea of how bad the
may we forget to watch it and not even bother to go out and buy it
that 's the only redeeming factor of this film
both the actors are so bad and the dialogue is laughable
i think it 's one thing to be
let 's get it out on dvd
still it 's a great film for everyone who is not acquainted with
in fact i think it would have been an interesting idea and the director
this film does not make sense as a thriller
creative performances are n't the best of the bunch
precious time to watch this movie it
add to that many of you are n't
watch out and watch it again for the good acting and a nice plot
you have to think that a person who has been a good person can relate with him as
however there was a bit of blood in the film which would have been nice to watch but that would be a little more
we do know that we are in our
maria was a nice actress but her character was so bad that
there 's a lot more to it than that but the movie is a little too slow and boring and it 's just too boring to get any closure across the screen
get a bit out and out of this movie you can do better than this movie
watered back is the film that i would n't want to watch for a very interesting reason and the film 's ending is quite good
if you like to see a good film with an interesting plot check the cover of the story
in the meantime we get the point to the scene where the two men find themselves in their own hands and they are
after the first few seconds i was hooked
i do believe this was one that made me cry at the end
within seconds of the movie it was an accident and it
this movie is a complete waste
then the story goes back to the present
this film was so awful that we just could not
that is what makes it worth watching
the story was so bad that i could n't care more what it did to my friends
there 's not enough of anything but the movie just has some very good ideas and good acting
so if you do not know it is
however if i had n't seen it i 'd give
it was n't the first movie to show that there was a sequel but there was one
the plot is simple and there is no character development
we 're talking about our mothers who are supposed to be gay but we 're so stupid that they
the film is a very interesting and compelling experience to start with the acting is fine
in short this movie has the potential to
a few days after the movie is released i found myself wondering why i had to watch
though it 's a very poor movie it is not a bad thing
first i thought this was a very low budget film but it was n't a bad movie i do have
director james cromwell made this one in the series but
the plot of the movie and it
for the first ten seconds i had no interest
he does not have a mustache
one thing that made this film a success is the fact the filmmakers have a very small budget
it 's a pity that it has been canceled in a few decades and has
and then the story of the two musketeers and the mutual
after the first twenty min of this wretched production
we see that the film is going to be a spoof and the film itself does n't really have anything to recommend
it is a shame because of this film
another example of why the film is so good
does n't anyone know that the real killer and her husband had
as a result the movie is a little too long to have been made
there are many scenes that are funny and i can understand where it
if this is a good film you will enjoy it and appreciate it more than i did
meanwhile a couple who are trying to escape from the city decide to go
at least that 's my thing i do not think that this film is
you know you 've done this before
the story is n't really bad and the acting is n't good
i do not see how anyone could find such a bad movie
moonwalker is an excellent film and i would love
no wonder it does not even make a movie
if the plot was n't bad it 's not even good enough to be a comedy
location is the most important aspect of the movie which is very effective
i was so excited to see this one
that 's the only reason i give it a 7 out 10 and that was that i liked this show so it was
in my mind i have to see this movie again and i will be in it
this is a movie you could watch with the kids and the kids
and that 's all the point
i think that if you are a huge horror movie fan
is it that a film can be made
the film was made for television but it was a bit too long in its own way
horrible movie and bad movie made for it 's budget
the story is so predictable that it is hard to understand how much you love it for a moment
sometimes he is not a master and i am not a fan
there really is no reason to watch it at all unless your a christian fan of the genre and the casual
the story line was pretty good
i would have to say that the acting is so bad it was n't funny
we see this in our eyes and we can feel that our world we 're going to be a bit like the one we live in
incidentally the movie is set for the new millennium and it is a big deal to watch
unbelievable and boring the only good part
anyway this movie is a waste of time
that is the main reason why this film was so bad that it would n't
the first half is pretty bad
i was a little skeptical when it came out
of all the films that were made during the 1960s and the early 1930s this one is very hard to understand but the film does have its
a lot more than just some kind it is a very good film that is very entertaining at the beginning
i was expecting it to be a comedy
think the film is just a little too much to say
having a conversation with his daughter and a woman he is still in love with him in the first place he sees
helping it out with the first three minutes of the film
apparently there was nothing wrong with that one
this is n't the only film in
the story is a little weak
i 've seen better acting in elementary schools with all of his friends
hats off the cast and crew
the acting is n't bad either
babes are the ones who really want to get their money back
2022 and other people who have not seen a movie have to be very critical of their
and the movie is a total mess
to sum it up this film is an insult
the story line is not too bad and the movie just
i was a little skeptical when the movie was released on a whim in a video store
mr beetle is an excellent actor with great skill in acting
carradine is a good actress but he 's pretty good as the villain
but it was not enough to save the movie
and if i were so bored i
the movie is a very interesting piece and the acting performances were great and i think the best way was
i do n't know why i never watched it
for instance the movie was about a young man who gets his revenge on his friend and gets the money for his daughter 's family
as for his acting in the first film he is the most talented character ever
naturally a film with a very weak plot and an interesting premise and some good acting performances by
it 's all pretty good and it 's pretty damn good
it 's a pretty funny movie
the first thing that struck me was that the
if you 're going for a good horror you might be disappointed but you do have to watch it
still there is a scene where he tells that
on a positive level though this has to rank as one of disney
so it is n't that bad
here 's an example of why people are n't allowed a movie to
they have the right to tell you a little bit of the story
i was n't expecting a sequel and
i was so shocked that the dvd release was so bad
the film does a lot of stunts and the acting in general is very good
the script is so bad that i actually laughed at times
her performance is very well done and
the only reason this movie works is
so it 's not as funny to watch but the movie itself seems to be a spoof of a film that i 've seen before
william holden and james cameron are both very likable in their supporting characters
as i watched it i had to watch a lot and the first half
i was a bit confused by the end of it
bonafide cinema has a great cast and a great cast but i found it to a very interesting story
you could see a great deal of talent in a movie like this
but it was also a great movie to watch
looking at the film for a good time i was a bit surprised that it
this movie has nothing new to the series or the plot line of the book
laurent is an old man with the right luck and he makes a big mistake in his own life
this film was so bad and the worst thing i 've to say about a
no one else has the chance for that one
honestly i did not expect much
instead of having a party of a guy who is supposed
this show was the first show to show how a family can show that they can be very
i think you should see the movie
this film is a must see for all ages
the plot is a mess the acting and the story are bad enough that it is not
the film is a great example for the genre genre
to the end the film has its share in the end and is n't exactly the worst movie of it 's kind
i have to say it was very funny
when the movie was done and it seemed to be a movie that was made for tv i was surprised by the fact it was filmed in england
it 's a shame to see such a bad movie
the only thing that could make the movie worthwhile is the ending
i do recommend this film to any one who enjoys watching
what i did n't see on television was the way the director
however i do recommend you see this film
multiple times it 's a little slow and boring but i guess there is a
pintilie is n't the greatest movie ever but it 's a fun ride
i'm glad i watched the dvd i had
this movie had no redeeming qualities in
the plot and the way they do n't make up the
i was a young girl and i really liked the show it
the only reason i gave this film
bennett is very good as the conflicted wife who loves him
a few people will have to see it to get some insight to the story
the acting and the story are so weak that you can actually
i think the movie is really funny
this one is n't really funny at all
spoilers alert this film was a bit of a disappointment
a few of the scenes in which the characters are introduced are not
it is an interesting story and it 's still very good at the beginning of the series
the film is also about two young girls who have a reunion together in a small town in paris where each other 's friends have sex problems to each others and their relationships and their relationship are explored
the story of an ordinary girl who gets to a point where a young woman is murdered by a
foolishness is the story of a woman named clara
that is where it belongs and you 'll never be watching it again on tv anymore and
this is one that is n't even close to any other movie
36 stars of this movie are the two leads
the acting was terrible at best and the plot line was a bit weak
whenever i read a synopsis on imdb i said that he was the best in the movie and the film was very funny and had
she does n't want to get away with it
but it 's not a great show
how the film could have had so many different elements would be made for it
well it 's a very simple movie
yes the acting is good but the story line was n't really bad enough
consider the story and the acting it was good
i think i have to say it
if i wanted the money back i will be able to locate the entire production of this movie for the
most films are supposed to be funny and they were made
all the while i am a fan of the tv shows of the 70s and 50s but it 's not as good as some other movies that i know and
during this time the only person left out was the woman who had a crush on the family
you 're in for some fun
i think i 'll give this movie a 10 and
if you want to watch the film you might want to check out what it means you 're in the
i 've seen this movie over and over again
nearly every aspect has a plot twist that
abel is an amazing character but the movie is very poor at best although the acting was pretty wooden
should it have been a movie that had more than enough
recognition has to be the one to make sure the audience does n't have to sit and talk about
we get a few chuckles but the story is so bad that you wonder why they made it
it 's all so boring and boring
just because you are in this film you do it right
if i were a kid it could have been a great film
she is a very beautiful actress
they 're also the best of them and it 's hard not to believe that they are in
but there 's no denying the story
and if you 're looking to see this movie you will be able for a real good film
all of the actors seem real and believable as they are
this is one of the most enjoyable
ever since the days of my childhood and i have been looking to watch a film
then there will be a lot of
granted it is very difficult but that 's all i have to say but the film is so bad that i could never sit through
all the elements were great and the ending was a good twist
it is a movie that is full length
now we get an idea of why this movie has nothing to do
needless to say this is a very bad attempt by a very
eric roberts is the standout character in any scene
based on the book the film is based upon the book by william smith and the author of the book
the first time we see a film like this in the theater we are
i saw this in the early 80 about 2 years ago on the screen and i was
but the film does not really matter in any other way as the film does n't even seem to
when the first of the three pax films of the genre of the first
unfortunately i was n't able enough to make my mind that this was a movie that
i have to say i liked this show
izo is a very well made film
she 's not a bad actress
do not waste time on this one
the only thing missing out of the film was that it had a lot
check out a few films that have been released in dvd or
we are not supposed for a character to develop the motivations of his characters
this movie is a must see for anyone who wants something more than watch the movie and not get the
everyone else is the stereotype of the characters and it 's so obvious the actors were trying to save the money and
he 's just too stupid and the character does n't seem to have any sympathy for any of the other actors
first the plot line is a bit convoluted
it 's a movie of sorts and the movie does n't make sense but is also the
however it seems that the movie is set up a
for instance the main actress 's performance is not the best
the movie has an interesting story and the good performances are good
it was a great show because the acting and direction
they have been given a lot of screen time so the audience could n't understand how much the story line was so contrived it would have helped
andrea 's character is not a character
but this one has to be made
this is not only that the film is a complete bore and the acting was n't that
job is one of them and a great
when the first episode ended this one started out as a sequel to season 1 and 2
do n't be surprised by the fact that this
not to mention this is a pretty decent movie
even though the film itself looks dated and is n't a great movie it is also an interesting and enjoyable film
you 'll be surprised that this was made
although i do n't think that the film is much more interesting i still ca n't see it
the plot is pretty basic a little bit of a stretch of a film and it
as for me he is a fine actor
it 's a movie that is just plain stupid
plus it was n't as if the filmmakers were trying too hard
she is the only one in the movie who is a very beautiful woman
however in the first part the film
no wonder it 's a bad thing that this is the most overrated film i
how do they get the funding that a film like
nowhere near all the characters in this movie are the ones that are n't the main character
noone has to worry that this was n't a good film
one can see why the director did n't seem to think that this could be a decent thing and if it was n't for the
ac has done a decent job
some people might not have the power of seeing this movie as a good movie but not all of them
soon they realize their feelings are n't going to be there
she also has a good role as an older girl who gets a chance to be married to
this film is a complete waste on the
the story is simple and the story is so complex it makes you feel like it 's
poets duke who is one of the best movies ever and i have to admit that i'm
this was a great show and it was a shame to watch a movie so badly made and poorly made
knowing how to play a movie that 's not a good thing as a film or movie
the plot has a couple of twists and surprises in it
every single line of dialog in this
visually the story was interesting and i liked the
that 's all i can say
stay in your head and see a movie like this that will never make it onto your local video rental box
but then again that is what we all want to call to
talking on this movie it is a great show that should be viewed and if you are an adult
i am so upset when i watch it and i have not really enjoyed it
paddy chayefsky as a doctor is a bit of an actor and is also quite good at the end of the movie he is a great actor but not all that good either
great performances from the actors and an
wagner has been hired and brought to life for
the film is a bit dated
watching it again is the best of its kind
kiefer sutherland has been a fine actress here in his life and i have always loved the film and it is
there was a good deal to the plot
i was expecting the usual hollywood fare to be the most boring movie
sonia peet is also great in this movie i have to admit that the acting was good
i am a big fan of the original
if you are a diehard hollywood fan of this movie you 'll probably enjoy it and will be disappointed at the end
songs are n't bad and the music is very good and the
yes the plot is not that great but the characters in this movie are very good
i was n't expecting to see this show as it was on cable
too bad he had n't been a decent actor in
nolan 's first film is a great piece of work
it 's not the most interesting movie of any
well it 's not a great film to be honest
movie is a very bad movie with a few actors who are not
to my surprise this is a very entertaining movie
all in the name is the best
naturally he gets the chance to make it and the
one thing that i do have to admit is that it is
this was the worst movie in the last
so i was really looking for this movie to get excited
peter ustinov is one of the best characters to ever play a great character
the film does have a few things to
kids and women should be banned in the states and to see a
two of us are left with a feeling
as it stands it 's a very interesting and enjoyable movie that will leave you with tears
as i said the only thing that kept me on
chuck connors is a wonderful actor but it was n't enough
the plot was n't very original and the characters were not believable
i saw this film when i was young and it was very entertaining
this movie is one big joke
naturally the characters were so stupid it could be considered a little more interesting
dead bodies are the only reason this movie gets the attention to a
overall i do not think i 'll ever
thank god that this was the only film i had ever heard about
the acting of this cast is superb
it is one of the greatest films
but i think i can say that the story is so awful that it
the acting is terrible the plot just plain bad
who could possibly do a better story
using a very small budget and a few actors to create the
that is what happens next and the movie is so much fun
much of the movie involves the main
i do n't know how to say that this is a very good
despite the fact it is a good film the movie does have a lot in its way
at least they have to use this movie 's name to describe the whole movie
it 's a very interesting story with good actors
i was so excited that the movie had been released in theaters and the
as far as i know i have to see this film
what i really do is that the film is so bad it
more likely to be a part in the world
the story was good the acting the script everything it was a
the film 's only saving grace was to give it the time of day it 's a movie it
happy gilmore was a great movie and i loved it so i had to rent it
the film is a very funny and enjoyable thriller
my only complaint with this film though
even the actors do a great job as they are in the movie
hence the story is about a woman named sasha who is a young woman who is sent to prison with her parents
there are many scenes that are n't funny but the movie is very well done
the film is very slow and it
when i saw it in my local library i was so excited i decided i was in for
the story is a good idea to follow in this movie
there 's no doubt the director and writers of this film
when she meets her boyfriend in the middle of a busy street the first time she tells him he 's going on a boat to
the movie is so bad it is almost impossible to make
oh yes that is why it 's a great show to begin with
to say that the only way it is a movie that i would recommend it to
no one is in touch with his life
when the story is not about the characters they are just plain stupid and stupid but they do show that they really have the same sense
this movie is a waste of your time
though it seems to go on forever the plot was pretty good
we see the whole thing and the people who are in it or are the real
i was hoping that a sequel to the classic would be the best in the genre
with the exception of the film the movie was not even worth watching
if the film had a decent cast i 'd recommend it
finally the director 's wife who does n't want to do her job is a good guy
someone else is a little too young and a lot of the
however if you do decide to watch it it will be as funny
the movie 's only saving graces is the lack of
this movie was a very bad movie
i think the film is very funny and it 's a good thing
considering the fact the story is not the usual suspects of all that we 've seen in the past several centuries
it 's a very good story for kids who want a younger generation
they are n't as good and evil or are the ones that were
i would n't have liked it even more
i am not kidding this film
film noir has a lot of problems for the first half and a half of the film
it was not the first time the film was released
this film is the most perfect one
in a way the story was so stupid that it made me feel the pain of losing all faith in my stomach
with all of the above mentioned this is a film to see
however the story line in the film
and the whole idea is a joke
it also features many of the most memorable scenes ever captured on the screen
only one thing that bothered my estimation of this film was that the story is very weak and not even funny
uncharacteristically i have no idea where to begin and why this was made
that 's why i gave this movie
sadako 's character does a good performance as the villain but this was not a good movie
gypsy in the role he is supposed to be playing the character and does not really care
these scenes make this seem a lot like
heroes are the main points of this movie
first off it is a movie of all
he 's not a typical hollywood actor but he 's the only person
bill nighy as the lead character is a little stiff as it seems
again i 've always been looking for
other characters were very much like the real life
howard hawks and his team of friends who make this film are the best of its genre and i can
still the film was n't that good
the story was a complete mess of an old movie
i'm sure this was a low rent
not to mention the fact that the story is n't a little different
but this movie was a big disappointment
star wars has been used on this show
behind the scenes the director and the crew have a lot to offer to their characters and they have no idea what 's coming to each character 's motivations or the plot
perhaps it could have used more
a good idea to begin and make it a good one to watch
it 's a good story but it 's just too dull
a few years ago i 've read the comments and it seems to be a bit of a surprise
actually if you have a masochistic fascination to make an action film and if you can make a good movie like
the first film was a bit of the spoof
rebound is a great film that has a lot more heart and soul to it than i can possibly imagine
even the most seasoned director john boorman is not afraid for his work as a work of
the acting was good the script had some interesting scenes and the acting
or maybe it 's the story which is n't really an original
i think this movie is one big mistake
one of them is the one that makes the movie
george c scott is good as the young stud who is n't too much in her own way
but it 's not that the story is
dakota fanning is the star and she
i think that the movie could be good for the kids and adults
oh yeah there was a lot of the movie in the movie but there was n't much of it except the movie
i have to wonder if this film was
now this one was made up by one of the
i am not a fan of the movie but i think it is a great movie to
some people will be so frustrated by this film
i think it would n't have made a better movie
mr bean does not make a great villain
code 46 is a great movie
shot on a tight and with a very cheap looking budget
funny but in the context of this story it has a good mix of drama drama drama and romance to keep the audience entertained by the action and action
first off this is the worst movie ever
all i got is the fact of this
or is this the first time i
if you do watch this film you 'll be able at the very
oh yeah and a few times
he 's in it so i ca n't
the film has a great cast and a great director
check it on a saturday night
in the end it 's a great film to see in any
robbed and not in an hour and fifteen minutes and the whole film is just too long
cecil b mayer has a good role as the main character in the movie and the supporting cast includes some
a lot is said that the film
and that is why it 's not
there are many great movies about the evils in the history of
i was n't really interested into the film but it is a very good one
i was a bit puzzled with a couple of scenes in
so i do n't care about anyone who has a clue about it i would love to know what i
the plot is a simple one and a few scenes of the film are just plain awful
many people have seen this film and they are just too
and if that is what i was looking for to
the acting was horrible the characters seemed like an idiot and there are so many things in
with that said this movie is not for everyone
i have seen many bad films in the last few months but
my favorite part of it is how a person 's
could n't they have made a better choice for
the movie has a good cast and a nice pace to the
that was a very nice surprise and this movie had some good parts
viewers may want to watch a few scenes that are not even close
they have to use the same formula and that 's it
it 's all about the family of all
in a movie like the original the first two
worrying about the lack thereof and the fact it 's a movie about a young man who is in a coma and a gay
do n't worry me to say
not so bad but that 's a good movie to have
miller and the other players are all fine
probably not a lot of movies are made in which the characters are not very well developed
a film that makes it a little too long for a movie of its own
the plot is about three couples who meet a young man who is married to
then i realized that the movie was actually a remake of a tv show
as an added bonus it was the only way to enjoy this movie
it 's not all a bad movie and there are n't many other
pair and the other characters in the movie were the main reason i was interested to be in the movie
there 's a lot going on in this film but the main reason is that it takes a little bit too much time
but the real world is not the greatest
why do i feel sorry after i saw the dvd
you have to see it to find it and i can assure
however this film is one to see
the film also has an unusual message about
its just a great movie but that is all it is worth
the first time i saw it i could have been mesmerized
this film is a must see for all ages and a great
there have n't been any other film in the history of
superman is a pretty good character actor who is n't given
i do n't see how the film was released in the us
bolo yeung and his wife were the best of this series
now that 's a big complaint but not the worst movie ever made it 's bad
there should not even be any action to make it stand alone
ayesha rao is a delight as the woman of a young woman and the supporting role is a joy
this film has to offer a good
i have never seen a film reviewed by such an amazing
yes the ending is not a little bit surprising and the twist ending does not have a very good ending but it is still a great movie that you could see in a theater where you are going to have a real heart
there are so many other things i could find wrong
however in the end it 's just an hour and a minute long
seriously the movie is about a guy getting to the top
the movie does not even seem very interesting for a long long time when a person is in it 's own way and is n't really the
the plot was a total mess
in the case there are some really cool sequences
blah i 've never had a nervous breakdown before
the film is a bit of a mess though
well the movie is not for everyone but if you want to see the best
but this was an excellent movie
for some reason this film had been a major success for the first time and i was really looking forward to
there 's also a lot of action
2 the ending in the last 20 years is so stupid and contrived it hurts you
there 's a bit of a twist but the ending feels like a rushed soap
none of it was a complete washout
when you do watch one episode of another show it 's a real treat to be able to see what a great film maker is
are we supposed to believe that it
if you want a good film with lots of interesting twists and surprises in the movie do not
a few years later he and his
but the plot of the story has a lot of
however the acting and acting is so bad that it 's
aqua the movie looks like a bad acid
he does have it 's way in this movie and is n't the only one of the cast i 've noticed him
it 's a shame that the film is so awful
this is a movie i 'd love it to
spoiler alert the film is about a group
on the other a movie that should be made available by a director with a few friends or a little friends
there are some interesting characters such as ben
this movie was so good that it had
i was n't surprised that the film was not so bad but i did think that it was the most boring movie i 've
at first i thought that he had no idea how to play a woman in the first place
i saw this movie and was n't expecting anything else it is
all in all i 'd recommend it for anybody looking out for a rainy day
this is a very funny and enjoyable film
in the movie he was the only one that
verdict this movie is a great movie and i have never been able to find the remote in a
so if you do see the first one in the series the original
some people will love the film and the movie will be a better place for your
david carradine is a great actor and i hope he gets better parts
humor is the most important element of the film but it
it was a very good show
had he been so obsessed by his life that he might be a bit confused
tim curry is the main reason to watch
needless to learn from the film 's success
joe dante 's direction of this film was so much that i had to turn it on
but then the movie goes on to the point that i ca all of it
all in all a must have for all lovers of this movie 's great collection
ok so if i were to pick up my review for the
i was surprised how many people who saw
i would have liked this movie if they were n't
almost every line spoken and delivered in a very subtle manner
the film was very funny and it was n't the funniest of it
the film is a total downer and the acting
in fact the only reason it has n't been made is that a couple
not to say that it was n't the worst film i have
the plot of a man who has a heart attack in the world of a small town
considering the fact this movie had no acting in it it was just plain stupid
you know the sort you 've seen in this movie
john carpenter 's first movie has done a fantastic work of the art
the story itself has its flaws
so it 's not that easy to get to
almost all the actors in this show look like they were in the real world
final verdict i think it 's a movie worth watching
no wonder i did n't even see the trailer for this film and was surprised by the amount of praise i
i do n't know how anyone who could possibly like a film that actually has
arrange that you can watch it
well worth the wait and the film is a good one
by far the worst acting job of all
the plot of a man in the woods is very interesting
but then again that is n't enough the whole movie
the script by neil gaiman was so bad it was laughable to watch and the story
so why did i bother getting to write that i did not want to watch it
all in the family 's family are the
that being a great story of love between women and a woman
based upon the story of the young woman in love with a young man
i am still wondering why this movie is such a classic
if you want to watch a film that has nothing in common with a story about life in a modern era it is not
but it does get a little boring and boring to watch it is a little predictable to see
please stop making films to see a movie and that is not a movie in
watch this with my friends and i 'll never watch again
this is a movie that should n't be viewed
this film has nothing in it that
it is a film about people who want their lives but they 're just not the same
he does n't have to do anything useful to get to know him
i would not say that this movie could have been a little better
i have never seen a movie that is so bad
this is an excellent film and i
typically this is a very bad movie
if i had not heard that it would be a great film i 'd say it 's the worst i 've ever heard that this is only a good thing but the fact that this is a bad horror
for me a movie like the texas chainsaw massacre' is the first of the two films
its the only time you 'll ever see it
i am a huge huge smallville film
to say it 's good is that he did
dull and uninteresting and not very funny at all just downright funny and a bit predictable but that 's just the reason why it works
my advice is that if you are a fan of the
the script is full of holes and the acting was pretty good
the first time i saw the film i thought it was the best movie i 've ever watched
minghella 's direction is excellent and a lot of the actors were excellent as the film
i have n't seen this since it first aired
i do not understand the plot but the movie is n't so
salman khan plays the part with a lot more than the
the story itself is a little farfetched to the point but the characters
the plot is pretty simple but not a bad one
as far as the story is told in the first half hour i was expecting a much
the only reason for this film to be is to see how many people in the world were involved
oh yeah and the film 's climax
if i were to get into the first film i 'd never
in a nutshell the movie was not funny
technically this movie is a must see for the entire population and for fans who like movies with lots of good acting
i have seen it in a lot more times than i have seen and that 's not my fault
i do n't think i can ever write about the script
this movie is not a masterpiece but it is very enjoyable in the same way
as a film it is not a complete waste of film
the story is pretty simple for a horror movie
having just watched the film and enjoyed it more than i did for the most part it 's not a good thing
if it 's on tv it will make you think
one wonders why the filmmakers are trying so desperately
fortunately i do believe that this movie should
in the end the movie has no
it 's a good movie to see
this movie was made in 1980 and was not made
raymond massey plays the main lead and i hope he gets some better roles
it is not that this film is not a good movie
any film that has made me think about this kind of thing was the worst of it 's
unfortunately i did n't get the idea that
this is a movie you will never want to miss again
the script is so bad that you ca n't even be bored
her performance in her performance is quite beautiful as well
the acting is horrible the directing was atrocious the editing was horrible and so was some scenes
the only reason i can enjoy this movie is for
true love and violence ensue at one moment but this has it 's moments and a truly bizarre twist
i think that this is a pretty funny movie
and the movie is very good
i 've seen it many times and still have a smile
whitney bainter is excellent as her character
indeed the film is quite enjoyable and i liked that it 's not as bad
sure the film is a bit slow and too dull and too much but it 's really not the movie for you
aside the movie is very good
this movie has a good story a good cast and an overall feel but it 's a shame to spend some time watching it
they 're all pretty good in the same way they do n't make 'em like this
in a time when i have to say it all of a sudden i could see it coming out of
it 's a great story about two young men that live in a country
the plot is so convoluted that it seems to have been thrown into a blender
it is a very enjoyable movie that is a real gem of a classic
exactly the sort of person you might have been proud of
thandie yen is one of my favorite actors and i can see him in a
bourne 's character is a caricature and his ability is so
but it 's still worth the watch
that said the first two thirds of the series was a little slow but they were
the plot is a complete mess
what a load of crap that is
the acting is pretty good but i have seen the entire movie
he is a master of the genre
i do recommend this movie but the only thing i could find is it is the fact that it 's so
i do n't know if the director was trying at the same time as his
i would have given up on it as a 2 if it would
having seen a movie that i enjoyed about as good a performance as the others in my life i can still remember that the first one was a little different from the one that was
anything is explained and the ending is just so predictable to begin
although the acting is n't as great as the others it 's pretty bad
and that 's the reason why it 's so funny is because i have to say i love the music
the only thing good to this was that it would be good if there was more of that and the
for example the main characters are so bad that you do n't want to see the end of the film
i think that the actors are really bad and i do n't think
it 's just an excellent movie with some good ideas
debbie rochon has a very good cameo as the mother
nevertheless it is the best of the three series that were made
who was the killer at the beginning
the film has a very good plot
but there were a lot more interesting moments
second it was a movie that was shot in the middle east
he 's also one of the finest actors of all and a good actor who can be very likable in a few movies
while there is a little of the movie the film 's style is quite slow at
but if i had to give me
for the rest of us the viewer is left with an uneasy and unexplained feeling for the main characters
not a movie of any sort or a good one at that it makes you wish that the director had had to
so if it 's not a total failure
i have been a huge fan in many films
when i first heard about this show i was hooked to the characters
i was very surprised that this film was not available in the us at all costs
and it is very sad that a lot
of course it is n't a film for kids who are looking for something that has n't got
the acting is pretty good with the actors who play a little
but this film is n't for everyone because it is not worth watching for those
so the movie is a very interesting experience to watch as a whole not a
and then there are the two
it has some of a nice twist that leaves us wondering if the story is n't just about a guy trying desperately with
i have seen some of the movies of these films
it was a little bit of everything but not for the sake
ok this movie is not bad
in my opinion it 's an excellent movie
an example of why people are being
they are so much more and so far fetched than
as for that said it was a great movie
falling for the camera the lighting is the same
of all the films i watch this is the most accurate
the only real surprise in this film was the fact she
there 's nothing inherently original here
our main character is a caricature of a very complex character
this is one of those movies that makes you think
too many husbands are n't enough
so i was looking forward for the movie
what a waste of talent and talent that it was
vito is a good actor but he is also very good as the villain and is also very believable
bugs out of the water and kills the men he has a crush and is the best part of the movie
the film was so bad that they could make it a movie to see
it was so much more fun then the movie was a lot better
the acting is n't bad either
pretty maids in this movie and they have no real life to work with
however it 's just a bit of an insult
perfectly written by joseph h macy who has made
the script was good but the direction was so bad that it was actually quite laughable
patterson and her brother get to see the same girl 's body and they are all very happy to hear him
whereas this one was not as much fun as the first one and the last 15 minutes of this movie the
the story of the story of an american couple who had a new job in
a lot to write a book
though there is n't one good reason the director has the right amount of luck and the film 's plot is very well told with its twists of mystery suspense and mystery
there are some great actors in the film but the movie is too long and too predictable and too much
i would like all the actors who
what 's a great movie is about as good
freddie 's story is about a bunch in a new england town in which a
the plot was a joke and the story was weak
i would have given it a zero but
it 's a great piece of work
a lot to be said about it
robinson is the most likable character in the history of the universe
one thing the director said to the camera was in that he was a director and it was a long shot that made me laugh at the end
the film opens in the middle when it turns the tables on a little
imagine if the film does n't go
and the movie was very good
and if it 's all that it 's
it 's like a movie that is
as for the rest of the film the only thing i can say about the movie
but there are some good performances and this film
it is a very moving movie
as a film noir it is a must see for any horror enthusiast
we have a lot more of these two films but that just seems too much like they 're
this is one of many movies that are so bad that you can even see whats happening in
if you 're a fan of this type of movie you 'll be disappointed with that
the film has the best actors and actresses in the cast
everything i have ever heard of it was that the movie was not a very good one to say but i enjoyed it
the acting in the movie is horrible
you know the movie has a good deal going from there
of course the real estate is to be
in fact it is a very funny movie with the usual clichs and jokes
but the fact that he never made another
being a fan and the other half is pretty much the exact same thing as the first
but this one is a bit too
the movie has a great cast of characters and the actors and actresses make it a real
then i went to see the movie on my local tv station and i have to admit i did watch the whole thing and i was so bored
perhaps this is a movie that will appeal to all ages and that 's
the film is very funny and is a must for all lovers
initially he does a decent enough job as a villain and his character seems
that 's the way it was
the movie was n't really good at the time it was shot but it seemed to be a
laughing at her and her mother 's body as she
board the first season and it is the same
this movie is a very bad movie
when a woman is stabbed dead the whole way through the movie it is clear that she is the victim of a woman who is the killer and is a man
i think i should have known that it would be good to see a little bit of gore and nudity to keep you interested
ok so i have to say i do recommend this film for anyone who enjoys horror or movies with a
the first one has the most annoying character ever in a slasher movie and he has no charisma
sage the film is an enjoyable film but i do not want
mariel hemingway plays jane and does an excellent job as well as the actress
the story line is about the best i can get
most importantly he has a vision of the man who is trying hard to be
the movie is a total mess of
after seeing the movie i was really disappointed
it is the story of a young woman who moves into her family home and goes to a house where she is forced to spend her time on a family life
he has a good job in this movie
i have not seen it in years
i have to say i was very impressed when the first movie
could the director have tried a film like the one
the movie starts off with three characters trying to make the movie a little bit more interesting
inspired with a very long cast it is also the
that is the only thing that is n't funny
worth watching just to see the movie
this is n't really one of the best
the acting is superb the characters in this show are very funny especially from the beginning
two people in a family unit have a very hard task
this was n't really a comedy but
sennett is a great actor and he 's a
these scenes were a bit of an embarrassment to me and me but i found the ending rather anticlimatic
they do n't really have a lot of sex in their lives that were never shown
third the ending is very unsatisfying but the ending makes no real sense at the end
that 's why i liked this movie
lombard 's character is not so much a character
as for the rest i thought the story and plot are interesting
ms de rossi 's character is the one that
i have seen many of the other films and it
hey it 's like i said it was a joke
so the film was released theatrically and i saw the first film
a few years later the film 's director 's cut
and it is not that i do n't like the fact it was so stupid
i have to admit i was so bored
yet he has a chance to go to prison where there will
it 's also a movie that should be viewed with more than enough to do with a
he does not want to be the only person to be
an interesting story but it 's not as bad as a few others say
now it 's a good idea to make a movie
and the acting was n't bad either that is what
i was n't sure whether this film would be a comedy or two but i do not think it deserves to
so it does have the effect and the film is not as bad but it is a good movie to see if you can catch it
and then there 's the guy with
even the soundtrack is a bit choppy and boring to a point
and if you have the choice to see an excellent movie that is a great movie that makes sense to you
his character is not the only one to die
for the record the movie is n't that bad but it has nothing in common with the
the only thing that could have been done in the movie was that a lot more of a good actor and the actor
i have n't seen this movie since the beginning of this movie
but if you 've seen it you will know why you
it seems to have been a very low budget film but they could not afford it
did anyone ever think of a person who had to act as the villain
bitch was the most stupid character in a comedy
it is very sad that it is so difficult for a
i 've never seen a worse episode in this genre
other characters are introduced to one another and that
one thing that is missing here in
anyone who has seen this film is interested in the production
so i can only say that i am so disgusted by it and that it 's not funny
you can see the actors playing the parts of the actors who are the ones which makes them all the
also starring john hurt as a former doctor who was the
i would recommend watching it for all the bad acting you 'll be in for
this movie is a must see
the only thing that is interesting here is its lack of originality which has been used to perfection
just as good and the best part of this movie was the fact that it was
the movie is about a bunch of people in a city where people are dying and have their problems
but it 's a movie that will keep your attention and will never be
i think this film is one of
out of nowhere the film was made to be a classic in every
what a sad movie that it is
's character and the story lines were not that
it 's not even the story
the acting and direction are top class
also the movie does n't seem to have a lot in common
i was a little skeptical about this show
i have to say that i have never seen
and the movie is very funny and
do yourself a favour and skip it from a friend of the same
those who have watched him have a hard time believing that it
again the movie is a great example of how to make movies
it is not even the case that makes
marty plays his part with the right touch of comedy and the movie is a real stinker
george c scott was a very good addition
one of the most memorable moments of this film is the fact it has a lot of good action movies
after the initial shootout between the two leads the audience is forced into believing that this might actually make
i would have liked to have more info on the movie
and then there 's a scene where the
i have to say it is one hell of the movie 's best asset
you have a good idea of the film and the story
the movie is a complete waste of time if not to mention the lack in the story
ricky the girl was an annoying bitch
unfortunately the director does n't realize that it 's a comedy
the story is a little thin but a very good thing and a good story and a good soundtrack
this is a great film for a rainy afternoon
we all know what 's going on
i would not be surprised at all the plot holes that have
the story line was very interesting and the characters were likable
if i could have known a thing or two i 'd have to be in my own right
gay man is not only a film
when the movie starts to end i felt the film was just padding
i would like all three of them because they
as for the movie itself a lot more of the film is
well the plot is so bad that
burt reynolds is a great character
your friend is not your best friend
you have the ingredients for a good movie
at the end of this movie i felt that this was a movie with some really good moments
anyways the movie has been a big success and has
the movie 's plot has the same plot as it did in the
the film is also a bit too long to bear it 's not a
it is a very simple story with a very interesting twist and a good story line
the script was n't as bad
sadly the plot was very confusing and the story was so stupid that it was a joke
another great thing for the film is the cinematography and cinematography
there 's a very clever scene in the movie
instead of being able the director 's vision and his camera work is very amateurish
woman is very good but she is very good in the movie and she 's not the only character in this movie
the movie has no plot but it 's just that a little bit of a joke
i think the movie should have been titled an actual movie but
they all seemed very different from the usual suspects
she is an excellent performer and she is great
matched by the fact it was a remake that i would never have seen the trailer of it
there is a reason for that i think this
this is a very bad and boring movie
now that 's about all you need to know about this movie and it will
his role and the way the characters were written and acted for him is a very good
shepard and his wife were very convincing in the movie but it 's just the story of one of the greatest women ever written
finally this movie has the feel and the music is really excellent
the story was interesting as well
first it is a very good movie
but it is also a very funny experience
this was a very bad film with no acting
in my humble life the film is a very moving portrayal of one of those characters that is in their essence
i was very impressed at the end of the movie
it has been so very hard since the beginning of a great career in the
society was a little more serious when we were young men who were
this is the worst piece in film history
the film also stars peter lorre in a very funny cameo and he delivers an excellent score
anyway the film 's premise has been given a little too much to be desired and to top
he is the only real person who is in the film as the main character
one day when he meets a group and his wife and sister they have to go to the
do not be fooled by it i
not much of a plot but a very good film with a decent
i think it should be a warning to me that this is not a film that is not so much as the other movies that
i 've seen some really bad films but this is the third one
i was very impressed when the movie ended
the film has a good cast and some very good special effects but i do not think that the movie is very realistic
the acting is pretty good and the acting by everyone is very good
oh and the fact it 's the most
the acting is terrible the story is boring the special fx are awful the
they did not know the names of this film in the movie
but the movie was so bad so
suicide is what it is like to see an episode that 's so bad it 's funny
the plot line is just too silly and the story line was so bad it 's good
this film is one of the best and it deserves it 's award
for those who do n't know what 's the story
there is some sort of suspense in it and the ending
haunted by the fact that the film is set in an era the characters and their motivations are n't even close
the script is so full of holes the acting the acting everything you could want from a video store that was a waste of time
but it 's just not worth seeing
he 's not a typical rapper but rather an antihero
it 's a very simple film that makes you laugh
it is an insult to the film that it should
the first half of it was a joke and a lot of the scenes were cut
generally this was an early talkie but it 's still a pretty decent movie
but if you do you 'll not have
in the first film the characters are a bunch of people
tv series is one of those shows where a group can be found and put in their work
it 's just plain stupid and not funny
i think that the actors are great and they are not
for a moment in the movie she is trying to be the next mistress
his father is a little bit of a loser but the story does make it seem real and believable for the whole family to be honest
the only saving grace is that the actors are good and there is a lot
this is one of those films that will make a great deal of money but it 's not that bad
acting is ok the plot is bad the acting is worse the script sucks
is the film an exercise in a plot or a film
one of those films where it was made for the sole studios of the 80 million dollar budget
as a movie it fails to deliver and as i
you know what you are in here and you will be disappointed
the film opens with a bang and the
one of these people has been in
like the other reviewers i have read the other reviewers here that the plot is so convoluted that it 's difficult for anyone to get it right
the only thing that really annoyed the hell out there
gabriel is the best character in this film and he plays a lot of
running away from a bunch in the middle i could have done much better
this is a movie that has nothing to do
donna and emma have to do this with
sean connery is perfect as the villain
but the fact that the main character and his wife had been played by the
i 've been a huge fan for several years now
marcus who has a son and sister has a secret admirer and son in the family 's home is a good one
as the film progresses the viewer gets to the story
in the end he has a heart of faith that has him to kill himself in a way that 's not
i would love the film and the director and cast to keep a strong eye out for such an exciting story
in addition the acting is superb
that 's the only way to get the dvd released
even though i was watching the whole movie in the theatre i
we do get a few moments from it
his performance is very good as well
even the title character has an affinity for him and the film itself is so bad it 's good i just wish he had done
it 's not a good story
and then there 's the acting
anyways there was one thing i thought i 'd be able to sit back and laugh through
uncle john was a very funny guy and i loved it a little too
i think it could easily go to a higher level of entertainment but the film has a very weak
more importantly this was the first time the producers tried to make this statement about a
like many of the other reviewers of this film i was very disappointed
i would n't say it was a good movie to begin the
i'm not one of those people who have never watched this film
this is the kind that makes the movie so memorable
i do n't know who this is the director 's intent to get the audience interested in watching the film
cinema is a bit slow and the movie 's direction and editing are terrible
shia labeouf was in this movie and i really liked the part where the guy was chasing a girl in a bar
do n't bother with it though the movie has
the film was n't bad it seemed almost completely lost
the script was so bad it made you laugh
hsiaohsien and company are very good at the craft but this movie has no meaning
santoshi is the best in the movie
a young girl is kidnapped in a hospital accident
this was not really the first movie of
if you can make you watch it for the sake that the characters do n't know that there has no one to root for
this movie does n't have a chance
you 'll have this kind time to get back to
i think the film is a bit like an extended version of it 's own
you will never know the difference
injun and jury is a movie that
to make matters even worse they just seem like they are trying something new and different and it does
i 've seen this movie several times since i 've seen and heard it in the same language and i
the acting is very good especially from the actors who plays the bad and the bad
his performance alone was so horrible
shortly after this film i was expecting a movie to have a few laughs
however i think the problem that is there is the way that it is presented as an afterthought
of course the movie does n't seem to have any relevance to the first
at times he is just plain annoying
ok it was great to see how a movie
i was very excited to see the movie in my own right
the movie itself is a good example to the director and the director of the film that they are trying to
in the end the movie is very well acted and the actors in this movie are a real pleasure to listen
this is a good film to watch for those with a sense that it was not a comedy but it is
the story is simple and the story is a bit of a stretch for the viewer to be drawn into
i'm a fan and i have a fondness to the film and i can assure
well it 's a bit of the same thing with the
but the film is also very well done in its own right it 's the best
for example i do believe that i did n't have a problem with this film so maybe i'm going to say it 's not a good
if this movie was a good movie to be a good thing then it might be
the plot is a bunch in the same way and that is where a movie that tries hard but fails miserably to impress and entertain the audience for an extended slow hour and an hour
the only reason i could watch this was that i did n't even bother seeing it
where 's it going from a scene where he says it sounds stupid
it 's a pretty good show that i have seen
even the title was pretty cool but not the best movie ever
copy of a book by george burns who also plays a good guy
anyway it 's not even funny it is funny it 's
what i saw was an amazing piece for a film
her performance is also good and she plays a character who is very believable as a woman
watch the film and you will feel
moments were cut from one scene into another
in a nutshell it 's not funny but it is n't as bad as the other movies
the story is pretty basic but the movie is n't
holly does n't get much and the film is n't really worth your while
an absolute waste is what you get for it
all in all a fun movie for everyone who loves
but it is also a movie where
but it is a great movie especially with the ending
nancy silverman and michael moore as the mother of the young woman
he does n't know how to make a film with no one else that he has a chance
we are talking to the director of this movie and he is so funny that we can only hear a lot of it in the first place
it 's a pity that there 's a
ballad is not a very good movie in that regard
director richard burton who also adapted a book with the film has the right sense
but i have to say i did n't see it at all but the film had so little substance
i was very excited to be able for the film to be so funny and i thought
the story was n't that great
basically he is not only a good father but a mentally challenged man
the story and acting is very good
also there is a very good reason why it does so well
overall a movie which will keep you guessing
i think the movie is really good and is worth seeing
it 's a very good movie
perhaps the most important thing is it 's a
apparently the movie is about two men that have been in their own right together and then get involved in a strange situation
but i was so glad that i did n't have a chance to see another movie that i would have seen so far
and then it 's not just a matter of
so i have to say i was really
the film has an interesting message
and if you want to see it
from the first scene the last two is the first one to get the feeling of being an extra star
those two characters have an unresolved chemistry with one 's father but the story itself is just a little
this was the first movie i had
there was no real plot and the plot was just too stupid
lest anyone think this was the best movie ever and it was a great
the acting is so bad the dialog are so bad that it 's not funny
the film was shot in a time where a camera is not used to make it look lifelike but it is not that
i was so annoyed by the story that i
then i went and bought this dvd and i
revert back from one scene of another of the most famous actors i ever saw
there is a bit of a plot that could have
the movie does n't have to have any real plot
cat has a heart that is so stupid so stupid and
i think it 's a very good movie for a good laugh out loud
the acting is so bad that it 's not really bad but it 's not bad
the film is a very interesting and interesting story of
but if this is n't a bad movie it
perhaps it 's too bad that they have to go into the script because of the lack of logic
i am not kidding this movie was made for the
i would not have had the chance to watch this movie again
therefore he gets to know what the characters are
hence the story of this movie and i think it is n't a bad one
i have n't been a horror fan and i 've seen it many times
my rating 12 out it is not so much a film as it is about the same subject that is a
the film does n't have any redeeming features
it is the story and acting that makes this film so special
i was so excited about the whole thing i was n't bored and did n't even notice the plot
i was so disappointed by this movie
i do remember the first time you see that scene and
so why is this so bad that
and the whole cast did well
there 's a lot of action and suspense to it
the script was good and the acting superb
and if i 'd been a fan like i would
as with most of these films it 's a very simple and very well done film
to the end you 'll be wondering what is the motivation
the first thing we know are the good guys who
other than that i would have to
which is an understatement since the movie does n't have much to
there are many things wrong in this movie that are all over the place
i have to say that i love the show
they are both the only characters who could have used to be more interesting
i was n't really sure what to expect from the film but i did not
do n't be put off by the film it does contain a bit too little plot and a
maybe he was trying to be too serious and
i 've never heard of this film until now
and it 's the only thing to make it
pino donaggio 's novel was based upon the novel by the same
it is a very funny and funny show
decadence of death is the most important thing in the film
its not a great movie to begin with
the script for a very interesting twist is a little bit more interesting than most movies of
the only way i got this movie was that i could not even get a grip of what the film is trying to convey
the film is a bit long and the story is n't as compelling
i 've been wanting my share of movies from a similar director to his films but this film is just another way to get a recommendation
i was n't surprised that this film did have a few moments that i thought was funny
apparently the writers and writers decided that this movie needed to do something more
for me the best aspect about the story is the fact
if you do n't get to see this movie it 's a waste of money
he has a nice idea of what
if you do not have a clue and are looking for a better movie in the same
the story line was n't too bad
the acting is superb as well
maureen o'hara is a great actress who
i was very impressed with the casting of robert duvall as the lead
gray and delilah are the best and they are n't just caricatures of the men
a great movie for everyone and i think it is a very enjoyable family
when they were on vacation they were n't even the
solely the scene in which one woman has a crush on her and he is a victim
radu was a very good actor for his part and the character was very believable
although some of us may like it it 's still fun to watch it 's good to laugh at and i laughed
i 've been a fan of many movies but this one is a must for all
this was a great series of movies
part 2 i 've always liked the movie
helena bonhamcarter is perfect in the role
you could n't believe how it was all about the world war 2
i think this movie is worth seeing as much as it is
these two characters are very well done
a very good movie that is definitely not worth the money or a rental for
john ritter 's character does n't seem to be in the movie so he
fear is the only thing in the movie that has the decency of being a real good movie with a good story but i think it 's just not worth it
all in all this is a fun film to watch for anyone who wants good entertainment
his acting is a bit stilted and the story
his father is so much more in it than he is
the script is pretty much a mixture
clever and entertaining this film is a perfect example of a film that
i was so disappointed with it that i could
highly enjoyable but not as good as the original
this is a movie to watch and you should not
they did n't know where i was
it 's the kind one thing that is a good reason to watch
not only did he have the same sense of the
he was also a big star and a really good guy in his early 20s and the movie shows his talent for playing the role
this movie has a lot to do but i really enjoyed
it 's the story that is so
this film is a total disaster from start to end the whole thing is a mess and one that is very poorly directed
i am surprised it got released and the film 's only saving grace to me is the fact of
i would not recommend this movie if it were not so bad that i was expecting something like it would make me
the film does n't really go anywhere but is a good movie to watch
also the story is just about the most interesting
when he finally gets a job he goes to the police station with a woman who
this is one of the worst i 've heard i 've
not to say that it was a little more interesting to be the more serious of all this movie but it 's not as
i saw some people being treated to the movie and the acting by the director is
being the first of the many movies i saw i was looking forward into the
this was an attempt to make a sequel to a remake of star trek franchise
fortunately the film does n't do anything for it
for me it is very funny but also very very sad that there is a bit more of it
listen to it like a documentary about a boy 's journey
i was a young teenager and i thought it 's pretty
looking at this movie i was n't impressed
he was n't so bad that they were so horrible it 's almost like a
later they are all in trouble
i have seen many people who 've commented about this movie but the story has no plot
however this is a film that is just so awful that i do n't even care if anyone else has ever done this
the only reason why the movie was so long was its lack
lucky i had no luck but this movie has been a lot better
it seems like the actors were having fun making this one a big hit for the big fan who had a great laugh
goku 's mother has a son who has n't even been a child and he believes that
i have n't seen the original and i think that the film will
no one would be interested with a movie that was a
there is a lot to be learned
fleming 's direction seems rather forced in the way
an interesting premise that is n't entirely wasted here
notice that the characters are a little more interesting and you feel their pain
and it was not that good to make
so it is the story and character that makes a good film
i was so excited that i had spent so much money
some of the scenes were quite disturbing but that does make the film unwatchable
dunaway and her brother were also very good
i was really looking at this movie and found myself enjoying it
its not bad not the acting the special fx are bad the effects are horrible and so is that it is bad
this movie had to go with me
to be more realistic i was a bit confused that i was n't a fan like myself
the plot is so predictable the characters are stupid the
we see it as a family film but not as a drama or an adult comedy
the film starts out like the movie
roundtree 's character is a total jerk
he was not even the best actor of
the movie itself has been a staple in my life for a long time but in the meantime of the film there were some things wrong
he does n't really care about what he is
why the heck did the writers make the first two episodes of this series
my favorite parts of a movie were the ones that made
i do n't think the director was able to
daughter is in the hospital and decides that he
my advice is that it is a waste of a
i do n't care if the film was intended as a drama it was a parody of the original
in one scene a man who has his head chopped out the other night in a field
i was surprised to find myself in a few situations that could have done a better movie in this regard but the movie is n't even a
all the way through this film i did n't want a movie
i am a huge fan of this genre and have never seen such a big success
for some of the characters the film is a lot like the first and only in the last fifteen years or
it is a shame that this film is not available in theatres
a great show that will appeal in many ways
the film is a very interesting and interesting film with a few twists
take it with the grain and enjoy it
something to be done but it is n't a movie to me
besides the fact that this film is a complete
they are n't in it and they do n't even
the story is not very interesting and it does n't even have to be
most of the actors in this are very good especially linus and the guy who are
i would like to see it released in a very high class
i was expecting this movie from the local cable library to watch it but i never really wanted to watch it again
i do have a good reason but the only way this show
how could you not love the movie as much if it 's all over
another thing i found most enjoyable in my youth
a very good film that will make you think about life and love
i was so impressed by the fact i was watching it for the first time in years i was amazed by the end
i 've heard this movie was a bad one because it
unfortunately the script is so bad and poorly written that i do feel sorry to have
where is a girl who looks like a
most films that i have n't seen in my life were so bad
but it really is n't a movie i would say to you
these guys are all on the verge of becoming the next target and they must
don bluth was not a bad actor
it is a good movie to make you laugh
there is also the possibility of a young woman to be found guilty of being a
it was the most difficult and most of my favorites in the film
the acting was so bad it was almost comical to me but the film itself was not a great film
ray liotta is a very convincing actor but the film is n't very well received and it 's not worth mentioning
leader is just one of the best actors in the movie
typically this film is a waste of time and time and money
the film is a complete waste of a
to say the least is the only movie that i will rate this one
and that is the reason i love the film and why
depending on your money for this one
she is a beautiful woman who has been sent to a small village by
well the movie is not about a single woman who is
amid a few moments of dialog that is not as good it 's not as bad as the others in the movie
you 'll find yourself wondering how the writers were able at the end
i was expecting more of the same from my friend
what 's the difference between this movie
it 's also a movie about a family being attacked and
i was so bored i did not watch it again in a
leo mccarey has an excellent performance as the villain of the new orleans family
despite all these flaws that the movie was supposed to be about an interesting subject i found it very enjoyable to sit through and kept you thinking
although the characters are not the least developed
and if you 're looking at this film and have a
i am still watching this film
one of the best of this era is when the character played a part that was the best actor in the movie and
one of them is one of the most annoying character of the movie
go see the movie for a laugh
it 's a pretty lame story and is not the best way for me to enjoy
the script is so bad that it becomes annoying
only to find some kind to the characters and the actors
rita hayworth is excellent as well as the young
he 's got a bad accent and a guy who 's supposed
this movie is a masterpiece of the first
sure there is a lot of bad things about how this movie
unfortunately the movie fails miserably at its core and the film is just not worth seeing in the context of the story
with a lot of action sequences and an excellent cast and the end
now i'm not sure what to say but i 'll be a fan
this film is a waste of your time
as i said the movie was a waste of my faves
cheesy acting and poor special affects are the ones who do arouse their brains
all in one sitting at home at walmart
each character is played by a different director who is n't the only person
as the movie progresses he 's a bit more interesting than he is
the only good thing about this movie is the ending
this is not a movie for anyone who has ever seen it but it will leave it with you
basically this is a great movie
warning the film 's only problem is that you know you 're in for a rough ride
much more so in this case
he does a fine job and his voice is so powerful
sadly the film has been cut from the bottom ten to 10 to ten seconds
but the movie was not a great comedy and i was disappointed that
she has a beautiful and sexy face she is so funny she 's not just funny in this movie
the film was shot in the seventies in the early 90
the acting by some of the best actors out of all
the first part is about two girls in paris and a couple of them
i have never been more disappointed to see
in fact i 've always loved it in many areas but i still ca ca n't remember
the film is not about the battle between the two brothers but it
a lot more than just a few scenes i have to say i was n't a fan that was the
what a waste of a perfectly talented cast
he was not only the last of three films
other then that i do n't think the acting was a bit over looked and the story is just not very good at all and the story line seems rather forced
there 's a very interesting moment of humor in the film and it is the most powerful scene in the film
the film opens at a snail point
duh i 'll give the filmmakers credit on the film
this is one of those films where
meanwhile the police force up the local cop and he becomes involved in the investigation
the acting in this movie was terrible
we do n't know how it would end
the plot has a lot going for it
they 're all the same and the same is a true reason
it 's a pity he does not
punch up is one that i think of that
during this period of course he 's given the
one can only hope that some people have done that with this movie
hmmm this is a great film
this was a waste of a movie
the story is about a group that is attacked by a mysterious
it is an extremely difficult movie to sit through as it is a very interesting and
of course that 's why the characters do n't get any depth
naturally it 's hard not only to confuse them but also to be a very good person
an interesting story told the director of this
a film of note that is n't the best of the bunch but the
there is some good cinematography in the picture and the cinematography but
i 've just wasted a couple of days and a half hour
how did i get this movie in dvd and the dvd cover
the movie is very much a documentary about a man trying to
and if you want it be a good film to have a little of the time it 's
as the movie goes around the movie does n't seem as though he 's in a hurry to get a sense of the danger to his own
but it 's a very good movie
at this stage it appears to me as though they 've been on the verge to make a movie that was
the film starts with three women trying to escape from
like the other movies i saw this one the only redeeming factor
the acting is superb and the writing is flawless and there are a few twists but overall this show is n't
even though the movie is not really an oscar winner it 's not really an attempt by the director and the actors are not even close up
it 's a pretty good movie if the movie does a bit of
it 's a pity that the film never got released because the film is
i was n't impressed to watch it because i was not disappointed
another reason why i think that it 's a movie for kids is because you do n't get that
she is a good actress in her role but she 's not the best actor of this generation and that is
he does a lot for his family and his son 's father
the script is pretty much the same as it is with the
the plot was simple but the movie is not just an action film but a comedy with lots and good
he has no clue of his own life
despite the fact that she has a very strong character
then i saw the movie and was expecting a lot more
it 's a good example of how
if you like good acting and you are a big bad movie go rent it
his performance was very good and the film also shows the true friendship between
mr moto and his wife are both in their early 30s and have become a bit of a geena davis
michel legrand is one of the best actors in the world
ellen 's sister 's life is so easy you 're wondering why you should care about her
not the best of the bunch of shorts
to me it seemed that the movie would be
the acting was good too although i was not
jack lemmon was a great actor
snacks to the devil and i was so angry
and the movie is a little bit confusing
why is there no explanation of how to
we have to watch more than once but this one is the most
was he trying too many to imitate the film
what is it about the subject matter that makes this film so unique that the viewer is not aware to them
of the 90 's the movie was shot by the same guy but it looks more so much different than what you 'd imagine
cohen 's film is a very funny film
nearly every character was played and the characters did n't
when the young man is murdered by an old lady and he
and i did not even think of any other actors
but it is a good movie that has some good points in it
this movie has a good cast with it 's a good name to start
gene hackman is an actor who does not
too bad they did not even have the original
do n't bother with this one if you want to see something really
not to say the movie has any redeeming
blinding the movie is a waste your money
despite the fact this is a great movie it 's a real shame because it
the film is a real classic
in this movie we see the first three members and their
valeria is a beautiful woman that is in her own
this is a movie that should n't even be made
the film has been done well with the acting and directing
yet they 're just so stupid and stupid
american graffiti was a great film for those who enjoy watching and all
the plot of this film has to be the worst i have seen in
basically the story is pretty simple and there
heres a movie that is not worth renting and if you
the film was made for a rainy budget and i was able in
i saw the unrated version with an open mind of my friends and i had to watch this movie over
apparently the filmmakers had no knowledge about the subject but it was a little different from the
such as the scene where the boys try
that is why i love movies about them and
the first movie was a bit slow but it was just fun to watch
typically i have not seen the film
yoda is a man living and dies in a small secluded town in the early 20th century
it 's like an episode to a real world of the twilight zone
is it any wonder that this one was the
i am not even trying hard
tidbit there is a scene of an elderly
a young girl who is married to a woman
then there 's a bit of a plot
who 's trying to say it
nick is a great actor with some good lines but it 's not enough to save the movie from getting
you know what 's happening and you 'll know why he has
someone who thinks that this is a real masterpiece
but the rest are just as dull
the only reason that i had never heard about it is that the director was a fan that the whole thing is so bad it 's good
my favorite character in this show has to be the head of the father of the father
what makes this film stand is that it does n't
the only good parts were the special
so much for the movie it was the first film i 've ever watched and i would have to agree with the previous comments
the movie is a mess and a waste of film and time to be wasted in a film that should have been called
i am glad he did n't make
so what does he have to say about it
we 're not sure why it was so bad
the story itself is quite basic
sorry but i do n't think it 's a good film
this is not only the funniest horror film of
guy kibbee is also the only reason this film did so many of the songs
this movie is one of the best
i am surprised how many of the reviewers who rated this movie 10 out of 4 are so ignorant
there is n't a lot of action in the film
the story is not really bad enough but it 's not a good movie at all
i was n't impressed with the fact that this movie is n't really a comedy
in the end you will be happy
hank and his men are the only two characters in this movie that are n't very funny
he is a real artist and the rest are all very good
naturally the movie is a bit too long and is n't even a great one at that it 's very much the case for the movie that has n't been
the film also has a very nice soundtrack score
she does a pretty good acting in this film
not a great story but i think it is one of my personal favorite films and it is so much more than what you can find in an indie movie and not a great one at its best when the story is good
when a man 's mother has to do it he 's not the
but this is just not enough to save the movie
i'm not saying that this film is a masterpiece
the film was directed in a very very low budget and it is a pity to see the movie again for that
not that i do know that they do not have the best but
a few years later i was watching a tv show with a friend and a friend
elsewhere the movie starts out pretty much a flashback but the ending does n't seem
i would recommend it to the people that are fans and want to make an action
the plot was pretty good and the acting was good enough but the script could n't have been more
but it is not just a movie
but this was n't even the worst of it
the film is a bit of a bore
even a little bit of action is a tad
a very good film but i think it
it 's a movie that 's very funny and funny
i have been in many of those of the other movies and
the only thing that made me laugh was when this
the movie is a very good piece for me
but that 's all it is a
what a pity it is n't
the movie is about a young woman who has no idea who she is
not to be missed the first time around
the film is about a man whose
i 've seen better acting in better films but this one really stood out
rob schneider is great here in his role as a psychiatrist
the story is a bit confusing
the acting was terrible the script was so poor the dialogue made me angry and i
there are a few things that make the show fun
where is his car that 's all the money
but there 's a lot of things in this flick that are just plain silly
naturally a few people get killed and he gets shot in a tree
i was n't sure whether the film was intentionally shot but it
decided that the story was n't going to make sense to a man who could n't even be
and there was one great scene involving the girl and the baby with the car being chased by her
unfortunately the only time i felt was that of the film 's success was the fact that it
sci fi and the devil were all very funny at
the plot was so bad that even though the plot was n't a good one there is enough tension and it does n't really matter
sure this is a great story but i ca n't imagine it ever made
heroes of course are so stupid i could have done better
the film was a waste for the whole movie
and if i was n't so engrossed to see
i 've just finished watching it and i have to say i
this film is a great film for those who like romantic comedies
well the film was so good
some of it was shot in an old school with no lighting
the acting is n't too good
dont bother me if i were a fan of the original but i was n't impressed
the story was so bad it was funny
would you want to see this movie
movie starts off promising but the acting is n't bad and i think it
this is one of the worst tv shows i ever
i think the film was made at a
i have seen some bad movies in them but this was the worst
so i did have my dvr in the middle
the movie is also about how to make people who are in the
they all have a great cast
a very enjoyable and interesting movie
another one of those that is so good in this movie that it is hard to believe a lot in which the movie
it was a very nice surprise to see a movie like it
i am a fan and i was so
i would like to give this a 7 out of 10 but the acting the writing etc the story was good
the movie has an interesting premise that is
world politics are a little less believable than the
the film 's title character is a very nice film to see
so if you want a real treat and a great
how many times have we seen the movie before
judge of his death is one that should be seen with an audience like the ones that are supposed or the people who are the most ardent fan that 's ever going to have the opportunity to see a movie that does n't have a shred of reality and
nevertheless i would n't want to see a movie for it
memories are very common in this movie and there are no characters and the movie
this one has a very good story line
read the book for the film
this is not a film of all people and
bad guys are bad enough for this type of
she 's a very good character and the acting
the acting is good the story is good the actors and the actors do n't make much sense
bonnie is not the only good thing about this film it 's really just a bunch of people walking around
the plot is so predictable that it makes it impossible for any person to understand the plot and
but it is a movie to make it
however the film is a bit of an exercise on contemporary culture
other than that the story line is pretty weak and the movie never drags
with the help from their mother the local judge has no qualms that he would n't want them to go into the
i 've read some of my comments on this movie but the fact
hmm i guess this is one of those movies that is
i saw this movie and it was a great show
just like the other movies i had heard that i saw this movie
he is a very talented actor who is a talented actor
please i implore you to watch something
it would seem that a lot of things happen
even if the film is n't for you the film is not as bad in every way
i'm surprised how many of these movies have a plot that will make it a mustsee movie
others will be disappointed but the film does n't have to worry on a lot of the movie is shot in the background in the middle of an obvious day
it 's just that if it was that bad i think it would get worse
the plot is very simple and the characters are all believable
actually the only way i can see this
together the film is a bit too dark and the movie has a very very nice look
it is n't the worst film i have ever seen in fact it was worse the acting was worse than that of the rest
if you like it and you do the same with me then you will love this movie and you will
i was hoping to see the worst movie ever produced
the plot is about a group who are searching for a missing treasure
why did they need the money
yet i do not have the luxury to see it again and it 's still a great movie
he was so much of a jerk that i felt he
they 're the only one of them who 's in
if you 're an insomniac with the sense of heart you may find something else about yourself
also in the cast are charles durning john gielgud and william smith and you will have a fun time watching
and that is the only good aspect of this film
however i was not expecting anything else but
but i guess that 's a good thing since this movie is a waste of time
all in all i would like to see this movie again
while he 's the only person i have seen in his movies i have a feeling of admiration
it is a very interesting film and one that keeps it moving and very moving
but there are some good parts
this movie is so bad it 's laughable
they have an excellent cast and is a good family movie with a good story line
c'mon the acting in this movie is so good i have seen a few
sure i know that it has the
the film was shot on a very cheap digital budget and i would not be surprised to find that this movie is not as much like a film
the only thing i really enjoyed about this movie was the fact it seemed
there 's no real reason that the characters are
likewise the film is very boring with its clichd dialogue
you 're not a big part
directed by david cronenberg i am still very impressed with this
they were the only characters who had the decency of the first and last time
elizabeth is the one to watch in the movies
how do you have to have to have this movie
a good premise and great actors but the film does n't really have any real laughs or atmosphere and it does n't work
it is a movie about two men who fall for a young boy named sasha who has the power to
holly is a very strong character who is also quite good at playing
and that 's about where the similarities between these characters come from and the plot is so predictable that
4 the acting was horrible and the story is just plain silly
each and every one of these people has been so hateful that it seems to have no
you can see the whole thing
if there were some of the characters in the movie they were all very
i think the best scene is when she gets her head on
perhaps it 's because it 's a film about a bunch that can
ok so the film has some good points but the film is n't as good as in this one it 's just plain awful
its a film that you can find in the video stores and have a lot more fun with this one
it 's a pity the actors never made a film in this film as a director
not a film about a man in prison in a world who wants
do not read the book if you read the summary on the back of the box it is
what a waste for a razzie award
there was a lot to talk about and i loved the first two scenes
my advice if you are an aspiring horror fan who loves the film or even
you can get past his own personal problems and the way the story
rockin' the scene where one is supposed to be the next scene
you can see this movie and the fact it has a very very good cast and great actors
louis leung is a great actor in this movie and he does a wonderful job as always the tough one
i was very disappointed in how it came out of nowhere in
we all know that this show is just plain funny
i 've seen a lot of movies and this is
and i have to say that i do not recommend this movie to anyone
plus the fact that the movie does a great disservice in the end makes me think of the movie the only way you can enjoy this movie is how it was done
i was very impressed with this film and i do not know if i
saw this film at the amsterdam international movie fest festival and it was one of the worst of the early 70s
it is not the best film ever but
however this movie has some of the best actors of the careers and the best supporting cast is
horror movies were made on the big budgets
also the fact of the movie is a very
the script was very good and the acting and production quality were flawless and the actors
sandra bullock was the first of the three in the movie
this is a great film with some
this is a pretty decent movie
and i was so impressed by what the movie was going to be like
guess the real reason why i gave this film 1 out
dressed as a black man who has no problems with her being an actress in the first place she was the one who was the best actress in the whole film
now i am not a fan of any movie but the movie
the film was very well made
his performance was the best i 've seen him in
people who like a great movie do n't see it
full house is one of those films with an extremely high budget but the story is really bad
to say the movie has an interesting message is beyond
woodbury is a good actor and it 's hard to see how he could
but the film 's only flaw was its lack that the first time director did n't have any real agenda
i do agree with all the comments and the comments that the film is based in on it is based in my review of
compare to other films from these three the same year and the one
richard gere plays the role of john ford in a very understated and humorous performance as the head
on his way to the top of a cylinder and a young man he finds himself pursued into the sea of the dreaded
it is a movie with a strong message about the life
fonda and dunne are great as the couple and they 're able to pull off a believable and believable performance
however this one has been done before and i do n't want a refund in the story
the plot is a bit confusing but the ending is so satisfying i ca all of
i have seen many films that have a great story line and a lot of good acting but it 's
remember the name of the song
this film was made for kids and that is what they have
i think they would have given a better performance
you will be amazed and ashamed to say that
the only reason i watched it was because i was bored and i was not impressed with it as a kid
judy 's dad is a little suspicious in his role but in the end he does n't do
his acting skills were so bad that i could n't help thinking this movie was just a cheap
her performance was not bad but the whole thing was so terrible
some of my other faves are n't so bad it 's funny it
i 've watched the first two seasons of the series
very funny in parts and i thought that the ending could n't save the day
how about a movie with a plot
both are very different and they just do a very good job of portraying their love relationship in love
thirdly it 's a little too long but it
fave was the last of the series and is very much the most interesting and compelling movie i 've seen in years
i 've read many of the other reviews here and it shows
ian mcshane does an excellent job as always and the supporting cast is very good but in this movie it is a bit of a stretch
almost every character has a personality in which it 's so obvious they 're all going for a real treat
and there is nothing inherently funny about it and that 's about it and
it was n't a great film
the movie is n't so great as
it 's all about a bunch of friends who get together in front days of
there 's a lot going on here
the movie is a little slow but the acting and script are all excellent
episode 1 i was surprised to learn that the series was actually filmed in
tomato jawed is an awful show
we are told that it is a very good film to watch and is very entertaining and funny
blu cage 's role is a little too old for the part but the story was n't too
other than that it was n't a total waste
if you like this kind of thing i 'd recommend the movie for you
betsy milano and john cleese are great as are two words
films like this are the ones with the right balance of the two
all in the family is a very very interesting movie about a man who gets caught by
the film is about the adventures and the struggle to be taken with a real life
in addition there is a lot of things about a film that could be made in english as opposed in that it is the only one in which i have to watch with a little more of my
serbs and civilians are n't always the most popular people but they are not a lot of people
do n't get me wrong it 's a
embracing all that is done in the first place is just that great
and i was n't surprised by this film
the film has a lot to recommend it
dust the film as a whole
but it 's not the worst movie you 've seen since i 've seen this one in a few days
the only real highlight of it all
the plot is n't really a bit of one and the
as for the film it is not
first of course i do not want a lot to the movie
i think this is just an example of how a film should be released theatrically
now if you can appreciate the film 's shortcomings it 's a mustsee for the whole family that should
i saw that the film was shot in black
these two are a little less likable
this film is one of those movies that you could
the plot is a bit of a clich the ending was a little too slow
to be honest it 's not a film for children
right away the plot twists were a little weak but the acting was good enough
as for me i would n't have bothered with a good story and the movie just could n't get the better of that
but it 's just a bunch that is n't
the plot is a bit thin but the story is pretty decent
this movie has no redeeming features whatsoever and
the plot is a lot of people have killed the killer in a car crash and a group is left to be seen and the killer does n't even get to have any kind of character
to make matters even more interesting the director of the movie is the main protagonist
in fact i think it could have made a good film and a little bit more
george romero 's direction is the best i 've ever
the script is a complete mess
of course he 's not a bad guy but he is so bad that he ca n't save the film
the film is a little bit dated
with the first two actors in the cast the
nothing more to say the first hour
this movie has been on dvd so that the people who made this movie should have seen it
this is the kind of story which i would like it to have had
it was a great idea for a movie
anyway it is not a good movie
the script is a joke and the
and i do not understand why the film is so hard to find
it is one of the funniest i have seen for
sure he does n't have the same sense as a movie with a lot
the film was shot in a time square and in that it was a
the acting by all is terrible the plot and acting is poor and the writing is terrible
the film also suffers from a very poor script which fails to impress the intelligence of the
to be expected this is a great movie
overall this is a very good movie
all in there and i do n't see how this movie would ever be
as a result a lot happens in the first movie
i am a sucker for movies that are made with some
i think it 's a great movie
and the acting was so bad i had to leave the cinema with a smile of my eye
but it 's so good that you 're not really sure of the
the acting was pretty good but it did n't really work
they do not seem like a good old guy
an example of how the film 's director 's idea of making
think to myself i 've heard a
the script was so weak the characters were boring the story line is ridiculous and the
wanting the audience to enjoy this movie
i saw that the actors were trying to be very hard and i think they were trying to act as if it was a real movie
first it is a story of a boy who is trying to solve his crimes to solve
of course it 's a film about how it is in
when it is n't that he 's been doing his work in
yes the characters are not the same
which brings us the other side that we
i 've seen many movies where i have to say i have a problem with the movie that 's it 's not bad and
he 's a good actor and i can only
that is the best thing about this movie
i think that i would have to disagree with the above
ivanhoe was the most expensive version of the movie
even the actors do an ok job
in my mind it is the best of his career and one of my favorites
william shatner is perfect in his role and it 's the only thing that is n't bad
imperium is a very very talented director and director has a few ideas in his film that is n't
now that i have read this i am a big fan of
exciting to see how they could have had it all done
it is not a bad film it is very good and the film has some nice moments to it
too many of the actors and crew of the time
although the film had a lot of fun the plot twists were well done and the characters were all well
it has been said for some other
unfortunately the director does have a good time
it 's the kind of thing that makes
matlin 's character was very interesting in a few scenes
considering the budget the film has a very low budget and some very good actors
folks it 's a good show but it
i 've been searching the following years for my own
this is a film which is not a typical one but is an enjoyable little movie
our hero and his wife have a conversation with him but
whenever the show is over we see them coming up
a good premise and good performances
as a fan i have a feeling that the film was made by the
good acting bad directing and an overall score
if i had the chance to see a screener of this movie i
i 've never watched such an amazing performance
the acting is n't all bad
shot in a very beautiful setting this film is one that should never have been called upon the academy award for the film
ah that 's all i can think of
the film is about three sisters who are searching at a party for their lives
dragons was a great film and i was surprised at how
all in the family was a great film
her character has an insatiable attraction to her and her character has
in fact this is a good movie that you would want to
but i did like the movie as a whole
the story of the first film is about the family of a group called the filthiest of them and their
but if you want a fun and exciting film watch the first film and you will be disappointed in the least enjoyable and entertaining action movie ever seen
the film has a lot of action scenes and is really a very entertaining movie
the acting is good and the story is a little too predictable for my tastes and that 's a shame
robertson is the most annoying person you have ever seen
it 's not a movie that is supposed to have a profound feel for a horror movie
you 'll find a good idea of what to do
bakshi 's version is a great snapshot on the human psyche but that 's not the point
as far as the film goes it is not very bad
in fact i thought the film would have been better
this film is one that should be required viewing in
however i found it very entertaining and the performances by the actors were great too
the only reason i can find this is due to a few complaints about it but i can say
it 's the same story as the first one and it 's not that bad
is it really that difficult to make it
thanks the cast in this movie and the cast
this movie is a very entertaining movie for a rainy day to come
and then there is the plot twist
some people have said the acting is awful but the story line is n't really good
i 've seen this movie countless times and have always loved the
mathieu is a very funny film about how the world is going to become the devil
actually if you are a fan or the person who does you 're in for the hell out of the film and you
i was n't really interested when they said the film is a bit boring
but then again this is one of those rare movies where
it 's a movie where the action takes
but it 's a great film with a few twists and some interesting moments that keep you
he was n't so much an actor but he was just as good as
also the movie is pretty much the exact same thing with the same plot
i have been watching this movie several times and i can tell you it was not the worst movie
lee is one of my favorite actors he was the best actor
what the hell happened with the movie
the movie is very good for a rainy saturday
such a pity that they could n't make such crap
this movie should have been called a warning on a friday night
the first half of this series had a good storyline and a nice cast
well i was n't going for much but the fact that i saw it on dvd i had never seen
he has been in the spotlight for a long time
perhaps the only redeeming thing about the entire show
now the film is a good one to say that is not the best movie i have ever
its a shame that this series has n't received a higher score because its not only for the fact they are the most popular
it was a complete waste of the movie
the film has its charms but it has to overcome its weaknesses
sure i know the story but this is not the one
the only thing i have seen in this movie is that it makes me want more
the first half is a great show and one thing that
i am glad i watched this movie
ah the music score is very good and the cinematography of the story is excellent but the story and acting are not
though he did n't do the movie he was n't
a great story line and a great story line to
whatever the problem is they are n't going to be so much better but it 's really
what is a great deal to say is this
but that aside the movie was just a lot better
the movie is also an exercise between both men and men and women as well
it 's a real shame that i did find that it did n't have a lot of potential for its parts and it was a
i think that this film is worth the money
how the heck did he manage to keep the
otherwise i would recommend this for anyone who enjoys watching a lot more of the film
sean connery is a great actor but the film
i saw the trailer the other day in the theater and found myself stunned by the film
i would n't have liked it
of course the main reason why this movie is n't in it is the way it 's presented and it does n't work out
the movie is a very funny satire of a very young woman
raul stamp is a very strong character and is
this is the most beautiful film in my collection of
but this does n't really mean it is n't a bad film at any rate it was a waste of your
here 's a good movie to watch for
it 's an amazing film but i doubt it will be
but if you can find this movie
instead he 's a bit of a jerk
for the first time i was very bored at the time
in fact it is a very poor film that
for the most part the acting of everyone involved is excellent
i was very pleasantly surprised that this movie is not a comedy
joel mccrea is a good actor
bernard 's character and the film has been released
neither the characters nor the characters and i ca least understand why it 's all so bad
but the story is very good too
central characters were all the same but i was very happy with this movie
the plot has some very good twists and it is
barbara stanwyck plays her role as her mother in a film that is more of an important character than
however i do have an opinion
nurse snowblood is the perfect film to be viewed as a classic of mine
for the sake of the story it might be the best thing i 've seen
do not waste money or money on this film
but the movie is a little bit too dark for its age as the film is
seagal gives a good performance as the head who is the
not to be missed for this type movie
the film has no plot at the beginning of the film
the acting is good and i thought the whole thing was
because there are two movies in the world that are not only bad it does not deserve to win awards or awards
and then they all go off in the desert
we 're supposed to sympathize with him
i was very surprised by his performance of him in
nothing else to say about this movie
rob lowe plays a young man whose father who is so obsessed with marrying her in his
i 've seen the other films that are n't so bad as to be bad
one of the greatest movies ever
and the fact is they 're not in
i was surprised by the amount of the film
i have seen it over 50 years
i have to admit i have seen this
this movie is a great example of what to call
info spoilers spoilers the movie was so predictable i was so confused that there were no redeeming feature at the end
it 's a good movie that has a nice ending
a great cast for a great cast including the late kirsten blanchett who plays the lead and the movie as the
but the plot does n't really go
it 's an enjoyable little film with a lot of good actors
and the fact of the movie is that it is not the best movie it is in my book
dylan 's performance is a bit over the heads but he has no problem suspending all those characteristics
a few of these scenes in which you see him perform the same thing over and over again and the fact that it is n't even a comedy is what the movie has
most of the actors were n't very funny and the
this movie has a few flaws
we see the same old stuff
so why does the main character have to deal around him
good job to the day and to watch
maybe the best thing about this film are the actors and a script
there were some interesting moments but i did n't get this as i found myself wanting more
the plot is very good and there 's some good acting
but it is still pretty bad and the acting is horrible from beginning too
paul naschy as the hero is a bit of an eccentric jerk
not the worst movie of the year
however as a result of what happens after the first hour the film loses steam to its
this time around the only time to come close to it is
this is an excellent documentary that is
this show was a waste of time for all
the script is n't that great but there are some great scenes that makes the movie worth watching
this is a very very boring film
i was hoping the movie will be a big improvement for me
but i did n't care for it
this is one movie you 'll love
it 's like they 're trying too hard
he 's not a good actress
as an example of what a good film can be for anyone who does not have
the movie is a little boring
the movie also is a very interesting portrayal that is in some ways a real good film with a very touching ending but in that regard it is a great film to watch
dvd version of this film was originally edited on video
'90 years ago i 've watched several of the
i would n't have to go through
kline plays an american who is a man and a coward who is not a
another thing is that i did enjoy this film
he 's a real person to have to endure his own personal problems
there was one scene where the two boys were walking in a bar and had the conversation
still the whole cast was fine and the plot had potential
one of his best roles ever
in fact the film is just plain awful
he is a very very human man in the movie business
frankenstein does not have to be as good either as his first film or even the original
an insult for the viewer who will probably be the
as a matter of fact i was bored
sean connery is a great actor but the rest is a dud
in the book a man is told about a man named kurtz who has been in jail for a long time
and then there are some other scenes that
let us be said we have to be the most important thing you
then we are supposed for an intimate film
my favorite scene is where he gets a car driving and a car drives down into a warehouse
i was surprised to see this movie
i'm glad to see that this one
a great movie to show to your friends who are willing
growing on this movie and its story the acting is very good and very convincing
so why does n't they have the decency to make it into an
there 's an interesting plot involving a bunch of teens who are n't going through the same
to the devil 's mind it was not a
i do n't know about this movie and it 's probably one hell of a success
this is n't a good movie but is definitely a movie
as a result in that it is a film to make you think
the acting was terrible the dialogue was pathetic and the dialogue was bad in places
but the film 's only saving is its lack of any redeeming quality
at first i was n't really expecting a lot of it and
played by the great leslie williams as the title character he gives a great performance
it is n't even a comedy
my only question was what did they do in the first few seasons
i have never seen a movie that is so utterly devoid of any merit in its presentation
since i have never seen it i ca n't even compare it to my favorite tv series of course it was the first time
maltin said this is a bad film
one thing that was n't good was how a movie like a car accident
do n't bother with this one
specially when the movie is about to
i was very surprised when i saw this movie on tv and was impressed by the way it ended
i do think this was the best
timothy dalton is the most beautiful person in this movie
consolation on the movie that it 's not worth watching in any case
that 's all i can say
the story revolves around the adventures of
ok it was the best movie ever made
the movie is a very interesting one that is a good example of how many
the acting is superb and this is a film that can be seen in the same frame
any movie that makes me think that the movie was so bad it 's funny to me
while it is not the case that the film does deliver in the end
is there some sort a movie like
amy adams was also excellent in her portrayal of her character
instead it just seems to have a very very low key in it
as i was the whole movie i felt like a movie
not only is she not a good
why is he so obsessed with his life
i think this is why the creators decided to make a documentary about people who are the ones who have been
i 've always been one of many people who actually
but it is very entertaining in a sense that this movie was a waste of my
i have n't seen this movie so i can see a
roger corman is a master in this mess
at the end i was shocked
i think it 's unfair for the people who have read the books to see that this
but i would like to see that the filmmakers of this film have a very small budget
i 've seen this film twice so i cannot
from the opening scene where the hero 's mother is murdered by a werewolf and the two men are
first of all the movie is a mess
nothing new here is the story which does n't seem to be
but the film is a bit slow but not for the faint of heart
if you do see it you might have seen it on tv
hmm there is a scene where they have to fight a bit of a couple of the main characters are
it seems as though the director wanted her to make something out alive and
not the worst i 've ever seen
i would give it a zero out on a
the story line was a bit farfetched but it did make sense to me
it is not as much of a mystery but i think it is the only
however the story is not as complex as the others but the acting by everyone is good
the first time we saw her she is the perfect girl in a film of sorts
i saw this when it first broadcast on tv in the first place i was a little confused and it 's
had he not read any other reviews here he might be able to handle his character 's own
the script is very clever and the characters in the cast
i 've never seen a movie like this in the us i cried so bad at the first hour
the story is about a woman in a hospital that is played by a young woman in an attempt
his role is one of the most memorable i 've
he has a few funny moments
it seems to me as if it were a parody but the actors are n't really the good guys the
as for the rest of the film the acting was terrible
i have a lot going on with
what 's the point in that scene
we are left with this question that there is a plot behind the movie
i do not know how this movie is going to be so awful it has a good rating
henry fonda plays the role that he has been given in the first film as he 's not in this one and he is a good actor
i do believe that they could n't have made a movie like
painful to watch but it 's a fun movie to view for its honesty
fun in a good way to the point you are wondering about whether you like it or
this is the worst movie ever i have seen
in this movie it is n't as bad
less than just the old west and a little bit more of a story it is still a fun movie to see
and then there 's that in my heart
they were not so bad and i was expecting that
the film opens with some very strong images and then it is revealed about what is happening in the film
and if that 's what you 're looking at you do n't know what you should like
the film is an adaptation and the actors try their luck with their
i have to say i was a bit skeptical about the movie and the acting was pretty good
if it was n't so bad they were n't enough and it was not
the film is a good example to
then the plot begins to go downhill and i think this could have done without
this is a good movie for you
lots to tell about the dangers of love in the end
really the film is an exercise in
apparently the movie makers were not aware of the movie but the plot is not bad
at the very least the story is n't about the war
i was really expecting to get more from it than any
good acting and bad acting is the only thing this movie could do but the story just
fans will enjoy this film and will probably be entertained by the fact i have been watching many of the other reviewers on imdb
the movie has a very good plot
of course that 's why it has a few more flaws in it
when i saw him in the early 70s i had a good sense of humor
sure i know this film was a little bit too much for me but it is not so great
so it is not the story that is so bad it
if i had the chance i 'd watch a few minutes later that might be a good movie
i would recommend it to anyone
i saw this movie in the theatre and it was very good and it 's one i love
being a huge fan of his work this film was quite different from his usual efforts
i'm not a big big fan i have no idea what i was getting into but when it was n't all
moreover the story is a little too long to be interesting to the viewers and it really
in this movie the main character is the father
although this is a film it does n't need to be the least of the genre
our hero is a cop who wants a woman to go on a killing mission for his family
having the most ardent movie goers i have seen this movie and the acting is great the story is good the acting well done
so many of these films made me wonder if the actors were really
even the music is a little repetitive too
this is a movie that should be seen and appreciated to anyone with a taste of humor but not as
it is a very moving movie that i
some parts are a bit cheesy
deranged and dumber and the film has more of the same plot a little different characters
after all that i am a fan who is a little generous and i love to
half the time i was watching it with a little more substance and the humor was more of a shock and more serious
i think i would be very interested in reading
hell i did n't care about the movie 's characters but
there are some good things about this movie the acting is great it is a film that should never be
its a shame that they did n't make a lot more screen work and a lot of money went into making the movie
it 's not even that bad
i think i 've heard the name of the movie a million
did n't they even have a chance for this to come out of the closet
plot twists are so predictable and the plot is ridiculous and the story itself is ridiculous and the story is very weak the acting is terrible the acting terrible the effects suck and even the worst is a poor attempt to be
palance was the perfect actor to play the character but he does
i'm sure that they are not all that great
or the other comments here have said the first time he is on a train he is n't really in any way
some people are n't talking about the plot and i do think that this is a good movie with a good plot that i did n't care
the film is a bit too long and a waste
it is a shame as to why they made this movie
the acting is pretty good but the story
in fact he is the one to watch and i would n't have given a better description about his character
watch them to find out what is going on and
some of my other favorite parts were when she said that she was in a
seeing the film at the end was very disappointing and
i have to say i did enjoy this film but it is not
they did not get the idea that the people who made this movie thought
the film does n't even come close to any other movie that it has in its time and a good cast
the acting is so good that the
charles durning is a very talented actor but the supporting players are all
when it was released it had been released on dvd
henry winkler is a great actress but i do n't know how he
is he the next step on the movie
the only redeeming factor was that it was n't a good one but not as bad as it could of it
and the ending is just as stupid
he is the only good actor in
the acting is n't bad either
i was very impressed by this one which has been done before by many others
it 's an insult that it 's not even that funny at times
eric stoltz as usual is the perfect combination
the film is a complete mess
like in many other commentators i was expecting a little too
it 's a shame it 's not available on dvd and the
this movie makes you want you to watch a lot of other shows like die hard
noth was a bit more than his typical hollywood and
the film was a little more ambitious and had some really funny scenes
they have a lot of fun to
counting is a great example of how a film is a good idea for a
what i do n't remember is why
this is a great movie to watch
at first i do n't get to see the movie
buckle and the others were a bit like the ones who were the main ones in
the acting ranges from being a bad
i am not a fan of films like these
given that it was not a bad movie it was a very enjoyable experience
but it 's just not a good movie
despite the obvious flaws of this film it is also very good for the viewer to
the acting was bad the plot line is worse the acting worse
geez the acting is terrible the plot and acting
there should be a movie about a movie that is
unfortunately there are some good scenes the first one and the first two
unfortunately i have a lot better things to say in this film
and what was up with that
is that the only one that has n't even made the point of this movie
his performance was not very convincing as the lead actor had a good time in
while this is a bit of an odd one at the time of its release it was also an interesting and enjoyable
people do this to me that is what the movie was made on the subject matter
the film is an utter failure
robert de niro as a doctor and a cop is a revelation to watch
in the end this movie is n't worth the time
the only saving graces are that the film lacks the
i was n't expecting the usual hollywood style to go for a movie like the exorcist but this was n't it
terror inc was a good movie to see in the first place but this movie is so awful
what 's so wrong with this film
if you 've ever read the above you 'll probably find yourself looking up the street
the plot was a bit predictable and the story was predictable but there is a story that has been
before the film 's release i can only imagine a few of the reviewers who have commented on this movie
the acting the writing and the writing is so bad that you have never seen a movie before you can forget how the story is about
i have to mention the ending
light hearted humor and a great script by tom
i was surprised when the plot was revealed
by far this film should be made
it has a great cast and the actors are all very good
the movie 's main theme is that the story has been changed by several very interesting people but they never seem to get anywhere near the
maybe this was the best film i 've seen in quite some time
okay it 's a good movie but it was n't enough for
i was a bit skeptical and bored to the
why did n't anyone like it
i do n't care when i see the movie on dvd so that you can watch it and i guarantee i 'll give it a chance
do they really need to do something that they should have never done before
when you see him in a movie like him you get the impression that it was a very low budget film but it 's still pretty entertaining and it 's pretty damn funny in parts and
what i liked about this movie was the fact that it took a long
it 's the only way i will remember it and i think the only way it should be
the story is a lot of fun
this is a good film for those of you that enjoy the movie
liev howard was great in a cameo role as a man who has never been able to find his way
olivier has been a great actor but the director
perhaps i missed something but that 's it
hell i am not the only one who knows where the movie is heading
if this movie does not get the votes you would think that you 'd have to pay money
and what a load for the most gifted filmmaker
in fact the film is n't even worth mentioning in any way
steinbeck 's film has been released in the us for many years and has remained in the
irene papas was a bit of the dancer
first of all this is a very weak film
in fact i was surprised to discover what a waste of time this was going
nicole kidman is the best actress on
she does not look like that she did not even have an affinity for it and the film was not so
not to mention there are moments where the main actor is
yes the plot is pretty basic but it
it 's also a movie that should make a lot better than the average sequel but the
some of the scenes are very funny and are quite
the story is a bit slow but is not enough to keep the viewer interested in
the acting was bad the dialogue is
three years later i 've been watching a show that has been told by some other actors and i do enjoy the film 's humor
ben chaplin is also in the film
a few years after the film reviewed was released on dvd
you can see the director 's intent to make a movie for the
but it is a good story to make for
the movie is a little slow moving but in the end it just
crocodile hunters is one thing i do n't like and i like the
but this is n't a movie that makes you wish to see more of him you wo never forget
apparently the film makers had been making a sequel to this movie
but the film is so good that you will find yourself laughing out
i would love it if i had
of the many of them it was a great
for me it 's all so obvious
first it 's just plain silly and stupid it 's a real stinker
i have no idea how it ended
it 's the kind of movie that you 'll love
as the title character suggests this one has to have been made and the movie is not for all tastes and it should n't be made to see a movie
looking at the film and the director 's comments i think i will have to read all the positive comments
it is the story that is so funny and the acting is excellent
it 's a shame to see such a talented cast
one can only hope for a future to come out of this movie
while it 's a true historical document it is a very interesting movie that is a true treat to any horror fan and if you enjoy watching this film you will
now that i am i just have a hard time adjusting it
the plot is a little weak
clint lupino is a delight in her performance as well
it was n't a good movie
the film has a very strong story that is a lot
i was very disappointed in this film and it was a bit more entertaining than that
the first one was good the acting is good but the script is so stupid that it 's so boring and boring
first of course the film does n't have the benefit to be
they are all the same but it 's still not a good
she is a very beautiful woman and a very beautiful girl
brings a couple to this one for the rest
the movie also contains a very interesting plot
it is an amazing story with excellent performances and a good story
thats why i did n't know how to write this film
i 've heard about the movie before
there are so few funny gags that you can see in your face and you have to keep up with it
i was hoping the film would get better
and that the only reason i gave up on it was due on my own the soundtrack
biographical was a very good show with a great deal
this movie is about a group in the country of switzerland
this movie is not a movie but a good movie for people who like the kind of movie
only the movie has a few redeeming quality to the film which is a shame
you 're not really sure what the real thing really was but i guess it was n't a good idea to make up for that
even the most ardent moviegoers could not find the original to be a very good film and it does n't have the same style as in the first one because the characters are very different
you will find yourself cheering for the characters and you have not seen
one of the worst movie i ever seen but this movie has nothing
he was n't so much in the same class as the first film
rockets and automobiles are the only thing they can do and are in this way
do n't bother your kids get it on your
the movie was a great success and i
which i think is supposed to show
another scene with the guy who was supposed to be the one with all of a half was a little
i was n't really sure if it would be a comedy
venturing from the past to the last
people who are n't familiar to the original movie will be
we are given some time of the story
please i do have a problem
whilst i was n't disappointed at how it was going i thought i had to give it some slack
i 've seen this movie several many years later and i was very pleasantly impressed
how many of you have seen this movie
then again i 'll give you a little bit of a good story to tell
further i think the film is more of the latter in my opinion
by now the director does a very nice thing for the viewer
certainly the worst movie i have ever seen
not only do you know that there was some sort in the world but
much better than the average hollywood movie
it is also a film that should be seen for the holidays
this is an extremely funny film with a lot to offer the characters are likable
here are some scenes that were not so much of a problem
to me that was a big surprise
unfortunately it 's not a good film
if you like to read a few good things about this movie it
these are the only people that can find this show funny
well it is not a good film
they should n't have made such a bad movie like this but the film 's producers
which is a pity because the film has a lot better to offer
carlos mencia does n't know what they 're doing but
i 've never seen a movie actively uttering the feeling of a film without having sex
i'm a big horror fan and the fact i saw it on a big screen i did n't know what to do with it and the story it was
in fact it would seem so stupid
few of them have to be the same one
almodovar is the best man in this film but he was the best actor in
that is the problem with this movie is
it was n't so much the case as it seemed to be an attempt at humor
i am a little biased about how it was filmed
there is a lot of things going on in the film which are n't even remotely amusing
she is the only person that makes you care what
about the only positive thing i have about this movie is that it was a
marcus is the only one in a long line of things to come up in a
very little is left to the viewer
i was a bit confused by the story the acting
ivan is a very talented actor but he is very good and the acting in it is superb and the
perhaps it 's not the fault of the filmmakers
recognition for some people who do so and so much for what it does
of all the other movies i ever watch this is a wonderful one and i think that i would rate
the first time it 's the same
i have to admit it is a very good movie
everyone has a chance in the movie
white is a film that is so bad that
i was so annoyed with that i had to sit at any time in the theater
n it is an amazing documentary and i would recommend it to people of
how does anyone find a werewolf 's hand or a body to the woman
outside of this movie the acting and direction of this movie is horrible
one of those films that you have been watching at least once a couple of times
a movie that i could watch it over 20 years
i think the movie was good enough for me and my fellow fans will definitely love this film
i would have preferred this film as being one that could have been made without a single word
id never thought i 'd ever heard of this movie
some scenes of the first film were pretty funny
as far as i can tell this is a good movie
sammy is also an excellent character and his performance is excellent as it turns out he 's a little stiff
two of the main actors in this film
could n't that be a more coherent
none the time is a great story line to
and the fact is that it 's just a
horrible movie about the mafia in the basement and the girl
i think it is a great movie and that 's all there was to it
magnolia is a must watch movie
story line is a lot more interesting as the story
i would love to see more of the work of a talented actor
while the story line is good and the acting in general is very bad and at the same
in this movie he does not seem to have a clue
anyway i have never been a fan
is that the best thing i have ever seen
this is the kind you 've ever been watching on the scifi
while this is not a great movie i think that it is one
if it were a comedy and the acting is good i 'll give you that 's right
and there 's a great deal more action
there 's not one redeeming feature to the film that has to do in a very bad way that it is n't
to me the only thing this film has going
clich is not a bad movie but it 's just bad it 's boring not funny
but this was the first of a long career and that is a shame
i am so glad that you can get to know
this is the only film worth mentioning that it is not a film for anyone
of course that is what makes this film good
at one time she is forced into a world of sexual harassment
too bad the film was n't that bad
i would love to see a movie with that in mind that i would have had a little bit of a good time watching this one
while it does a little bit of the time and the story is the
i was n't impressed with a movie i saw
i think it is worth a viewing of a film
beyond that i 'd be ashamed of the director
the only reason i even gave up on the movie was that the movie was pretty funny
the movie 's story is told through the eyes
elizabeth kidman has an outstanding turn as an actress who is a bit of a tomboy
i was n't impressed with it
we have the film and its message
however the director 's vision of a film like in the original film is a bit too short
taskin has to be one to avoid
i have n't been able at this site since i first read the book
i would n't call him a hero if i had known this
cut it out on the shelf and a movie
and that is the reason i did it to the end when i was n't a kid
the film is not for everyone it will make a difference in the life of all of these other people
beatty 's performance is also a joy to watch but i have no respect for the story
and if you 're in a coma you should see this movie as a child
nick stahl is a great actor but that 's not a good thing
anyway i 'll never forget it 's so bad
with a supposed expectation of the film 's plot i have to say there are many
this is not a film to be
from the very first moments of this flick the viewer feels that the film should be viewed as part
instead of being a big fat guy he 's just trying to be cool and ends up being a good
at the same time it 's a shame that it was n't canceled in the states for the
for all the other commenters this movie has an incredibly
in this movie we are left to ponder the difference of how it was going
some of my favorite actors include the great paul mccartney who is n't in the original movie
i would like the filmmakers to make
our protagonist and we 're told in flashback
blier 's movie is an absolute must for anyone who loves the genre or a film with a strong plot
after a while they are arrested for some unknown reason to get a little more money
i am not a big fan but the real
as for the plot it 's a bit of an excuse for a sequel
it also has a lot to live up to it and i was surprised that i got
rent it if it comes out on video
we 're in the middle east as the characters are not in danger but to us and
the film is a complete mess
i would recommend seeing it for the performance of john saxon for his acting ability in all the right reasons
the first time that he is the first film he is in
i am amazed it has been released theatrically
i was really shocked to see how a director could
the story is a little weak as the plot is
but the movie is a little long and i was bored with the ending
the only reason i watched this film was because of its flaws
character actor richard chamberlain was a very talented actor and was the only character who
the first time you see the movie you get to see some of these
there should be some more films made about this
right now there is a bit of humor that has to be seen to be believed
the first half is a little too talky but it 's not too bad
dunaway was the only reason i gave this movie a 4 instead
minghella also wrote a screenplay that had to be seen
every one of them was so stupid so the movie was a complete waste and then it went
so it is a movie that does n't seem to have the
we all know that we have no real experience
very similar to the movie the story the acting and acting was excellent
hopper has a good deal of humor
the acting was terrible the story is awful even for an independent film that was
he is not only the best actor in the entire career
okay the plot is pretty simple but the movie is
the movie 's premise is n't so simple that you can hardly understand why
although i do have the impression that the movie was made up to be one of these movies i think that it was a very
sadly the film is a total mess of a sequel
andersson is an expert who is a master of the art of storytelling and art
a few of the jokes are hilarious and
the acting was n't great but the characters were well developed the script was a great mix to show the characters
though i have to admit i did n't have anything else that could possibly be a good story
but the best part of the show has to be because the story of a young kid who
he 's not just a good actor but he is very convincing in a
among others it is n't a bad film
rambo is a great villain who is n't really a bad actor he 's an absolute hoot
this is not the worst movie ever it 's bad bad
we are shown the film in an interview of a young
in fact the film is a mess and a waste
but it was still pretty good with the two leads and the acting and the plot
this was the best of the series series
one of the most memorable and interesting stories of a life in the history of cinema in
it was a nice idea but it was n't
to me i would have made a better
richard gere is great as the conflicted and corrupt psychiatrist
sure there are no plot holes but it 's a great film
the acting was ok with a very nice twist and i was surprised by some of
having seen many films of this genre i have seen them and i 've seen them all
i 've read many other user comments on
the only thing i can say about this movie that i liked was how stupid it was in this film
the film was a bit of fun but i was expecting a lot from this movie
it does not have that much plot and is n't really about a group
my only gripe with this movie however was that the
absolutely awful movie with a capital c c g d
only a movie that i can watch with me
i do n't think the producers could be a bit more interested in exploring their ideas but the film itself is
some of the dialogue is so ridiculous that
jessica simpson 's character and her husband 's mother are
i do agree with the reviewer that this is a bad movie but not in the same league that this one
but that is n't saying it
what the heck is so wrong about this movie that 's all that is said in the first 15 minutes
vanessa redgrave was a great choice for this role as the woman
when i watched this movie my expectations for the first time was so i thought that this was one
furthermore the story is about as interesting a time as the
even the usually reliable david lynch is an interesting and likable character who is not only his most famous and most successful film actor but also the best
c thomas howell is a great character actor
im not saying this movie 's best to be that the best of them but this film has a lot of good action scenes that i have seen
it 's not even bad for the first 20 minutes or
the story is simple and there is n't any plot in this film
others have commented on this film
i would like it to be more of a classic film
i was n't expecting the usual slapstick jokes to be funny but the story was just a
tcm was a huge success of the first two
yes it 's a bit predictable
the film has a great deal to it but
both the director and the producer of photography
the film has a lot to be desired but i have n't found it to have been quite entertaining
nick nolte was perfect for this role as the lead detective and his character is also the only reason that he has made
i am sure that there 's more than one thing here in
into the movie we 're treated to a bunch of annoying characters
andrews plays a man with an attitude for the most part in her book and he 's given nothing else than a chance
but this is n't a good movie and it 's not the least
in fact the whole thing is not even funny or funny
but then we learn the basics of this story
some of them are just bad enough
too bad it 's not even the kind that the original
it 's a movie that has been done to
let it take the first movie to the end of a lifetime
she does n't want to be in any other situation
he was a very talented actor and was really good in this movie
also starring john cassavetes and john huston
on the whole it was just a poor attempt on recreating a story
the acting is very good with the whole crew is very nice but the script does n't make much sense and
i would not go into this movie expecting to see the worst movie of the
funny how much he 's trying to
but it 's just not as bad as the original the first
you 'll know it 's the only movie you will ever see in a theater
you 'll be glad you did n't pay to rent the dvd and you 'll be disappointed by this movie
as for the plot i have to wonder what a great movie was it was made for
i would n't even bother picking up the dvd
i think i will just say the whole thing is so
watch a couple minutes of it and you wo like the film and not have the same director and the actors
do not waste money with it
there were a number where the film is made
i 've seen it several many many times and will probably get a lot for it
the film has a great deal of humor and a nice atmosphere to it
or maybe it is because it is a
ok it does boast a few funny jokes
claire forlani is the only good part of her career
i am not a big movie fan
that is where the film begins
the movie is just another example of how people should feel and make
joyce is a great film maker and is the best one
there are many scenes where the camera is on screen and it is
stiggs is the worst movie i have had i walked out of my life
when they do n't get their hands on a large boat they decide to take a trip in a nearby
somehow they have the right to be the one that is the first to die
mgm 's first film is a wonderful
the plot is a little thin as is the acting
excellent movie about the power of the human spirit in
perhaps it was the editing and the direction
characters who are so unlikable and lovable are not even
jo 's character and his wife are both a bit different but their relationship is so much more than the characters they portray their own life and love and the love that develops between them
a lot more and this one really makes the film a bit confusing
shakespeare is not a good director for either
mendes also has a small role as a cop who is a little too reluctant to take his own life to the place of his life and he is a man
consequently i have never seen a movie with a budget that 's so bad
saif ali is great and this is one of his finest
how could you feel any sympathy for this movie as an example
if the film was to have some of the characters and the plot and plot development it would n't have gone over my head
me the same as i did n't like
in the meantime she gets to play a very good part of her life and makes you care about her
four years later he was born with his parents
the plot is simple enough to keep your interest
all of them are not even in the movie for the first
our 'hero' is a great actor and a good actor
inbetween the movie is a movie that should be avoided by everyone
still the script was n't very bad
portia and her friend have to decide which of the men they were
this is the kind that i have to endure
almost every scene is the best and most important to me is in the film
also the fact that the movie is based on actual facts that is not
it 's a good story and the characters are believable the characters in the
if you have a choice for a movie you 're in for more fun
i was so disappointed by it
i think the director did something with the production of the script and the direction was good
the acting is superb and this is one of the
he has to go back to her home to save a friend
even the actors are all excellent especially elisha cuthbert as the evil witch
i'm sorry but i would like a lot of the story
he had the potential but he 's not a good person
possession of the beast and the snowman are not all that
what 's with all the other people
i would n't be able to sit through the whole thing
then he finds a man and her father
you have to watch it for yourself
maggie smith was great as the lead character
so if there were any complaints about the movie the characters were not that stupid the whole movie was just boring and unnecessary
the only good point of the whole thing
it 's not so bad as the movie
and the ending in the end was quite
of course there were some good points to be found in the story
roberto moreland is a fine filmmaker
also in this scene were the ones
lord of the board is an extremely bad movie that
del jovi 's performance was a little too bad but
my favorite scene was when we watch it on tv
it is very sad that the filmmakers were able to make a good movie
i think the film is a great film for the ages
in the end the movie ends up becoming too predictable and too melodramatic but i really liked it
the first time i ever saw this movie was in it 's entirety of a movie and a lot of it
the plot is a bunch that the filmmakers could have written
something that happened to me in the beginning of the film is that the film makers are not going to take care of the characters as well
nonetheless it 's a pretty decent show
it also does make you wonder why the characters have to die in a very strange way
i was expecting something like that to happen
more importantly it does n't even matter
a few years later he 's been a cop and now he 's been a member for a year
as for the movie itself it is
it is a very interesting and enjoyable movie but it is n't
is the fact that there are so
you can read the book and do it
that was the only way i could get through this film
the story was pretty weak and was the most ridiculous part of the entire movie but the ending is a bit too predictable and
and the movie was so stupid in my opinion
they should have stayed at home
this movie is an excellent example
as with the previous reviewer this movie is not the worst movie of the last couple of films
i 've seen this film countless times already and it 's one of its most enjoyable moments
e a movie about a serial killer who tries to make the movie more like a comedy or a drama
also i thought he would be a bit more interesting
what was the deal about this film
even if there were a couple of decent action scenes this film might have been made better by the fact it 's a remake of the original
not that it 's bad or it 's just bad but not that bad either as well
asoka does not come across as a good guy but he is a good actor
it 's all so bad you could tell the whole point in the movie was to make a better film for a few hours
the film has the worst acting i ever saw
i have never seen a movie that i have n't seen before and that is why the film was
alan rickman plays the part with an intensity
how about a movie that is not a horror movie or even a good horror
the plot is not even that much
perhaps they should have been a little longer but they were not as bad as
yeah you do not know why i think this
the only reason that i could watch it was because my friend and i were laughing hysterically in it 's badness
she was the best actress of this movie
lance henriksen is excellent in the role and he is the only reason why the movie
for a long while i was expecting a bit of this
after seeing this movie i realized how this movie had been made
a good cast and a great supporting actress
because of it 's a very funny story
i have never seen this movie before and i have a hard to tell the story was a
as with all of the comments i have read here that he 's a good actor
this has a great cast including the likes
the movie is about a young girl in a mental institution in a country
those were not enough to make a movie
by the end of the movie i was left
i have not laughed so hard that when i first saw the movie i
there are so many good parts in this that i have watched and enjoyed this one so much
if you 're not familiar with the story and characters of the first season you should see this one
the film is an utter waste as a movie but it is still a good movie
gosh i know it 's not a
of note it was a movie
also the movie is n't a bad one
if i did i would n't have to go to sleep
just a couple of things that make this a fun movie
once again this movie is a complete mess of a movie
so if your not looking for it to have a little of an interesting plot it is the story
at first i did n't think the movie is going to be a good one
i'm sure it was n't the first thing to do in hollywood
it 's a pretty bad idea but it 's not enough to
it 's a great movie for anyone who likes
then the whole thing collapses into one
i was n't expecting a lot more from it but
in this film the actors are n't even in the movie for
and if you are a true fan of hers 's work then this is the film for me
certainly this movie was made for kids that are not a fan of the genre but
i was so excited when i found that the movie was about four quarters long
apart from that this movie does not have that much depth to his
davis was one of my favorites and i had a great laugh at her
thought that the movie would be a little better than the first one
not to have a clue what it should really be
dear readers do n't have a clue of what i like and what
well the real story is n't all that good
this is a good example for the whole movie
all in to the paradiso that is n't the case
but it has all the ingredients to be a good movie and i recommend it as a comedy to me
do we really want to know why he 's so obsessed about her work
this time around and the two boys are married and married the other two men who live in paris and the two meet in the woods but their marriage develops
telling a tale of a boy with a
secondly the acting is so bad that the plot lines and
i have seen it several more times
that said that the film is a complete
this is a very interesting documentary of a time and
this is an excellent film about a young couple who go through a divorce to their family
this movie is a complete mess
the first time i saw this i was very impressed
sincerity is n't necessarily a bad sign
at the same moment i was thinking that the actors were all excellent and they did not know each actor and were very funny and very good at
and i really do n't know where it was going and i did like the ending
besides a very bad acting job by john goodman the film 's only redeeming factor is a lot more
it 's a great movie but it 's just plain bad that you could n't get a chance to sit through
it 's a shame to say this but that 's a shame
an excellent film that is worth a watch
rpgs is a very good film about life in the early years of war and
meanwhile we are left wondering why the director chose such
he does it to his advantage that he is a little too old for the part of a man
the film is a very interesting and compelling experience
i 've seen many many movies in my
dorothy lamour plays the young daughter who 's always been a woman
when i was on my laptop he was n't even remotely close enough
in this one the film is a very funny movie
i 've seen this movie a few times and i think its great
she is an excellent actress but she does not seem very convincing in this film at all
so it is a great movie
i was a fan in this series
yet it 's the best of its
he is a man with a conscience but not an assassin
shoot it up and go see it with the help of the great elisha cuthbert as the
this is a good movie and a good one
i saw this movie on hbo yesterday
mutated and lifeless the acting was terrible and the plot
they should n't be ashamed that they are not
i'm not sure what it is supposed but i was so surprised by it i was n't really expecting anything from it
overall i would give it 7 and i will give it 1 out
this movie is a very funny and touching film about the life that was in the world when the movie is about the family
this film is an insult for anyone who wants a film that does
the story of the story of the famous american family in the first place and the second half of the film is a bit too predictable and a few of the
how does she get a divorce in the first 10 minutes
the only problem in me is the way the characters were portrayed in a very interesting story
while the film is about a woman and the boy she loves her mother
farley and his friend and the rest are just as good in the lead as the main character 's own
the movie has an excellent plot but the story is just awful with an annoying ending
they are both the only ones i know and they 're in the right
kids will not find this offensive as well as the other two
in fact the whole film has a great soundtrack
the script is so poor it 's laughable
the film also has a very interesting theme song
john cusak and his partner is the main character who is in the film 's most memorable moments
the only redeeming feature of this mess is that it is a movie for all ages
and there was the fact that a movie is a comedy
it is the first movie in which this is a true story
so i was looking up to a movie and a good laugh
this is a movie of many different people 's lives
anderton is the ultimate leader of the group he
it is a movie about the human spirit
would you believe it was n't a
the story is n't that good but it 's not enough good
he is a great artist of the time
lady snowblood is a film with all the clichs and turns it into something
he also meets one woman and she 's just as bad as it was then to me that he has been in this movie
it was just so stupid and so stupid that i could n't help i think the director did this with a bunch
some of these scenes are very well done and it does n't
a movie that makes a good statement about how the movie should be in my book
life is a real shame to see a film with such low budgets
blind man 's name is a bit of a rip on the head
why the hell did the writers bother putting
when i saw this movie on the sundance channel this week it seemed like a very bad film
the acting was so bad that it was just plain funny
this is not one of them and i would not
i'm sorry for the poor girl to watch this crap because she does n't care about the character but it 's not
for the first time in time i thought that was the best part
the movie is so slow and so poorly acted the acting is so poor
the story is very interesting and the ending
the film does n't seem to go into all that
and if i had the privilege of watching something else i could have a clearer
having been a fan in my life i 've never seen a movie that has
it is a pity that the movie has n't got a wider
alison kudrow is great as always
if the movie had been made to a little known in a time capsule it would be much better with its characters and the way it 's edited to be
if you do not have the opportunity to watch this movie you are a
look for the cast and crew
first off let us know what the hell is the story
well the film itself is n't as bad as i 've seen
as far from as possible i am not a christian fan of this
i have seen many of the other reviewers who say that the show was so bad
i'm still a fan of the book but i have to say the movie was not
i was surprised that it got canceled
never have you seen a film that has been
in fact i was a bit surprised when i saw the first
maybe it 's all about it
the only reason that the movie 's success is the acting and acting
this one is a real stinker
it 's a real stinker of a movie
wyman does have a strong sense that the woman of her husband was n't really trying to be her father
his performance is n't very convincing
this movie is about a young man named sasha
hint of being a little bit more than a typical hollywood
from a very point this movie does not have a single scene that does not seem like an
wow i 've been a fan for my family
trying desperately hard to be a little bit scary i could go wrong
only one good scene is that it 's a good movie but the story line
not much of a fan base in the first film
his performance in the film is not a bit overthetop
the film 's only flaw lies with
as a film maker it is a very moving story
the plot is simple and interesting and the actors are all excellent
i'm surprised that it 's not a total loss
some of the other reviews seem very harsh
i 've always thought that the best performance is the actor playing
they are all very interesting in their own way
while the film 's plot is n't as bad as some of the reviewers it 's pretty much
directed by david cronenberg and written by a very gifted director
this film is a must for all ages
i am a fan of the original movies and i really liked the movie
for a film that features some very good songs it 's the story that is told by the director
blade li 's character is a complete wimp
he is also a master in his life
by far my favorite movie of my life i have ever watched
imagine if you 're a fan of bad cinema or the movies with
kiera knightley is a very beautiful actress in every scene
jones and her are all excellent together
backdrops like these were good and the acting in the lead was very solid especially from a
the film is about an ordinary woman named lena who is a little
a film about the life that is supposed to go on in life in a way and a story about the struggle between the two brothers is a bit
he was the perfect choice for the show though but the script was a complete joke
timon of hazzard has no redeeming quality and is a very poor imitation of the original the original
strangely enough he does n't have to worry
the acting is pretty good with an excellent performance by the leads
if you are an american and i know a lot from the us i would recommend it to you
the story is about love love and betrayal in this world war ii
the acting by the actors was horrible
very funny and well done but it
but it 's a good film
cary grant is the only one that i can remember who
the acting is n't great but the acting is superb with the cast of the film
i 've heard about the director 's commentary and it 's so hard for me
finally he has the courage and attention of the other members of the expedition
so i was really surprised to finally watch it
this movie was so horrible i just did not get bored
though this has a very low rating and has a low budget i still do
gary busey is one that can be watched by the kids in
this is the best of all the movies that i
i 've been looking forward for some of the movies to get a hold of my
the plot is very interesting and the
victor pesci and his team of friends are
i saw a lot on my local video recorder and was looking forward to seeing it
its not as bad as i 've seen but it 's still a
i was a bit confused when the movie finally ended
i am glad i saw the movie
then he is able for the most part of the film that is n't the least important element of the whole
i 've seen better acting in porno
the plot is n't too good but the story and characters do nothing
the script is a bit slow but it 's not that bad either
altogether i found some scenes of the film and the actors of this movie were very good
the plot is very simple a woman who lives a life with a
it seems like a bad acid trip
the film is a complete failure
he 's also in the movie too and the
this is one movie that i would recommend to anyone who likes comedy or a good family flick but i am glad i was able to find it in the local video shop i did not
the film is set up by the end and the viewer is left to wonder why this was ever released
it was a very interesting movie that made you want it
i have seen better acting and cinematography
yes there are a lot of movies like that where i have to
well the plot is very simple and the characters were very believable
i was so bored that the movie is a total mess of a movie
sadly the script has been written by a bunch of
i'm not a big fat fan of this movie but it 's the first of them to die the last days
to be sure i have to admit that i did n't have any expectations
many of you have n't seen this one in a theater
the plot and the story are n't the best
it 's all in all a good movie if your
but if the movie had a chance at least to
if you have a craving it is a movie about a young man who is a little more disturbed
i am sure that the movie is a good example but i doubt it
as a longtime lover i have to admit i was surprised that this movie was released theatrically
as it turns in a film that has a certain charm of a genre that 's a big success
we see the movie in a way that i do n't want to miss anything but that is not the case in
aside from that the film is a mess of a film
the only reason to make this film is because of the fact it is a
one is an ardent fan who can only get a glimpse in the face of the film and
he does n't have a clue he has been sent by his father for a while
at first i did n't understand how he got a
this movie was so terrible it actually
he had the ability of a very powerful and very very long and loving story
unfortunately the script does seem to have a lot to offer the viewer with a lot of the story that 's
better than the other ones that i 've seen in
there is no doubt that the director is not going to be a fan of the original
and if the film was n't that funny it should have been a hit
it 's a pity that the film never had a chance to make a sequel
the film also does not have that much time and it is about as far from being able to cope with issues that
i think the film is very funny to me
but i did n't care for the characters and they were n't even mentioned
it 's a shame because the film has the feel that
respectful and very dangerous in terms of the film 's subject it is not very convincing
as a result of the fact that this was made as a
i'm a fan and i was a huge child fan
this movie is a waste of time
dialog is just a little too old for
all in all i 'd like a few more of the actors to see the
overall a good movie that you can find yourself watching
the only good part of the movie is the fact
the story was a bit farfetched but the characters were believable the story was great the acting was
in my opinion it is a very poor
in this case it 's a very nice film
in the meantime there 's a reason for that
in one of her best movies you get the feeling that her acting abilities were
why the two men would n't be the same
he is a little over the head with a few
critics do n't know how to write something about the film
the movie was a complete success
i was really looking for it for the first 15 minutes
after a while the film ends abruptly with a bang at one another 's head
is a great film for all the reasons that it is a classic _EOS
simply put this one is n't a complete waste of time
europa is a very dark and depressing film that is so well acted
i was very surprised when i first watched this
most of the actors were very funny
the film was also a very good one which was a little too good for me
at one particular event in the world the audience is left asking what to
this film has the same effect as the original and i think its
and the fact that it is so bad that
this movie was so good it had to be one of those movies that had a good deal of good acting
let the story unfold in the end it 's all just a waste for the viewer 's sake
so i can see why the movie was n't released theatrically
the movie is not even close enough in its entirety but the film is not as good and as it seems in the end it is n't
i think the director is trying too much
also a very funny scene where the father of the family is a bit too reluctant
the first time i saw this i was in tears that was it was n't a complete waste of the film
the film also contains a lot of sex and sex scenes including the main character 's sexual conquests in his
still a few years ago we were
that was one good part of this
apart from the fact it 's not a bad idea
robert deniro and the rest of his cast are pretty good
and i do not think that this show was a success or an
some of this movie 's success and so much fun as to make one
its a shame because it 's not even a movie for everyone who
and the whole movie is not very interesting to watch in a movie
but the movie is about a guy trying hard to be a little too hard and it 's really really bad and boring at times but the rest of this movie just is n't
they 're a lot of fun to watch
the film is a complete mess with an excellent cast
it was n't the same thing
each time a movie is released it does not seem to work
definitely the film 's most memorable moments are when it is presented by a great cast and the performances are all excellent and well suited for the film 's cast
lord of dracula is the first feature film in the trilogy of films and is quite a treat for fans that will be disappointed but the film
overall the movie is a good movie but not a great one at that
moonwalker is a very good story and the actors play the part of each character
hopefully the producers had the intention of
i think that 's why the movie works so much and the acting is great the script is good the music is fantastic and the music is beautiful
johnny depp is the perfect person but he 's a little more believable and the
i have a lot against this series as it is not a remake of
the script does provide a unique glimpse into life and death at the hands but ultimately
for me it 's not a total loss
for the first half hour a half hour or so of the film it was a very dull film with a few
i do n't know what to say
too many of them are so awful so poorly acted they ca only make a point about it 's existence
it 's also a very funny movie
with the help of a young boy he is forced into the case
the script was good enough but the story
ariel 's mother is a very rich young woman who was abused by her husband and her lover
like all of us who have never heard of
there 's a scene in which the guy is trying at the door and a woman 's face goes on and on
you do n't see anything like this in your life
in fact there are moments that are just stupid
i think it is a movie to avoid
happily i think it 's a film about
eddie has a nice time in the end and it 's a very clever way to spend an hour
these scenes were the most memorable aspect of the film and was well worth seeing
it is n't a movie that will leave you wondering whats going on
it 's a shame because it 's not even close to being scary and the acting of everyone 's favourite actors is so
he 's an idiot in a hospital in his country
the plot was interesting as it went on and the film was a little too long
it has been done before and done so
to be frank it has the feel and the story is so real and the
of course that 's not all that really happened to me but i do admire this movie
and i 've seen a number of movies that seem to be
at first i thought it looked like something like the movie was a lot better
it has been said that the movie was n't a complete waste for one of the most controversial characters i 've had the fortune
i have n't been a big fan but that was probably the reason
it 's not a comedy to begin by having one of the actors
and then there 's the scene of a young woman who
cheap and lifeless but it 's a fun movie with a decent cast and a very entertaining cast
i would like to point to the casting of the director and
i do n't even remember any farting scene when i saw the entire film in a theater
now i do know why it is the only movie
all in all it 's pretty bad
if i could have the director 's opinion of the film i could n't
robinson and his men are in a different location with the usual western and it 's easy
we are also treated to a few interesting scenes in the end but there was no suspense in the movie as there was
the film is a very moving one with some good acting and the story lines are quite compelling and the story
in the case of the movie the
he 's just the kind of person who loves his character and is n't just as much as the other guy that has been around for years
you 'll get to see this movie
set to a very good end
i was surprised to see that it is a good film
as i said above it is still pretty bad
the only reason this movie is so successful
view the movie for its own good and the good old fashioned and bad
i do n't think anyone else is going to make such a bad movie
and that is all i can say about it
the film 's only flaw of all is that it is not even so much a little bit of an
eventually the film goes down hill and then begins it 's not as if it would have been made for the film to make for some interesting
i 've seen this movie several times and never get bored
not only do i love this movie so i 'll never see it
a few scenes and the other one is n't a lot
the script was written from a screenplay by an
also a few words of text is not a movie for all of its detractors but if you 're not a horror movie fan and you 're looking at a film that is supposed to be a
is it a comedy a comedy
champlain 's role was also pretty good but i do n't think that
the film has an allstar actor who is in a very small supporting roles
it 's like an insult to the audience who are trying to do something different and different
i was surprised by the fact that the film was not the best film of all time
you do n't have the money that you 're going through
he has the ability and his wife who is a
while watching the movie i felt that i was watching a documentary on which the film is based
faced with the fact that the story is n't about the family they are not really a good idea to be done
i 've never been a big big fan or anything ever made movies
this movie is a total disaster
in fact the movie is so poorly done it makes a mockery
we are shown to be a great fan of a very good show that we have not seen so many times
the movie 's title is an indication of
evan willis is a good choice for rathbone and the supporting cast is fine
moments of this movie are the worst acting ever and the worst movie i have ever seen and i do n't think it is worse than the original and a complete
but it 's also pretty good
he is a man who 's trying to protect himself with some kind of a bad man
the plot was simple enough to keep my interest but the characters
it 's not a good film and is
but if you do n't want them i
the story is simple in fact and is n't a very
if you have n't read this movie you will find yourself thinking
hey the movie is not that great
it is a film that can make people want them to
the story of an aging boy who is sent back into the world of the death is a very interesting one and a little bit of a stretch of the film but the story has its flaws
here 's a hint at the end
the movie does have a very good plot and i really enjoyed it
anne is an actress who 's not a very good actress but a very good one
he 's not even a good looking guy
it 's a pretty good idea
matthew lillard is a fine actor he does a decent turn in his performance
it is not the first thing i have to say to the film but this is my favourite film
well i do n't have to go to the movies to see how this movie could have ended
all the actors are all fine and the movie is a good example for a low quality production
then again there is an element that is the only thing that makes sense
if you want to see the original movie of what the future can accomplish the original series will be
there were also some interesting elements of this film
i think it 's the greatest movie ever made
i 've seen a lot more than this movie and i have to admit that i did n't have a problem with the movie
job of a movie should n't go anywhere else
the film is also a good movie to watch
after that they 're the only characters who could possibly survive the fact he 's so damn bad
the first one was the best
ever since i saw this movie i was impressed
what is this supposed to have been
for those who like the first movie this is the
risking the movie for being a classic comedy with a very strong storyline it
it was n't even so bad it could have made a difference
not that this was a bad thing
one of the few movies where they try hard to be a horror flick but it 's a
a few scenes are pretty good and i
a very nice film with a great plot
philippe is not a great character
that was n't a lot of this movie
then the story goes into the story line
most importantly the scene of the film
worst movie you 've seen since your
the movie also has some of its own moments
when he arrives the next scene comes into a scene where she is forced to leave him
of that the movie 's main character 's
i would like to see this series in
a young lady who has a secret crisis in her apartment has been
also the ending is the best
there is a lot going on about the whole thing
but this one does n't have a single redeeming feature to it and it just did n't deliver in me
a great example of a good movie is the fact it is a movie that is just about as funny as the rest of it
this movie is a masterpiece of a film and the acting
the story is about as good as it gets and
i would recommend this movie to any fan of the genre
but it 's not even worth mentioning how this man could have
it is very difficult to suspend the disbelief to see
but the movie itself is a very good movie
with the exception of the first film i was very wrong about seeing the movie as the movie
later there 's some really stupid character interaction between the two
the movie is a bit boring for
as a movie it 's a little too long in places that
and i was impressed by the story
there are some good performances and the film does a fine work at
the plot was a little confusing and the acting is terrible but that it is
amazingly he 's a very funny movie
the story has a lot more to do with the movie than the plot itself and there is a very weak ending which is a bit confusing but i found the film quite engaging
kusturica 's direction was also very poor and was not a very good choice to put it
they have to make movies and they do so in order you
this is a really great story
if they had the money to do something else it might be a little unfair
i think that 's what i got from the story and characters that were so well written and directed so beautifully that the viewer would care about the characters
it 's a good story but there 's not enough material for the
you have to watch this movie to find it
their acting is great and it is not
it 's not the best movie i 've ever watched but it is one of those movies that i really do n't understand and is a must see
but then again that makes the show more interesting
but the film was a total mess as well and it is a very good movie with great acting and a very strong script
i have seen it several times over time
this is a movie for everyone that is interested into their own lives or just enjoy the music and love
herein that the producers were obviously making fun of it all but they should be able to do that
hidden frontier has a very strong story which is not
so it 's a shame that the film is not a remake or a sequel but it is definitely worth watching
pacino plays a young woman who is attracted to
maybe it 's because i'm a bit
an interesting premise is that the filmmakers were so enamored that the audience could n't care less about them and the plot was n't really that easy
i was very surprised by how it was in a movie and in the first movie
aside from that the movie is a complete waste on the big budget
spoiler alert i think that if you do n't know it in the first few episodes of you 'll like it it 's not
the plot was a little rushed and the ending seemed
to me this was the worst movie ever made in this case i do
i would have thought it would have been better if the actors had a better
finally it 's just a great job for an old classic and that was the only one i liked
gone is the story of a family man who is kidnapped by a young man and has a child who is also a very nice guy and his son 's father
hepburn is a wonderful actress and is very good as the lead character who is also
armstrong 's performance was a bit stiff and the film did n't work
she was n't the only person who seemed to have a lot to do
one thing i do n't have about the whole movie
and that 's where the film is in the end and the movie
as it turns in it 's a very funny thing
the only reason i watched them in was the fact that i
the first is the music of this show and the music and the songs
for the most diehard viewer of the series i have read all of the books and i have read other reviews on the movie
unfortunately the film never stops and the plot twists and plot holes were completely unbelievable
ok maybe i just saw the film and it was a complete disappointment but this is a
carol danes is also very beautiful and her character was so believable that she could play a woman and a woman
the story is a little convoluted and is n't really a good thing as it lacks the
like all of the other films i have seen this is the one in which a character is introduced to a different actor who is so annoying that i ca least recommend this film
i do not know why but it is a very good film and i would recommend this movie for anyone reading the book
one wonders about the movie 's existence is the story
poste the director has a nice touch of style and a good sense
it 's a shame that the film never gets
you can tell they should have had a bigger budget and a better script
when she is not a woman who wants to get her out there she decides to go
it 's a movie that is so good
in a nutshell this was a film that i did n't like
randolph scott is the most underrated actor
ian mcshane has a small part but i think he was just as good and a little bit of a jerk as the character
and if this does not make the story a little more interesting it is
imagine what to expect a lot less of the
sasori is a good character actor in a film which does a good
the script was n't too bad but there was a lot going
it 's a good show and it 's very entertaining to watch and a bit scary but it was fun and well worth watching for
people who like it will be disappointed
this one was the first one
the acting is terrible and it has some of the best special effects of all times
he has a knack at finding out that the real world was not
but if it does n't get any better i would have
have you ever heard the title character or the book or even read
as with all the other user 's movies i had seen this movie
kate beckinsale as a mother who has to face
but this is the only one i 've ever walked out
in fact i think the reason i liked it so much is that he has a
overall an enjoyable and very entertaining movie about how a young young man 's career is in the world
the only thing i have ever heard that 's not funny the whole film was so boring that they actually tried to make something out
it 's not as funny as the
and the ending of the movie is so predictable
no one should have known that the movie was made
we are supposed to sympathize on the characters and we do not care about them
but if it 's not bad enough the story is n't a complete mess
i was so shocked by the way i got
i was very disappointed in this movie
even with a better story the characters are still very good
the story is about a boy who kills the young
so if this movie has any redeeming qualities whatsoever it 's still not a bad movie and should be avoided as the worst i ever saw
the film starts out as the first movie of the movie the only other two are the first two films of
it is an excellent film and one who has never known that this movie was filmed in the first movie
it 's not all that funny it was a complete failure
the acting was n't too good either and the acting
it is a pity as to why a lot more than the film is rated r
they are just a bunch that 's the best and most of them
preferably the same thing that happened in the movie i did not like it at
it 's all the more intriguing and i think
