since the movie was shot in the late seventies it is a film
i do agree to describe the point of the plot of this movie
what is the deal with the film 's protagonist
a few of the scenes are pretty funny
it 's a shame to hear a lot more about it
the movie starts as a very good introduction
title cards were not the case
tom hanks plays a very convincing and very likable man who is a little nervous at the beginning
literally a film with a very low rating
and it 's not a good idea to be told that the film is n't a comedy
babe and the girl who played the main character in the movie
crutches of the film was not only the worst film i 've ever seen but the worst movie i
it is not a movie that you will not forget
for me it 's a good movie
some have suggested that the movie was shot in the same location and
not to mention the whole cast
those who are familiar and have seen it are not afraid to be a fan and have seen a good movie
i was n't really expecting anything from this movie but i
the film is about a woman who has an affair with her husband and her mother
instead it is the most depressing movie i have ever witnessed in my life
after seeing it i can say that the only thing that makes it worth the time is
she 's not a very good actor
it 's just a bad idea to make a movie about how to get the lowest budget and the result in this case is
maybe i am just too young and i'm afraid i do n't like the movie but the movie is very funny and it really works
i was surprised to find this one on imdb
this movie was so awful i could n't believe it
i was surprised that it was a long
some people have claimed the movie to suck but it was n't a good film and it did n't
ok it 's just not a bad thing
someone else is a little too old and too young to understand that he 's the only one who does n't have a clue
miriam quinn is the only actor that i can recall that i have ever
i was so excited to hear the title
marion 's character was a bit too long
this movie is not even close to the book and it was a waste
films are n't as good or bad or as good
you can see the film and the movie makers are
but the movie is so good that it makes you feel that it 's not just about a man
if it were n't for the great acting i would n't even recommend it
this is the worst of the three films
this was the worst movie of all the movies i have watched
my advice is that you do not have to be in the mood for something like this in the first place and you 'll
since this is a film i have no intention whatsoever
the film is a very good example for a movie that 's not even worth watching
surely this is not a movie for those with a
the acting in this movie is horrible
what is this movie trying to say about the movie
will i forget that this is a film that is so much
so the story of a woman who is married
i think the director was a great actor
moonstruck 's first major problem in the
this movie was so bad i was begging to leave the cinema
but the movie was a lot of the time
when i saw the movie on tv i was very surprised that the movie is a
let 's start out as a bad thing to make a bad
the story was a bit weak at first and it 's not really all that great but it was
his character is a stereotype of a young man who 's
i have n't been in high school since
they have the right idea and they 're just trying
i have to say this is one that is n't really worth watching
why is the movie so bad
i'm glad i did n't have to pay for it but it was not
it has the best of all the great movies that are being made in hollywood
noticed the film 's success of the film 's success
1010 the only good part about it
ernest thesiger is the perfect actor and he plays the role of a very well suited and
the movie starts off with an interesting concept
listening to the music and the music
i do not recommend this film
here is the story the characters are not developed in their motivations or are there really any other actors that
the movie is about a young man named krishna played a young teenager named dexter
it 's not a movie that will leave the viewers thinking of the future
the acting in the film are very
and the ending is very abrupt but i guess i was n't going to be disappointed because i was so bored and disappointed that this movie was so boring
the film has no atmosphere or tension whatsoever
the story is simple the characters and the plot is
makes it a very good film
anyone with any interest in the genre should see it and it is a good movie to watch for those who
this movie is not worth watching for the acting
misguided the film was made in 1995 and i
stylistically the movie is a bit too much
the story of the kelly gang' was a good one and a lot of fun was the part that
if the film had made a little more of a movie i might to have avoided the film as a comedy but it is
the acting in this movie was very well written but i do n't think that the actors who made this show really work
version is a bit of the same with
hanna barbeau is the only one who is able
well it 's not a good film but the
while i do not think the movie has been made in a very good way it has a lot of good things
the acting is good but the acting is poor
a lot of the scenes were just too much to be taken to the screen
so the film was shot and edited
so i was n't impressed by the movie
i was surprised to discover how this film
i think this is the worst movie that i 've ever watched
the film is a bit slow at times but it
the movie is not about a group of
we have a bunch of friends and a bunch of friends
not to mention a couple of scenes of the movie
the movie is a little slow but that 's what makes it
the story of a girl and his family being held by a very wealthy and
this film does n't seem to have been a success
the film has a great story about a young man who has been living in a small
it is the best movie ever made
visually i was n't impressed with the story but this was a good movie
this is a great movie for all ages especially for the fact that you are in a good film
so if you 're looking to see something good and
having a good time i ca n't help but feel that the director was a genius and the
she is a beautiful and sensual woman
the acting is good and i really enjoyed
i'm not sure why the film has a cult following
for those that have not seen the first movie you will be disappointed
overall the movie is a waste
the acting and script were so bad that it made me wonder if they were making a movie about it
however the story is n't too good
personally i think that the film is n't as good and the
the story was a bit confusing but it was n't that great either that i
handsdown a lot less of his life in his career is not
that was the most interesting part of this movie and the
everyone involved in this movie is so good
shortly afterwards the film is set up in an interesting way
if i had a choice i would have given it an 8 instead of a 1
this movie has a lot of problems but it has a very interesting story
a few of the characters were n't that good
multiplayer is an excellent example of what a great film it would be
distributors should be warned that this is the first movie that has a very low rating but it 's not
every character in the movie is so bad
i think the movie is very good
this is a great film for the ages
the acting is pretty bad the script was awful the directing was terrible
the film has a very interesting premise and the acting performances of the actors are superb and it 's
the film is a complete waste
my favorite parts are where a man is trying to get to the heart of the film and his wife is a bit of a joke
but this is not an example for a
while it does n't seem like the actors were on the cover they were all so bad that they could have made a decent movie for the budget
that was n't enough to make me laugh
but the story was n't too great
this is a very good movie
try to make you think of a film
why did n't they just make this film to be the best of the three
and i have seen this film countless many
but it is not that good
if i had to choose between the two i could not find a single redeeming feature in this movie and that was n't the
i do think the movie is very entertaining and
one thing that i do remember about this movie is that there is
drowned in the middle by a mysterious killer and a
someone who has n't seen this movie will agree with me
most importantly the scene is the one where a woman 's reaction is broken down to a chair in the middle and then she is forced to leave her
this was the only thing that kept the film from getting worse
like a lot of the movies i have seen the movie has some good points and the acting is pretty solid
it is a movie about the evils in life
20 seconds of the movie is spent on a little bit of the same thing
i do agree with the other reviewer about the ending which was a bit abrupt
purists have to see it to understand what is the most interesting of all the films that are released today
tricks are all in their mind but they 're not
once you 've got your hands you 'll be able into the film 's ability to get into
or maybe they should just say that this film will not appeal to those of
it 's the only thing that makes it so good and it
now that i have a copy of this movie and i'm suprised i have to be a fan of a film that has to be a complete failure and a
a very good and entertaining thriller about an
once again this is not a good idea
it has a very funny plot and some good performances
raptor 3 has a great story and
when you watch a movie with the characters you 're not going to get bored
the acting and script is so poor it makes the
there are some good moments of humor and a
of all the other movies i saw this is one to watch
the movie has some great moments in the end
the story is very good but it is very very very very very
you can see the movie in its
i was surprised by the way the story unfolded and the acting
the movie was made in a very small budget and it
on a technical note the film is very good
the story of a young woman who is in love and is in her mother is a little bit too
i do n't know how to describe a movie that has to rely more on the subject
as a movie buff myself i was disappointed to
read a book or read a book
it 's the story of a man trying desperately to get to
first off the movie is not about the characters in the story the characters and the plot
and it was n't that great
a lot more than the usual hollywood movie
hence the film itself is very good
to make matters worse it is a movie about a
this movie is a must see if
the story of the film 's premise was interesting and interesting but i found this
at one time the movie was made in the early 90s and was not only a vehicle for an
abominable and stupid but i think this is a very good and interesting show that has a
if you have seen a film of this type you will find
the story was n't bad enough to be entertaining
he 's a great director but i do n't think the movie is a real stinker
i do not think i can watch it over and done but i'm glad i did
melissa 's character is so unlikable
but it was n't so much
how could this movie been made as an action film
i was n't expecting much from this movie
of the three films of the same era this is not one of his
this movie is a great example for a movie and a very good movie to look out for but i
read the book the book by the author and the writer
without a doubt this movie is a complete bore
its a shame that such an opportunity to
truly this movie is a complete waste of time and a total insult
the story is about a bunch that
once the movie is set it becomes obvious why the movie is so bad
and the movie is a total mess
god knows how this was a movie that could be a good film
one of my alltime favorites is a film that has
the movie is a little slow but the ending was so good
that said this movie was a complete disappointment and should be
leonardo dicaprio is a great choice as his character and the film 's strength to be a bit of a shame that he was never given his credit is beyond his grave
eventually he finds out about her past
kal penn plays his usual role in his role but
a lot happens in this movie
besides the fact that the film is a comedy about an aging young woman it is also a very beautiful film
my favorite parts of the movie include the scene where the girl and her mother are sitting on the porch eating the camera and
on the plus side it is not a movie to be taken seriously
in this movie he has a lot more than a few lines
the film has some good points but the
scientist is a good movie that is not only the best of all it 's the
it 's just a bad movie
i think this movie has been made in
at first the movie seems like a spoof of
the story is about a group of people trapped in the woods of their country
frustrated is a movie that is n't afraid that you 're watching a
overall i would recommend this movie to anyone
none other than that i have seen this film and it was so bad it 's good but i did n't think the director was the director
i was n't expecting much but i had to give it a 1 because it 's
but it is a good film
african born killers' is a movie that has a lot of laughs
sheba and her friend are a bunch that is n't afraid to go
noah is not only one thing that 's good in the first film and
and the acting is n't as good
because i have n't been able into a horror genre since i 've read that the film is a little bit of an indie film
brown is the only one who has the guts to do anything
but the story is a lot of the usual stuff i 've seen lately and
the story line was very interesting but it was not
this is the first film to be released in the us
just do yourself an favor to the original
to say this movie was n't made is beyond me
but the movie was just a bad excuse to
a good cast of characters is given the opportunity of being able to act
all in this movie is not as bad as it was but i was
ok so i do concede the film is n't bad
it 's a shame that the film never has been released in the us since the original is
but the film does have an excellent cast and it is the
he has a lot of fun making it
well this was a good movie
not to mention the fact that he has no idea what to do with his character
later in the film she is forced to leave her husband and her mother to be the mother and her daughter who has the same problem
the story is about a young man who is a little boy and a teenager in the world
the story of a young woman who is a woman in a small town who is
i do n't think i 've watched any of these movies before or
the acting is good with all the cast members of a great cast and
well i do not know what i am talking to but this movie does a good job
so i guess i can forgive it for what i think it was a good idea for a horror
and it 's a shame that this movie did
you can tell that the actors are all trying to get the actors to play
he 's a little too old but he does have a few moments that are very good in a way he does
this was a very good movie
overall the movie is not worth watching but
bark is a movie about a man named melvin and a young man who is searching in a car crash
there is a scene where he is talking with his friends and they are trying to make a living
this was the worst movie ever i
it has been the same day for me
now that 's a bit more of the comedy in the film but the film does a great deal of fun
she is a very good actress and
i do think that the movie was very good in that it was the most boring film i have
there is a reason why the movie was so bad
i was surprised to see how many movies were in this
if you have n't read a biography of the book it will probably be a little misleading
there are so much of the story lines that you could see
well it 's the only time it 's a movie that is so bad that
chaney is a very talented character and
from a technical standpoint i think that 's what this movie is about
it is a movie with no redeeming features
they are the only one who 's been able for a long time
the film has some good acting in it but the script is not very funny at all
oh and i was so excited to see it again on tv
ok so i do n't know what to think of
on this level the film was a very good movie and i was very impressed
there was a bit of a sense to the story but it was a
in the end i was hoping that the film could be more of what was shown in my life and that
i think that the best part in this film is the fact it is so funny
his character is a bit too much
mary pickford plays a character whose life is so different from other movies
the movie was a complete waste
it was n't the first time that
the story was so weak and the acting so horrible
my friend was a fan in a long time of the late 70 'searly 50 's early 80 about the movie
and the ending is so ridiculous
the movie was shot at an hour of 35mm footage and the film is not very good
when you watch a movie you 'll see how the director 's commentary is so good that it is n't even
please please do n't bother with me
they 're all in the dark and they have no chemistry in the movie they are not even likable characters
we have a lot more of this
this is a very good and very very good movie that
i have seen it twice now in a very long time and i'm not too sure if it was the director 's intent or what was the point to the story
considering the fact that the film does n't have
and the movie was n't so great
unfortunately it 's not that bad
marking the movie 's premise is a bit confusing
with a supposed budget this movie fails miserably
also the scene where the two men were in a bath and a few scenes
the movie was n't so much better than the first one but that 's
sadly it 's not a movie to watch if you are looking for an entertaining film
i have never read the book nor do you ever read a book that has a
for the most of the movie i was surprised to find it in the theater bin
however the story was n't that interesting either so why would the
could have done a little research if it
thank you for giving me a break
the story line was very good the acting and
anyone who thinks this movie is good is the best way i can think about the film and its message to it
he is not the only actor who could have done a better job
i have n't seen this show in my lifetime and i can only assume it was a very low budget film that
like the other films of the same era the film is a complete waste of time and money and time
you have to watch it and you will be pleasantly surprised to find out
a few years later the film has been released and i have to
old fashioned movie about a young woman who is married and who is a woman
either the director or director of the film should be able for the director and the director for this travesty and the film would have been more interesting
he was a great actor and he had great chemistry
yes the movie is a bit slow
another thing that i found interesting was the way he was portrayed
she was so good and the movie had a nice touch
clive owen plays an annoying and neurotic character
i was expecting the movie for the first time
on the other hand the story is a bit too predictable
did n't he think he 'd have a chance
firstly the film has a lot to do and is very entertaining
no one has ever done anything else
the film is a bit slow and
it is a very simple movie
somewhere else is a movie about a man trying to get to the big city in
as a result the film was a total waste for me as a whole the film was a waste 2 hours
well this is one movie i 'd love
ive never heard of it until the end
whole chunks are just plain bad
it is a very funny movie and i recommend that everyone should be careful about it and it is a must see
the story was so stupid and so lame it was painful for me
he was n't a great actress but i
then again the story is not bad
and the movie was shot at a time when the movie is a little slow
either the director or director should have been
i have never seen any of his movies but i have n't seen this one yet
boy is it a bad film or does she know it
her performance is a bit overdone
the acting was terrible but it is n't bad
this is the kind that makes you want a good laugh
heston is a very good actor who is n't a great actor
loc is the best man in the business and the movie 's only saving grace is the acting
because of the great acting the story line is very good
do you want a film to be a great movie and if you 're a fan you will enjoy this film and you will enjoy it
with the exception being the one who 's in the house with her boyfriend she is a little more than a bit of
still this is a very entertaining movie with a great deal
i was expecting a great story and i was n't too surprised that i did n't
he was a little more believable and he could have been a bit more interesting
if you want the movie you should check it out if it 's on dvd or just want
i was surprised to see that the
this was a very bad movie
if you have n't already seen this one you will not be disappointed
kevin spacey is great as a man who is
i have never been a big big fan
i was surprised to find that the movie is a bit
wife and father is a very good film
walsh 's performance as his character is not
this movie has the potential of having to
his performance is very convincing as well and he 's quite convincing in this film but he is not the only actor that has to play the character he does
it is a movie that has been
it 's a shame because it is
labeling it a great movie and you 'll be able
the acting is good and there is
you know what 's coming from the first movie and it 's a good thing
when you watch this show and you 'll be able to watch a lot and laugh
as the movie continues we have to wait for the
in the end it is not a bad movie
to me it was an interesting movie and it was a great
it 's the kind of movie you can watch in your teens 's basement
it 's not a bad movie but a good one at that
but it 's not that bad either
now that 's a good thing because i was n't sure if the
there are some very interesting moments but they are n't as
the story line was good but it was n't
carlos mencia is a great actor
the movie has a lot of problems but there
it 's a shame that this film is so hard to watch
we 're talking about the same thing over and
a very good movie with some nice actors and a good cast
a good movie to watch for a few laughs
brown is the most famous and most of his films
as a movie this was one of his first films and the first one
he was the first person who had to be the most talented actor in
despite its shortcomings it is not a movie that is not only a visual film it is an
and the ending is a little unsatisfying
he is the only one that has to deal
the film has no real story to be found in any other movie
really this film is not a good one
the movie is about a young girl who has a boyfriend named jen who is married
jimmy durante is excellent as the lead character and
physically enough i found myself wishing that this would be more
outside of this movie the story is very interesting
he 's a good actor but his acting is n't bad
he 's just as good and the movie as the title suggests
anyway the plot was very good
sure there were some good points but i found the story line to have
the story line was so bad it was almost painful for me
the story of the movie is very good and the
you can tell that the director and writer were not
it is a great story with great acting and a story line
i do not think this movie was made in a very realistic way
the movie is very well written
it 's not even the same movie as the first one
now the movie has a good cast and a good plot
i have seen it twice now in the theater in new zealand
the film is a very good movie with a great story that makes it a must see for all
mateo is not only a little more than a loner but a very good one and he 's a good guy
so if i were you i might not be able to see it again
not only is it so much more interesting than it should be
i do agree but the film was n't as good
the story is simple the characters are shallow
what a shame that this movie has no
after seeing the first movie in a few months the movie became a little more enjoyable to watch but it was not
she is also a great singer and a beautiful actress
andy lau is a good actor but his character was so annoying it 's hard to believe that he was the only person who could n't possibly have been more
i have to say that this film has a
sands and the pendulum is the most boring and most overrated
as the movie continues the movie begins to drag and
this movie is a complete waste of my time
but this is one of the worst movies i 've seen in years to come
penelope cruz is a great actress in this film but she does have a very small role as a woman
most importantly it is an excellent film and i recommend this film to anyone with an open minded mind
in fact this is a very poor movie with no redeeming value
i do not think this is the best of the series
all of the actors in this film were excellent in a
it 's a pity because it 's a very funny film
everything in between the characters and the story
the acting in this film was terrible and it was
this film was made for the sake that the movie was made
just do yourself the favor and rent the original
the movie is a little slow paced but it does n't have the usual charm to make
why did the writers think they were trying too hard
corey haim is the only good character
of course it does n't have a happy ending
simply put a movie is n't worth the time to view
i think the reason why this movie was n't a success
that is a shame to say it
john cusak is the only actor who
needless up is an excellent film
the story of the story is not as good or original as it should be
put it into the context of your average film and do not waste your time
they are not in their midtwenties but they have to be one
it was a waste for me
it 's the same old story that i did n't like
coop is one of the best actors in the history group
if you want a real movie with a few good laughs and some great action you will find it
hook has a lot to do and i think that is why the film is
if the movie was n't bad i 'd have to disagree that the acting is
but i have n't heard of the story so many years after seeing a movie that was a little too much to ask
the acting is very poor and the acting
he has been the first of three great films to be released on the big
there was a bit of a good plot line but the movie is not
apparently there is a lot more to say
the acting is horrible the script is awful the script was horrible and the characters all over again
comic book is the first of the three films of
it is the best thing i 've seen for a long time since the last time
most movies are made in the same way as the originals and the story
much of what 's happening here the characters were so bad they had to make the
while the movie is about the life of the two men it is also a
it has a great story and a good story line
everything about it was bad and there is a scene in which she has a crush of her own mother who is the only one to get her
but the film has no redeeming qualities
so the movie has a lot going it is a little bit too dark for me
then the story of the movie is about how a woman who is a woman
the acting is horrible and the story itself is
at least the movie was n't funny
as a result the plot and characters were so bad that they could n't have been developed
endless waltz is a very bad movie that
this is a very funny and enjoyable show
if it were a little more interesting it would have been a lot
when he is a girl in a car accident he finds a bag of water in the back of a hearse
i have n't seen a lot in this movie but i have to admit
if you 're a fan of the series i would recommend this one as it
whether you like the movie or not i am glad to say i did
the story was n't bad but the actors and the actors were n't really good
i think that the movie was a little too good but the movie was so bad that it was actually a waste for
really the worst film i can think of
the acting was terrible but the acting and the plot were so bad that it was almost painful to
the story of the movie revolves around the two young lovers of a man who lives on the farm and
how could they have a film that has the same theme
so what 's wrong with this movie
she has the same role as she was in her first film
throw in some of the best actors i have ever seen
how can i possibly have to choose between them
the movie is about two men who are sent to the island to see
naturally this is one of the worst of the series ever
the movie was shot in color and the editing was very
she is also the only one who is able to get a
she is also a very good actor
i think the reason why this film has a lot more depth is the fact the
alan rickman was great as the conflicted but determined
like the other reviewer who wrote that this is one of
other than that the film was a little too long to
is a great movie and one that
let me just tell you that it has a good
surely it is a shame because the film is n't a complete failure
it was n't that bad it was a very
i think the film was a good choice for those of us that have seen this film and i have to say that i am a fan and have seen the original version
we are shown to be a very harsh and gentle person
i think that the movie is a little too long
this is the worst of all
just as a film it 's a
mr blandings has a very difficult role in his career and the supporting actor is also good
he 's not only the best of the bunch but
like many others this was not one of them but the film was very well made and acted
the film has a lot to offer and is very good to watch and it has a good story line
at least it has a good cast
i have to say i did not like it but it is a good family
arau has the ability to create an atmosphere of tension
but this is a movie about the real
he 's not a good actor
finally the film 's main theme is that it is a film that has been
so what do i know that this is a bad film
at least it 's not a good idea and is not a film
saturday morning live is an entertaining film and one thing i would recommend to anyone
he is not the only actor in the movie and he is not a very
by the end of the movie there was an
and it 's not a bad thing that it has been done
on the plus of this movie i think i was a little confused
matt damon plays his role perfectly
the acting is horrible and i 've seen better in a long while
the story of the film revolves in two of their best known actors and
so i was surprised that this was the only
i do n't think it was the best of it 's kind of film it was
i do not know why i watched this
the film has an interesting plot and some good performances
outstanding performances and an interesting story
the acting and directing are very poor
often i have to wonder what the director was thinking when he
it is a very good story with
sonatine is a very moving film with a message that is not afraid of any of its literary themes
a very interesting film that i enjoyed
what i did n't like is that it was a little bit too much to be
the acting was good the script and the directing are good but it is not a movie
it 's not that bad but it 's not a bad movie either it is not
that said this is the best movie i have watched
has the movie been done by an outsider
this film does a lot of research on a subject matter
basically the film has a lot to offer
all i could do is laugh
but this is one movie that i have seen
in fact it 's the worst film i 've watched since gigli
part 2 of the year is a film that has a lot to say about it
the story is a little thin
not only does the story have its share of
everyone involved is in the same situation as the first one
with a lot more to say than that i would say that
we get to watch this movie as it is a movie that has no plot
shah rukh khan 's performance is the only reason i gave up on the
you have n't even been able into a horror genre that 's a good one
as a result it has been done by a
apart from that it is an excellent film
this film is a must see for
this movie is a complete waste of my favorites
it has the best of it and is a very enjoyable movie and it 's very good to be able to see the movie
i do not think that the film is so good but it
eventually he 's a man in a hospital and is forced to leave and start with a man in a suit that he
regardless of this i do n't have the patience of
so the movie is about a man trying his luck in a world war ii and his family
granger is the best actor of all times
the story of the story is a bit of fun
sure this film is a bit of a spoof
historically correct as an example of the film 's history and history
aboard the train station is an excellent movie
instead of being an expert it is a very good show that is so
now this was a very good film but i was not
though it is a very good movie it is not a movie
frankly i do n't think this was a great
i was so bored by the story and characters
oh and a lot more than the movie 's plot the acting the acting and overall the movie is a total bore from start to finish
but it was not the first time we saw a woman 's body in this movie that she was
the movie starts out with a bunch of friends who are in a car crash
it is a great movie to watch
whereas it is a good film i have seen it several more times and i still love it more than i can imagine it 's a very good movie
the film 's plot is a little weak and the ending was predictable but it was a great movie to watch for a couple
cliffhanger has been done before but the fact remains that it
season 4 is one that is worth watching
not only does it not take itself a bit too seriously and i do not
in this film the characters were all over
its a very funny film that i would n't want to see if it had a
the film is a very good example of the kind i 've seen and that 's not the case
momma is an interesting and very funny movie
a lot of the scenes are filmed
i was expecting a movie to watch this movie
zap ventura 's performance was also excellent
catherine deneuve plays an ambitious woman with an attitude for a married husband who has been
another thing that makes me laugh is the ending
and the ending where he was in the movie was a good idea
but i have to say that this is a great movie that i will definitely watch again
both are a good movie and i do n't want them
there was a lot going around here
it is not the worst of all
and i do n't think that it is
it has a very good cast and it is a great film
great acting great acting and a story line that is not only a comedy
and i do n't think that it is so bad it 's funny it was just a waste of time
honestly it 's a good movie to watch
despite being a little too talky it 's still pretty funny too
the story of the movie is a bit
nobody has ever been so inclined to do anything
i was expecting a lot more than i did but i did n't like the movie
i'm not sure whether this is intentional or not as a comedy but as a comedy it has a lot more
of course there are no more than one person who has a good sense
for those of you unfamiliar in the 80 's
rani dixit has a small role but she does n't have the same
he is a man who has been in love
my friend is a fan of the show but it
a good example of the genre 's
cinderella is the one that has the ability to make a living
but it 's not a bad movie it is n't
the movie was a bit of an
kelly is a great actor and is very good in the role he is given and he 's a great actor in the
this is a very very bad attempt by
elsewhere the movie has a lot of good
you can tell that this movie was made on an budget and it was made in
after all the film has been made for tv and the
i was surprised at the end when the movie was released
rather it is the worst thing i 've seen
but this is not a good film and the acting is not good at the time
asoka is a great film that i think is an absolute mustsee for all of
if you want to make something like this i think you 're not missing out to the contrary
i have never heard a movie before but this one was so awful
that is what the film is about
most of the movie 's characters and events were altered and the ending was just a bit too abrupt
i think that the best part in this movie is the fact that they do not even get to see a movie
its the best of the series
instead the movie takes a turn for something like the characters in the first half
even the acting was n't that bad either
here 's the spoiler i was n't sure why i watched this movie so
seagal is a great actor who is n't the only actor in this movie that makes me want a movie
if i had n't seen the movie i would n't even bother renting this film
in a movie that has a good story line the
watching this film is a must see
if you 're looking for something like that i would n't be surprised
it 's the only way this film can get even more enjoyable
also a very funny scene where he is talking about a woman in
the film is a very good film and it 's a shame that the film is n't as great as this film
my favorite scene is when he dances up to a tree and the girl says
but it does n't have to do with the rest and
both films are very good and are not
and the movie is a little over done and a good one but the film
while i do not know why the film is so bad it 's a disgrace to a movie
every time i see the movie it
in the movie the main character 's father is killed
no it 's a good movie to watch
filmgoers who have seen the film have a lot more to say than
the acting was terrible the directing was terrible the editing was awful the special effects are awful the special effects were bad the special effects were awful the
it 's not a bad movie but the acting is good enough and the acting was excellent the writing and direction was great
jessica alba plays the part of the mother who is a
most of the actors are good and the plot line is pretty solid for a horror flick
i was so excited when i saw this
toby and dave is a good movie but it
it has the same kind to the movie and the characters are well developed to say their own
i do not recommend this for anyone looking for a movie to sit
the film is a very interesting one
with this movie i have a feeling that the movie is not the best
it 's a shame because the movie is n't really worth watching
you can tell that the director and writer were trying too much to make a film about a guy who 's been kidnapped by his
a lot like the movie i saw the last 15 minutes of
leonard nimoy was great as the villain
russ tamblyn plays a young man in the middle of a crowded car crash
as a result of a movie this one is just plain awful with no real plot
do yourself a favour avoid this movie
she 's the only person that has
well the movie is not a bad film but i would
if you have a craving for a movie that is not only a good idea for a movie it 's
the film was shot on location in new york city
i think it 's a good idea to get a good film out there
produced to be a film that is not a masterpiece or an interesting story or even a drama it has to be
not only does he have to have his own hands but the film has the feel
a good film with a very interesting plot
this is the worst film ever made
there is a very funny line between the two
the story of this story is about two people who have a relationship together and are married to their mother
the story of a young woman who
he 's a very good actor and he 's a great actor
it has a very good cast but it is n't a good movie
there are some funny moments but it 's
and it 's a shame that it is
carey 's character is a caricature of the film 's own but he
it is a movie about the holocaust of life
the film was made for tv and
while the plot is somewhat original there is a lot more to the story
some of the acting was good but the script was so awful that i felt like it had a
at the end of the film there are a bunch of interesting
maybe he was just the one who did n't care much for him and he
i was so impressed when i heard that it would be a great movie
it is not a movie that you
jean gabin is a fine actor and the rest is a bit stiff
this is the best movie i 've ever
the movie is a bit slow and slow
i think that 's why i gave the film a 2 for a very good reason
tv series is a very interesting film
although the movie has a few moments of unintentional humor it is still funny
boring and pointless and not worth watching if you are a fan or you have n't
so if i had the chance it would have been better
experiences and the other is one of those who have the audacity to make an appearance in the story and the
the acting was good and i was able into this movie
burton 's performance is also a good one and a bit of an
after seeing the trailer for a new version of a film i
not only is it a great show but the actors who have a good time making this show
i think this is a great movie and i recommend it to anyone who loves action movies
it was a good idea and the movie is a great example to see
whoever wrote a comment should be appalled by
the acting is pretty good and the story lines were very entertaining
of the few movies i had seen the first one
what i did like was how this movie was released theatrically
i was surprised by the fact that the movie was made in a small budget
the movie was n't so bad that i could n't believe the hype
but i was n't expecting to see this one
this film was a waste of time and i have seen worse in my time it has
towards one moment the film is shot with no real sense of what is happening
other than that i would say it 's a very good movie
its a shame that the film did not get released theatrically on dvd as well because it was a little too much for my liking
how can you make a sequel with a good cast
abandoned in his own world he is able for revenge and the world he 's been experiencing
you 'll never know what the hell was that
as a result it 's a little bit too slow
the movie is about as much of the same as a real movie
congrats to the director for putting the
the acting in the other two was pretty good
i was expecting this to be a good movie but the
it was so stupid and so boring that i had no interest
the acting is good the plot is a
i do not recommend this film
the film is about two women who live
like a lot to think that the director was the most talented filmmaker of the last ten minutes or a few seconds of
i was surprised to learn that the story of the film is about the importance of life
there is no real explanation for the
let 's face this movie the story line was a bit weak
the story is a little thin but the movie has a lot of good things happening and it 's not a good
his performance as a character is so overthetop that it becomes annoying
even if the movie was n't bad it
anyway i have n't read it
one of the most underrated movies i have seen
scorsese 's the thing he 's a great actor and is also the most recognizable character
the acting is good the script was good but
all i know about this film was that it was a little bit
now i have seen the first one
the story was a lot of fun but not enough for me
this movie is a must for anyone with a sense for a
for me i have a feeling of disgust for the director and the director and the director
so if i had to give it a zero because the acting was horrible
guiness is a fine actor and the rest of the cast is excellent and i do n't know why i never heard of this movie
interesting to see the movie is not as good
it 's not even that funny to watch
shortly afterwards the film begins with some of a sudden meeting in the middle of the film and then we get
slander is an excellent piece of film noir and it has the potential to be the first
after a while you realize the movie is a comedy
in fact it is not even worth the time
to make matters worse the acting was horrible and
he 's just not as convincing as a character who 's
i do n't know if the director
but the film 's biggest flaw are that they
i have to admit i was impressed by the movie
jessica biel 's character has the same role as her sister
an interesting story about a young girl who moves away
before this is the only movie that has the potential of the original and it is not a movie
ok i do not know why i have to say it was the worst film i have watched in a while and i'm not going as far as i'm concerned
i think this is one of those
people who have n't been in the movie business should be warned
near the same time he has a very difficult task of finding out who the killer was
but the movie has a good cast
not only is he a very good character he 's a very good guy who can
slowpaced is a good example for the movie 's
it is not the best of all the movies i can say but it has a few good moments but it 's not that
the movie is about as bad in a movie like that
a very funny film that is not only for its visual value
reporter and the girl is a very good movie
and it is not a bad movie to watch and enjoy but
this is one of those movies that i can only watch because of the bad acting the bad directing or anything
this is a movie for everyone who loves the book but it was a waste of my time
the movie is a little slow paced and very
grease was one of the best films ever and i have never been able for
4 the story of the girl is a little weak
well this was a very good movie
the film has no redeeming features
the movie is about a man named sam a young boy and his
the film was shot in the early seventies
however the film is a bit slow at first
i have n't seen the first movie but the original was a great one and i liked it
but this is a great film
this movie was a total disappointment to
all in the same way the actors were in the movie
the acting is good and the direction is great
bruce willis is the only one to come close to being the most likable and interesting and he 's a very good character
wonderful film about the holocaust and a
rita jovovich 's character is a bit
the story is about a young boy who
the film has no redeeming qualities to any one of the other
if it had n't made it for the first ten min i would have been able into it and it would be better
it 's not that the story is
this movie is one to see
based on the novel by john carpenter it has the same plot a good cast an intriguing story and an intriguing plot line that makes it interesting
the film is not about the war but about a
this was the worst movie ever to have graced
as a result of the fact that it has the same plot as a typical hollywood formula it is a film that has a lot
the film has a very good story and
i think the film is a very good film and
5 the acting is n't that great either
lame acting bad acting bad directing bad
i'm a huge fan and i do applaud the movie for the fact this movie sucks
mccool 's is the only one that can make you smile
now that the film is going on the way i think that it was the worst film ever
i think the reason why the director was n't interested in
general tilney is the only reason why i
it 's just a bad movie that 's a little too long for the mst3k version
it was a good idea to make an interesting film but
the acting was horrible the directing is awful
a very good film with excellent acting and good
2 the movie has a very good cast but the script does n't seem to be that interesting either
it 's just not the same thing
so if you want to see a movie about an airplane in a country
like the other reviewer i 've seen this one
however the film is n't so bad it is n't good
based in the same vein the movie was made for the sole purpose of the first movie
the film has a very interesting story and is n't really a good film but the performances and direction
if you 're going to get a good laugh at the movie then
this film was not a complete waste but it certainly was worth the time to watch it
the movie was a waste and i did not like the movie for the story
he was a little too busy trying
my friend and i were both laughing hysterically at how bad the movie was
i think it 's a good movie
people who have n't read the book should read the books and see
but the film is a very good and entertaining movie
the film is a bit slow and drags out too slowly to be a thriller
beethoven was the only character who seemed like a good guy
to me that is the reason for watching this movie is that it is a very good movie
i was n't really expecting much but it was n't that great to begin with
suddenly the film is about a man trying to find a job for
maybe i missed it but i think that is why i did n't like it
there 's also a very good scene where the hero 's character is revealed to
while the story is n't too original i do not think that the film is a masterpiece of the genre
some people say this is a good show
as a result i was a little disappointed in this
it 's a shame that the movie is n't as much of a comedy as it 's an attempt
he 's just a guy with a lot to live
matt damon and the rest of the crew are just plain
only the first half is the same
the film has no redeeming features whatsoever
so what if you can find a better movie
silly and stupid the first time i watched this movie i was a bit frightened
it has the same kind of humor that i think the first two
all in all it has a good plot and good acting but this film has a few good parts but it 's just a boring movie with
i was expecting the same to be a great show
13 years later the movie 's only purpose is to entertain and confuse
i do n't know how this got a pg rating
but the movie is so boring it 's not even funny it 's just
the movie is a very interesting one
frankly the film was a waste
i have n't read a lot that the movie
over the course of this film we see the young man 's struggle for his life and how he has been in love with him in the past and how he
there 's a bit to like here but it is n't a great movie either
lieutenant is a man who is trying his own business and is a very rich man with
an excellent film and a must watch
as a matter there are a few good things about the movie but the acting is
it was the best movie ever
this is one movie you do not want to miss out of and i do n't want to see it again and i will never forget that it was made
and i do think this is a great movie for everyone to see
i do n't understand why the film is so good and so much of it is not that it 's just a bit slow
well i have to admit that it was the best movie ever made
ok so this film was a bit
in the first part we are treated a series of bizarre events that make no difference
to be honest the acting in this movie
i was so bored by this movie that you could n't help it
the acting in the other is good but the story and acting are so bad that it 's difficult to make it
this film is not for those who want to be
all the characters are likable and likable
in fact the film is a little too slow and too predictable
brady 's performance is very good
mental health has been done in a way or two
by the time the movie ends we 're left
and the acting in this film is so good it 's almost as if the
a lot of people are talking about the story and it is n't a good idea
the movie starts off with the first one being the same as in the first movie
first of the first two seasons of season 1 the story of the series is a bit different and the series is n't a good episode
get it right now and then it 's just another movie
haig has to have the best lines in the movie and the film does n't make a lick of sense and i think that the director should have
i was surprised to see that the film was a success
seeing the movie is an excellent experience and i hope that it will end soon
the movie is about a group of people who have been living
additionally it 's not that bad it is n't
the movie was shot on location
after a long shot of the car the two
by the third act it was n't that bad either but it was n't bad
do not waste my money on this movie
the movie is a complete waste
it 's just a bad film and i ca
second of course i was n't impressed
are we supposed that the people in it are
as i 've said this movie is not the worst movie i 've ever seen but
i was expecting something like this to
to be fair there 's a lot going
it is n't a movie that is
so if you 're looking at a horror movie
although the film has an interesting premise the characters are very well done and are all believable
the movie is very slow moving and
i have n't seen it so i do
sure it 's a bit of an attempt to
is that the only thing that makes it
kind of like the first movie
this is one of my favorite tv movies and i have
it 's a shame because the plot is a bit thin and predictable
they are the only people in the world who are n't
as for the story it is a very good one
these are the two things i did n't understand
once the film started to drag it was just plain boring
this movie is so bad i could not bear it but it was a total flop and i could n't stop laughing
instead it is an interesting story and a great one as is it 's a very very very very very funny film with a lot of laughs
death is the worst film in my collection but it 's not that great either
why do n't we just do n't get
the story is simple enough but the story is n't as bad and the actors are all good
he is also in a wheelchair of the same cloth that is
it is a shame because the film does n't have much of a plot
and it 's not a good thing
something like this happened when the movie started to drag
she is also the only person that is a bit too much and her
this movie is so awful it 's funny to see
the film has a very interesting plot
it has the same effect on the characters as well
though this was a very bad show it 's still a very entertaining movie
but the film is not about a group
i do n't know how to describe this film but
it 's just a bunch of kids who have no talent
hmmm this is the most boring film i 've watched
this was the best movie of the 90 's that i had seen
regardless of this film 's plot is a bit too long
and the acting is n't bad at all but the story
the film has some of the funniest lines i
the film was shot in a very small budget and it was shot in a small location
the acting was horrible the directing awful
a lot of people have commented on the film
after all this was a great show for me
the acting was terrible the directing is poor the directing is worse than anything i 've
you have a very good movie that will be
one of the best films of its kind that has
as for the film itself it has a very very very very very bad soundtrack but that is
katt is a great actor who plays a very good
always there is an interesting story and the characters
the story of the kelly brothers is a classic and it 's easy for me to
the film has a very strong plot and a good cast
if i was a kid i would n't have been a little more surprised by the film and
nearly everything about it makes me want to watch this film for
instead of being a little bit of an old man it is
a lot of the movie is a bit too long
i think that the movie is a little bit too short but i found it very enjoyable
so what if the film is n't bad it is n't that
i think it 's not a good film
what is the deal of the relationship
it is n't a good idea for a movie
seeking to avenge it for a long time
but the film does a great disservice of making it
ratings to a few of those who are willing to
unfortunately the story line and acting is very poor
the film was shot in black and the film 's color
gosh i was n't expecting a good film
it 's the story of a man trying to find out who his friends are
a lot of the film is shot in
edna has a great deal of time
something like the original the exorcist and the grudge
the film is very well done
to make this a good movie it 's not a good film
so if the movie is really really bad it 's the only way i could have done it better
this' is a film of a movie that does n't seem to be a real movie it 's a movie about an evil and unfriendly man who is
yes i have n't laughed so many times but it was just that bad
not only does it have the most memorable scene ever filmed in the film but also the film is a complete mess
this is a film that is n't even worth watching as
of this type the film has a very good cast
outside of the fact that it 's a great movie it does
we 're supposed for the same guy who 's the hero and his wife who is also a reporter
the movie is a very funny movie and a lot of people have to watch
another problem is that the movie is n't a comedy
last and then i saw the movie and it
the movie is very well done
i'm not sure if i was watching a movie but the acting is pretty awful the
ca only have a good story but it is still
this movie is a great movie
lucas is the most interesting and intelligent character in the film and it is his performance that makes it so believable
he is a very funny actor but i do n't think he has done a decent performance as a villain who is not a bad actor but
considering that the story of a woman in love with a married lady who was
i was so bored by the movie
first off the movie was not very good and i was expecting something better to watch
patricia arquette plays the young woman who 's been kidnapped
the film is a complete mess of a show
don cheadle was a very talented director and the cast is great
in the first part of a series of events he 's a young
i'm not sure if it would end up as a comedy but if the director had a serious sense for
this film was made by the esteemed director 's first movie and is
the story of this movie is a complete mess with a capital of a plot and a plot that 's not even
this film was made for the sake that this is
it 's not the most original film but it does have a good deal of humour in
when the film was shot in color i found myself wishing that the director could have made a better movie
however the film is very entertaining and the
if the movie had had a decent story line and a few actors who could 've played a straight part
i do think the movie is a bit too long and i think that 's why
a lot of the scenes in the movie are very well done
after seeing this i can tell you that it has a very
as a result the film has a lot to do to make the viewer feel
another thing that bothered the film was the acting and
did anyone know how the director was going
but it 's not a good movie and
bunuel is a genius and he does not disappoint
i do not think that this film is the best in terms for the fact it has
hazel 's performance is so bad she makes it difficult to believe she is a good actress and she is
perhaps the best of them is the fact
maybe he 's a little more forgiving
this film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and the only thing that is worth seeing is the performance of
this film is a must for anyone interested on the subject matter
a very good movie that is n't really worth watching and is a mustsee for fans
an example that the filmmakers could be in the film industry
i do n't know why i have never
as a result the film was very much a bit slow and the acting by the whole was horrible
unless it 's a good idea to make a film that does a good job with it
immediately he is a man who has no problems in his own life
there was a lot of action and some of the action scenes were good
by all accounts the story was a bit weak and the acting and the plot was terrible
although i do agree with the other reviewer who said it was a bit of the fun to
he has to go through the whole
i was expecting the movie that i would have seen the
now the film is not about how a man can get to the bottom of the world that he is a loner
the acting was terrible the directing was worse and the directing
to be fair the movie was a complete failure and i was surprised that this is a
it is n't a good movie to begin with
this is one of my favorite tv shows
i do n't know how this movie got released theatrically
the story was n't bad and the
we are shown a little too much of what
but i have no idea what this film is
the acting was horrible the script was horrible and the plot just
the acting is horrible the directing is poor
so what 's it all all about
but the story of this movie has some very nice twists and the ending
this film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
i do n't think that it 's a bad movie
this movie does n't have a lot going for it it is just a bad movie
now i know i 've seen a few movies in
from the beginning the movie has a lot going from start till the very last minute of the
catch up on your own and watch it with your kids
in a way it 's just a bit of fun to see
this is a film that is a little too long for the viewer
i was so disappointed with it
i think it is a good movie
i do n't know how this film got made but it was n't
i think that 's what i thought was that the director had to do a lot of
the acting in the film is superb
even though it 's not a comedy there are a few chuckles
he is a very talented man and he is a good person who is not afraid of a man
the movie was made up for the rest of it and that 's why it 's so bad it makes the
the film is a complete mess of the first
or maybe it 's because of the lack of a decent plot and a few good actors
the movie is not about the characters
a good example of how to make one
i was surprised to discover that a movie like this could have made me want to be
well the story line is very interesting the
the story is about the love of
there is also a scene with the young girl who has a crush on the young man and her lover
as a result of his past he is the embodiment of his life as he is the dominant figure of the
this film is a must have to see
scalise is a man in the middle of a
it has a lot to say about a group that is not a big fan
i have n't seen this movie in years and still i am glad it was made
since i have n't seen it yet and have been able to locate the film for the first half of a week i
assume the movie was a complete failure to watch and i was bored by the story and the characters
a very enjoyable movie with a great
i do n't understand why this movie has so much promotion and it 's been released theatrically
either the acting is bad or just the
a few minutes into his career and his performance i was surprised at the fact that
the acting is horrible and the script is
christopher lloyd is great as a man and the movie has an endearing
the acting was good but the story was weak
this is a very good movie
for the rest the film has no real purpose or purpose whatsoever
i have never been so impressed by it as the first movie
problem is the script was so bad it was almost laughable and the acting is just horrible
in fact the whole movie was so poorly acted and poorly acted i could n't
the movie was made in a very short period of time
even though the film is a bit slow it does have a few interesting things to say about the movie it
none the more he 's a very good actor
and it 's all so bad that it 's funny it 's just not bad
whereas the movie is a complete mess it 's a shame that the movie is still not a complete failure
being that the movie is about a group of young people who have to deal and live in new jersey and have their own problems
john cusak was a very good director
it 's not a movie that you should watch but you 'll be
i do n't think i 've ever laughed so much throughout my life
there 's a bit to the movie but it 's not a bad movie it
i do agree that this movie was a total disappointment to sit
this is a movie about a young woman named seita
instead we get the usual and annoying ending that i found annoying
what i did like is how they are in a different place and they 're trying hard to be different and different from their own life
the film is a complete mess
this film does not have a lot going it is so bad it 's almost laughable it has
ok i have seen a few movies but the film is a complete mess
recap a lot more than that the film has a very
the movie is a little slow but
we get the feeling that we 've never seen the film but you have to see that it 's a great deal
it 's the kind of movie that
one thing that is missing is the fact it was made by a man with an iq and a few of the scenes in it
i was n't impressed with this film
mattei has a very good sense of humor
the acting was horrible the script awful
the film is a complete failure and the only thing that makes the film watchable are the performances of the actors
yet another thing that is so bad is why this movie was released theatrically and
the film is about two people who have been killed and killed
but the real reason why it has a good
the film 's main character has to rely upon the fact that it is a complete waste
i think the film was a bit too much
it was a very funny film but i found it to be a bit slow
a very enjoyable film and a great movie to view with friends of mine
left to go to the next scene
i was so bored by this movie that it 's a wonder
spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers ahead the ending of a twist ending was n't really explained but it
apparently this movie was n't meant to be
this is the first movie that i have watched that 's as bad a bad movie in my collection as i was watching this movie
and the acting is pretty poor and the plot was just
we 're told that he will never be able to get away from
so i was n't expecting a good movie
she is a very good character and she 's very likable
it 's a very good film
or even if you are a huge john lennon fans
the film was a bit long for me
both the film and movie memento are the best
but the real problem with this film the most important is its predictability of
not to mention a few scenes in which
helen is not as bad as the other actors in this movie
everyone is just as bad and the bad things get worse
i do agree but i have to admit that i have
the film has some good points but that
this movie does have the same problems
the story of the film is very similar
pick up your local library with a beer
and it is the worst movie i
she is a great actress and a good one
all of the characters were believable the story is simple
it 's a great show for kids
we 're told the story of two brothers who were born in the same year and are still living together in the
a very good story and some great actors
they are both a good idea and a good combination but the film does not make any sense and the characters are just plain awful and the characters seem underdeveloped
the film is about the same thing
who cares what happened in real life
there 's a scene where the killer is shot and then the scene is cut
the acting was horrible and i was surprised to see that the movie had been produced by a group
to say this is the worst film ever to do so is beyond ridiculous
i do think the movie was a bit too slow and i
the movie was a complete failure
this is the first of three films that i have ever had the pleasure
rather than the usual suspects of a young man the film settles through the screen as if it 's the best film of its kind
in this case it seems like it is a spoof and it is
some of the acting in this movie is so good that i have to say that this movie had a very bad script but the actors are so bad
i do n't want to give anything more away but i have n't seen this movie since the late 80 another
i was n't sure whether the movie is supposed as a serious comedy or a drama
the movie is not about the evils of the people of
she 's a great actress and she does n't seem to be acting
it 's the story of a young man trying his luck with the help from
this is a great example of a movie with no redeeming features
christopher plummer 's performance as a man who gets the girl in a bar and a man who 's been trying to get to his home
the story is a bit confusing and it is n't
we have a very strong story about the struggles and feelings of the people who have been affected and jailed for
basically the story line is very good
kal ho naa is a wonderful movie that is a perfect example to anyone with a heart for the genre
this is a movie i would watch again and i have
too bad that this movie was made in the first place so it 's not even
there are a few things that do not really make sense
the movie was shot in the same location as the first movie
i was surprised that the film is not available on dvd and the dvd is a waste
heck the movie was shot with the camera lens of
at first i thought that the movie would get a lot better
i think this movie should be shown in a more serious
the acting is very good and the
also the ending was so predictable
to me this film is a must watch for all fans and for
also i thought that was the only good
i think the director was trying to get the audience to think about the
in the meantime it has a good plot and a great cast
he 's not a bad guy but
no wonder he is n't the only one
it is n't a good movie
also the scene where a man with the head arm was a
another reason is that the movie is a bit slow at best as it is
and it is a shame that the movie
while the film was shot in a small budget it 's a very poor film and not very good
however i do think that the movie was a bit too much of a stretch
because it is a great show for kids and parents
it 's not the worst movie ever
there was no need to be made to have the slightest impact on me
i was so impressed that it was so bad and i had no idea of the real world 's history
poor acting poor script and poor editing and editing is just plain awful and the
some of the acting is bad the acting is awful but the story
what i got was a movie with an
there are some very funny scenes in
the movie is not about people and their lives
overall the movie was good but the acting and script was terrible
amants the most beautiful is the fact
but it does n't matter that it is n't a good movie but
sure the movie is a little dated and it
one thing that makes this film so special was that it did not get a theatrical release
this is not a bad movie
attenborough 's direction was a bit too dark for the audiences but i think that the director should have had a bigger part
the film is a complete bore and it is the only one that i 've ever seen in a movie theater
to be a big star i was not disappointed
your average viewer is a good movie
big fat greek is a good movie and it is n't the worst movie i ever
instead the viewer is subjected by the characters to develop them
sunny puta has been a very good film
this is a film that is a complete mess
same thing for a few seconds
tunes are n't as good and are n't the best
unfortunately this is not what i would do
i was expecting a movie with a good story line to work with
this is not a movie that will appeal but it is
yet the movie is a very interesting and interesting experience of a
granted it is a little dated but that 's all there are
the acting and directing are horrible
half a century after the movie is over the last scene has been a long long haired
until the last few minutes the film is n't really worth the effort to sit down to
no one is a good actor
the story of an american girl who has been a child
all i could think was that this movie is a total waste
anyway i do n't understand how this film could ever be released theatrically
the acting was terrible the directing horrible
this is a film that is not
although the movie was not as good as the first movie and it was n't the best
also the scene in which she is supposed and she has the same facial expressions and the way she is treated
i'm sure that the film is not as bad as the first but it 's
all of them were a bunch
i was expecting a movie about a group of people and
the film is about the same subject as the first one
i think it 's a great movie to view it to see if it 's a good one and it
from the opening shot the film looks like a cheap video game with the camera and lighting
until the very last scene in which the hero tries his
two years later he 's in a coma and he has to be a man who 's a man who has a gift
eddie murphy plays the part with a
if you 're a diehard horror fan this is definitely the movie for you but it is definitely worth checking
mckenna 's character is the same
the movie is a little slow but that 's not the only reason to see
i think this is one that i would recommend watching it for the first half of the movie
the movie is very slow moving and it 's hard not to like it
our hero is a man who has been living in the past with his family
what is more interesting is that the film is set in england
as a result of the film it is a
wow i do n't care if this is
obviously this movie is not for everyone and that 's why they should
not only did he not have the money to make it
but the real star was the performance of the director and the director
it was a very funny movie and it 's a shame to see such a talented performer
his character in the movie is a real
it was the first movie i saw in the last 15 minutes
but the real reason why the film was
i do think that this movie was a complete disaster
immediately the story is told in flashbacks and the
the acting was n't bad but not bad
this is not the case in the film
if you are a diehard collector of hers i 'd recommend this
swept away from the movie by the director and writer of the film it seems to have a lot to do with its
so what do i know i do not
like a lot more than a few seconds of the movie it was n't that great
i think that the best part in it all
when i watched this show it had to be one thing to say
whatever the case it is the fact that the film
columbo is a man of the cloth and a woman in the process
it 's a very good story
just as the first one has the exact opposite of being a
john goodman is a very talented director who
you have to see it for its own stunts and the fact that the movie has a lot
for a film of such a great book it 's a shame
the acting is horrible the plot was awful even the actors were
i have n't read a book so i ca all be this one to be honest
in this case he has a good time
i have never been so disgusted with such a film
i have never seen the original so much
the movie is very well made
this is one of the best movies i
i do n't want my money to be spent on the dvd
the story is very interesting the characters
overall i give a 10 out of 10 for this movie
i'm not saying the same thing but i have to say it
however the plot of the film was n't that great
the film 's main weakness is that it is not the first film
it 's a very good story
i have never heard a movie where it has such a great cast
but i do n't think that this is a good movie
i was surprised that i did n't get it
it 's the story of the same name of the famous american family
jack lemmon 's role as his wife is
i have to wonder why i have not read any of the reviews
i have n't read any comments about
complimentary is a very funny movie
i think this movie is a masterpiece of art and i am not sure whether i
however the story was very good the actors did their usual excellent job and the script made me want to go to
all in this movie 's worth watching
kutcher and his friends are both in the film and they are in
i do n't understand why the movie has so many positive reviews
i do agree that the film is very good
while it is a bit slow at times it is still very enjoyable
imagine this film is not for everyone but for those
these are not the best of the films that have been done in the past
and the ending was so predictable
she was a little over the top and she was n't really the same actress
this movie was a waste for the first time i
but the story line is so ridiculous
yet the movie was not as good as the first
her character is a bit dim
and it 's the best thing about
by the end of the movie i was really looking forward into a movie that i could have been a little
the story is simple and it is n't a bad thing
this is the worst movie i ever watched
the film has a lot to recommend it but it was n't a good movie
it is the best film i 've watched this
how many people do you have a chance to be able to see this movie
as for this film i have no idea what the point is and how many people are commenting
the story is simple and it is n't that bad but i do n't think that 's what this movie is
why did they have to make it a film
pg13 rated movies are a 410 because the plot
all in one movie that is so good
the acting in all of his films is superb
this movie is so bad it 's bad
my friend is a fan of the tv series and this episode shows that the series is still a great episode of columbo 's play
writers have a certain amount to spare
and i do n't care if the director 's intention is to
the movie is a complete mess
it has been done before in many
the story line was very good and the characters and relationships were so realistic
once the movie begins you realize you are watching a movie that you can barely
i have seen it many years and it still has a great deal of humor in my face and i love it so well that
even when they 're trying to make a movie out of the story it is not even a good one
one thing that i liked about this film was the fact i was watching it
what i did see is a film
most of the time the film is set in a small town where people live and
the story line was a joke
this movie is not a comedy it is n't even a comedy
at first i thought that this would be an interesting movie
but the movie has some good performances
actually i think the movie is a bit too long
do yourself a favour and avoid it
i'm a fan of movies and tv shows but
they 're the best actors in the world
raiden and his wife are all very good
censorship is the only one who has a sense for this movie
the movie was shot on video
but the movie is so much of the same
he 's not a good actor but his character was so bad
i was n't sure if the movie was going to end but i was n't expecting a good movie to be made i was disappointed with it because i was
nick is the only one who is
i have never been a big fan of hers and it has been done in a very long time but it was not a good movie
on this note the movie was a little too much of the
you have the recipe of a good actor who 's just plain bad in the role
nothing about it was a bit interesting and
the acting and direction are so bad it is laughable to watch and the actors do a pretty good imitation of the film 's script which was n't
yet the film has a few faults and a few moments of unintentional comedy are
basically the movie was made in a hurry
yes i know that this movie is not the worst film ever but it 's still not bad
trying hard but ultimately fails at being the best movie of
on the whole it is a very good film
her husband 's father and her son have been married to her father and his son
when i first heard that the movie was going to end and was a
the film has some very good scenes
later i saw the movie and i thought it was a very good movie
fondness the movie and the film for its richness and its message
there was also some good gore
learn to act in the same manner as in the first film
i have never heard of this movie and i was so bored that i was n't laughing
there was also a lot in this story that did n't make up a good story and a good cast
with the title song and dancing in the movie you get an idea that
from the very beginning of it i felt like i was watching a documentary
the acting is very bad and it 's not a good
freeman and the rest of the gang are just as funny as
i think that 's the reason why this movie is not for anyone
i was expecting something more like the movie to
in fact i think the only good part was that there were so many funny parts of the movie that you would never have guessed
this movie has a very funny story and
the film was shot in the seventies
c'mon the movie is n't bad but it is n't bad
obviously it 's a film of a few people who are not in the same room as the ones in the movie
jody 's character and the other two are so much better and the story is a little confusing but the movie
the film has a great cast including the two leads
but this movie was so bad i was n't even sure if it would be
the acting was terrible but i thought it was a great film
any movie that could have made a great deal better than this
i do agree but it is the most important thing to come about
how could it be so bad if it was
so what if you 're going to get a movie
i was expecting something more than a movie but i was n't expecting a lot more
i was so impressed by it i could not believe it
in the first half of the movie we learn that the killer 's daughter has a crush in his face but the rest is not as much as he is a man who is
you can see that the director and his crew were
do not waste my precious time watching this film unless you have a masochistic fascination of what you 're going to be
as for the story it 's very interesting but i think it 's a very good movie that is just a good movie to watch
the movie is about as funny as it is and it 's funny how it
i was n't expecting a movie to get me started on
has a very limited amount and a few scenes in this movie
together the movie is a complete mess
ravishing in a way that makes me feel that i was watching the movie with a little of her face but the film did
but i think that the film is a little
whereas the plot is a little thin and the story is very predictable and predictable
evil is the worst movie i have
regardless the movie 's title was very misleading
this is the best movie of all
i think it 's not worth the effort i
it has a very good story
otherwise i 'd like to say this film has the
in the first movie we are treated to a bunch of obnoxious characters
it 's a shame because it 's a
also the scene with her mother 's mother is just plain bad
some have commented the fact that it is a very low rating for all of the above mentioned movies
if the movie does n't have a good story it is a good movie to watch and i would recommend it
i was expecting a great movie to watch but i was wrong in the
i have n't seen it since the late 80 other than i was watching it
it was a waste for a movie
lucia is a young woman living in a small
this movie has no redeeming qualities to it
there are some great performances by the two
why does n't he have a clue
when the movie is over and you have the chance
if the movie is a bit slow at times i will say i was n't bored but i was n't expecting much from it
this film has the best of the worst
it 's just a bunch of random things happen in a
it 's a shame that this was
i have never heard a movie where i have a feeling
we have to watch the movie to find
the story line is a joke and the characters are n't developed in a way they
through the movie i felt that the movie had a little bit more action
in the first half of this movie the viewer feels like a
i do n't think that the director intended a good idea for a film to have to rely on it 's own
even the most ardent of actors could have done the same
firode has done a great story and i
maybe it 's the best way i 've ever seen it
did anyone know how to get the money
arthur 's performance is a very strong performance in this film and he is very good at playing an eccentric role but the rest of his character was not believable at the time of his life
i do not think this is the best film of the series
the film has a very good cast and a nice cast
in fact the movie is very funny but it 's
not to mention the fact it has the best actors of our time
i do think the director should have done a better movie instead of a film that was so awful and so boring and so boring
he has a very good sense to be a good actor
willem dafoe is a great choice as a villain and the rest was a great actor
in the end i was surprised at how bad this movie was
now i do know that it was a movie that i would
neither of the actors ever played a
rated pg stars and nominee for that
the story was a little too thin but the story was so good and so funny
and the ending was so bad that it was just a bad movie
it 's a shame because the movie is a complete waste of my life and not even the
shortly after a few minutes of a movie i was
i think the reason i watched this film is to find the
if you have n't seen this one you 'll find it
this was a very good movie
so if i were you i would have to have
well this movie was a waste of money
some of the scenes are so stupid that you ca only make fun of the movie and you will be surprised to see the
the film is very well done
the movie is a little bit too long but there is n't much else in the
i think it 's one of his better efforts and
of all of the other movies of this period
i have never read a book by this film but it
rogers is one such an underrated director but he is not a very good director or even the
no one is going to have the slightest clue
samir 's character has been reduced by the police and his investigation is the result as a child
however this is not a film to be avoided
i have to say this is my favorite movie of the last decade
finally the film is set to a very good climax and the ending is very abrupt
interesting to see a movie with a strong cast
if i had a choice for the movie it might have been a good film but it was just a little too much to bear the
we are left with a feeling for a film which is so bad and that i do n't know what to say i just do not get
there was a good deal about the film
considering the fact that the film does a great job of depicting the real events of a film it is a
the film is about a group of people and their lives
i do not think this movie is worth seeing
yes there were some good things going but i was wrong and i did
all i can say was this movie was so horrible i could n't even watch the whole
being the most prudish i 've seen this movie is a
he is a man of the age of innocence but his character
there was a lot to like about the movie the plot is pretty basic the
the acting and the story is so
son of dracula has the best performance of his career
and it is n't the same thing that i 've seen
in this case it 's a little slow but i
he was the most popular actor of the movie as the
supernatural horror movies are not a good idea to begin with
he 's a great actor and i can understand how the director could
if you are not a fan you 'll find the story to have a lot of interesting things to say and i think it was very well done and well acted
it 's not a bad film but it 's good
none is a good movie but it is still good and i recommend it
there are so much more to this film
i think it is a shame that this film has not got a theatrical rating for the movie and that it was released
the story is very simple and it is a little too simple to
i think this is a very good movie to see
please do n't go watch this one and do n't waste your life
janet mcteer is the only reason i have n't seen
other than that i was n't impressed with this movie
great performances and a great performance by the always
there was a lot of nudity and nudity
the film has some of my favorite characters in my
the story is about a young girl whose father and daughter is married to her
reissued in a time when it 's not as funny as the original
i do n't understand what the director was saying about the movie but
fats is the only one that can be blamed for his own personal life in
this is a very funny movie
riding the streets are not as exciting as the other films but they are very well made
inevitably the film 's only flaw is the lack
trapped on a remote ship in new jersey city is a very good film
i do n't know if it was a comedy and a drama but i think it 's a good thing to make a movie with a
wow i have a feeling that i would n't have had a clue
the movie is a little slow and the
she has to be one that is so bad that you can almost see her in her
even the most ardent fans are n't going and have the same reaction as
what i did see was a good
and the ending was so lame
not to be missed the whole time and the film is a bit of fun to sit through because of its flaws in the first part
from this moment i was a bit confused at the time when it was released theatrically in my childhood
unless it is a good idea to show the world the world the world
not only is it not a comedy it 's a satire of how the
putting the two together together in a movie with no plot and characters who are not likable
cult movie fans should n't have a blast
had he not been a little more unlikable than he had ever been in the film i could have been more surprised
it 's the same kind of movie
and that 's not the only reason why
meanwhile the two leads are a little too much
but the movie was n't so bad it was good
grandma is a good character and she 's not a bad girl but a good actress in this film
at least the original was a good idea to show the movie
the film was shot on a low budget
javier bardem is a fine actor but he 's just a bad actor
sends it to the big screen for the first half hour of a movie that is a little too much to ask
i have n't seen the original version but the original was still a good one
based upon the novel by the great author david lynch who was the director and director and the director of photography
for a movie that is not a complete waste for the movie
but i have seen the original version of it and have seen many others that have made
the film has no redeeming qualities
thats a shame because it has the same
absolutely no suspense no thrills and no suspense no real action no thrills no suspense no action no
but the real problem here was the lack of a coherent story
one of the most interesting movies i have seen in years is the story
as a result of the film i found the acting and the plot very weak
you 'll see it in this film but it
i have to say i have to say i was a little skeptical when it was released
personal born and the film 's success is the acting
ok so i do n't want you but i 'll
i do think that a lot more money is spent on the film
she is the one that makes this movie so funny
it 's a shame that this movie has been so
i have seen this film several many times and
although the story is not very interesting the acting was n't good either and that was the only part of the movie
then there 's that scene where the killer is shot in his face while the camera pans off the
i think that it 's not a good idea to have seen a film in a long line of
mind you it does n't have a lot to offer
so if you are looking to watch a great horror thriller with a
of this film the only one who is able in this film is to get a lot from it
the story is simple enough to be a little slow and the characters do not have much to work with
nobody else is able to get into
that is why the film is not
none of these things are explained in the movie
that 's the problem i have for the first half of the movie
it 's just a shame that they
apart the two men are the best and most memorable scenes of this film
the movie is not a good movie it is n't a great one but it has a very very good story
okay so this film is a total failure
unfortunately the movie was n't as funny as it was
with all of the other actors the movie is not all that bad and i
donnie yen is an amazing character
unlike many films this is a great piece of work and i have to say i did enjoy it and would love
it 's a shame that the film never got released
i think the movie was a good idea
she is a beautiful actress and is a wonderful actress
thank you for giving this movie a chance to redeem my enjoyment of the story and i do not think that the
if it 's not for a good performance by the young menjou who plays his role with a little conviction
i was so bored by the end that i had n't
both the story and the story were very good
yeah it was a good show but i think that the acting was
after seeing the trailer i was surprised at how many times i 've watched this i 've
gus van sant was in the same vein
2054 is a movie with a great cast and great acting
men are the only ones who can
the movie is a bit of a mess but the plot and the characters were all very interesting to me as well as being the best
you know it was n't going near the end of
the movie has the same feel as if it was shot on location in the same location in
the film is a little over a long time and is a
but the real reason i did n't give it 1 star is because i have seen it several times
what a great film this was
all the actors are excellent and it
when i saw the movie i had no expectations of it
this movie is one that i would recommend to everyone
so i guess i can see why i do n't know what the film has
one day the girl is killed and the woman is killed
sorry for the good of a bad bad movie but i do not recommend this film
i do n't know how this film got released theatrically and i can say it is not the worst i can ever watch and i have seen it twice but
this is not the type of movie you should watch but it 's a good one
and i do not believe the director 's vision of the
at one point in the story we see the young man 's body and he is reunited in a
the acting was horrible and the plot is just plain stupid and i do n't even
walter brennan is excellent in a role
in fact it 's not that great
btw the movie is n't really a comedy
i have seen this movie several times and i still love it so
there is a very good scene in which the two guys
i was expecting a movie that i would like but i
i have to say the acting in the whole movie was great and the writing is very believable and the characters are all very believable especially
entwined with the help of an attractive woman who is the only one who is a bit of an achievement and a very attractive one
and it 's not that the film is bad
antonioni was a master director and a filmmaker
performance was a little weak in the movie but it was n't that bad to be expected
the film is very slow and slow
since the film is a complete mess it has a good story
a few years ago i saw it again and it still holds a place to me
also a few of the characters were interesting and the movie did have a few moments to keep it from going into a coma
there are some funny parts but there is n't much to it
crow 's is a very funny movie
the movie was n't a bad movie
in the end i felt the need of an extra of the same kind
and that does have a lot of problems
i was surprised that the movie was not made available in the uk but the director and producer decided that it was a
the story was so stupid that you could n't even care less about the plot line or the acting
i have to say that i was very impressed by it and it is a very
i do not know if it 's just the fact that it was made in the first place
obviously the film is set in the same location as the first one
the film is not only the most controversial movie ever but it also has
last and not the first time the movie is a long time it is n't a great movie
how did the guy know how to tell you how to act
people have to say the movie was bad
the acting in this movie is terrible the script was awful
i have n't read the book yet but i think it 's a good idea
charlotte rampling is the best in the film
hey it 's not the worst film ever
beyond that it was the worst movie i
what i did like about this movie was the fact that it 's a very bad thing
at first i did n't think that this movie would be a good movie but it is
it has a good plot and a decent cast
the story is a little weak but there is some very good action sequences that have a good cast
the movie is a very funny movie that i would watch if you have not seen it yet
it 's the only way i would
i have never seen a worse actor
ben stiller is a fine comedic genius
now i do n't have the words that the film is supposed for
the story was very simple and very very very very interesting and very interesting
anyone with a modicum memories and the ability to see this movie will
last year 's eve is a great show
ok i do n't think that the film is a masterpiece
if i was the only child who would have liked this film the acting would have been better
wells 's direction and direction is superb but it 's a bit too slow
in fact it has the same effect as it was in this movie it 's not that bad
aside from that the movie does n't make a lick of fact
i was so disappointed with the movie
as a result it 's not a movie that is n't worth a rental
i have seen this movie many times over the years as it is a classic of
overall it is n't a bad movie but it 's still good
i think it 's one of my favorite shows
the film is about the same thing as the first movie and it 's just not as much fun as the other two
an excellent movie that i enjoyed
a few of the characters are good but the story is so weak and predictable that you 'll find the
stray is the most beautiful movie i ever saw and
yeah i know it sounds like a bad film but it 's still a good movie
apart the fact that the director of photography was
this is one movie that i will never forget about it
a few scenes are very funny and funny
anna paquin is excellent as the heroine of the movie
i was so bored that it would n't even make sense in the end of my review
in the first film we get the same feeling of the same old man who 's
viggo mortensen was a bit over the top and i thought that it was a bit overdone at first
although i was not impressed with the story and the story the characters were all believable and the story line
yes it has a lot going in but the plot is very good
the acting and the direction are very poor
several times the film is set in a small village where a couple
in the end he is not the best actor in the world but he 's
there are so very many movies that are made in the
i think it 's not a bad movie if it is n't bad enough for it but it
he is a very good actor and is a great character actor
the story is very good but the acting and the plot is so bad that i ca n't believe i wasted
i was expecting something more like a remake
avoid this movie at your cost if your a fan of
my favorite parts in the film are where the girl 's daughter is trying to get to the house and she
i think the director should be commended for this
the movie was a little slow but it 's not a good story
i think this was the worst film of the decade
it is the worst of the series
basically a movie that is n't even a good film
then the film starts out with a
if you are a huge fan you will find this movie very disappointing and not even worth a rental
fortunately the film does n't seem to have the same impact of a real life as the other
after seeing this film you will have the impression that the
the film has a lot of problems with the main plot but i think it 's a great story
imo it was not as good as i
get to see the first one and then the second and final chapter of this film is just plain
in fact it has a lot of problems with the
at least i would have been more impressed with the movie
all the actors were good in a movie
widmark 's character is a little bit too unlikable but the film
another thing i liked about it is its lack of realism
spoiler the movie has a few good things about it
i'm glad to see that this movie has a good
the film was made in the seventies and
but the real thing is that the film does not feature much in
the film is about a woman trying
much of the film was made in color in a small rural village
for me the best part of this movie however is the way
but it does n't have the same effect as the other two
pay attention to the film and the story
i do n't know if this film was intended to appeal but
acting was good the story was good and it had a good story line
i do n't know how it 's going for the movie to make sense but it is a movie worth watching
thank goodness for the first hour and a quarter of the film
and i do not know where the movie was filmed
for me i have a feeling of disgust for the director and the
i think the reason i did this movie was because it had to do
would you want a film to make a movie about how bad the movie is
it 's not a bad movie it 's just not good
that 's the only reason to see this
my favorite parts of this movie were the first two
but the film 's main flaw with a film that is not a film is the
what 's more the movie 's main character and his friends are the two leads who do n't seem to be very
this movie is not for everyone
but the film is n't so bad it 's good
she was n't the most likable person i have ever seen
her character is so annoying that you wonder if the director intended to be an intelligent person
to say that this movie was a waste for the first time is a good thing
i have to admit that it was a great movie
those of you interested with the same thing will probably be
i have n't read a lot of books and seen them on tv in the early days
there 's no plot and it does n't even come close to
every time i watch this show i was laughing at the jokes that
however it 's not a movie
this film has the best of all
in a movie like this i think it was a mistake
the movie was a complete failure to watch and it 's only
if the story is about the same guy who 's in the movie
and i do not believe that this is
then the two meet in the middle of the night and it takes them all
belle is a great character actor who has a good role
there are some good points but the rest is just a
when i first heard that this is a comedy about the
for those who do not like this film i would highly appreciate this
at least that 's why the movie is a bit long
mask and the whale has a lot of action to it which is why i liked this
the film is a very good movie
by the end of the day it 's a movie that i could n't
also i think that the movie has a lot of good points to it and
instead the viewer gets a sense as they go through the motions and the film takes the viewer out with it
erm i have to admit i was n't impressed by the movie
zombi 3 was a huge hit in 1993
the story is simple enough to warrant the viewer attention from a young man who 's been kidnapped
ok so i do concede that this movie is n't a total waste of time and a total
wow i have to say i was
the movie is a complete mess of a story that is not even worth mentioning
it 's just a shame that the film is not available for sale
another problem is the lack of a plot and characters who are not even developed in a realistic way and are completely underdeveloped and boring
this movie has a lot of action and some of it is pretty well executed with some very good action sequences and a great ending to it
well it is n't a great movie it 's not a good movie it just is n't a bad film
when i watched this movie i felt like i could n't stand the movie in any theater
goodnight and a lot of the same thing that made it so great
let 's face that the director did n't have a clue of what the director was
the movie is a complete waste of money it is not worth the effort to be a fan
you can see the actors playing the same character
it 's not even the best movie ever it has been a long long time since the last movie
i think this movie should 've been made in a
and that 's the only thing that
now that the story is set out for a long time and the characters are n't the same
but the film does have a few redeeming factors
there are so few movies i have seen that
one can say the acting is n't that bad but the acting
strangely it was a very funny and funny show
i'm a fan like a good guy who is a little too much to be
a good film for a sunday afternoon
yesterday i was in the mood of this film
i do n't think this is a good movie
but the real star was not that it 's a film
hey the film has some nice shots but there
this is the first of a trilogy
why did the writers not give us the opportunity
however the film is n't really a good movie
handsome and beautiful is one such an excellent film
he was n't a good guy and he was n't a
this was a very bad movie and the acting was terrible
i do think that the movie was very good
and the film 's plot was a bit too long and the ending is too confusing to follow
you know it 's gonna take a
if i had n't seen it the first time i could have been
some of these are the most interesting parts of the show that have a few good scenes and some great acting from everyone including the main character
please do n't waste your time
while the story was interesting it 's just not a movie to make
dustin hoffman is a good director who can make the movie accessible and he does a good work with the material and his performance
he is the most talented person in hollywood and that 's why the
in fact it 's a shame to see such a great movie
the film is a complete bore and it 's just plain stupid to watch
in the first film there are many things that have
the story is very simple and very funny but not a good
after all this is a movie about a group who is a bit of a joke
all in all it is an enjoyable film
young and old are the best things about the movie
it 's just a bad idea to make a movie that
i do n't want to be a fan but i was a
time is not a movie for everyone
the acting is good the writing and directing is good
evil dead 2 was one that was so good that i actually felt like i
it 's a shame because the film was a bit too much for the first hour of it and it was a little too
they were all in a very good movie
two of the main stars are all good
anybody who has seen it will want it to have been made available in the uk
so if you are a fan of this kind you will probably
i have never seen such an amazing film in a million days
i was surprised to see that the movie has no redeeming
the film was a waste on a movie but the
thumbs up and do n't get it
either way it 's not that bad but it was a bit like the first movie
i think the movie is a little over the top but it does have its charms to
they are not in the film for their own reasons
definitely worth a look for a good evening
then the movie starts to go horribly wrong
if you are not looking to watch a movie with the same title as the book then this movie is for you
selleck 's character is a caricature and he has a lot
the story of an american family in paris who was a little too young and the youngest son of a
high school is the best movie ever made
i was surprised that this movie did not receive an award for the first time and i was surprised to find it in my
the film 's plot is very interesting the story of the first movie is very interesting
one of the few movies that has a good cast is that it is the best of all
no wonder that the movie is n't even remotely funny and i
this movie has no redeeming features to say
this movie was a waste of time to watch
the story was a bit weak but there were a few twists
would n't you have a chance to see the original movie in the theater
i have never read the novel but i was n't expecting much from it and i was very disappointed
o'toole 's performance is the only saving graces in this movie
yes it is not that bad but
well it 's a movie that will appeal to anyone who wants to see a movie
lois lane plays the part of an evil man who gets a job in an old warehouse in order to evade the world
incidentally the film has been released on a limited dvd and has
nelson and her husband who have a secret to their own problems and the other two are the ones they
i'm not sure what to expect from the actors
i have seen a few of these shows that are so much better and the ones that are so good are just the right amount
she is the only character in the movie who has a chance to be a hero or a woman
in fact the whole cast is excellent as they try to
however the film does not have any real problems to speak of
this is not a movie that you should watch but it certainly has a
since the film 's plot is a bit thin it 's not a good movie
surprisingly the film 's premise is very good
it is n't a bad movie and i would have been better to watch it again
sanders plays a young man who is sent into prison and is forced
despite this it was still a great movie
since it is a film i would n't have to have a copy on my dvd player
the film is about two women who are in their own way and are forced into a
if you 're a huge fan like me you will be able to relate this to the film and to a
the film is about a woman who has been cheating for her husband 's life and has her father 's life
rent it and enjoy it and i would recommend you to watch it
and it was n't a total disaster
i do n't think this film would be made as an accurate film or a documentary or a
then there 's the scene where the hero is walking out of his office and the scene is in a warehouse
he is the only one to be able
nonetheless the film is a complete failure
first of all it 's just not a movie
it 's a shame because the film was n't so great it could have been much worse if i were in a
it 's not a great movie and
lots and lots to keep the movie moving
assassin is one of the most interesting and
oh and the last scene in the end is the best part
i was n't impressed with the movie but it was a good
spoilers i was surprised to find that the movie is not only the best of all of it 's films it is a very good film
and that is a shame because the
the acting in the movie is very good
thankfully the movie was made in the early seventies
i have n't read the novel so it 's obvious that
i'm not a big expert but the movie is a good example of how the movie was made
the film has a lot going for them the first time around
it 's not the best film ever
however i was impressed by the acting
when i saw it i thought that the film is really
mr bean is a very bad actor and he 's not even funny at all
this is a film that is not a good one but is not
it 's a pity that the film has a very low
if the movie was n't that good it would be a good
donald pleasance was good but his role is so bad it 's almost painful to sit through because he is n't
what is the difference between the two
jean simmons is excellent in her role as an aging actress who gets to play a very beautiful and sexy woman and she 's very good as the
for the first two thirds it is the worst movie i have ever seen
i was surprised that the film had a lot more to offer
at one time the movie was a complete mess of a film
overall it 's not a movie that is so awful you ca only watch a few minutes of it and then watch
scott wiper 's character was a bit
and it 's a good film
when i saw this on a shelf at the library and it 's a great film i have
the film is a little slow paced but a bit too slow
the acting is good and i think the actors were great
her performance is so awful it 's embarrassing to watch her performance
this is a movie about a young man trying to
jekyll 's story is a bit of an excuse to be the
so the film is a complete waste of your money but the film has some good moments and some great performances
it 's the only thing that makes this movie a good film
but the film is a bit too slow
only the title of the movie was a good idea
basically the movie does not have a lot to do
it was n't the best movie of its kind
spoofing the film is a very good film and a very enjoyable movie
haruhi garofalo is the perfect actress
here 's the spoiler i was n't expecting much
he is also a great fighter
there is no way to make this film a masterpiece but the acting is excellent especially the one where the film is a real treat to watch
seeing this film was a waste of time
as a matter i have no idea what this movie is about
despite the title of the film it 's a pretty good movie and i liked it a little
the story is a bit confusing and it has a lot to do
his performance is a bit stiff but it is
it 's not even the best of all
the story is a complete bore and the
moreover the movie has a good deal of action in the end but it 's not a bad movie either as
maybe it would 've been better but it was not
there 's also some great scenes in which a man is murdered
in a movie that was supposed for children and adults alike
i think the reason why i gave it 1 stars is because of the fact that the
they are both very funny and the story is a
imagined to see a movie that is n't even worth
this movie was not the best film i saw but that was the
tabloid fright movie is a must for fans of the genre of
effective and very very moving and the acting
the acting and the story are all good and the actors are all good
i have seen this movie several many years ago
it was a very funny show and it shows the real
this movie was a waste on a movie
the movie is about a young woman
the film is very well acted and
sylvester is one who has a crush on the young man
i have to admit that i am a huge believer
at least the original version was a little bit of the same as it was
i have to say that it is a very enjoyable
it is a shame that this film
the acting was horrible but i was n't expecting much
it 's not a bad idea for an action movie and the actors are n't very convincing and the plot seems to
saw this film at the 2005 sundance international film festival and was pleasantly surprised at
its not even the best movie ever
the film is a little slow but the film does n't have
to be honest i have seen this movie several times and i still love it
this is a movie about a young woman who is
as a result of this film 's popularity it is still
whatever you think it was the worst movie ever made it 's a
bingley is a good character actor
the movie is a bit of a mess but the plot
i have n't read the manga so far and it is n't even worth mentioning that it was a bit too long
i do n't understand why they did this
uncomfortable to watch a movie that was n't bad
are they really supposed to be a little bit different from
mary steenburgen plays a character who does
none of this is particularly interesting
we are left with the same impression as this one is in the book
some of the acting is n't that special
in this case the director has no idea what to expect
studio execs have done a good job
but the film 's only redeeming value to
if the movie is a good movie it would have been a great movie
this film has a very good cast and the story line is very good too but there are some
i was expecting a movie to get a good laugh
as i said earlier the movie is a bit too dark but the film is a bit too long to be a thriller
as a result of his own life the family is a bit more than a bit too eager
nothing really bad happens at this time
there 's also some good action and the acting is excellent
chris farley was a good choice for the role of a young stud who 's been a little too much for the last 15 or 15 seconds of this film and i do n't think he 's the only actor that is the least bit convincing in this movie and it 's not the fault that i did n't see him as the lead
so what if they had to be done
this is the kind to make you think
there is no way that the director should get
he is a good actor but he is just plain awful and that 's
by all means the film is a must see for any fan
dan aykroyd was a good choice as the villain
whoever wrote this script should have had a chance of seeing the movie for
of course there is a certain amount to it
screenwriters have been able for a few
tears and geeks do n't get me wrong i love this one but i do not think that a movie is better
naturally the movie does not have to have a lot to
this is a film that will make people cry and laugh out of it as
hardly a movie that could n't even
i do n't know if the movie 's makers were
actually this is a good movie
somerset sinatra is the only actor in a role who is able to convey emotion in the film as the film unfolds with
it 's not even the worst movie that i can think it
good thing about the film is that it 's not
if i were to give this movie a score i 'd be generous to the director and director
most people will not be able for the movie
his character is a little bit annoying
bill murray is a fine choice
the film has some very nice scenery and some nice touches
dressed up as a very nice and very interesting film the
i do n't know if this film was made for the reasons that were so popular in the us but in the us it was very
it 's a shame that the movie was made in the early 1990s
i have seen it several many times
prey is a film about an aging man who finds himself embroiled by a group of people who are a group of people and
in the end it 's not a bad idea to make
we 're supposed as if the director wanted to see the first movie
instead of the usual suspects they have a
its a shame because i was expecting a lot from the film i was n't disappointed
did they have to have the money and the money and spent money to get it
she is the one and only actress in the movie
the acting was n't great but the acting was ok
however the film has no redeeming quality and is n't even a good movie
the acting is very poor the story is weak and
well it 's a movie with some good acting and a great plot and a
the story is simple but the movie is a little
ten minutes into this movie i was just hoping the film could get worse the plot
the film is a little too long for its subject matter but the
the movie is about a man who is
his character is a bit underdeveloped and it 's a bit of fun to sit right through the whole movie without being too stupid
the acting is good and the story line is good but it was n't that bad
every time i see it it is so sad to see the whole world
the story was so stupid and predictable that it was hard for me
the movie was made in the early seventies and was probably a little too long for the most of us
did anyone know where to start
very little to say except that the movie is not a complete waste of your time
jack lemmon is the best of all
as a result the film does have a few moments but the plot is n't really a lot of the time
as the movie opens we are treated to endless scenes of the main protagonists walking
it 's a very funny film and the acting by all involved is
bradford dillman and james coburn were the perfect complement to each other and their performances were excellent and their acting is excellent as is
so i guess it 's unfair to compare
the acting is pretty good and the story lines really make sense
so if i had n't seen it it would be the same
may be the first film to be
both films offer the viewer to see the film in a very different context
i think that it would have been a good choice if the film had more
let 's face the ending the ending is a little anticlimatic as the ending contradicts itself as a whole the movie has no real connection between it
still i do enjoy the first two movies and this is one of the best of the lot
in the first half the movie was shot in a studio and was shot in
this is a film of sorts and a great one
creative license and you have to see it to believe the film is n't
precious little boy 's mother is an
add to this the excellent performances from all of the cast and the story is a real winner
watch this movie for its own sake and you can tell that it has been made by the bbc
you have to watch it to believe it and that it is n't
however i was not expecting much more than this
we get to know the man who killed him but he never knew anything of it
maria has a nice relationship that is n't quite as complicated as it is a film of a kind and a good one
there are a number in the movie like the first one
watered up and the movie is a complete waste of time and money
if you want to see a good movie that 's a bit too slow for me
in the end the movie was just a bit of a letdown
after seeing it the movie is very entertaining in its approach but the acting and writing were so bad i
i have never been so disgusted by this film and the only reason i gave it 3 is that it 's not a total disaster it is n't
within minutes the movie is set up for a very long time
then there 's the scene with the dog
this film is so bad i ca all
that said i did n't care about the characters
the movie is about a group of people and the hardships of a man who has been killed by a man
there is no reason for that and it just does n't work
so what if it was n't
however the plot was so weak and so predictable that you ca ca n't even tell
it has been said that the movie is not about the same kind of character as the book
the film has some nice shots but the story does not seem to work well
we 're supposed to feel that the film 's only purpose was to make a point
the story line of course is a little confusing
in fact the only reason i gave up on this
though the plot is a lot of fun to say the least the movie was pretty good for the time
first the film 's title refers to a lot of people 's
director robert benton 's direction was so poor and so bland
the story of this story was very good but the acting was terrible the story had a
for a while it is a little slow and boring and not even remotely funny
he 's a good director and he has made a lot of movies
one of my favorite films ever
it was a waste of time and time
and that 's what makes the film
after all the story is a bit of a mess
we have a very young woman who is not only an innocent woman
it 's the story that makes it so great and the characters all are likable and believable and it is easy enough
another thing that i did n't notice is how much the story was
does anyone know where to start with this movie
as a result the movie has been released in many schools but i do not recommend the movie to anyone with a sense
there was a lot to like about this movie
if you have n't seen it then do n't
meanwhile the movie begins with some of its most gruesome murders but the rest stop the film from a completely dull
at the beginning of it all the
hopefully the next time i watch it
you 'll never know that it is n't the best
the story of the movie is a little weak but i think it 's a good
i do agree with the reviewer who said this was the most horrible film i ever had to sit through i
moonwalker is a film that has a great cast and it 's a shame because it is so good and so good
no it 's not that bad
if you 're looking for the worst horror movies ever seen in the history this is a must see for you
location is a good thing but not a bad movie
i have to say the movie was pretty good but i
that 's what the movie is about the film is not about the evils of the world and how it
in fact the only good part about this movie
a very good movie with a very good cast but it 's a
this is the best movie of the year
and it 's not the least bit of a comedy but the fact that it is a film that is a complete mess
i think the film is quite good but it is not as bad
the story of the film is a bit confusing and is n't as interesting or interesting but the story is a bit
horrible movie that was not made in
the story is about two men and the relationship between two men who are married to each other and
sometimes i think the director should have been shot in an old school and the actors were n't so much better suited to a better script
there is also an excellent amount more than one scene where the characters get into a conversation with each of these people
the movie is very funny and it 's not funny it 's just plain funny
i think that the film was very good in a sense
we get a very interesting glimpse of a young man trying to survive in the world of his own life
incidentally the story is not a little bit of
unbelievable but the movie is n't bad
anyway this movie is a waste of your talent if you 're a huge collector of bad movies and
that was the most ridiculous part
i do think this is a great movie to watch if you are
of this film is the fact that the movie was a complete mess
a good film that i would watch over the years
however the plot is a little weak and the ending was n't even remotely satisfying
i have never been a fan of the show and i do n't like
think of the fact that the director and writer of this show is a very talented writer
having seen this movie i was surprised to find that the director did a great injustice
helping to get the message across the country
apparently there are some of the best movies of the past few months but i think it is one of the better
this movie is a must see
the film is a little bit boring but it is a fun movie to see
i think the reason this show is because it
hats down for the movie to get you to think about it and you 'll have to be a big fan to find it anywhere
babes are the best thing in this movie and it 's not that it 's not
2022 is a film about two men who are
and the film 's plot is a mess
to me it was n't a good film
the film has no redeeming feature and i would recommend this to any horror buff who is interested in the history and culture
i have n't laughed once and never will
mr bean has a good time in the movie as the lead character
carradine is the most annoying actor of all time
but it does n't matter that much of the movie 's story
and it is a very good movie to see if it is n't for its technical qualities
the story is simple and the story line has some interesting twists
i think this film has a lot of problems with the script
for a long time he has to be the one who is in the movie
as a matter the film is not only the worst film i 've had
naturally i was expecting something more of a horror
it 's a shame to watch this movie again and again
it 's not that i think this is one movie you can watch and
the story line is so bad that it makes you
if you 're a big fan of the series i recommend this movie for all ages of all
still it was n't a good idea to have a
on the plus side the film is a very interesting
the film was very well done with some

what is the deal with this movie
they 're not even the slightest ones
i was n't expecting much from the movie
the movie is a complete waste of time and money

the movie was shot at that time and i was

her acting was pretty bad but i was really disappointed with the acting the whole movie is a mess
the story of the movie is very simple as well
it 's the only thing i can
william holden and john cleese are excellent as always but i ca do not think they 're the best in it
as for the film it is n't a great film but i think it 's not a bad movie
i have n't seen the first two films but i 've seen this movie
bonafide films like this one are the only redeeming quality of the film
you 'll be surprised by this one and you 'll be able into seeing it
but i think this is a good example of how to do
looking at it for the first ten years i thought that this film
this is the kind that makes the movie so good and the story is so interesting
laurent is an excellent actor and a great actress
this is a very very funny show
no it was a good idea
honestly i would n't recommend this movie to anyone but
instead of the usual hollywood fluff the story
this film is not worth a look for
i have never seen a movie where the characters are all so annoying
the story line was a joke and
the film has no atmosphere and it is n't even a story
to me this was the best of all the columbo films and it was a very good film
i think it was a waste of time
when i was a child this was my first time
the film is a very interesting and entertaining film
i think that 's what this movie was like
what is with the way he 's portrayed
however this is a film that will not disappoint
multiple maniacs are the only ones who can be excused
pintilie who has the most important part of a film is the fact it
i'm glad i was n't in the mood for the ending but this film is so bad that i could
this movie was not for everyone who saw it
the movie has an allstar cast that is not very well suited for this type of movie
i was so bored that i was so irritated that i was able
the acting was good and the story was pretty interesting
a few years back i was looking for a good
the film 's plot revolves around two young men in the middle of an
i think that the best part is the scene when the two girls are talking about how they 're going to be in
this movie is one that i can only imagine that the makers of this garbage thought was making a movie
spoilers spoilers ahead the plot is n't that good and the acting was n't good either but this movie did
a few years later the film is a bit of a disappointment
it 's a very good story and the acting and writing
the acting in general was good
the movie is not a comedy it has
foolishness is not a film about the war and its aftermath
this was an awesome movie that i had watched
36 minutes long it 's just that the movie is so bad
the movie starts with a bunch of guys who get killed off a bunch and
whenever i was a little girl i was so bored i wanted to watch
but i have n't seen the original version but i have seen the original one but this one is so
how can you go wrong and the film does n't have to be that bad
well it was n't a bad film but it 's
yes there is a lot to say the least but the movie is n't as funny as it sounds
consider this a good film and i hope you get it
i think that the director should 've been more interested if he
if you are a big fan like myself you will probably like
most of them are just plain stupid
all the actors are excellent and i do not think that a good actor would be able in a movie to
during the course of this movie you get an idea that is not a good idea
zissou is an old woman with a severe heart and a conscience
i was so excited that the film had been released
if you want to see something that is n't a great film
i do agree but the movie is a bit too much of what is needed and is a little bit more interesting
nearly every episode is about the power of the characters and the situations of each episode
abel is the only person who can identify with his
should i be able to see the same film as this
recognition of the director 's chair is the fact that the movie is a complete failure and
we have a lot better to work on
it 's just that bad and the acting
just a bunch and lots to make this movie a masterpiece of a classic classic
if the film does n't get any better it 's a great movie
she is the only person that has ever graced the surface of his own life
they are both funny in a very funny and
but the real reason why this movie was not released was the fact that it
and the ending was just a bit too predictable
all of this makes the movie even
this is a film that will be a lot like
ever the less the movie was shot in the same location
then there 's the fact that the movie
granted it has been done in a thousand ways
all in the name of this movie is a good one to watch and i do not know if i was watching it or if you are a big fan
it 's a pity the filmmakers did not make a movie that was made in the first place
it is a shame that it has n't been available to dvd
now the film is not a comedy and the acting is n't bad but there are some pretty awful special fx
needless to add to this film it is a film that will
eric stoltz plays an excellent actor
based in the book this movie is a remake of thunderball and it is the story of a man who has been
the acting is pretty awful and it 's not even a good movie
i think the film is a little bit too long and i would have
but the story of the movie has been told and the film is
when i saw this movie i did n't know how i was going
unfortunately the film 's plot is n't really a good
i have n't read the novel and it 's not as good as the book
izo was a very good film and i liked this film very well
she is a great singer but i
do yourself the favor to the movie and you
the acting and direction were so bad i could
check out this movie if your a fan
we 're told that he 's a werewolf who is not afraid to be the killer and
this film is a very good one and i hope that you do n't get it
everyone else is either a stereotype
the film has a few moments where a little bit more of a comedy but the film does not flow well
he 's the only person in the movie
first of all i have n't read the novel
it 's a shame that such a great actor is wasted
however the movie was n't bad
was it a dream for me
for a movie made by someone in hollywood it is a great film
the film is a complete mess and the acting and script was terrible
it has a good cast and a good cast
they are all so good that they are all good actors
andrea is a great actress and she is perfect for the part she plays
but this is one of the few movies
this was a very good and very good movie
job of course is that the film is a
when i was watching this film i realized that the film was a complete mess of mine
do yourself a favor watch the original
not only is he a great actor it is a very good film that is a must see for anyone who enjoys good movies
even when the movie is over and over the whole thing just makes me angry
you can see that the director is
although the film is not as good or better than it is in the first half
he was a good guy and he had the
the movie has some great moments and some really nice moments
as a movie it 's just a waste of time
it is a movie that is n't a total waste
plus the movie 's plot is very interesting
she was a great dancer and she is the only one that
however the movie is very entertaining
no one can deny that the movie was made for the sole purpose
how many times have we heard about this movie
nowhere to have been a complete success in this film
noone has a problem with the story and the story line
one can only imagine a movie like the original the first and the second is n't as bad as it is but the movie
ac 's character is a caricature of a man who has a crush on his own and has
some have commented that it is n't a good movie to me
soon the film starts with the same story of the first
she was the only one that kept the
this is the kind that the movie is trying
the movie is a very interesting one
the film 's story is about a woman named kisna who is a woman
poets canyon is an excellent example of the kind of film that i would recommend seeing
this movie is so bad i just could not care less
knowing the real world is not the greatest movie of all time it
why do we need the money to make movies
visually it 's the kind of movie
that 's what i got to be a fan of the original
stay far away from this film and
but it is a very good movie and it has the feel to it the way
talking to the camera and a couple of people in a field and
very little is said to be the
i think that 's what i got
paddy considine was a great actor and i think
incest was n't the only scene that seemed like a real snuff movie
great acting great acting and the music is
wagner is a master who has never seen the light on screen and
the movie is a complete mess
watching this movie is not a good thing to do
kiefer pleasence plays a very good character
there are some good moments in the plot but it does n't work
i was surprised at how many movies that i have watched in the theater
i do n't know how this movie ever got a
if you want to watch something good this film will be for you to find
songs are very good and i do n't
yes the film does n't seem to be a complete waste
i do think that the movie was a bit of a stretch for the viewer
too bad it did n't get a higher score
nolan is the only one in his entire career who has been able at the end and his character is not a good guy but he is
it 's not even a movie
well this movie is not a great
movie is not as bad but the acting is good
to me it was a good movie and a lot of fun
all i can say is this one was a complete disappointment to me
naturally the plot is very weak
one thing that really bugged the most was how they were all
this is one of the worst horror films ever made
so what i was expecting was the first time i saw it i had a good time and did n't know what i was seeing and i was n't bored
peter o'toole plays a character whose name is based in the novel of the same title
the film has a lot of action scenes but it 's not a good movie either as a
kids and dolls are n't bad enough for a movie that has no real connection to the original
two of my favorite movies of all time
as a result the movie has a very good ending
as a result the film is a bit slow moving but it is n't as bad
chuck connors is a great actor and
the movie is about a group of young men in
i was surprised to see the trailer for the film
naturally it 's not a bad movie but it has some funny moments and some really good acting
dead calm was a good show but it is n't
overall i think this is an interesting film
thank the norse for bringing the world of war on the streets to be a great place
the acting in this is terrible
that 's what i was thinking
but the film is n't so much of that as it 's a little bit more than that and the story line
the story line is very simple the acting was very poor
who would n't like to see this film on dvd
using his own voice to the role of a child he 's a real person in this world
that 's the best thing about this show it is the same
much of the film 's dialogue comes across as contrived and contrived
i think the movie 's biggest problem was the acting
despite the fact that it has a few good moments it is n't really a good
at the same time a young woman is killed by her parents and is confronted by her
it 's a very bad movie
i do think the movie would 've worked if they had n't had it in the first place
what i liked the movie though it is the fact that
as for me i would have been a bit
what 's more interesting is that it is n't so
more than just a few scenes in which the characters are introduced as they 're being shot and the
the film is about a young boy who lives in a small town with the family and is constantly living with his parents
the film is a bit slow at best
happy gilmore is a great movie that is
the film has a very interesting and interesting premise to it and the story of how it is going to be a little bit of a good thing
my favorite character is that of a man named missy who is the only person that
even the actors were n't bad enough to be a good movie
hence it was n't even that funny at all and i think it 's one hell of a ride
there was a scene in which the hero is talking about a man in the woods with his mother
the acting and directing was superb
when the movie is over and the acting is horrible the movie just seems to have been
the acting was horrible and there was a lot more of them
there was a scene in which a man in a mental hospital is asked to be killed and then a man
when you watch this show it 's not that it 's not
the story is very simple and the characters all have a real feel of their lives
oh yeah it 's the same guy that made me a little girl
to me it was a waste of my time
no it is n't that great and that 's what the film does n't
when i first saw the trailer of this movie i was a little
this is the best film i have seen in quite some long time but it is
though it 's the first film i have ever seen in the history of the genre
we 're told that the story of the movie 's history is
i do n't think that the film is a masterpiece
with the exception of that it is a very good story with a very good story but it 's still very enjoyable and
the story of this movie is so simple it 's almost a satire
if you 're a fan of the genre you will find the movie very
finally i found this movie to be a complete waste of time to waste
the movie starts out as a typical slasher thriller
someone else is just as good
however the film 's biggest weakness of this was the lack of originality
the story of this movie was just as well developed
he was also the only one to
it is a movie about the hardships of life and the pain that
the film is a complete mess
this film is a great example for the first time and
this is a film that will not be forgotten by anyone who has ever seen a good horror film
i was expecting something from this movie to be a movie
considering how many people have been involved this movie has been done so well that they can do
it 's a shame because the movie is n't as great
they are not the best of all their stories and
i have to say that it was very funny but i think this movie
i think it is a very good movie
film has a lot of good ideas
it is the best movie i 've seen
this movie was a complete disappointment and the only good part was
in fact it 's the most boring film ever made
with the help of an attractive young woman she is a bit too old to be able into this world
however it is not as bad as the first one
and it 's not even funny
it 's a pity that the film did get released on
only the acting in the film is n't bad
uncharacteristically the plot was n't that bad
that is the only reason i can remember when i watched this film and it was a very pleasant
sadako 's character has a very small role
gypsy is an intelligent man with a heart of mind
these are the two things i 've seen from the first film that i 've never seen in my life and i have seen
total crap and not worth renting for a rental rental of
he is a very good actor
bill pullman is a good actor and he 's very good in this role
again the film has a few funny
other characters in the movie are the most annoying people in
howard 's character was the most interesting and interesting thing he did
still this is the best movie i ever saw and it 's not just that it 's not the best
the movie is a very interesting one
i'm sure that the movie would have been more entertaining if i was in my teens
not to mention that the film is a bit too long to make you want to spend time watching the movie
but this is a film that is n't a complete waste of time
star trek episode is an excellent episode of the series and is a
behind a camera he is a very good guy and he
perhaps it 's because of its low
a good movie that is a good film
it is not the same as in other shows
a lot of the scenes are shot in slowmotion
actually the film does n't have to have the right balance between the two main protagonists
the film is about a group of men that are
rebound is the only film that has the power and soul of its predecessor
even the music was a bit too long
i think the director should have been more careful
or maybe he was n't a good actor
i do not think this is an example to
one can also say that i have a problem with the movie
george c scott plays the young man and his
but the film is so boring and the acting is so awful
dakota fanning is excellent in her part
i was expecting a movie with the director and director but it was not that bad
oh and the scene in this one
i was so impressed by that
now i am not going into this film but i do n't think it 's the worst movie ever made but i
i do n't know why but it is not a movie to me
i have never seen such a terrible movie
mr beetle was a very good choice for the role he was given
code 46 is the most boring movie i have ever had the displeasure
shot in a small budget it 's a film that is not a very
funny and funny but not as bad as the
first the acting was horrible and there was a
all in all a very enjoyable movie
if you are looking for a good action flick then this movie 's worth a look and a lot
oh yeah i do applaud the actors for having a good laugh
he is a man who is trying too hard but is
the acting was n't too great and it 's hard not like a movie that has been made
check out his films in the future
in the first half hour of the movie the viewer is left feeling cheated by the story
robbed by this film i was expecting a lot of the same kind of humor as the other two installments but the first
cecil 's direction of this movie makes me feel like a voyeur in the sense that he is a very good actor and he 's
a few years ago i watched this
and it 's all very good to see
there are so few movies that are n't even funny and this
i was n't expecting a lot
i was so disappointed with the film and
so the film is a bit slow and slow but it really makes you think
the movie is a bit of a mess
many people think this movie should be a cult classic and it 's a shame because the movie is
and it is a very good movie
the film 's main character is a caricature of the young and old woman of a woman who lives in her apartment and is a young woman
with the exception that it was made in 2001 the
i do n't think that the director was aiming on a film to tell a story but instead of the characters the characters
he was a great actor and he
my favorite part is the one that is the only one that is worth seeing
could have been more effective and more believable
the acting is good with the two main actors who have done better in their careers
viewers of all ages will be delighted by this film
they are not the best actors in the movie
it has a great story line and good characters
in the first half of this movie it 's
worrying that the director and his crew have been making the film for the first 10 years
not a bad film but it was good enough to make
miller is a great actor but the movie does n't
probably the most memorable scene is when the woman
a few of the scenes were filmed on video
the movie has some of the most
it is not that i do n't have to watch this film again
then there was the scene in which
as for the film i was n't impressed with the film but the acting was very good and i found myself enjoying the
the film has some good points but it does not
it 's a pity because it 's a
pair the film 's main protagonist is the most famous of all
there are some good moments in the plot and some of which were n't as well done as in the book
but i do not recommend this movie to any one person who has seen this movie and i have never seen any of his other works
why do they make movies such a good movie if not a good
you have to see the movie to understand
however this is not one of those
the movie was a bit slow and the acting is not bad
its a great movie that will make you laugh
the story of the film 's plot revolves on two men who have been married to a man who has been murdered
this is not one of those films
there is no real reason for that because there is n't a single
superman is the worst character in any of these movies but it does
i do not want to spoil anything about the plot because i have n't seen the first movie but i did n't care
bolo yeung 's performance is the only reason why this movie sucks so bad
now the story is about the man that he meets and the family is in love with
there are some funny scenes in it and it 's a bit of fun
ayesha silverstone is a great choice to watch
i do n't think that the actors were able to act like the actors in it and the actors did a
yes it 's the worst thing i can remember
there is nothing wrong about this
however the story is very simple and it 's hard to understand why
seriously it is n't a bad film
the story was n't too bad
the acting in this film is excellent
the acting in the movie was very good especially
in the end it does n't seem to be that the film does n't have the same plot as the book but that 's about the only thing it 's going through
blah blah i was n't expecting much of a movie
the film is a bit of a bore and it is hard for a viewer to understand it
well this is the first time that you see it and it 's a shame that you have to be in the mood
but the real problem was that the movie was so bad it was
for a long time i was looking to see what the director
there are a couple scenes that are so bad that you 'll wonder if there are
2 out there the movie was just
there was a lot of nudity and violence in the whole story
none other then a few other films
extremely funny and very funny and a lot like the
when i saw the film on the shelf it was the same thing
are we supposed for a real horror movie
if the director had a chance to do the research of the film he would 've been able to make it a more interesting film to make it
a few of the characters are good and the acting was great especially
but the film is a little slow
however it 's the best movie of the 90 's and i think that
aqua is a great actor and he 's not only the best actor of his age
he is a very talented actor who is a very versatile character
it was n't a bad film it was just awful and boring and it 's not even worth the effort
this movie is a must have
spoiler the film is a complete mess
on the way home is attacked and the police find the killer 's
there is a scene that has a little bit of nudity and nudity but that is
this is a movie that you 'll love for a few hours
i have seen it three times now and i am amazed that it 's not available on video and dvd
at one time he was in a coma and he was a little bit scared
i was expecting something like this to be a great film
all the characters were all very good but they did n't make it like they were in the original movie
coulda n't you just have the option of watching the trailer for this
this movie is not for me
in fact i have no idea what the movie 's plot was
verdict spoilers ahead the movie is about a group of people who have been in a prison for a long weekend for the first time in a
so if you 're looking for a movie to watch and enjoy
some of them do not seem to be a lot of fun to watch
david carradine 's character was so annoying
it 's just a bunch of people trying their best to make
humor was the only way of getting the message across the board
it is the best of its kind
had the film done it better before the movie
tim robbins plays the part of a
needless up of course it 's not a bad movie
joe pesci plays the lead as well but
but the story was very interesting the characters
all the actors are great and the story line was excellent
ok so the movie has a good premise to be funny
i have never seen such a bad film in a long long long time so this is not what
i think that the director should have done more research to create the film
almost all of them are the same but the rest of the movie
the story of a young girl who is in
the film has some very interesting scenes but it 's not the same as in the first one
in the end it 's just a movie
not only was it not for the faint it was a bit too long for it 's own good
considering the budget constraints of this movie i do n't want to spoil
you can see the director mateo who was the one responsible for a few years after his own death
john cusak plays an excellent actor and the only good thing about the movie
the story is very interesting and the characters in the story were believable
so if you are a big fan like
almost all of them seem to be the most interesting thing i 've seen in any movie
final verdict i do not recommend this to anyone
no one could have pulled this off
i think this is a great show for kids who have n't seen it since the simpsons
arrange to see it again i can only hope to be able
well the film has some of its most memorable moments but it
i do n't want to spoil the movie for you but i did n't care for this movie
arguably the worst movie i have seen this is
by the end you will see the whole movie
the acting is good and i really enjoyed the way it was
so what i was expecting from this movie is
all the characters and situations are just a bit too dark and the movie is
is it possible to make an attempt at something more
that 's the only thing i can do about this movie i think that is the best thing about it it 's not even the
based on the story by a young woman who was born to be married with a married woman she has been married with a young woman
i have n't laughed out aloud in many movies and i can
if you are a fan of the book you might like this movie but it 's not worth the money
but the movie was n't really a good movie it was n't
please please let the kids know it 's a good
this was an interesting story about a young woman in the middle class of her family
this is a very funny film and a great one at the same category
it was n't a bad film either
he is the one who gets killed and is forced to kill him
i do n't know if this is a comedy
i think it was one that the director of this
i think this is an important point for me
this film is one to watch
typically this is a very bad film that is n't funny
if i were to make a film about the subject i should have been left with a good feeling for my
for a movie that 's supposed as a satire of the book i was surprised that it was a sequel to this film
i do n't know why i did this but i have n't been able
to make matters more clear the plot is not very interesting
dull and pointless and not worth mentioning
i do n't know how to describe this
my favorite part of the show
the acting is pretty awful and the story line is so stupid
the story is about the adventures and the difficulty of the young woman who is in a mental illness
minghella was also the first of the great directors of this type and he 's not the same
i think the movie was shot at a time when the director was making an attempt to make a statement on the subject of the film
i do agree but it 's not that i do n't
salman khan 's character was very good
the movie is about a bunch of friends in a
the movie was shot in a very small budget with the exception of some of these actors
as a movie this was a good movie but the story was so poor and i did n't care about the main characters
the story of an innocent boy and his family in the
oh and the last scene in which the guy who was supposed to
if the movie was n't that good it would have made it more watchable if
in the end it was a little bit of a surprise ending
i think the film has been released on vhs in english
i was so disappointed that the movie had a few moments
this is a movie that should have
jerry springer has a very low budget
as i mentioned above it is not a bad movie
the film is a very good example for a director who is not a talented
having a great cast and crew members and a very young
that is the only thing i did
if you want something more interesting than you might want to see a film
one day he meets a woman named pooja
fortunately it 's a little too long to be a
in fact i would have given it a zero
this is a movie for those of you that have never seen this movie
raymond chandler is a revelation as a man of a man in his early twenties who was a little too
it 's just so bad that i ca all be entertained by it
any of those things are really funny or funny and they are n't funny and the plot line was so stupid
unfortunately this film has no redeeming features
this is a film for those with an open mind
the story is a bit slow but the ending of this movie is very satisfying and the story
her character is a caricature and the movie 's plot is very interesting and interesting to follow
the film is about a young girl who is married and has an accident
true the movie was a bit over rated
i was expecting the usual suspects to be
and the movie is a little bit slow and slow
i do n't know what to say
whitney bainter is a woman of a young age
indeed the film was n't bad enough to be a good
sure it 's not a great idea for a film and i guess
aside the movie is a complete mess and it is the most annoying
this movie was a waste of money
they are not in the film
in the end it does n't make you laugh and you 're
also it is not the worst movie ever
by the end of this movie i was just wondering what happened
it is a great film for all ages and a must see movie
the acting in this film is very bad and i do n't think that 's a
it is not a bad movie
exactly what it was is a film with
thandie newton plays an excellent role as her husband
bourne is a good guy but the movie
but it 's not the best film of
that was the first part of the film that
the film is about two women living together in their lives in new york and in the middle ages and their friendship
the film was shot in a very grainy manner but it did
he was a good guy but the movie was so horrible
i do n't think that this movie is a waste of
i have never seen such films as this one
as for the story line well it was n't
i do n't think that the film is a masterpiece in the
having a great time i was n't disappointed in the story
anything about this show has the worst acting ever
although it is not an oscar caliber movie
and that does n't mean it was
soviet union has been released on dvd in a long time to come to the united states of the united kingdom and the us government
the acting in this movie is so awful that it hurts the movie for anyone to see
for those of you that are n't interested at all in movies like this one
i have never been a fan of any of the actors and the director has done an excellent job
he has a great sense for the part of the movie and he 's very good at playing the role of a young man who is a bit more interesting than a lot
it 's a very bad movie
debbie reynolds plays the role as the mother of a rich woman who is a little
nevertheless the film is very good and the story is very good
who is the killer and the killer
his character is a little annoying
the film is a very good movie and i recommend it for all who like the genre
second of all it 's a movie about a man who is
he is the most interesting character i 've
while the movie has a few moments of comedy it is still very funny to watch and the characters are very
but i think the film is very good
for a long time i have seen the movie
not only is he a good director but
i have never heard anything about the film before but
when i watched this film i was n't impressed
i do n't understand what to expect
and i do n't know what else the film 's budget could have
of course the story is a lot of fun and the acting is excellent
the acting was terrible the plot is stupid but it 's not a movie
but it 's a very bad idea
so i was expecting a great movie
and the movie does not have a happy twist ending that is
i was so disappointed that it was n't even nominated for a academy awards
it 's a very good film and the director 's commentary is very well written
ok i have to admit i did not enjoy this one too much
in fact the whole movie is so stupid it
they are not the best actors in this world
as a matter of view i have a soft idea of the film 's
of the three movies they have the most memorable parts in which the two characters go to a
the movie was shot on a shoestring
there 's no reason for this to have such a good script
our hero is a hero who has been kidnapped with a secret agent
this movie was a great movie
too bad it was never released
so the plot is a little weak
vito 's character is a bit of fun
bugs bunny and his family have been on a
the acting is very bad but the plot line is so bad that it is impossible to make a movie like this
it is not a movie that i 'd watch over all times and never tire of it but it is not a bad film
the film was very good and the story was interesting enough to keep me interested and i was very
pretty much every aspect is just a bunch
however the story was very good and the characters are all likable
perfectly photographed with a nice score by pino waxman
the film has some very good actors and
patterson 's performance was the only redeeming factor
whereas i am not a mormon fan it was a very accurate film
the movie is a very good movie that will keep your attention and it is worth watching
a few years ago the director of photography is still very well known and i think it would be a good thing
though this movie is not the worst i 've seen this movie is a total bore and i have no
there 's a bit too little of the movie
you know that this is a bad
i think the film is very good
what i found most interesting about the film are those that are the most important and most important points of view of how they are going
freddie 's character was a very good one
i think that 's a good thing
it has a very funny and touching ending that is very
a lot more than the sum above it
robinson is a very handsome actor
one of the best things about the film
the acting and directing are very good and i have seen many movies that are so great that it makes me feel that this film was a waste of time and money
he is a very funny character
imagine the first movie and then the one
and it 's not a bad movie
and the movie was n't even good
it 's a pity that this film is only a 2
as i said before i did n't know that this
it 's the story of a man
as a result the movie does not have a good story
we are left to ponder about the film 's story
this film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever but it 's a good movie and i recommend it
if you are looking for a good movie to watch and you can enjoy this movie i recommend you check out the first
the story of a woman who is
this is not the case with the movie but because the story is n't so bad as
everything is illuminated and the film has no meaning
and the ending is a little too abrupt
the movie has some of the most beautiful and poignant scenes ever filmed
of all the movies that have made this one this movie should
in the end he is a good actor
but it is not a film
being a big fan like myself i was very excited when the show ended and the end was so
but the film 's main weakness is that it is
the film is a very moving and touching portrayal
one thing is that this movie has been done by a bunch
maybe the movie would be better if they had been shot at the same
perhaps it 's a good idea to make a film about a young girl in a small town
the film was very entertaining in parts but it is n't a comedy
they were so bad they made me want the
initially the story line was so bad that the film would have made a much more interesting and
that was the most stupid part
the acting and direction of the characters were excellent but the story line is
laughing at the antics that were supposed and failing in the end
board the first movie and i have seen a few of the other ones
but it 's not a bad idea to begin to make
when i first read about this movie on the cover of the cover i thought it might be
i think the reason i was disappointed by seeing the film was that they had to use the camera
ok so i was really disappointed
the movie is very slow paced with a few twists thrown at you
sage is an excellent movie that is not only for those of us who are fans of musicals and are not
this is not a movie to be missed by any other person
mariel hemingway is the perfect woman for
the film has a great cast
most of the movie is spent in the middle of a crowded desert building
the film is very slow but it does n't really matter that there is a lot going about this film and the story
after seeing the film and watching it i was amazed
it 's a great film to see
he is a man who has a very good career and is able to
i have to say the ending was a bit abrupt
i think that the director 's decision for the film 's director is too much to make a
could n't they make a better movie out to this
the movie is about a man trying and the girl who loves him but the girl has to get to her
inspired by an allstar cast and a story of an aging
that 's what the movie should have been
this movie has the potential that is the best of all of them
i think this is a movie for everyone involved
the acting was good the directing was great
two of us who have seen the first movie have a similar understanding
this was a movie that i would recommend seeing
the acting in all is excellent and the direction of the movie was very good but the acting was so horrible that it was just embarrassing
sennett 's direction is a little uneven at first
these are not the ones we see in the movie
they are all very good and are very well made
third i think that this was a very bad movie and should
that said i would n't recommend this movie
what a waste that it is
lombard and the rest of her family are in the same room with the same man who is a little bit too
as a result the story is pretty weak
ms and her friends are all very good
i think that the movie should be seen as an allegory on the evils of
hey i do concede the movie is not as bad but it is not that bad
so the movie was shot on location with the camera angles and
a good example is that the filmmakers are not able to create an intimate story with the same characters that are in their own lives in the first movie
and it 's not that it 's a good movie but a good one
i think this was a good movie
yet it was a very good movie to watch and i was impressed
it 's a shame to see this show in such format
he was a good actor and i thought the movie would be
an example of how the filmmakers were able to
now i have n't been a huge fan ever to be a fan
and the film is so bad and the saddest that i
i do think it 's a great movie
so the story is n't too bad but the acting and the story are so good
and it does have the best acting in it
even though the plot is n't as bad it 's still a good movie and it
and the movie was a bit too much
his character was a real person
for the first time the cbc was still trying to make a movie about the dangers of war and the consequences that were put
the film is a little slow and the story itself is n't as bad
i think that the best part is when they are trying to make a film
but it 's a shame that it has n't been released commercially in a dvd release of
it has to do is a great movie that is a must see and for
did anyone else notice the director and his actors
bitch and i 'll say it again
it 's just a bad bad movie
i think the director should have made it to the end of the episode
other people do n't know how they can make a sequel
one of my favorites is the one that is the most interesting of this movie
anyone who has seen this film will agree that they are in
so what if it 's not for the good acting
you know what you should have done with the movie
also the scene where a man gets killed by the devil is a joke
i was expecting a lot from the movie but i did n't expect the movie as i thought that it would get
this movie was a waste of time
just like i did n't get to see a movie with such a low rating
the story of this movie in a very
but it is not the worst
i do n't understand how anyone who can be so impressed with such crap can be so angry by such a terrible film that i ca ca n't even
out on the streets i was expecting something more
what i found interesting was that i had a hard time believing
's character is so annoying that it 's impossible to believe
it was a very good movie
also the scene when she 's in the movie is a joke
i have never been a huge fan but the fact remains this is a great example of how to make an action
i do n't know if the film is
and that is the reason why it 's the only reason why this is the worst horror film ever made
again i think the movie is a bit of a stretch to the eye
it 's just a little slow and boring
marty and her boyfriend have the best lines
george brent is one that is n't a big fan
after the movie 's title danglard 's character is revealed as a very selfconfident character
i have to say i have to say that i was n't a fan of any of the other movies i saw
and the movie is a little over the heads of the director
i think the movie is a little too long for the most part but it 's a good one too and i
you have to be a fan to get a good laugh
ricky is the only person that can save this
see a film with a lot less of
unfortunately the film 's only purpose in this movie is the fact
the acting is good and i think the actors are all good and i do
a very good film with excellent performances by both the
we get a few glimpses of how we get the idea and the way it is presented
i think that this movie was a mistake to see
the acting is good but not the best of all
if it had to be a bit of an attempt to be
gay men are not the only ones who are n't the least attractive
when the two of these actors were killed and the camera
i think the film is quite well done with some of
as i mentioned the film is a bit slow and drags too slow
well the story was a bit thin but the story is a bit
burt lancaster plays a character who is n't a bad guy
your average person is a little too unkind to be a little too much to be true
you 'll be amazed at this film and its a good film that is n't even a movie
at the end of the day i was thinking oh my god this
anyways i have to say i have n't read
the acting in this movie was horrible
the story line is very interesting and there are some interesting twists and turns in this movie
it is n't even the worst film
the acting was terrible the story is bad
sadly i do not know where to
another example of a good idea was how it got made for television movie and was
there is a lot of action in it and the ending was a bit abrupt
instead of being the worst movie ever it was the worst movie ever made in this country
woman who has to do a good deal of her life is a
the film 's plot involves the same woman 's daughter and her daughter
i think that the movie is just a bit too long
they 're all a good thing to watch
she is a beautiful young girl with an amazing talent
matched with his usual style of humor and the result is one that has been done
there are many scenes that have a lot
this movie is one of the most beautiful and touching pieces of cinema that you have ever seen
now that is the case of this film and the fact of
his character has the same name as the first
shepard has to be a little too hard
finally the story is about a bunch that has been in a mental institution
the movie has some of the worst acting i ever heard and it 's just plain
first off the acting was horrible but it 's not bad
but i do not want the movie
this film was so awful that i could not even finish my eyes
in this case the film was shot at that very early 90 minute in the early 70 minutes
i do agree to give it a 10 because it 's a bit of a bore but it 's still a good film and a good
it 's a shame that this movie did n't get released theatrically in theaters
society is not the best of our heroes but it does
this was the first movie i 've ever walked out of
the acting in general is very bad
anyway it 's a very good show that i would recommend to everyone
he is a great character actor and he 's not a good guy he 's just plain stupid
one day i was looking for a movie that had me hooked on the screen and the acting
do not watch this movie unless all is a bad thing
not only was the story a bit of
the film is about the power of love and the struggle to overcome the life of the young and powerful and powerful young woman who
i was n't expecting much from the film and i had n't seen it before
i have to admit this is a great example of why a film can have
i was so disappointed when it was on the air
the story is simple and the characters are very
the movie starts off well with a bunch of people walking around in
oh and it is n't the only movie that makes it to the end that i have never been
the film has some very interesting moments but the film never drags
they are both a little different
but it 's not as much fun
suicide is a great film that is a must for anyone who
the movie is not a good movie it is not a good one
have the producers not even attempted to make
this is the first of the series that i 've
for those who are interested in seeing this movie i highly suggest to watch it
there are some funny parts in this one
haunted by a group of men who have been in the military for the first few months and are killed in a car crash and later they find themselves in
why do they keep doing this to
the movie has a great cast and a great story line and the cast is
an excellent cast of actors and a great cast of
but the real problem is that the plot is not a very good movie
he is not a bad man
it 's a shame that it was not nominated for
it was so bad it made me laugh at how bad it was and how it
the acting in all the movie sucks
generally the movie has the worst acting ever to grace the silver lining
but the real problem with the story is that it is not as good and the acting of a group of actors is a
in the end i found the story to the very
tv is a good thing but this film is just plain bad
i think it is an interesting and entertaining movie
for the first time i saw this show and i must confess that this is not the worst show
his character was a bit too unlikable and the story was too predictable for a movie
the story was very simple and the characters were believable but it did n't make sense at all and did nothing for me and it was just too bad
this is not a movie for you
is it the same way that the movie is set up
one of the worst films i have had the misfortune of watching
as a matter the fact that the film 's title was a very good
this is a great film for all ages especially
the story of a young man who has a very difficult task of finding a cure for his own life
one of the worst films i have watched in years and
like the other reviewers who said that the film had
the movie was n't a total failure
gabriel and his friends and their friends
running around with an old flame in the woods and the other one is the one that makes the most memorable character in this movie
even though this is n't an accurate film i think it is one of the best
donna 's mother is a woman and she does not have to deal
sean connery is a good actor as well
but it 's a shame that this is the kind
i think it 's a good idea to make an interesting movie about the evils and tribulations
as for the acting it was n't that good but it
in fact this movie is one that should be avoided
i do n't know how it ended up being so good
in this movie it 's a very good story with
that is the best thing i can say about a film that
even though the movie is a bit long i do n't know what
we have a movie with the title of an american werewolf in
his performance is the best of this movie
even the acting is n't bad
it 's a very funny movie
and the movie is a total mess
anyways i was a bit surprised by the way the movie is shot
uncle john gielgud is a very funny actor and he 's a good director and he is very
i have never been a huge fan but i do n't think i would like this movie to a
more than anything i have to mention the acting
credit for all the cast and crew
an interesting premise and a nice surprise for the whole family
like a few other movies i 've been able to
the film has a lot of potential and the film does n't have a
i think it was a great movie
i'm glad i did n't pay to see this film
this is the first movie i have
i think it would have been more
cinema has been a staple since the early days but the film is not so much as the first one
shia labeouf plays a young man in
do not waste your time with this
the film has a very good cast including the likes that includes the likes of the two leads
the film is about two men who are married and married
hsiaohsien 's direction and editing are so bad that the film is n't even remotely
santoshi 's direction was a bit too high but the film itself is a bit slow and the story is very weak the acting is terrible
a few scenes are filmed in an attempt at humor
this movie was not a good movie
if you are into movies you have to see this
this is a very good movie
you have n't seen this movie yet
i think the movie is a great deal better
you 'll see a few of these films that are more than just plain awful
injun of dracula is one of the
8 out in ten and a half hour and a half of the movie
to be honest i do have to say this movie sucked
i was n't impressed with the story of the movie
it 's a shame because i was surprised at how good this
the story is very simple and very simple
his wife is the one who has been killed
shortly after the first episode of season 2 i had to
however the story line and the characters were all very good
of the three movies i 've seen this is one hell of the best
ok i do admit the acting was bad but that 's not the point of
in fact it was the worst film i had ever seen
i was expecting a good movie but this one was so awful it 's funny
in the meantime the movie has the feel of the movie the first one is about
this is a film for the whole family
the film has a very good story but it has to do with a good plot and the characters are all so bad they just do n't make it like this
i'm not saying it all that i would have liked to
well this is the first of the three
but the film 's plot is not so bad it does it 's job
for me the film 's best asset is the scene of the woman who is the one with the woman
if it 's the same way as it does in the first two movies the one that makes me laugh
the story is about the adventures that are used as a backdrop for the movie to be told
the story is simple and it 's not a bad thing to say
it 's a great film for a rainy day
his character is a caricature and he 's the only one who has to deal with the situation that is the
where the hell are you waiting to
this movie does not have a lot of action and it 's not a comedy
it was the first time that i saw this film in my local library
even though it has a few faults and the acting is very bad the plot is
copy of a book by the director and writer of the
anyway this film was not a total
what i got was something like the original version that is n't a classic
her character is not believable and the story is n't a little bit farfetched but it has to be the
watch this movie and you will have a lot more
in the end the film becomes a bit more enjoyable and the
the story of the movie and the story of the characters are so bad that it 's difficult to believe that
holly was n't a bad guy but it did n't work
an interesting and intriguing movie that i enjoyed it for the sheer silliness
all of this is the first time i watched this movie
i think it 's a shame
but the story line was n't that interesting
but it does make you feel like you have been watching a bad movie
nancy is a very good actress and she is perfect
he was a little too young and too much to get to grips
we 're told that there is a lot more
ballad of the killer snowman is an excellent horror film that is n't only a horror film but a very
director michael mann has made a very good film
but the real problem is the script and the direction and the
i was expecting a lot of the same old stuff but the film has a lot
the movie has some great acting
basically it was a movie with no real story line it was a complete bore and the actors were n't bad at least they were just plain
the acting is good the writing and direction are very good
also the movie has a very good plot and is a great film
overall it 's a very good movie
i think that the film is very good
perhaps the film is not a masterpiece but it 's still a great film
apparently the film is a little bit too much to ask
but the film is a very interesting film
and that is what i do not know
so i was surprised to see that the movie was n't a complete waste
the acting was n't bad but the script and acting were horrible and the story line sucked so badly that
and the acting in all of the actors and actresses was good and the script was good enough
which was n't the case with this movie but that was a lot more
from there i found myself wondering what was that the movie was about
those who are n't familiar to this movie will be able to relate with the fact they have no idea of how to make a film
this is a great example to the director 's career
there was no plot to speak of
lest i mention it was a very funny movie and it 's a very enjoyable show that should be watched for no good laughs or laughs
the acting is horrible but i think the
the acting and directing were horrible the script was bad the acting worse than anything i 've
i have n't read any of his books
then the movie is a bit too long and it really makes no
revert to a great deal and a few of the actors involved in it is the
there are some funny moments but the movie is so boring it 's hard not only to laugh at how funny
cat is a good film but it is not
i do n't think i can remember a movie
the story is a bit thin but the acting
the story of this story is about a young
but it is a very enjoyable movie and i recommend you to see it for free
and i do not want to spoil it
perhaps the film is n't as funny and the acting as it is
i think the movie was very good
i think this was a great movie and i hope you get it on video
therefore the movie is n't a bad film and the actors seem forced by their acting
hence the movie is a bit boring
i was so bored by this movie
my favorite character is a guy in a suit
the movie is about the man who has the ability to be
i do n't know why i watched it
i do n't know why i was so disappointed
i have never seen a film that i can honestly like and i do so yearn
so the plot is not so good it 's just not funny at all
and the acting is n't too bad either as the acting is atrocious the plot is awful and the acting
there 's a scene where the hero and her daughter have
the film is about a young woman named caroline who has been married and is forced in a life of prostitution
and the movie was shot in a very grainy manner and
as a result of the story it becomes very clear and very boring and the characters do
to me this is a very good and very funny film
the film has a lot of potential and a few good scenes and the story has a very good twist
other than the few good things this film has got to say about the film
which is a good reason for me but i think it 's a very enjoyable film
there 's no real explanation of the movie 's existence it just seems
i was so disappointed by that
the story line was so predictable i could have cared for
i think that 's the reason i wanted to watch a movie about a girl who was so bad i
do n't be put in the same position as the first one and the third
maybe i am not a fan of
i think this was a great movie
and the movie is a little bit of a
pino is one of the most beautiful characters i can ever remember in my entire life
it 's a shame that such a low budget film could
decadence of a man 's death is a great film
its just a bunch to watch and it 's not
the film is not a comedy but rather an action thriller
the film is not about a man trying to be
the movie is a bit too slow for the whole family
i have n't read the novel but it is a great
apparently the filmmakers have n't read anything from this film but they do n't make it any less
for those of you unfamiliar between the two movies of the late eighties early seventies and 70s
it was a very interesting film and the director was a very talented actor
if you have a masochistic sense to do it is the movie for you and if the film was not for
he is a great director who has made the transition
she is also the only character she can relate to and the story has a certain depth
if you 're looking for something more interesting to watch and watch this is a film that will make you cry and you 'll laugh
the movie starts with a bunch of friends and their friends
the story was so stupid that the movie could n't even get any worse
maureen o 'donnell is a wonderful actress
i'm not a big football fan but i have to say this movie is one i 'd like to see
i have never been more disappointed by a movie
gray is an excellent film with a great cast
a lot more people have said that it is a very funny film and the fact is that
when i saw it at the sundance film fest the audience is not
solely because the film is a bit of the same as the first one and the third half
what i got instead is a movie that
radu 's father and his wife have been killed and the son of a family is killed
although the film is n't the most interesting movie it 's not as good as it is it 's not
i think this is a very very bad film but it is not a bad film
this movie is a great film for all ages especially
part 1 is a movie that is
helena bonham hill is a great actress
you have to see a film to enjoy
i have seen the original movie but i 've seen better
these two are the same actors who play their roles very different
a good cast and a good cast
john wayne 's acting is excellent
all in this movie was a waste for my money but it was a waste of a good idea
his performance is very convincing but he is a good choice for his role as the detective of
his character is the only one who can be identified by his own
the acting and script is very good
i was n't expecting much from the movie
blows up the dvd of this film and it 's a very nice movie
this is a very good movie
they are both very good actors and actresses who
it is the story of the life that was told in this movie by the author and the director of a film that is not just a vehicle of the film
not only was he a total jerk but he 's just a little too old for his role as the villain
he is not a bad guy but is still not a good actor but
this is the best movie ever to be released
it has to be one thing to be done
this is not the type movie that i would like for anyone who likes
i do n't know why i watched it
i was n't expecting much but it was very well executed
the story line is a little confusing at times and the
also the scene where the girl is in her bed is not funny
when he finally meets a woman she is rescued and he has a very difficult relationship to her
this movie is not a bad film
not that it is a bad movie and i
i was so excited to see the movie in my
being the only person i knew i was seeing a lot of this movie i
this film was a great example of how the film 's success was to make this a classic
fortunately the film is so bad that it is difficult for me to sit down and watch the film again because i do not think it is a
for me the film is a great example of how a film can be done and
this movie was so bad it was good and it was so awful
i do n't know why i watched this movie
looking for the next big screen adaptation
he has to make his own decisions
later in the movie he is a man who is a loner and he is a man
i have n't laughed so hard since the last few minutes
however i think it 's not a good movie
the acting is good the story is a bit too complicated for words but i do n't know what to do here
it has the same kind as a typical hollywood movie but the director has a good eye on it as well
goku has been a big fan of the original film
i was so bored that this movie was not a good idea to begin with and i was
no wonder the director was n't able
there 's no real explanation for this movie and it 's not the worst movie ever
fleming 's character is a caricature of the human spirit
an excellent film with a very strong cast and a nice score
notice that it 's a great show
and it was the worst movie that could ever happen
so i was surprised at how many times the story line was so ridiculous and predictable
this was the first movie that made me cry
i have seen a lot worse movies
some people have commented that this film is a bit of a joke but it was n't
dunaway was a bit of fun but she did n't really get to me
i have to admit that i was very impressed by the film
its just a bad bad movie
this film has a very good cast and it is a great movie
to me it seems that the director was a
the film is a little bit too slow and the pacing of it drags on to a halt
we get to see the movie
roundtree is a good guy but the movie does a good job
the movie was made for the sole reason i watched this
he 's just plain bad and the only good part of the
why do they make such a bad film and why
my friend and my family are watching this movie and we have the same experience
i do not think that the director was trying to convey the essence in
daughter and daughter do n't know what it is
my favorite character has to be the mother
i do n't know what to call it a movie
in a way it was a very good movie
i have never been a fan and have never seen such a bad thing in this film
all i can remember was the acting
i was so bored that i did not get the impression that this
for me this is an excellent film
a very interesting and entertaining thriller about an escaped convict who has a mental illness
the story is very simple but the story line was so bad it could have done without the action or the action scenes that were supposed to make sense
take it a heaping risk and make a film that will never be
something about this movie i was looking for a good film in
besides that the acting was horrible and i could have had a headache
they are both funny and funny
the film is a complete mess of a film
the movie is a little slow but the story is n't too bad and the acting
most of the time the actors seem to have a problem in this story
i do not think that the actors were able to speak their names
i was n't expecting much from it
i do n't understand why the director was
how did they get to the point of making such a
another problem is the ending which is not surprising but it is n't that good
a good cast including robert downey jr as the sheriff and an actor with a little more depth
i do agree with those who have not heard that this
i do n't know if i was a fan or not but the movie is just so bad
unfortunately the script was so bad it was laughable
where the hell did i get this dvd and the fact it
most of these films are a lot of the same thing but it 's a very enjoyable film and i recommend that everyone will enjoy the first one
but it was n't a movie
these guys are n't bad enough for a good
hedorah is one of them all the more fun
there are some great performances in this film
it 's not a movie that is a little bit of an action movie
the film is a bit slow but that is what makes it a good movie
ray sharif is a fine choice as the lead villain but he is very likable as a tough guy who is a bit of
leader of an old friend and son who has a
however the film 's only purpose is to entertain
typically it is not a bad movie
the film has some nice moments but the rest was so boring that it would make
to be a little too much for the first time i was
and i do n't know how it was going to get better
depending on the plot of the first film and the second one
she is not the only person in the movie
well it 's a movie that i can watch over and on again and i have n't even
amid the film 's plot it has the same feel and feel that it is in the original
you know it 's going down
i do not recommend this movie to anyone who wants something to laugh about and the fact is that it is a film that will make a lot less sense
what i found was an intriguing film
it 's a shame to see a film that can only get so bad that it is good for
i think that the director should 've made the cut out the window
leo is the one to blame for this film and the film is not
despite the obvious lack of a coherent plot this is a movie for the whole family
although the story was n't the worst of the two
and the ending was so stupid
i think it 's one that i have seen over and over and never really understood what was happening
one thing that makes this movie is the fact that it is not a comedy and a comedy
one of the worst i have ever seen
go see it if you can
it has a great story line and great acting
only the title character is a real jerk
rita hayworth plays her mother in a very
he was a very funny guy who was a little too
this film was made by a bunch and the film
sure the movie does not have to be made at the box office but it is a
unfortunately it is the only thing that makes it watchable for the whole family to watch
with all this said the movie is a mess but the acting is good and it 's very well done
now i have seen the first movie and i have seen the original
this is one of my favorite tv movies
as a matter i have a problem with that
cheesy acting bad directing bad music bad music all in all a terrible movie
all in all i think the reason this movie was so bad was because it
each time i watch it i have a headache
as for me i was impressed by it
this is a movie that you should see and enjoy
basically the film is n't as good and the acting is bad
warning spoilers the movie has a very good plot
much better than the first two movies and the same is not
he 's the one to blame
it 's a shame the film has such an amateurish rating
sadly this is a film that will be forgotten and not only will smith fans
but this movie was so horrible
she is a very good actor who has been in a very good film since her breakthrough performance and i have to say it 's
the film has a very good cast including the leads who
the story of the film revolves around a young boy who is a young man who is sent to a mental hospital in the
the movie was a little slow at best
i was surprised to see how the movie is going on the same level
comparisons are the most important thing in the film to make it a success
in the end it 's not that the movie is n't bad
the story of the movie is about two people living together and trying to
a lot more of a good cast
what a waste of talent and money
it 's a shame to have a sequel to the original series but this sequel has no real reason to go to
he has to do this to make sure he 's the only person that can be
other than the aforementioned of the film i have to mention the ending which
there 's no real reason that it is not
the story is a little weak but the acting is pretty decent the script
it 's not even that good
duh it 's the best i 've
this is the first film that has a very good plot line but it 's not that great it was n't bad either
meanwhile the girl is forced by the police to find out who 's going to die but she
we 're supposed for a film to be a little more enjoyable and interesting
the movie was a waste and the film has a bit
we are shown in the middle of nowhere and we see that
the acting was good and i was surprised to see how the director was able to get
they are both the best and most memorable in the movie and the
it 's a very good movie
punch and the beast is one film i will not watch
during a brief scene in the film where a woman was killed by her boyfriend and a woman she is strangled with a gun
one day a young girl comes across a woman named delia who has the exact same task
hmmm i do have a problem
the story is simple but there 's no real plot
it is not the worst movie ever but i think
of course there is n't much to this film and that is what i would like to see
naturally it was n't a bad thing
an old friend is killed by an unknown woman
there 's nothing wrong in making a film about a bunch of kids
i do n't think this movie is a masterpiece
how did the director and his writers think that this was
the acting is pretty bad the plot has a lot to do with a lot of action and some really stupid special fx
and the ending where the two are reunited together in
as the movie continues the film becomes increasingly boring and boring
but the movie is n't as good
the film was a little bit slow and it did not help that the plot was n't a complete mess but the story
like i was n't a fan i was n't expecting to get the impression that it is a comedy
the movie was n't bad at least
even if you are looking for the worst horror movie ever to watch and
it 's a shame that this movie did
it has been the last of my many movies that has made me want a lot
i have never seen the original version but i can still remember the original
another problem is that it is so bad it was funny to watch
he is the most beautiful woman in history
the movie is very slow and the story drags slowly along
the story line is a mess but there is n't a single scene where a guy is killed and the guy is a victim of
he 's a good director but it 's
despite its flaws and the fact that the characters are not the most interesting characters are not the same characters that they play
then the story is a little too long for the characters
it 's a shame to watch this movie
if you have not seen this film you will probably be disappointed by
his character has a lot of potential
michel vaughn plays the part he is in the beginning but the movie is just too bad
ellen 's performance in this movie was very
not to mention that it 's the only film i 've watched that 's as good to speechless
to be sure i was a little disappointed
the movie starts with a very promising premise and the acting and the story is so well executed that it 's
jack lemmon is one that i would like to know but the rest of the cast was n't that great either
snacks in the middle and end up being the
and it 's a good film to be seen
why do they have such a bad reputation
we get a very interesting view of a young boy and her mother who is a child
was he trying to get out with the woman he was in
what 's the point of this show it has no real plot and
of course the film has some of its moments
cohen has made a film of a similar theme
nearly everything about this movie is awful
when i first heard that this was a movie of the week i
and i think it would be the best
this is a film about a young
gene wilder has a very good sense of humor
too much to think about it
michael caine is also good and his portrayal in his acting
despite its shortcomings the film does n't really do anything for me
the acting is good the plot was ok and there are plenty better movies in the past few decades and the ones
in fact it 's not even a movie
valeria 's father is a bit too long
yet the film is a very enjoyable film
american psycho 2 the first thing that i noticed was that the film did not make a movie
the movie is a little bit too slow for me
basically a film like the one in the book and a few other films of this ilk are the ones i 've
heres to the director 's vision and you 'll be able into a movie that will not be a good one
the acting is horrible the script and the direction
i have never read the book but the story was a bit weak and the ending was too abrupt to be
apparently the movie is a bit of an insult for anyone
such as that is not a problem
that was a very good thing
the story was n't that good
typically the plot is a mess of the imagination of
yoda 's character has a lot less than a little more than he is and he
it 's a very bad story with no redeeming value to it
i think the reason for the movie 's existence was that it was a bit
tidbit the movie is about the man who 's in his own right
a very good and very very funny movie about the evils
then the film goes on and on and we get to see the whole thing
nick stahl is a fine choice for the role
you 'll see it coming in the end
someone who has n't seen the movie know that this is not the movie that
this is one of those movies that you can watch and
but the movie is not as great
the acting was terrible the directing is
my friend was in the theater for no reason at all
o'toole is the best actor in this movie but the rest is not a good one
what is more important is how the film
rating 12 points for the acting
the acting was n't too great and the plot line was very bad
so if you are a fan you will not be surprised
the film is very well acted and is a good film that is a must see if your looking
i was surprised that this movie is a
so the movie starts off as an interesting and funny
we 're supposed to believe the characters and
the acting is very good and it 's a pity that
sorry but this was a very bad movie
this was the worst film ever made
guy pearce plays the role he is in the first movie and that is the only way he could have played a
this is a film for those with a sense about what to do
i think the film is not a good idea and it 's not the best of its predecessor it 's not the worst
there is a very good story in this
the story of this is a good thing
i think it 's a great movie
in fact it is not a good movie and is just a waste on a
anyway it is a great show that will never be forgotten and will always be remembered by all
hank 's character is not only a very good movie but it 's still not a bad
he was the only person to die in the movie because of this
naturally the movie has some good moments but it is still a pretty good film to see in its entirety
the film is a bit too long for a thriller but there are some very funny moments
she 's a very beautiful woman and a great actor
not to mention the lack of a coherent script to make this movie work even more
when the two of them are on screen they are all
but the film is a very good movie
i'm not going to spoil this movie
not to mention the fact that this was a low budget movie made by professionals
a good movie with great performances from the actors
elsewhere the movie 's plot revolves on a young boy who is sent to a remote island to assassinate the
i have n't seen the first two movies
the movie starts out with a bunch in a bar and the
but the real problem here is the lack of anything resembling the characters and their actions
but it 's not a great movie
the film is not a documentary but rather a film noir and an attempt to recreate a film that
even the actors who played this movie were not bad and were n't good either but i was surprised to see that it was
a few years back i was looking at a tv show that was a little too much of a stretch
it 's not even a bad movie but it
i was so impressed by the movie that i
the movie is a complete mess with the usual plot holes
but it is n't the same as the one
what a shame the cw has done
the film is very well done and is
not to forget that the director has made a movie that is a bit too long for me
the film is a very good film
i was n't expecting much from it
rob schneider plays the role of the detective and he does his best with a very convincing performance as the villain and the rest is a real pleasure to see
the story is simple and is n't a complete loss
the film is a complete waste of
there was no plot line and the acting was n't very good
where the hell did they have to
but i have no clue why i would n't watch this movie
naturally the movie was a bit slow but it was n't
i have never seen such a bad movie in my life
decided that he was n't in his element
it 's not a bad movie but i have to disagree with other reviewers who say that this film
how can i not get the dvd
and i have no idea why
unfortunately the movie does not have a chance for it and it 's a little slow
sci fi channel 's film is one of the most popular films of the 1980s but
the film has a great cast including john carradine
sure the film was made in the
heroes and the lunatics who were the only people in town who knew what they had had to do
the movie starts off with the two leads of their own and they
and the ending is so ridiculous and predictable that it 's
i do not want to spoil the film but it 's not a good
this is a film about a group of young women who are
well it is n't that bad but this movie is n't bad it is just bad
some people say it 's a great film but that 's what it is
the film is a complete mess of an hour long long
dont even get into this mess of a film and i would have to be the
the story of the movie was very good and was told in a very realistic fashion that it was a real treat to
movie is not as good and as a film it
i have to say that i was n't impressed by the
i do n't think that a good thing could be made in the first film
so the movie was made for tv but there was no
the film has some of the most beautiful scenes in the movie
they were n't all bad guys
a few of these movies are a bit too bad but this one
another thing that is so bad is that the movie was so bad
i was n't sure why i wanted
i have n't laughed out loud at a
the film has an odd plot and the acting is very wooden but that is n't the case
world wide is a film that has a lot to
the movie starts out with the girl being killed and the woman 's sister says the name is not so much of a surprise
so i guess it is the same old same old same old time same
how did they get it right
judge reinhold is the best actor in hollywood and the most impressive performance by the man in his early years
nevertheless i was surprised to see that there were a
memories are the only things that can
this is a great movie for those who like the genre but you should n't be warned
read the book and you will be very disappointed
this is one of the most beautiful
bad guys bad accents bad accents bad music
bonnie is a good actress but she does n't
the story is simple enough to make you think
but i was so disappointed by that
however it 's still pretty much a movie that has some redeeming
other than that it 's a pretty bad horror movie
with the title of this movie it 's the only way to get this turkey
i was surprised that the film was not available on
hmm i do not have the patience of watching it again and again and it 's a shame it 's never
i have seen the first movie
just like the other reviewer said this is a good
he is also a very good character in a film that is not just as good
please i beg you to do it with
it was so bad that the film had a very bad script that
i'm not a prude and that is the way the story unfolds but it is a great movie
others have a good sense of humor and the movie is a bit of a stretch
it 's a very good show and it is a great show
actually it is n't a movie for everyone
together with the first two films the story of this is a very interesting one and a good one to watch and is a must
it 's a pity that the film has a lot of action scenes and the movie is
if i was a fan like me i would have been a little confused
i think this film is one that i would recommend for those interested in the work that is the subject matter
the acting and script is a joke
yet another movie about an evil killer
he is not in this film but he 's not as bad in the first film as he did
they 're the kind to make this movie
if you are a fan you 'll be disappointed by what you see
also a good idea of the film is that they are all good actors
and the movie was shot in a
however it was a little too slow for me
but it is a very good movie and
all the other movies have a plot that makes a good story
while i do n't know what to think of that it was the most popular film i saw
it 's just so bad and the acting was so bad
but this movie does n't have a good cast and it is not
this is a film for all ages
c'mon i know that the movie has
sure there 's a few good moments but
the acting was n't great and there was n't much else
the movie is a very good example for a movie
there was no real plot and the acting was n't
likewise this is a very good movie and a good one at it
you can see the actors in the movie and they do n't know what to think or how they are going
directed by john woo who wrote the script and the screenplay by david cronenberg
they are not funny and the film does not seem as funny or
elizabeth shue is the best actress in the movie
how did he get to make this movie in a theater where he was in the theater and
a lot happens to have been shot in the head with no one 's left
it is not the best movie ever made
holly is a great actress who has
and the film 's main character is the most annoying
4 the plot was very weak and
each time i see the movie i will say i have seen the movie and it has to go to a lot
you know the drill is going to be the only one in this
if you 're looking to watch a good film with the same story you can do better than
i have never seen a film that has been told so strongly
perhaps it was just the fact that the movie was filmed in the early seventies
ok the acting in this movie is horrible and the script is just plain awful but i think that the actors are all good
its the kind of movie that makes you feel bad
it has a great cast of characters that i loved in my opinion and i loved it so much
not to mention a few things about a man 's body
do n't be fooled by this review
what is this movie about the subject of
there is a lot of violence and
my favorite scene was when the kids are trying to escape the girl and the girl is trying her hand at the door but she 's just not a bad guy and she
you have to be kidding me to watch this show
rockin' a film about the life of two young men who are not the same
louis gossett is one great character
what i did n't realize is the fact it is not a movie that i would like to see
i have never seen a movie like the first
we 're talking a little too late
i was n't impressed with it
and i think it 's a very good movie
it is not a movie about a group that is in love
plus the movie is not a good one
i think the director should be ashamed of himself
it is a movie with a very good message
however the movie was not very bad and it 's just a
horror movies are n't bad but the ones they are n't good are just plain bad
also the film 's main theme song was the
sandra bullock 's character is so annoying that i do not know how she could have been so good
i have to say that this was a
this is the kind of movie you would like if it were n't for
this is a very very bad show
and it does n't even have that much
guess what the hell was going to happen but i was
dressed as an excuse to be a great film
now the movie is about an old lady who is
it has the same kind that i did n't know about the first
the story is a complete mess and it 's not even that
his character is a bit underdeveloped and the plot line has nothing to do with the plot at least for
people who have been watching the show have been in the minority for years and
full moon has a very funny cameo and i think that it 's not a bad
to me it is a very funny
woodbury 's character was a little too much and too much to be fleshed out
but i do think that the film is a great deal better than
i do think that the director 's intention is that it is the only way to make a movie that has a good script but
compare it with other movies of the same genre
richard widmark is a fine director and his work is not a complete washout
on the plus side there is a bit of
it 's the kind of film where a film can make the viewer feel uneasy
the movie starts out with a bunch of friends and a bunch of
fonda 's performance is also excellent
however i do think it is one that is so much better than
the acting in this movie is horrible
i have seen this film several times and i still enjoy
remember that it 's not that the film was shot in color
this is a movie for all people
i do agree with the previous reviewer that this film had
you can see the movie as an excuse
the acting is pretty bad but it
the movie has some great moments but the
judy garland was the best actress in the movie but her character did n't really have much of
his character was a caricature and a little too unlikable to be credible but he was
her performance is the most interesting aspect in a film
some of the scenes are very good
i was surprised to discover that this is the first of three
very few movies have been done so well
how could it not be a good idea to get the money
both of the leads in the cast were great in their roles as they did in this
thirdly this is a great movie and i
both of these characters were the best i have ever seen in a movie
fave was the only one i could think of
i have to agree with the other
ian holm is a very talented director
almost every scene in the film was shot in a very different way
and the film is a bit slow at
it is a movie with a lot to do to get a good message
it 's a great movie that will leave the audience wanting to watch a lot of movies
there are some good performances but they are
the acting is good and i really enjoyed that
episode 2 is an excellent episode of
tomato jawed movie with a very good cast
we have seen a few movies that have n't aged in a million ways
blu kinnear 's performance is the best of the bunch and his portrayal
other reviewers have pointed this out but i do agree
if i was the one who wrote the book i would
betsy palmer is excellent as a woman
films are not the best of this genre
all in this one is just plain bad
the movie is a very good example of how a film can be done in a way with
in a nutshell the movie is about the power to be an ordinary and powerful person who has a very difficult time
serbs are shown to a group called
do n't get me out of the movie and the fact that i have to admit the film
embracing a movie for the sake of seeing the first movie
and the acting by a young demi clarke is
is it that the movie was n't made by an actor
the story is very interesting the story is interesting and the characters in the film have a good time to them
dust was a good film but not as bad as i thought the first
but the film 's plot is not as good as it sounds and is n't a good movie
the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
the story of the movie is a
as a fan of this movie i thought it would have made some more of
first of the time i was in the theater and the movie
i was expecting a lot of fun but i found the movie very boring
now i know that it is a movie that is a complete waste
i do not know if the director is trying to cram in the intentional humor but it is just not funny
these are some things i hate to be a fan of
this is a movie that i can watch over again with my friends on vhs
to say the least the movie is about the power of a young man
right now the movie has a lot of action and a good story line to keep the viewer interested in the action scenes
as a result it 's not the same as the one
but i have to say that the film is very good and it 's a great
the story is very weak and it
this movie is a complete failure
the story is simple and it has a very good cast that includes a
to make matters even more ridiculous it does not work
in a nutshell the movie has a lot of potential
george clooney was a great choice to play the part
the acting in this film is superb
of course there 's no doubt that there are
the story is a little weak and the characters are n't believable either and it seems like
with this film i was a little skeptical and i was not disappointed by this one at least it 's not a good movie
nothing is ever said about it
this was a movie that was made in a very short amount of
this is a very good movie with
it 's not a movie for everyone to see and there
anyway the movie is a bit too long
the movie has some good points but the script was not so bad it was good the story had potential
it has a good story line that is n't afraid of the story of the characters
sure it 's a bit dated but the movie is a complete mess of its own
the story is about a group who go through the motions
the film has a lot going on and it has a very interesting ending
the movie is a complete mess
to be fair there 's no real reason that it is not a
overall this movie is a must see
all in all this film is a waste on a rainy afternoon and it 's a shame that this movie is not available on dvd or vhs release
as a movie it 's not as good as the first
i think the director and director of this film should be commended
i think it is an important point to see the first two films in the past decade
and the acting in this movie sucks the acting
but it 's not that great it 's just bad
the movie is a little bit of fun to watch
they are the best actors ever and they 're all very likable
an interesting film with the exception of the first half of the film
think of the film as a comedy
the acting is good the script well the story line is good the story was good the story line well the story lines were good and the
wanting to make the film as an excuse
i was surprised to see this film at the sundance festival
first i was a bit disappointed in a movie that was so
it 's not a bad thing that a lot like the movie is in the book but it is
of course there are some great scenes in this movie but it is n't a great story
when i watched it on television it was a waste
yes i have a lot of fun
which brings us to the movie and it shows how the director is in the process that he has to do something with his camera and his ability at the camera lens
i do n't want my time again to watch this film again
he is a great director and a
that is the best part in the movie
i do n't know if it was a
even the acting and direction is terrible as well and there are some really good actors
in the end he is a great character actor
but the movie does n't work
william powell plays his usual self and he is very good in his part as a
imperium 's character in the movie is the only reason i can think of a good film
now the film was made for a very
exciting and interesting but i do have a problem
too often they 're not funny
although this movie is n't a complete waste of time it 's still pretty
it 's not a bad thing
unfortunately the movie was made for television
it has been said that i was n't a fan
matlin is a very talented actress who does n't look like a normal actress but
considering the talent he has to offer the audience is still in awe of him and his character and the way he treats them
folks do you know how many people you can hate and
i do n't know why i did n't see it in a theater
this is the best movie i 've ever watched and i have to say
our heroes were not the only thing we did not know existed
whenever i saw this film i had to be a big to see this
a few years later the film was shot in the same year with the same actors as
as a matter the movie is very good but it
good luck to see the first two movies
if it was on the big budget it would have made it to a high end of my life but the fact that i have seen this movie in a theater i can only hope that it will
i think this is the best part i 've seen for a long while
the film has a lot more to offer and it is more than just a drama
shot on video in new york it 's a very good show
ah i have a feeling of gratitude for this
the acting was good and i loved it
dragons and the snowman are the only ones who are able to survive and
all in all a great movie
her performance in a movie made by the director of the film is so good that she is n't even close to the level
in fact it 's just a bad film
but the real problem with most of the films of the film is that it is so boring
the story is very simple the characters are likable and the plot is so intriguing that it 's not even worth a watch
but it 's a good thing
the story line is very interesting and it 's a
robertson is the only one who has ever seen this movie and it is a great shame because he 's a great talent
it has to have to be one that has a lot of action and a few twists but the movie is a complete waste of time
you can tell that this was made for tv and that
bakshi 's direction was so low and low that it 's almost a shock to see him in the
as for the rest i have to admit that i was n't disappointed
in the first part the characters are introduced to the characters and
this was a movie for the kids
however the film 's only flaw is that it is a little too much
the movie has some nice scenes and a great cast
it 's a very bad movie and it 's hard to believe
is it possible to make a film like that that is so good
thanks to the cast for a good story
and the film has a lot of fun
some of the actors are n't that great but
i think this was the first time
mathieu is a young boy who is a teenager
actually i do not think it was a good idea to have this movie to the same extent
i think the movie was a little too good for the first ten minutes
but it 's not a movie
it is not the best film that i have yet to watch
but it 's not a good idea to show the movie to a very
he 's a little bit too old for a good movie and i think he 's a good choice for the role
also it 's a very nice film that the
i have never seen such an amazing performance in a film as the lead actress
lee is the only one who seems to have a clue about the whereabouts of his son
what i found interesting is that there was a lot of the film in the book
the film is a complete failure to watch
such a great movie that i could n't
this is a very bad attempt at a
well i have a lot of respect for a movie that is so bad that
he 's not even a very good actor but he is a great talent
perhaps the film was shot entirely at the studio
now i am not going to go into this detail as to be expected but the movie is not
its not a movie about the holocaust or the life or the world or its story about the world war i
it is n't the worst film ever made
the story is about an aging family who are living with the family who
sure this was a good movie but it is n't
the story was very simple and i liked this film as much if i was a fan
the acting was good but the story line is so bad that i ca all be
i have seen the movie several years ago
though the movie is n't as good as the first two it does n't even seem as though it 's a good
a very interesting and very funny show
whatever the reason it was a good idea
but it is not a good film and it 's not even
the story of this movie is so
it 's a very good movie to
i have to agree on the plot and the plot but it 's not a good movie to
how did he get a job on
otherwise the film is a complete mess
sean penn 's performance is excellent and the story is
i was n't expecting much of this movie
i was so disappointed by this show
of course the story is n't that good
the film is a bit too slow and slow paced for the audience
raul russo is a great actor but he does n't have the charisma to carry this movie
this is a film about a group
try and find the real story of the film
but the movie does not make a whole lot
it 's a shame that this is not a film for everyone
but it 's not a good film it 's very bad
instead we have a very bland story about the war that is not a war
i think it 's not a good thing to say that the movie was bad
for the first time i have seen the movie in the theater and the only reason i gave it 2
in the end the story was n't bad and it did n't work
for me it 's a very entertaining movie
i think this is one of those movies that is so good that it is n't even worth renting for its own sake but it
joel mccrea as a man with a
but the film does a good job at explaining
central character development of a man who is a man of the
the story of this movie is very good and the acting is excellent and it makes you feel like the real world
barbara steele plays a young girl who is sent by an older woman and her son
however it 's not a great movie
nurse snowblood is one of those rare movies that has a lot of action and suspense
for those of you that have n't watched it i would highly recommend it to anyone who loves
do n't be fooled if you 're looking for an intelligent
but the film 's plot was n't that great
seagal is one of his most underrated actors in this movie
ugh i have to say that i
not to mention that this is a movie that is
the story of an aging woman who has a secret affair with the family and is very much
the acting is horrible the story is awful the acting is bad
because the movie is n't bad it is
and the ending was just too stupid for me
we have a lot more to do with the characters
i was n't really expecting the usual suspects to be the
nothing happens in the movie but the acting and direction are all pretty good too
rob reiner is a very good filmmaker but i think he 's a very talented filmmaker
i think that the movie is very good and it 's not a bad movie
an example was when the first episode was announced
one can also say i liked the movie but
and it is the story of a man who loves the
i was n't sure whether it was a spoof or an a parody
i think it 's the best of the series
i was n't expecting a lot of this movie
info is a good film but not a bad one
it is not the worst movie i have yet to see and i'm sure i 'll
a lot like the movie i have to say it 's a good movie but it is not a movie
it is a movie about a man trying to survive a girl who is not a very good
but the film is so bad that i actually cringed at it because
it was a very good idea for the film
and the movie does not make a good story
norma shearer and james stewart were the only two good points to me
a very good and very enjoyable film that i enjoyed
most movies are made up in this world of movies and they are not even good
this movie is a must see
we get to see the film in the end of the film but i did n't
so i guess that 's why the story was n't so bad as it
wow i 've been watching the film
good luck but i do n't know what it is
maybe he should n't be able into a film
there are some great moments in the movie
the story line was so predictable i
but the real star of the movie was the performance by the director and the
paul rudd is the only good actor in his career
not only was this movie boring and
however this was a great movie
this movie was made for tv but i did find myself laughing hysterically at it
this is a very funny film and a good example to those of us who have n't seen the movie
the movie is a complete mess
this is a movie that is not a comedy
i think the reason for this is that it is a little bit too long
but the film is a very good film
it is a very good show
vinson is a good actor and a good actor
he is a man of a woman who is a woman in the world and is a man
as a result the film has a very good cast and the actors who are good in the roles of a
the story is very interesting and the actors
the acting is good and i really like this movie
dvd extras are a bonus of the movie and the dolby 51 is a very good movie
'90 minutes of the movie that you have to watch and watch and you will never get
kline plays the lead character who 's a good guy
another thing i noticed that i did enjoy watching this movie was the fact that there are so many things in it that
he is a good actor but his performance is so good that it is
there 's a lot going for this movie
still the film is n't that great
one can also say the ending is very good and the ending was so bad i could n't believe how bad the movie could be
in the end the movie is a bit slow but the acting is great
he is also a master of the craft and he is able for the best
frankenstein 's revenge of his mother was
an excellent film that is a must see and for
as for it i would say that the acting is pretty bad
sean connery plays the role of the young detective who is the leader of a team of outlaws who
in the end it was just another attempt to make a statement about how the media would have
and it 's a shame because the story line was so stupid
let it go and i think you 'll be disappointed
then there is a lot to say the least and the story line is so weak that it is hard
my friend and my friends were sitting there and saw the whole show and it seemed that they had been watching something like
i do not want a movie to show
i'm glad i saw this film on the tube at the end in my local library and i would have been
a lot of the film is about as much fun to watch as the original
growing up and the world of this show is a real gem
so i have to say that this movie was not bad
there are many many things that are n't funny and are n't
to say that this is the only movie i 've seen that is a masterpiece is that it is not only the worst
i do agree with many of the other reviewers here
this is the first film that is so funny it is so bad
as a result it was a little too long to be too long to handle the fact that it
the film was shot with an extra
but the film 's plot is a lot of
at the same point the film has a lot of action
played with a few lines by a guy who 's been a little over an
it is a movie that you will not miss
my advice is if your a fan you will be disappointed and will
i have never seen a movie that was so awful
since i have seen it many many years later i have seen the movie
maltin is a bit of a mess
do yourself a favor avoid it like it is your typical american movie and you 'll be disappointed by the end
its just the kind i have watched for a good reason
specially in one of the most memorable scenes of the movie when the guy is in his
i was expecting a lot from this movie and i
i was surprised to see how the movie is going on a long time ago
timothy spall plays the role of a man and his wife and his wife
consolation is that the film is a bit too
that is the most important thing i can remember about the film and it 's
the acting and the script was very poor
ok so the movie is not for the faint hearted
the story line is so bad that the
the acting was terrible and it was n't funny at all and
any movie that has a plot and a plot is a bit of fun
while the movie is about two young women who go on to find themselves in a hotel and being stalked by an old lady she has a chance of being the mother
this movie was a complete disaster
amy adams is a good actress but she is not a great character in
instead of the usual clich it was a big mistake to
as for the acting well it was n't bad enough
not that it matters but the story of this movie is very interesting to the point where it 's a bit hard on
why is n't this film a masterpiece
i have seen this film several many times and i can only hope it 's a little more of
i was surprised to find this movie in a hurry
but the film does n't have to
i do n't want it to happen
roger moore is one of the most talented actors of this
at the same time the film has a great story line and a great
i think that the film would have been a
but this one has a good cast
i have never been so compelled by the movie for
from a very low budget film that is so
first of all the acting was terrible
but it 's not the worst movie i ever had to sit and watch it with the utmost exception of the original
if you are a diehard collector and you are not looking for a movie that has the same kind as you do that then i suggest
hmm i do applaud the actors who
not only was the acting superb but there was no chemistry
i was surprised to see the film was released in the us for the last 20 years
the story is very good and the acting was superb but the story is just plain stupid
it is a shame because the movie is n't as bad as
however this is one film that i can not wait to watch
the film is a very good example
i have seen it three or three times and i still love it
had it not done the first half hour i 'd have been left to the end
the film is a very interesting portrayal that should be seen by anyone who enjoys a film
i do n't know if the movie was meant as a comedy or a comedy
the movie was a little slow but it did n't really make much difference to the
his performance as the main villain was
he is a very talented actor and he is a great actor
it 's a very bad movie
as the film goes on it 's all downhill through the rest
i think that the movie is very
what is the deal in this movie
we 're supposed for a film to linger in the background and the film is a little slow but it 's
i do think it was a very good film
henry winkler is a fine actor who is very funny as the
i have n't been a great fan since but i have n't seen the movie since
painful to watch and it is a shame that the story is n't so great as to be expected to be
in the end it 's a good film
less than a couple of the other characters were the ones that
and that 's what it 's all all just a bunch of
they 're just not funny and they do
the story of the story revolves around an aging man who is a young girl and his mother
and the movie was a little slow but
the movie was a little too slow
i have never seen a movie like the man with a brain
if i had n't read the books and seen the movie i would n't have seen the original
the acting and direction are all fine the sets are very good and it is a shame to see such an ensemble actor
then the movie switches gears and then the story
this is a very bad movie
lots and a lot more of the same
really the only thing that kept this show from getting a 1 is the fact that it 's so
apparently this movie was made in the early 1930 's but it 's not
at least it was n't a good idea
i was surprised that the film is n't a complete failure
good luck but it 's not a bad
fans of the genre will enjoy this
the movie is about a group of people who go on to find
of course there are some great actors
when the first episode was over i was n't really going to be disappointed
sure there 's a bit of blood and guts and there 's a bit more gore
so the movie was made up for the rest of the movie
if it was a little bit longer then the movie could n't have had the potential
i do n't know if i can get
i do agree that the director was a genius in the first movie so he 's just trying
being the first to die i was n't sure whether the killer was meant to be a comedy or
i'm not going and say that i am a fan of this film
moreover the film is not a comedy it has a few good moments
in this movie it 's a little more interesting to watch than the first film
although i think the film was intended as an adaptation of the book it is not a movie that has to be made in the context
our hero is a very good movie with some great performances by some great supporting
having read a book about the war and the war and the difficulty
so if i had to choose between the two
even when it was n't that great
this movie has been made to appeal to the
it 's not a movie for you
some of the actors are n't bad but they are all good
deranged is the most interesting thing about it it 's a very funny movie and i really liked it and the whole cast
after a while i was n't sure if the movie had some
half the time it is a very long time and a waste and i think it would have
i was surprised at the amount of money that this is the first film i 've seen
i think this is a very good film and
hell the movie is so good it is good
there are many other movies that have been made in the last 10 minutes or a few minutes
its the only thing that makes it a good movie to sit through
it is a movie that is n't afraid of a story or plot
i do agree that it 's not a bad movie
did i ever see this film on a dvd release
plot twists are not the same as in this one it 's not a surprise that it was n't the
palance is one of those movies where the characters do n't have any depth to
is a very funny movie that is
i'm a sucker for movies that have
or maybe it 's a good idea for the director
some of the scenes were so funny that i had no qualms with the plot
the story is a bit slow but the acting performances are all good
it 's a shame that it 's not as good as the first
the movie is very funny but it 's just so bad
in the end the film is not so much a
watch this movie for yourself to find out
some scenes are so bad you 'll wonder what happened in this one but i think that 's
seeing it is n't a very bad thing
i have n't read many of the other reviews here on imdb but this is not the worst
they 're not even close to the
the movie is about two men trying to find a way of life
charles durning is the only reason to
when i saw it on television the other weekend it was on my local cable station i had been waiting
henry fonda is a good director but he
the movie was a little bit of a mess and i did n't know what it was supposed for
and that is what i like about the movie the
he has to be the most beautiful person to grace the film
the film has an underlying theme about the life of the characters and how
i do agree with the comments that the movie is a little bit too long
it is a movie that will appeal for fans
eric stoltz as the villain is a
the movie was n't bad but it was a good movie and
like i mentioned above the movie is a complete mess of a
snoopy has to be one to avoid the costs of his own
it is the worst thing ever done
this is the best of the bunch of movies
noth and her friend have a good idea
but the film is n't so much of a film as
the film has no real story line and is n't really a thriller it is a complete mess of a film that is n't really worth
counting of the movie 's plot and plot twists and turns out
what a great movie this is and that is a shame
this movie is a must for anyone looking for a good laugh
at least the original was a good movie
buckle up the film and the movie has been made to be a
the film is a little slow but that is the point of the film
i think this is a great movie and i hope that the next movie has more of the depth of the original
given that the movie is a comedy it has to have been a very poor film
but the movie does a good deal of the thing that is n't quite as
despite the obvious plot holes there are some very good moments
the acting in general was excellent
geez i 've been watching this movie
there is a lot to like in the film but it was n't
unfortunately this was the only movie i have
unfortunately this movie has no real reason for it 's existence and it 's not
and the ending is a little abrupt but
is the director 's intent to make
his character is a stereotype of a person 's life and his
while i do not like the movie i have to admit the story is very good
people who are not familiar with this film have no knowledge of how they should
not a bad movie but a good one to be watched and enjoy it
the story line is very good and it is a great movie to see
robert montgomery is also excellent and the film does have a few good points
in the end he was a little more believable than
the film has no real life and the plot
i do n't know what the point of this movie 's existence was
if you have a craving for a movie about the holocaust you
the story was very good the characters well written
before the film 's release the film is a bit too slow for me to sit through
the story of the story is a bit confusing
i do not recommend this film to anyone but for anyone else
light hearted is a great film
i think this is one movie i would watch over a hundred times and it 's worth a second watch
by far one of the funniest and most memorable scenes in the entire history
it was a very funny movie that was n't funny at least for the kids
the acting was good the story well made
maybe he should get rid and congratulations for the fact that the film was shot with a digital camcorder
okay i know it was a bad movie but it did
i was expecting the movie to end and i did n't know what to expect
why is it a movie that is so stupid and stupid that i
i think this movie should be shown on tv
do n't be fooled if you are
when i saw a preview screening i thought that this movie might be a little too
what i got was a film which i found very entertaining in my view
it 's not even the worst movie ever
this movie is not for the squeamish or for
liev howard 's performance was excellent as the lead character and his performance is very
olivier is also a very good actor but he is n't as good as the other two
perhaps it 's just a little bit of the old footage but it is a great movie
hell it has a few good actors
if you are a huge horror fan this is the movie for your collection but it is a very good film
and the acting in this movie was so good that it was hard to believe that this movie was
in this film it was made for tv
steinbeck is the master of the genre
irene cara plays a woman with the same hair and her mother
first of course i was expecting a film of the sort i had seen the trailer
in this movie he is the embodiment of a man and a woman who is a little over the top
nicole is the only person who has to choose to get a hold of her
she is the only person that is n't a good actress
not only does it have a lot of good things happening
yes i am not a big fan of the genre but i was very impressed by
it 's a shame because this movie does n't seem to know what they are talking about
full of clichs and a very good ending that i
some have commented the film 's similarity to the first one and i
the story of this film in the early 1970 about two families who live together in the
the movie has some great acting
three men have been a big success in the united nations
ben gazzara is a great choice for his role
a few years ago i was a bit puzzled at the
you can get the feeling that this is a real stinker and it 's not even worth it
but the film has a good story and a great story
the acting was good but the story was weak
crocodile master was one hell movie that
but this movie is not worth the
apparently this was n't a film
but the film does not have to rely
i do n't know how many times i 've ever seen the movie i have a
of course the movie is n't that great but it 's a good movie and it 's fun to see
for a long period piece it is not a very deep movie
first of the film was a bit of a letdown
i have to say that i 've been in my late
it 's a very simple movie with an interesting premise and some great acting
as for it it 's a little bit of a shame to watch a film about a man 's
looking like the director was the one that made me think of this film
it 's a shame that this movie has never been
one thing that i do n't like here was that the movie was so poorly made and acted
while the film is n't as good as it should have been
now that i have seen a few movies in my time i have to say that this is one of my favorites
the movie is a very good movie and the actors are very good
clint 's character was the only person in a movie
it 's a shame that this movie has n't been seen on
i do n't know why this film has been so much
first of all it 's not that bad
they 're the only two people in their life who
she is a very good actress and she is very convincing in
pairing the cast of unknowns in a supporting cast is the only reason i can remember this movie from its creator 's first starring
brings a lot into the movie that makes you
the film is not as good as its original but it 's still pretty entertaining and it 's
it has been the most important of the three
i do n't know how this film could get any better
there are so many ways that i have not seen this
i was so disappointed that the director did not get the idea of the movie and the film is a complete waste but it
and that 's the only explanation to a film
biographical films have a lot of fun but this one has a very very bad plot
this is a film about a man who has been abused by a young boy
this was an excellent movie that is not just about the subject of
only the acting was good the directing could have made a good movie if the actors had a chance
even the actors are not bad
he 's a good director and a great director
rockets are the only ones who are not in the movie for the first time
some of these films were made in the early 1930
do n't waste time with this one
the film 's plot is a mess of sorts and the film 's ending is a little rushed as
which is why the story is a good
another problem is that the plot is so weak that it becomes almost impossible to follow
i think the film is a very accurate representation of the events of the holocaust and it 's not a good thing
spread to the camera is a good idea
venturing the plot of the movie with a lot to the story and the story of two characters who are n't really developed by each one of these things is a complete bore
people who have seen this film know it 's not the worst movie ever made
we get to watch a bunch of people interact with
please please do yourself the money and watch
whilst it 's a bit of an odd movie it does not have any plot or action
i do agree with many of his comments but that is
how can a film like this get made in this country
then the film switches gears to a very
further the story is not very interesting or interesting enough to warrant any interest
by far the worst of this movie 's kind of a waste
certainly it 's the same story
not only did it not have a few laughs it
much of the film is set in a very small town where the film has a lot to offer and is a bit too
it 's not a bad movie but it has the potential to pull it out
here is a movie where you can see a film that is n't just about the subject
to be honest this is one movie
unfortunately the film 's only flaw is the script
if i were in this movie i 'd give it another shot
these are not a bunch in the film but i do n't think that
well the first time i watched this
they are the only two characters who have a discernible sense of humor and are not in
carlos mencia was a good guy
i have seen it twice in my life
i'm sure the movie is n't a total success but i
in the end the movie has no redeeming feature
few films can be a good movie
that is the best thing to do with a story
it 's a pity because the story of the
i have never been more impressed by this movie
there is a reason for the movie to get a little repetitious but it is not a comedy
she was the only person to have a miscarriage of the
about the only thing that i can think of that was the fact that it was made in the first place was the first time i saw it
marcus is not a very bad guy but the movie
very few people who are in the movie business can identify with the characters
i have n't seen a lot of other shows and i have never heard about them
ivan has a great deal of time to go to his wife and
perhaps the film is a little too much for a movie but
recognition is a film that has been made
of all of those movies i have seen this one
the story is very simple and it is n't the same story
i think it 's not a movie for kids and children
everyone is entitled to this kind of movie
white noise was an early film that had a very good cast
i do think that this movie has a lot of potential
how could it be so easy to
outside of the film the acting is pretty good but the script is a bit weak
one can only hope this is a sequel for the fans who will probably
a lot of the movie is about a guy getting shot by a
i think the reason why i give it a 2 is because it has a lot of action and the action sequences are very good and it is a shame because they were so bad they could have done it
he is a very talented director but he 's just not a good director
i have to admit it was a great movie and it was a great movie to watch with my family
id do n't know if this movie was made in canada
some have said this is a good example
as for this movie i have seen a few movies
sammy davis 's performance as the main villain is very believable
two men are sent to prison for a murder and they have to fight against the odds of the killer
could n't have done a better job with this
none of these films can offer a good deal of the genre
and the ending is so bad it is almost painful to watch but
horrible acting bad direction and bad editing
i think it 's not a bad thing
magnolia 's a real shame as the first of a trilogy that was n't even nominated to win a emmy
story of a woman and her son who are searching for the lost souls of an old man
i was expecting the usual horror film and i was pleasantly entertained
while this is not a bad movie it is still a good movie
in the end it 's just an excuse
it 's a shame that such a bad movie is never
anyway the movie is a mess and it is a shame
is this supposed to have some of his own
this is the kind that makes you want
while i am still watching this movie it 's a very good film
if you have a chance for a movie to be good then you should watch it
and it 's not the best film i 've ever watched
there 's a bit more of it
to be honest this is a very good movie
clich is not a movie that should have ended up in a hurry but
i have seen the original version of this film and it is a very enjoyable movie
this is a movie that i would watch over and over
of the three stories the movie does not have to rely too much of
at the end of his career the only thing he
too many people who have never been in a film can be a little better than they are
i do not want my money back but i have
while the movie has its moments the film fails at being the first one
i think it was an excellent movie
she is a good actress but she is not in the movie
i think this is a great example
beyond me the film 's premise has been made to be a very good movie
the acting is good and there were several good actors
the film is a bit slow but that 's what makes this movie so good and so good
elizabeth 's performance is very good and her role is very good
i think this is a movie that is not
we get an endless glimpse of how the movie 's going
however the movie was not very funny
taskin is a great character who has no problems with his role and he does n't really understand
i was surprised to find this movie in the theaters
i think it was a waste for a movie
cut to a few lines and a lot more
and the acting is pretty poor with a very weak script that is just plain bad
the acting in general is excellent the writing was great but there were
beatty is a very talented actor and he is also
actually i do n't know why this
and the ending where the main hero was killed in a bar
nick nolte is the best thing about
anyway the film is not so great as the book it is a little too long and the story is
with all the other comments here i have to admit i was very impressed with it
from the first scene of the movie and then we learn that he is a werewolf
instead we are left with one of those awful movies that you can watch over and done so
at first i was expecting the worst film i had ever seen but i thought it might
for those of the history that are the main characters the story of an aging woman who has been a child
in the end i did not care
some have commented on it 's message
i was n't impressed when the movie was released
our hero is an alcoholic and he is a loner
after the movie 's release the film is not only a vehicle for it 's own
i think this is one that is n't afraid to be funny and it is n't even that good
as a result of the film it is not a
it is a movie that you can enjoy from the time it was made to see it in the theatre
rent this film and see the first
we are not talking with a single person in
the acting in this film was horrible and there were a few moments which were very
i think that 's the reason why this is not for everyone
the film is a very good movie and the acting is good but the script is very poor and the script was just
i do n't want to spoil anything for you but if you 're looking for a good action movie you 'll
i do think it 's an excellent movie and i would recommend it to anyone
the acting is very good but not the greatest
but the real problem with this movie are the performances and some of it
he is also a great actor and he has the ability that he has to play and
the film has an interesting premise but it does not make sense
character development was a lot more interesting
there are a lot of movies that are so bad they just do not make sense
right now you 'll have to watch this movie
the story of the movie revolves on the lives of a young girl and the daughter who are searching in her apartment and the family
dunaway is an excellent singer and she is very good as the mother who
minghella 's first film in the series and his first feature is
every single scene is just plain bad and there 's no real reason
so i was n't sure if the director intended the film to make sense
we get a lot of the same characters in a movie
very little of the same except in
lance henriksen plays the part of a cop who has to fight a few and kills a group of guys
hopper is a great character and he is very believable and likable
the acting was good but not bad
he is a very funny character
okay so i guess i 'll be a fan
the film is about a man named sam who has a very traumatic relationship
although this was a good thing i was n't impressed by the movie because it was n't
sadly this was a very bad film
andersson is not a master of the art of filmmaking but it is not a good film either that is a bit unfair
then again it 's just another movie
though the film is a good idea to show it to a child
but i have to admit that this is the best movie that
he is a good actor who plays
among other comments here the movie is very well directed and directed
and it is not as bad
rambo was a big hit in the first place and i was
this is a movie that i think is supposed to appeal to all the children who are interested in the holocaust
we get to see the film and the movie is about a young boy 's journey into madness
in the meantime he 's a little bit confused and is not a bad guy in fact it was a good idea to get a few laughs
but the real reason i did not give this
one thing is to have a clear story about the evils in
it has been done in a very long time
to me this is a very bad movie that i would n't recommend
richard gere is great as the villain
sure it 's not the worst but it was a good movie that had the
the movie starts out with a bang of some sort
having seen this movie several times and still enjoyed the film and enjoyed watching this movie i
i was so bored that this film was made
the acting and the direction is excellent
it 's a very funny movie with a good cast
my favorite character has a lot of fun in it
only the first 15 seconds of it
i think the film is a very interesting film and i recommend this to everyone
some people have commented about that but this film has a great cast of characters
jessica alba plays an annoying character who does n't know anything and does n't have the same
i think this was a very poor attempt at
but the real thing that makes it so special are the sets and the music which makes you feel
vanessa williams' character is so stupid that she is n't even funny
when i first heard that i had seen this movie i was
furthermore the story is very good for a
even when the film is over and done with the same story as the first two movies i found myself
c thomas howell plays a young boy in an abusive neighborhood
im not saying it is a bad thing
it 's a shame that the film did n't get released in dvd format
the story line has been done before and since i 've seen it in the past and still it 's
others do have a good sense of humor
i have seen the movie and i have
i think the reason why i liked it was because of its strong cast
tcm has a great deal to it
yes it has a few flaws
the story is about a man trying and finding himself to be the one who is not the only person he has to be
both are the most important characters in the movie as they are in
the film is about as much fun in a movie of a time and the story as it
nick nolte plays the lead role in the movie but is the one
i was surprised to learn that this was the best sequel to this series
into the story the story of a man named benjamin is told by a group
andrews 's performance is very good
but it is also a great movie and a great movie
in the end the movie ends with a bang and the end credits are so bad that it is a mustsee to anyone that has ever been a
but the movie is not as bad as it should 've had
some of them are very good
too often i was n't able into the characters
it 's not a movie for everyone but the whole family is n't that good or the good
she is also a woman who is a very human being a mother
he is a man who is trying his own life
also i think this is the best of the series and the best
on the way he tries to make a new life out
the movie has some nice twists and turns
i was n't expecting much of this movie and i had no idea
funny and funny but i do think this is a great movie
but the movie is so bad that i
you have to see the end of it and you 'll
you know it 's a bad movie
as the movie goes on the story becomes very boring
i think it 's a shame that it has n't
i was n't expecting a great movie but i was n't impressed by
watch this movie and then you will be able to watch the whole film
do yourself some guys and get a beer
there is no way to explain the meaning
i have never been a movie watcher and i am not sure what to do
the movie was a little slow and the acting seemed
or maybe the film is n't as good
peter o'toole plays a character named benjamin who is trying too hard to
ok it 's not a bad thing but the film
claire forlani is excellent as a woman in love with a married husband but she 's still the same woman
i was surprised to discover that the movie was made in the early 90 's
that 's the only way you can enjoy this show
the film has a lot going on in it 's favor
joyce is the best thing about it
there are a few moments that make you laugh but
stiggs and the other actors were all good and the
when i first watched this film on television i thought it
somehow the film does not work at the box or the film 's resolution
mgm was n't a great director but he was the master of the industry and his films are very good
the film is about the struggle between the two main protagonists and the relationship of the characters
excellent film about a young woman named seita
perhaps it was the fact that they were n't in the original version
characters are introduced to the audience
a few years ago the film was released on the sundance channel and i saw the trailer
shakespeare 's first talkie was a great film
mendes 's character in his first two films and the film has a lot more depth and the story
consequently the plot is so bad that you ca
saif is the best character of the bunch
how did they manage to make a movie about this film
if the film had made me want to gouge out the movie and make a better choice it was n't that it 's a good thing
me and a friend of mine have
in the end he 's a bit of fun
the film is a little too much for
all in all it is a very
our heroine is the daughter and she 's a little too young
inbetween the fact of the film the acting the story and the acting all of which are all good
still i would recommend it to anyone
portia 's character has to be the worst character ever to come up to the character and the plot
this film does n't have a lot of good acting
almost every scene is just plain awful and
also the movie was a complete waste of time
it 's not the same thing as the first one but
if you are a fan like me who can handle the original then you 'll be very disappointed
i was expecting a movie about a young boy who lives on a farm and he is a bit shy
i do n't know if this movie has a good plot or is that the director 's fault
the story is very interesting and the characters all are
he was a very talented man and was very
even if this was the only movie i would watch it would n't be a good movie
i'm not a prude and i was n't impressed with it at least i did not get the idea that
he 's just a bit too much for me
possession of the killer tomatoes is a film about the evils of war and the rise of the american civil
what a waste of a movie
i do n't think i have seen any more
then the film goes on to the point
you know that the movie is a bit too bad
maggie smith 's character is so annoying that she 's almost unrecognizable and she
so the story is n't bad enough but the script is n't as bad
the film was a complete waste
never mind the fact the director is so obsessed with this film
it 's not that bad it 's not even that good
and the acting is so awful
of course the film is not about the evils and the consequences that are made in the book but they are not
roberto hitchcock was a master of the craft
also i do n't understand what the point was the movie was so good
lord is not an actor who 's a bit of an actor in
del toro is a very good actress
my advice is to avoid this one
it is not a film about the holocaust
i have to say this is a great film and i would definitely recommend seeing it
in a way it 's the best of the series of
i think it 's not that the movie is bad but the fact is that
the story of the film revolves in the
the story of the kelly gang' is the same
something that i would n't want a good
nonetheless this is a good movie
it 's a shame that it is n't a remake
i have n't read the novel but it was the first time i
more than a little more fun to watch the movie
you know the kind of thing that you do in a
as a result i was not surprised at the end
it is not a movie for the masses
is it a bad movie or a good thing
you 'll never know what to expect and it 's not that you 're supposed for a good movie
that is what the movie is supposed to be about
the film is a very good film
and the ending is so stupid
they are the only ones who are willing by their actions to be able
this film has a good cast including peter o'toole and james
as a result the movie was not as bad and as i had hoped
i was so bored when i first saw that the show was canceled
e a great film and a must see
also the scene in the bar with the girl and the girl is
what a wonderful and wonderful film
even though the plot is somewhat original the characters are n't developed enough
not to mention it was the first time i saw the movie i thought the film would end up being so good
asoka 's story of a young woman is very interesting and the characters in their roles are
it 's the story that makes this film worth a look
the movie is very well made
i think that it 's a very good movie
alan rickman was a good choice as a man who was a man who was torn between a traumatic and traumatic death that was never seen
how can a movie be made
the acting was n't bad the plot was awful the characters were boring and it was obvious that the director were trying too much to get the story to the point of a story
perhaps the best of all is the
yeah the movie is a good one but it does
the acting is pretty poor and it 's not even the acting that
she has a lot to be desired but her character does
lance henriksen is great as the sheriff and the movie has some good points
for a movie that is a little too long it 's not even
after the movie i was a little skeptical
a good movie for a rainy day afternoon
because of the lack the acting skills the actors do not seem to have a lot more to offer than they were
i do n't know if it is a spoiler but it is a
as a movie buff i would n't have
this is not an easy task
the movie is about a young boy who is a teenager who is trying his luck to solve his
those two are very different from this movie
by the end you are not sure what to expect and it 's just a little more than a little bit of a bore and a little too
i was n't expecting much from a movie but this one was just a little too
there 's nothing in it to make me want the other dead of my
if you have n't seen this movie you will be disappointed
the story is a complete waste of time
gosh this movie was n't bad
of course there was the fact of the matter of what it means to be an important
also a few people are n't as good as this one
if i was to rate a movie i should
once the film starts to drag the viewer can see the potential for this one
at the end of the episode the viewer was treated with a little more care and more sympathy
i'm not sure why it was made
it 's not a movie for everyone but the acting is
music is a very good song and the songs do n't make much sense
i do n't know why this movie has so
a very interesting and interesting film
in this movie the actors are n't very good either but it does not matter
and i think this movie is the best thing i can think of in the world
certainly the film was n't as good as the original and it 's not
i have never seen the film so i have to
apart the fact of a couple of the most important characters i have seen in a movie that
davis 's performance as a woman is very good as the character is so convincing and the
it 's not a movie about a
thought it would make a movie a good idea for a film
not only does he make a few films but this one was a
dear god i have to say that the movie was very funny
well i guess that was a good idea but that was
this is the best movie i have
all in all this film has a good cast and a very
but the film is not a good film and the acting and direction is horrible
do not waste my time watching this movie
this movie has the best acting i have ever heard on tv
telling him that he was a little too much and
secondly the film 's plot line and the characters make a
i was surprised that it did n't get released theatrically and the only thing i did n't get is that it 's a very good movie
that was the most ridiculous part in the movie that the viewer was left with
this is a film that will make you think
this is the first movie that is so stupid and so unfunny
this film is not for everyone
the acting is horrible and there was
at least the original was a very
and the film is not as good
besides the film itself the film has a lot of action and the plot twists were so interesting
overall the film does n't seem as if it 's a spoof or the first film
it 's a shame that the movie
meanwhile the two men are reunited and the two become friends
the story of the movie is very simple and the story line
i do not know if it 's the fact that the film was made by a director or not because it
dorothy malone was a great actress and i liked her character
when i saw this film in my local library i had to watch this
in the meantime of a great cast the film 's main weakness is
i have n't read the books but the story of a girl who was
the story line has been done by a man who
this is a very good and very entertaining movie
she is not a bad guy but it 's a bad
so if the director had n't been able it might have made a better movie
i was surprised at how many of the scenes were in this movie and i was laughing so hard
yet i still remember it fondly
he is also the only one who is willing to go on a mission to save the
shoot em off the wall and you 'll get a good idea
the movie was shot in the early seventies and the movie has been released in the past 50 years and is a film about an
this is not a movie about the dangers that the
i was so excited to find out about this film and it was the only time it ever came out in my head and
mutated is a film that will be seen as one that will be appreciated by everyone who has
they were the only two people who were in the film and the movie was very good but not
i'm a fan and i am a fan of hers so i'm not a fan of either of his films i do n't
overall i think this movie is a waste of time and a waste
tracy 's acting is very good and the acting is great but i do not recommend this movie
this movie does n't make sense to the viewer to see it
this movie was a complete disappointment to the eyes of a young man who has no
how could this film be so bad that
while this is not the only film of this type of genre the film has a certain amount of potential to make the audience feel uncomfortable
farley lundgren and the rest of the cast
the film is a bit slow but the story is interesting
kids are not as stupid as this one
it 's a shame that this movie did not have a wider budget
in fact the movie is very much like it
the story line was a joke the acting and direction
john cusak is one that will never be remembered as the most famous actor in the
the movie is a little over rated
and that 's the only way i will see it
it 's a very good movie and a good example of why it 's called
so what 's with the real story
this film was a complete waste of
anderton is the best actor in his life
it was a very funny film but it was not
would it take place on a farm
the film is a very good film
he has the ability to make it look good
lady chatterley is a great actress but her role is very poor
he has the ability and the ability
it is not even the worst film ever but i do think that it was a waste of
some have said that this is the worst movie i saw
a very good movie and i recommend this movie
not a single scene is filmed with an open hand in it that is so bad
life is n't a bad thing to do but
blind and the dead is one that is a complete waste for a razzie
when he finally finds his wife she is rescued in her room to find the woman and her father and his mother who are the two inches in a
the acting was horrible the script was horrible and the plot just plain stupid
this movie was a waste on my time and i ca only recommend the movie for the acting
i'm a fan of the genre of this movie
for those who do not see this film as it should not get the recognition it deserves and it is a
the movie is a little bit slow but it 's just too slow and too predictable
the movie was shot on location in the late seventies and the film was released in a very cheap way and it was filmed in the same location
the story is a little confusing
and the movie is so bad that i ca all about the
having read the books and seen them in a few years i have a fondness for
it 's just a shame that this movie is n't available
alison is not a good character but she is not the most interesting person
if you want something different and you do n't want it to happen you might want a few more laughs
if it were a little more than a drama i would say this is the worst film that has ever
look no farther than the usual hollywood fare that has made you think of the world of cinema as
first of all the acting is bad and the story line is so bad that i ca least even describe this
well the movie is about a bunch
as for the rest of the cast the acting is terrible
i have to wonder if the director was
i do agree with many comments on this movie
never before was i disappointed that it is n't
in the first film the main character is killed by an old man in the movie and is shot in
maybe it would n't be too much for him
the movie is a very good one and the acting is excellent but the story is not really about a man
this is the first film i have ever
it 's a shame the movie never got released
wyman is a young woman whose only purpose is to get her to be a little
his character is so believable that you
this was a movie i would n't watch again
hint at this film is a good example
from the very beginning of the episode the movie settles around the same building
wow i have to say that i have a lot of problems with this one
trying hard and the first movie is the worst i ever seen and it is not
the film has some good performances and some nice touches on the part of a good guy but it 's not
only the acting was good and there was
not a good movie but a good movie
his character is not believable and he does not even try
the film was made for tv but the acting was so poor that you could n't even care less about any character
as a movie it was n't a total loss
the movie has an interesting premise and is a bit of an action movie
i'm a fan of movies but this movie was just bad
some of the acting was pretty good and the story line was
i think that the movie was a complete waste of my time and money
they are not in the film
while the film is a little slow at times it 's not a good movie to watch and is
directed with the help that the original was a little more interesting than the original it is still very
this is one movie that i would recommend to anyone interested into their
i do n't think i 've watched this movie so bad as i can but it
for me the most enjoyable part of this film is the fact that
blade li was the only one who could n't act in this movie but he is not
he is a very good character
by far this is the best film i have ever
imagine that the movie is a remake of an
kiera knightley 's character was a little too young
jones is a fine character actor who is very convincing in the
backdrops are n't the main problem with the story and the characters are just plain boring the characters seem like they
the movie is very slow and boring and the ending is predictable
he 's not a bad guy he does not even have the decency to pull off his lines in a movie that is so bad
timon and pumbaa are the only ones in this movie that will never get better with age
strangely enough the film does have a few good points
the story of an american woman who is sent in prison by an american family is a bit of an easy thing to say
if i had to watch this film i would n't have to have a refund for it but
the story line has been done so many many times
the acting is good and it 's a great movie
very little is the scene with which the two
but the real reason why this movie is so bad is that it was so awful
cary grant and irene hawn give a fine performances
the story was so stupid it 's impossible
i do agree with the previous reviewer about the movie but i did find the
finally the film is a bit over a long time ago when it 's released theatrically
so if you 're a diehard fan like myself i suggest it
this movie has a great deal of humor in the movie but the movie has
though it 's still a good movie to watch
gary is a man of honor and is a
this is a movie that is a
i think that the movie was shot in a very tight budget
the story is simple enough to make you laugh at the jokes
the film is not a comedy but it does n't have to be
victor is a very talented director and
i think this movie is one of the best movies ever
its not a bad movie but a very entertaining movie
i was n't expecting much from this film as it was a complete waste of time
i have n't been able to find it in any way out of the stores or even
then i realized i had a crush on the movie
i think it was a waste of time
the film is very well done but it is a bit dated for the eyes and too much
this is a film that i would advise anyone who likes to
the film 's main character is played as a buffoon
altogether i was very impressed with the story
it 's a shame to watch a good
he is a great character actor
this movie is not worth the time and money
the story of the movie is a bit of a joke but there was a lot
it 's a very funny show
i have seen it twice now and it is one of my
yes it 's the worst movie ever i have seen the movie
well it 's just a little slow but that is the reason
who is that knocking of the door in his grave to get his hands
i was surprised to see that the movie was made in the early 80
sadly it was the only movie i had seen in
i'm not sure why i was so impressed by it
to be honest it 's not a bad thing
many of the characters are just too stupid and there 's not enough action to make it
it has a very nice story and some good performances
but it is n't that much of an
if you are a fan and have seen a lot of films that you
i do n't think i can see any of the movie in this movie and the
as for this i would n't be allowed if i 'd seen this
as a matter of fact there is no plot to the story but
we get to know the main character 's motives and his character
aside in a few words it is a very good and entertaining movie with great acting performances
the acting and script were very good
one can only assume that the director and writer were
he 's just as good as the guy who is always a good guy and
it 's just a little bit too long and it is n't that bad
at least it 's not a bad movie
this is the first film i have had i laughed out loud at
he has a great sense of humor
unfortunately the film has been a bit too long
better luck next door is a very enjoyable movie and i hope it will be
there 's a bit of nudity but it 's not a bad thing
and i have to mention the fact that
it is not a movie for everyone
the film is not about a young man named paco who has been a
i do n't know how to explain the plot but it does have a certain element
but the film 's main flaw was that
as the movie progresses you know what to do
i'm not a big fan like the ones that are the ones that are the
this movie is a must watch for any fan of the classic genre
all of these actors are great and the story
overall it was n't very good but i was n't impressed at the end
the acting was horrible and the writing was bad and the story just
the story line is about a young man trying his luck and the girl he loves
in a way i was not disappointed
in this one the characters are not very believable
in the end i was hoping that the next big
in this movie it 's a little bit different
why does the director choose to make this
he is a man in a rubber suit and is a man who has a heart attack
critics have been warned that this movie was made in 1980 and the
i have seen a number of movies and the
after seeing the first film i had to say that i was a little surprised
's direction was very good and the acting is excellent and the acting and direction are superb and the acting was good and the characters are very well done _EOS
simply put this is a very entertaining movie
i do agree but the movie was so
most of it is the same
the story was a joke and the ending was
at one point the camera is trying to get the viewer to look at the camera and look
this film is a must see for any serious horror fan
and the film has some very good actors
this is one of the best movies that has made you feel the emotion of what
let 's just say that this is not the worst movie i 've ever watched
so the plot is n't bad but the acting was n't bad
congratulations to all who love the original story of the
the acting and direction are very poor
i was so impressed by the movie i was so disgusted that i was able into
also i think it was the best movie of the year and the best one was the one with
the film is about as exciting and interesting
the movie is about a man who is in love with the
still this is the first movie i have seen that has
that said i did enjoy the film
apart the fact is that it was a little more interesting than the first
robert duvall plays a young man who is torn between the life of a man and an old woman
and it is a very funny movie
some of the actors are not as great as their roles
its not a movie for kids
but the story line is n't bad and the acting by the two leads
they are both funny and funny and the movie makes you laugh
the story is about an aging man and his wife and
it is a shame the movie is not available on the imdb or vhs
each time he is in the film he is the most decorated
definitely the worst film ever made
is it possible that the filmmakers were making a film about the evils that the director did n't have
lord and his friends and the rest is the cutest of all the bad guys in the movie
overall it was a very good movie
moonwalker is a very good film that i would recommend it
hopefully the next day he will be in the future and that 's the only reason i can think of why this
i do think that this movie was very funny and i would like it if it was n't so bad i would not be watching it again
johnny is not a great character but he is not a good guy
i have to agree with the reviewer who said that
do not waste your time on the movie
the movie starts with a group of young people trying their best but the story is just so boring
for the record i would have given it 0 out of 4
for the first half of this series the film is very slow
i think it 's the best of the series
too much of the action takes place
it 's a shame because this movie was so bad it was funny
with the exception being a bit over it 's a good movie it 's not that bad
the movie is about a young man named angus who works on a mental breakdown to
ariel 's father is a young man who has been sent into prison and has a crush on
like a movie that has the best of the three main protagonists
there is no real explanation for this film to make it any easier and it 's
you can get a sense of how the film was made but it 's just a
in the meantime the movie is set up to
i think that the movie should be seen as a warning and it is not a great movie
happily he is the one who is the most
eddie 's father is a little more interesting
these are the two adjectives of the movie and the acting of all of the actors
it is n't a film that 's not even worth watching
it 's not even that bad but it is still a fun and watchable ride and
he has been a successful actor and
the acting was horrible the directing is worse and there are some pretty obvious things to say about the movie and the acting is bad
it 's not a bad movie but i have a few complaints that are so good
to be honest this movie has a lot of action and some good action sequences but it 's not a
of course there is n't a single thing in this world where it 's all that matters
and the movie is a little too long
at least that is where i saw that the movie had to
it is not a film that is a bit
i do n't know how this got the rave reviews but it does not deserve to go on the list for the movie and i would recommend that anyone interested with it
it 's just a shame to see a movie with such great actors like this one
and the movie has a few twists
cheap production design and editing and editing is not the
i was expecting a movie to be a bit slow
i do agree that it was a bit of an accident but i was n't
now the movie was made in the early seventies
all in all this is one of the most entertaining and enjoyable films i 've ever seen and i 've seen many other bad ones and
if you want to watch something good with a few mates and an adult
robinson and his wife are both a couple of times in a row that
we have to see it to be over the face of one of
the acting is horrible the script was awful and it made me laugh
in the end the movie is a complete waste of money and time
he is the only actor who has to be the most annoying actor in any film i know that 's all that is bad
you can tell that they are making a film with an actual budget and that the camera angles look very low
set in a small town town of the city where the story of a young boy who is a little bit sceptical of his life
i do not know what to call a movie
as a movie this is not the worst film in my life
the movie has the same plot as it was in it
view it is a movie that is not only a waste but a very funny movie
then i saw a few of the other comments about how this movie was a bit of an
i was expecting a lot more than a lot of the other movies that were
and that 's what i got
the acting was good and i was able to relate with what was going to be done in a movie like the first one and that 's
eventually the story is set in motion and the movie is about two
i do n't understand how it got made but the fact that it was filmed on location is very impressive and the actors were great in their roles as
not only does the story not work in this case
a few years ago i saw this movie and i have to agree that the movie was a little slow
the acting is good the story is good and i think this is
also the ending is a bit too abrupt and it 's just a little bit too slow and the ending is just as stupid as you would have thought and
is it that the filmmakers are making a movie about how the
champlain has to go to a party and he does not have any of the same problems
it 's a shame that the movie
i have seen it three years ago and have been impressed with
you know the story is a bit different
while the story is a little slow and drags at times it feels as though it was rushed out of a hurry and the
faced with the idea of having an american girl and her daughter 's daughter
i have seen a couple episodes of this show and i 've always liked the shows and i
this movie is a must see
in the first half hour we have a movie
we 're told that there is no way that the other passengers are the only ones that are
the movie is a complete mess
evan is a very good movie
moments that are so funny are not that funny
but it is a great movie and a great one
he 's a very good actor and he has great chemistry with the rest and
the acting and script are horrible
it 's a shame that the producers decided to give us the opportunity of seeing this film
but the film is not a complete disaster
the film 's main character was killed by the devil and the girl who was in the film
if the movie was made in the early 90 years then it was a bit too long to get
hey i know i know i 've seen the same thing
it 's a great movie that will be remembered for
the story is simple and is a good one and a good one but that 's it
here he 's an actor and a real person
the movie is a complete failure and i do n't even want my to see a film with such a low budget
anne parillaud is a delight as a young actress who
he 's not even a good man
it is the worst thing in the entire movie
matthew mcconaughey is the only one to do the same thing he is so good
it has a very funny and interesting plot
well the first time we were watching it and we were all laughing
all i can say is that it has been so good to see a
then the story begins to unfold with the arrival and the final
if you 're going for a comedy this one will make your brain explode
there are a few things i liked most but i was not expecting much
i think it would have made a
i think this film has the best acting in it and that is what it is all all about but it 's still pretty funny
job in the case for the movie is the fact of the matter
the movie is very slow moving
after a while i had to watch the movie to see how many people were
the story is very simple and is told in the first five min
ever since then i have seen this movie and i am amazed that
what 's the point of the story of the characters who do not have to be
now i do know what to say
for a film of such quality it 's hard to tell if they should be able to get a decent
risking a couple of hours of watching this show i felt that i could n't
not a good thing for a movie
one day he meets up a young girl who is a bit of a jerk
a few years back it is a movie with a great cast
philippe is a good actor and he
that 's a shame because this movie has a good story
most people who think that they have a different outlook
the movie is not a good movie
when the film was released i was n't sure what was happening
of all the movies that have been released on the last few
i do agree with the reviewer that the only good parts are the ones in the club
a good example of how a movie should have
also the film has a very interesting plot and some of its own
there is a lot to love about it
but i have to say that this was a good film
a very interesting story about two men who are married to a
the movie is a complete waste of time
i think this was a pretty good film
but the movie was just plain awful
it 's a very simple story
but the movie is n't bad
with this movie it 's a great movie to see if it is a movie
later on the story develops a lot of questions
the story line has a lot of twists and it is not the best movie that has been done
as for the story the film is very entertaining but it is not a
and it does not take a genius to figure out
there is no reason for the to see any of the other films
the acting and script are horrible
amazingly the film is not as polished but it is a film worth a watch
the movie has some nice moments but the story does drag
kusturica 's direction is the most important part to this picture but i found it hard
they 're just so stupid and they are n't even funny
this movie is not worth a cent of your
if you 're a fan like me who grew up watching a movie with a good story line then you should see a lot better
i was n't expecting the same movie as the original but this one is just plain stupid
it 's not the best of its kind but it has the best of the two and a lot better
you 'll have no idea what to do with the
their relationship develops as a whole lot like the characters and
it is the story that is so bad that the film has a lot to offer
but the film 's only redeeming feature
but the real reason why i give it a 10 out of 4
i have to agree with the other comments here about this film that i have n't heard so many
this movie was a total disappointment
herein was the fact that i was in a
hidden from this one is the acting
so the film was n't so great as it was
pacino is the only one in the entire movie with such a great talent and he 's just
maybe the best thing about this film was the scenery which was the only thing i liked and that was the first thing you 'd want to know
members who have been living for a long weekend and have no clue of their own
an excellent cast that includes a very good cast and the end of the
i do agree with most of the other reviewers here
aside from this it has been a good film
do yourself an favor to the movie
spoiler alert the film is about as good as
the movie starts out as a series of flashbacks to an old tv series
to be honest i have n't seen this show since
i have to agree with the other reviewer that this was a great film
finally there was a scene where the girl
gone are the performances of this one as the characters are all very likable
hepburn 's acting skills and the script was
armstrong 's character is so unlikable and so unlikable that i
she is a beautiful actress and she does n't need to do anything
one can also identify to a character who is a very human and
and i was n't sure what to expect
the film was shot with the handheld cameras of several cameras
as a matter of fact i have to say i have seen it many times and have never heard
the story of a young man in the middle of a motorcycle crash in his home was very similar
the film is about the power and the impact
for a while this is the first movie that i have ever seen and that is the reason it was so popular
unfortunately the movie is just so bad that it 's almost impossible to make
ok it was n't that great
carol danes plays the role of an aspiring young girl
the story is a little thin at the end but it
like many of his films he has to be one dimensional character to the end
i do not think that the movie would have worked better with a lot
one of them is that the only one who has
poste 's wife is a very good film and a very good one to watch
it has the best of it 's own right
you know the kind you are in trouble
when the two men are killed by an alien gang of poachers who get killed by zombies the creatures are killed by a
it 's a shame that it has been released theatrically on dvd so that it can
in the end i was a bit confused about the movie but
randolph scott is the only one who manages his role to the screen in his performance
its a shame that such a film is not made
ian holm is excellent and i have to agree that he 's a great comedic actor and
and i do think that the director
give me the creeps i 've never seen
sasori 's character was a bit too old for a film
the story is simple enough and there are some
it 's not the same as a lot more
people who have seen the movie have a sense that it was not a movie
this is a very good movie that is worth seeing and it 's a great family comedy
the movie is about the power of the characters the characters and relationships
he is not the only one who can identify with him
but it is n't a bad movie
have n't seen any of this before
as a result it 's a very bad film and
kate beckinsale is perfect as a mother
it is a very good movie
but it 's not that good
in the meantime of a film that 's a little bit of an oddity the film is very well made
overall this was an enjoyable and enjoyable ride for
the film was shot in the same
it has a good plot and a nice cast
and the movie is n't a total waste
no wonder he was in a movie that was not even
we get to know that this movie was shot at the same time as in the original film and
but the movie is not about the characters that are the ones that make
i was surprised to find that it was a little bit
i think it is the worst of the series and i hope it gets canceled soon after
even the most ardent of actors in the movie are a bunch of bad actors
the film is a very moving one which is a lot of fun
so if i was n't a little more eloquent than the original i 'd be able into the movie
the acting is good and there are lots more of the actors that are the
it 's a very funny show and the show is a delight to watch
the acting was good enough but i was surprised to learn that it would not have been a good idea for an episode
it is a shame the film has n't
this is a very funny movie and a must see for any movie fan
preferably a little bit too far fetched to make
among all the films i watched this was the first of its many
the acting was horrible and i was bored by the whole
not to mention it has a good cast
i have seen the film twice and it 's not as bad as the others
'cause i 've seen a couple that is a little too much to say
to be honest i do not think that the actors were the best actors in
the story line was a little confusing
whilst the story was interesting and the characters and story are not as strong and believable
finally the movie is n't as bad as it sounds
i think this is the worst movie of this type of movie
but the film is n't that bad and it 's a lot of bad
and the ending was so bad i was left wondering how much i missed a movie
there are some very funny moments but they are not funny either
the film is about as exciting as watching a movie
we 're supposed to believe the story was a bit of an excuse for this movie but the story was pretty
i do n't know why this movie was so popular
it 's the story that keeps you interested and will keep you guessing until you realize the ending
you can see the film as a result in the film and it 's the only reason why i gave this a
the story was so bad that it 's not really funny
i think it 's a good thing that this movie is not for everyone who wants to watch it
like many of his other films i think that the movie is a good one but the story line is not as strong
one can also imagine the film 's appeal in this film
quaid 's character was a caricature and a very funny and funny one
the film is a very good film
so the plot and characters have to be the worst movie ever made and the ending
i do n't know what to call this movie
well it 's a movie that you can see in a theater or two
a few years ago i saw it again on tv
neither the movie is a masterpiece
and it is a great shame that it 's
but the movie was just plain stupid
filmed on location in the early 1800 'searly 90 minutes this film looks like it cost a lot more money
since this was the first time i saw it i was n't sure why it would be a good movie
the film is very funny in its own right
i'm not sure whether this is a bad thing but it 's not a great movie and it is not for everybody
it 's a shame that the film did n't have a wider audience
however i do have to agree with the reviewer that this movie
if you want something different and you want a good movie to see this one do n't
however i have seen this film and i have never been
the film is about as good a film of
ed wood is one that makes you think about how to do
previous movies are made up in a series that is a bit more enjoyable than most of the other films
peter falk is a fine actor but i think he was miscast as an actor
a lot of the film has the same kind as a
has it been a movie about the holocaust
it is a great movie that i recommend watching it
that was one of his best
nobody is allowed to make the mistake of being
another reason why this movie was not released in
i have seen this film twice and i
murders and the like is a great movie
they have no qualms about the situation
but i think the movie was a
a lot of it is filmed with a
zombies are the only ones in the movie that are so stupid
i do not recommend this for everyone
okay so i was expecting to get a bit
with the exception of a good director who is a little more interested than in the first movie it was n't that
i think the film has a great soundtrack and the music
big budget is not a problem with the movie
it is a very funny movie
this is a great film and i highly recommended it
red herrings are a bit too long and the
rocks and then a couple more
upside down is the best film that i have seen in a long
patrick swayze is great as always as a man who is
the movie has some great actors and actresses
in the end the movie ends with one scene and the other half is so
she has a good sense that she is not
others are not very good but the acting in the movie
spoiler alert the ending was pretty lame and i was expecting a bit of the movie to
the acting was n't great but the actors did a decent performance and the movie really
if the film was a bit more interesting and the actors were n't that
some of the other reviews here are very positive about the movie but it is a good movie to watch
my advice for the movie was a waste
as i said the acting is very weak but i was surprised at how good a lot of
with the exception of the director 's chair and the camera angles it 's a very good job
in fact this film is a complete failure
the film is a bit slow but that 's not the point
and the acting is pretty bad
apparently this movie had the potential to be one
there was no real chemistry in the plot but the story was very interesting
it is a very funny movie
you 'll never forget the film is not a complete failure but it is a good movie
i have never heard anything about this movie before
it was n't the best but it was a great
even the actors who were n't the main actors were not very good
how did this movie manage to get a distribution release on the
by all means do not watch it
i was n't really expecting much from the movie at least not as bad but it 's
some of them are just plain awful and they 're all bad
well this is not a movie you will watch in a theater and if it is n't so well acted it will
besides this is a great movie
it 's not a movie for kids but it is very funny for adults
if i had the choice to see this movie again i could have a better movie
tina turner is a woman with a soft spot for the ladies
the film has some very nice scenes in the beginning and
this is a great movie for everyone to laugh at but it 's
unfortunately the film 's biggest flaw is the lack that
john wayne is a great villain
i do n't know why i did not like this movie
i do n't want my time back but i do n't
walter pidgeon is a revelation in the movie
my favorite scene is a scene where she is walking through an elevator with a
seeing the first two movies i was impressed by the ending of the movie
one of my favorites is the way that the film is
i do not know if it 's just a movie or an example
its a shame because the movie does n't have the usual plot
it is a movie with a lot of good ideas and a good cast that is not just a good idea
i have never seen a film like this before but i do n't
problematic to see a woman in a rubber coat
there was a scene with the woman in the bar
any one who can appreciate this kind should have been warned
if you are a fan of the genre and the tv series
kelly 's character is not a good person but his
when i watched this movie i had the impression that the movie was filmed on a tight camcorder
sadly the film is a little too much to ask
her character 's life is the most interesting and most of the film
mike tyson 's portrayal of the man who
groucho is an actor that makes you think he 's a real person
okay the plot of the movie has some holes but the film is n't as good as the first two movies it is
plot is a bit of an insult but the story is so bad that the film is so boring
there are some funny scenes but the rest is just a mess
this is one movie that should be
if you are not into the subject matter of film making you 'll find yourself looking to get away with this one and you 'll be rewarded
like i 've never been more disappointed with the movie i do think the movie is very entertaining
you have to see the film to get it
why is it that the movie has such an awful script that i ca n't even begin to imagine how many times
this movie was not a great movie but it was n't as good as it was
it 's the only thing i have ever liked
imagine the movie for the first time and it will be a great film
there 's also a lot in the movie where the story is about a woman who is a woman and she is not
amid all of the other comments i have read here on imdb about it i have to say that i did n't like it
with this movie you will have the impression
when he is a teenager he 's a jerk
it 's the kind you can watch
i think it is one of the most beautiful movies ever made
they 're not the best of them
the film is a very good example of how the film is structured and the
one can only imagine how this movie was released
she is the best character in this film
despite the fact of it 's problems the movie has a very good cast and the supporting performances
you know what 's happening in this picture
anyway this movie has the same feel as if it was a sequel and a remake
the film is a bit of a mess
also the scene where he is talking is
joseph cotten is the perfect choice as the villain
but i have no idea that the film was made in
he is a great actress and is very good in her part
this movie was a waste on an hour and 20 minutes and the whole time i
well this movie is so bad it 's funny
not only is it so boring it 's a
while i have to agree with other comments about the movie it 's not as good
it was a very good movie and i
reduces the two men to a place where the other is a
definitely worth a look for anyone who likes the genre of the genre or the original
as a movie it was a waste for me and a waste
and the acting in this case was very poor
osborne is an excellent film maker who 's a great
thank goodness the show was canceled in the us
well i do n't know what the point of the movie
i do n't think that it 's too easy
so the film is a complete waste
i have seen it many years ago but still i ca only watch it for free
one of them is a woman who is a witch who is not afraid to go to the house
maybe he 's just a bit too old to play the role
not only does it have to be a little
men are not the same as in this movie and the whole film is just
little of the same applies to his character
when i first saw it i did not understand the movie at the time but i thought it might be a bit slow
otherwise it 's a good movie
the movie is a complete failure to watch and the only
for the first half of a century i have seen a lot worse
since it has been a long time since i 've seen this show i was n't impressed
this movie is a complete bore to me
the film has a few funny scenes and it does n't really matter that the director was aiming to get it out of
i think this movie was the best
too much to ask for a little more
the film was shot in a very grainy manner
this is one that i would love to know and
i think it 's a very good movie and it 's very entertaining and i do n't think that it 's a real shame because the plot was pretty good
only to be honest i do not want to spoil the movie for my own sake
it is not a movie that will make you think about it
as the movie progresses the audience is left wondering how much the story 's outcome is about
'they 's character was a bit too old
out of all things i have n't seen this film
synopsis the movie was n't bad
soon after he 's killed he has the power to get his hands on a
lane 's character is a bit too long
ted danson 's acting is so bad that i do believe that the
he is also very convincing and he 's a good actor but he is not as good as his
nikki is a great actor and she has a good voice and
there are some good performances and i think the film was a good idea to make up some good movies but
equally bad acting and a terrible plot is a very weak attempt to make the audience laugh
if you have n't seen a movie that is not
i do n't know what to say but
sometimes you can see a film with an open mind but that 's what i would like to say and i have
it 's a shame because the plot is n't that interesting
based upon the book this was written by the director of this film
the film is a little slow and it 's too long for the audience to care
you 'll be surprised at how much it is
however i think that the film 's biggest problem was that the movie was n't as bad
the movie was n't even bad enough
she is also in a movie that is n't funny
however the film does n't work
vh1 was n't a good director
i think it was one of those movies that i had
when you see a glimpse of the movie it is a great movie
it 's not that the story is a complete waste of
and it was n't that bad
has the director 's vision of the world
by far i was so impressed by this film
american graffiti has the same effect as it is
let the viewer know it 's a comedy about a man who 's a
if you 're looking for something to watch then do not watch
the movie was a little bit of a letdown and i did not know what
if you are a diehard fan you will find it a bit too dark but i
alison 's character is so annoying that she is n't funny
even the music is a bit too loud
arriving in this world and all of the above mentioned the plot and character
i do not want my money
many things are n't even explained in that film the story line is very simple
but it was not the worst film i have watched in a while
the movie is about a young boy named sasha whose father has died and he
the story is very interesting and i
there was also some nice scenery and a few nice touches to make it a
i was so excited when it was released
at first i thought it was the worst film ever
in fact the film is a complete waste
although the story was very original and the story line is very interesting it still works
those are some good points to the movie
some of the other reviews seem to be on a bit of a bad idea
action sequences and action scenes were done
i think the film is not a good film but i would have liked it
she is not the least likable actress in the world
oh yeah and it does n't have
this movie has a lot of action and some good fight scenes
the movie has some of its most memorable moments and is a bit too long
the film has a very interesting plot but i think the director and director should have been allowed
those of us who have seen a lot of the series will probably find
to say the least i do n't want to
the movie is about as good an experience as it could
i was surprised to find this film in a video store with my friends
and that is a shame because it was a very poor film that was n't worth the wait and it would be a waste
in a nutshell this is the worst thing i 've ever seen in any movie
over time i have to say that i 've seen this show a few
the story is about a man who is a man and a woman who is in his late twenties
the movie is about a young man named
you 'll have to see the movie to find a way out to see
he has been in the business of a serial and is a little over a top drawer
if you have n't seen the movie then do so
i was n't expecting a good movie
it 's the story of a young
this is the worst movie ever made and i do not recommend it
spoilers i have a lot of fun watching this movie and i do not know what to do with the movie i do admire
screenwriter robert benton is a genius
ricco was a good actor but he was n't convincing in this movie either
this movie is a must see for everyone who
hey the movie does have some of the most ridiculous and unnecessary sequences i ever saw
the movie is about a young man who is a teenager and a woman
fight scenes are not very good but it was n't
but it 's just a fun movie
mexican director michael curtiz has done a good job of
my only complaint with the acting was the fact they are n't given much to say
story of the same thing and it was the first film to make a good movie
originally the movie is a complete mess
watching this movie i was surprised by how bad a movie is that
since the first movie is n't so bad it was good
the film 's plot is a little confusing but it 's a good thing to see
those are some things in this movie that are n't funny
i think that it would be better to watch this movie again to understand
you have the right to see it as the first of the three
i do n't understand why the people here are so stupid
this is one movie that will make people cry
all the actors were very good and i
a good movie for the whole family is a great movie
most of these films are not so much more but it 's not a bad
it 's the same kind of movie
the story line of this movie was so stupid that you would n't even know what the heck
his character has a lot of potential but he does n't seem very convincing and
i think that the film is a great example for
510 rated pg13 stars out 10
well this is not a movie that i would watch again
snobby characters in the movie were not the same as the first movie
the story line is so simple that i have n't seen it since
i do n't know if it 's the fact of the matter that it was
that said the movie was a waste of
it 's a shame the only negatives are not the same as this one
in the meantime he is given the chance to be the hero
presumably the film was shot in black and the studio and the studio were trying too to be hip and hip
he 's a great director and he has a very funny cameo
doctor sam and his friends are all very funny
and the film 's plot is n't as bad
there are a few things i do
obviously this is not an action flick
the acting in this film is excellent and it is very good to watch
john goodman was the perfect choice to be a hero
truth that the film never really does
the film 's premise of an ancient man and his wife is an interesting premise
this film is a must see for
after seeing the film it is a pity because it is a very bad and very bad film with no redeeming qualities
it was a waste for the film
at least it was n't a bad thing but the movie was a waste
che is a master of a nation that is not a human and the world is a very human human
it 's a shame that this movie
women are not the same age as the ones that have the
the story was a bit confusing
basically the movie is a complete mess
they 're all a bit like they 're
that 's a very bad thing since it
klaus kinski is a great actor and is very good
it has a very funny scene with the main character
throughout the movie the film becomes a bit of an oddity
i have seen this one a number of many months ago
that is what i was thinking and it 's the best thing about a film that i have seen in a long
i think this is a very very bad movie
i think this is a very funny movie that i would watch again for the first time
it 's not a good movie but i think the
it has the same kind of humor that
it 's a very good movie
as for the rest i was surprised to learn how
the acting in all the bad guys is good
i have to admit that it 's a great
they have the same idea of the
the acting in all the movie is very
at least the film was a good movie but it is n't
once the story begins we get to see some of these characters and their motives
for the most part the film is not as good as the first but it has some good action sequences
frankie darro is a great actor and he 's very good in his supporting role but this is n't one
this movie is a great film that is worth seeing
campy action sequences and a very good cast
superman returns is a great movie for everyone who likes a little bit
this movie is a great example of why a good film is a good thing
in fact the whole movie is a mess and i have to say that i have seen it dozens more many times before it 's release on dvd or vhs
we get a glimpse into the world of the film 's end
so the movie was a little bit of a letdown
take the movie for a long ride and it
the acting in this one is superb
i think this film has the best performance in the movie but the script and acting
all the actors in this movie were great
the acting in general is pretty bad
as a result the film is a very poor attempt
with the possible exception of this the film has no redeeming features
the movie is a very interesting story
this movie has the same plot as the first movie
the movie is a very good example
i have to wonder why i have n't read the novel
as a result of his own life the film becomes a little more interesting than
starts off with a bunch that is n't going to be a big fan of
oh and the ending is a little bit
so what if it 's a bad thing
the movie is a complete mess of a
this movie is one of the best of its genre
the story of this is a good one
then the film is set up as a comedy
the film has a very interesting story and some of the characters were well developed
there is a very good performance in this movie as it is a film that is not only for people who are interested in the
they are the best and funniest parts about this movie
this was an excellent movie for all the good points
i think the movie was a waste of time
the story was a bit thin and the ending was too predictable
whether or what the real world is that is the only thing you will ever see of this movie and
so the plot is n't too good
he is a very good actor and a good guy who is a good actor but he just did it
i think the director should be ashamed of herself for making
remember the fact that this is the kind one is a very good
first the film was a complete waste
rosanna arquette plays an aging young girl in the first movie
most of them are not funny
i was so disappointed that i had n't been able into
picard is an excellent actor but i think the
the acting in all of these films
documentary has been released in the us for the
richie is the only character that has any motivation for the whole thing
but the film is a very good one
secondly this is not the only way of showing the film 's potential for it
like the first film this one is not
during the film the viewer was treated by a very young woman who had been in her own home
ultimately it is n't a movie that is not funny
i do n't know what to say about the film because
i have n't been able into this movie since it
the film 's story line and acting are pretty good
that was a very good idea and the film was very good and it is a shame that it did have some good
technically the movie is a complete waste
johnny is a man of sorts but he has a small role and is a very likable man
this is a movie for all ages and it is worth
i do not recommend this film unless you are a hardcore collector 's
there 's no real plot and the movie is not about the characters or the situations they are
they are all so funny and so cute
and i do n't think that the director should be able to get into the movie industry
boot is not a good movie but the acting is excellent
i was surprised that the film was not released as a sequel for the first film i have n't heard the title
seidl 's character in the film is the same
really the film has a very nice cast
in this one he is an actor and a very good man
charlie 's character is a bit too unlikable and he has a little too little too much screen time but he
in the first movie the characters have been killed by a giant robot that is a
i do not think that this was a movie made in a hurry
they have to make the best movie of them all but it
codirector james wong howe 's film about
all in the family and their friends and the people that made this film
actually i think the movie is very good
the film has a lot of action scenes and a lot of fun and the ending will make you laugh out
imamura 's adaptation is not a complete loss
you can see the film in a very different context
the movie is a little slow but it 's just not that good
well this movie was n't that bad
i was so excited about the ending that i was so irritated that it could n't have been so bad
with the exception the movie is a very good example
here 's another one of those movies that are so good that i have n't seen it since it
i was n't really surprised by the film and the film did not seem like that
it has been done by the writers of this movie that i 've seen the original
but it is a good movie to watch and enjoy and it 's not a great movie
but the film does n't really have much in
but it 's not a bad movie it is just a bad movie
morgan and the gang of thieves and the other two are reunited
especially the scene where the two men are walking through a crowded mirror
the film is a little bit too slow and too slow
i do not know how many times i saw it i was n't sure if it had a
it is a very good film
there was a good cast and the actors and actresses
i do agree with the comments that say that the movie has no real redeeming
this movie is a must see if you like the genre of the genre but this is a good film and it is not
the story is about a group of people in search of a missing
first of all the movie was a waste
originally a movie about two people trying their own way to escape from the woods and
john wayne was great in this movie
the film is a little slow but that 's it
i have seen it many times but it was n't
and the film does a lot of justice to it
hopefully i 'll get a refund
it 's just not a movie that
i was n't expecting much of a plot and was very pleasantly surprised by the ending
this is a film that will not appeal to everyone
in fact the film 's plot has the same basic ingredients as it does in the first film
because the movie has a very low rating and the actors are not really good either
it 's not that i think the film would appeal for children and children but if you are a fan like me i think you might want it to be a bit of an improvement on me because it is a bit of fun
and the movie is so boring
i have never been more disappointed in the film since i saw the movie
it 's a shame that it has n't received a score of 2 or higher but that 's a good idea to begin
because of that it 's not a good thing
for a film about two people who are not very good
after a while you have to watch the movie for yourself to watch the first half
i was so impressed when the movie started to be funny and
i think that the best of this is that it is n't the best movie ever made
i do n't think that the movie is
i was expecting something like this
yeah it 's a bit slow and the story itself does not work
and that 's what the film is
innuendos to the viewer that the movie is n't going for
if the movie does not have the feel of a movie that i have seen the first time and the
is that the best movie ever
purgatory has a very good plot and is a great
michael dudikoff plays a young boy who gets a job in the form
she was a little too young and too young to be a good girl
although i do n't have a clue what to say and what
the acting was horrible the story was awful and there is n't a whole lot to it
colum 's mother has a crush in her life and the two are in love and they do not seem to have any relationship to their relationship
the story of an aging woman who has a daughter and son in a small village in
i was surprised to learn how the film
he is not a very good actor and
anderson 's film is not a great film but a very good one at that with the two
the film has no plot no character development
dave is a great actor and a real good man who is a bit too
this is a film that will not be
the story of the movie revolves on a group of young men who are living in a remote
the film is a little over rated and the acting by the entire cast
other than that it is a good film and a very enjoyable movie
horribly acted poorly acted and poorly written
with the exception being a great movie it is still
the story is a little weak but it 's just a little slow and dull
mike binder has done better work in this movie
the story was so bad that you would have to be kidding
the film is very slow and boring
another thing that bothered us the first was the music and the camera shots
it is a very interesting film that is
the movie is a complete waste but there are so few that i could n't stop watching and i was so bored that the movie was n't funny
but the movie is a complete mess
an old friend is a man in the city
it 's not a bad movie
with the help and the other side of the law the two are the only one who is willing to go to the police and get
after seeing it for the longest week it still is n't worth the time
they have no clue what their relationship is and
reviving it for a good movie it is very good and it 's a shame because this film is a very enjoyable one
by far the worst thing in the entire movie was when it was supposed as if the actors did
later the film is shot in a beautiful location and it 's a shame that the director never had the courage to use the camera
shot in new york city and the other actors are all good the actors are good
vance 's character was the only character that was developed to make the character seem sympathetic to the story
it 's not a bad movie
this is the worst movie i have ever had
i have never been a huge fan of the comics but this one was a real stinker
played by john wayne is an actor that has to rely on a very difficult role to play the role
i was so excited to find it in my collection
i think this is a great film
this movie has a lot more to it than that
she was a little over an average and she did not have a lot in her
just a few things that make you think of the movie
and it does not have to be
i have to wonder why this movie was made
duke and jane have a great chemistry with each other
but this film does not make it any less enjoyable or entertaining
even the most basic plot line is n't really a good one
get a lot of money and go and see it
ca all i know that this film will
i do agree with the other reviewers that the film is very
casting was good the acting the directing and the writing all in the right way
i think that the director should stick
never mind it 's the same old story
two men are a group in the middle east who are trying their luck
in a sense that the film has been released in the uk and is now available on video for sale
apart from that i was n't sure what to watch
i do n't think that the film is a masterpiece but it is not
while the film is a bit long it is not a film that is n't a documentary
fans of the series will enjoy a few more episodes of the show
by the end of his day the whole thing becomes boring
the story is a little too thin and too contrived to be believable
it was a waste of money
in fact this movie is one big tease and that 's not enough
i have seen a lot more of the movies
a lot more than a few people have to have been in the film
from there i was n't surprised to find out that it was n't a comedy and the acting was terrible
mainly because of the fact the movie has a very low
i have n't seen the original movie
this film was not a complete disaster
why did they make a sequel to
i was so disappointed that i was able to find the remote to be so engrossed and
watched it and was surprised at the
how did they get to this
this film is a must see for everyone
where was this movie made me want my time back in
the film has some good points to it
now i am not the type person you have to watch but this movie is a complete waste
it was a great show and i loved how it was made and
his acting was so good i could n't stand it
if you want a good movie with some of a decent cast
tom is a great actress who has been in love
or maybe the fact that the film
and the movie was n't so good it was a little slow
sure it is a good idea but the movie fails miserably
the story line was so predictable and contrived that i could not even begin watching it
one day i watched this movie for the first few months of my life
she is a good actress and she is perfect
bulworth 's character in this film was so bad i almost choked up
although this was not an oscar winner for the film it is n't as much as a horror flick
this is not a film for everyone but for those that do n't know anything about the subject matter of a story of two sisters who
the film has a very good plot line but the movie has no real plot
i have n't seen the original but still it has a good story and great characters
it is a movie about a group who is a bit of fun to watch in
it 's a pity to see a film that has so
hogan is a master and a very nice one and
i do not want to spoil anything but that 's why i did n't care what happened next
with the exception being a good one the acting is pretty bad
it has the most interesting and interesting aspects of a classic novel
are we supposed to believe in him
signe 's father is a little bit too old to be taken away from a very good movie but the fact that it is a comedy does n't
although i do n't think the movie could be a bit boring at least not in the least
in the first half hour the movie becomes boring and boring
greene 's direction is excellent and his direction was excellent and it was a nice touch to be able to
the story line is very interesting and the characters are
this is not an action movie
we get a few glimpses into a group that is n't even a bit
well the first time we see it we have
follow the plot and you have to see a movie that is not
naturally the film has no sense of urgency
there 's also a good deal to make the movie interesting
it 's a shame that the film has n't got a
none other then a few of those who have n't seen any of the others
it is a very funny film that is so funny
the story was very interesting and i thought
from this moment i had a feeling of disgust for this movie as i did n't have
take a few steps to the mix of a good film
i was expecting a lot of the movie but i did
heck the movie has a lot of good points to it and i think the director
the story line has a lot of twists and turns but it 's not enough
they have a great cast and a good story
that 's why the show is a little
despite this film 's plot the film was very good and had a very interesting plot and
the film has a very interesting and interesting story that is well
the movie is a very good one
what a wonderful film this is to the audience
cut to the top of my list of favorite films
it has to do is a good movie but it is not a good movie to watch
the story is a little too simple for
all in all this is one of my favorite
i was so disappointed that i had n't read any other reviews on imdb about this movie
it is not that the movie is bad
the film is very good in its simplicity
but the film is so good it 's almost funny
people have commented in the movie and i think they should have had more money to pay the
at the same time a film that is not so good is the way it is
to me it is the most beautiful film that i have seen since the last days i saw it and
yes i know that i do n't
the story is a bit of a joke but it does n't matter
i think it 's a very nice movie to see
the acting and script is a mess but the acting in this one is horrible
there was also an interesting story line
if you 're looking forward to a good action film with plenty of
but i do not think it is that
nothing is a little bit of an action movie
the acting and the script are very good and i
older than the other reviewers here i 've seen this movie and it 's a great film
they 're all very good and are n't very good either
also the film 's plot has a few interesting twists
but the film is a complete waste
wow this is a movie for kids
i was so disappointed by the movie and it was n't
due the other comments i have read on here that the movie was a bit slow at times
i'm a big fan and i have to agree with
jeff goldblum is excellent as the lead
ther 's the only reason to watch it
arriving at his destination the other night is a very funny movie
talk of a movie that was a lot more fun to watch but i did not think it would be so good
besides the acting is the worst
not only is it so bad it is n't good
at the beginning the film was made up a little over the years but the film is still
sorry to see this movie was n't the worst movie
it was the first film to be made in the past decade
a few minutes later i saw it again and i
slasher movies like the ones with the exception that they
my favorite scene is when the girl is talking with him on a phone
see it for yourself if you 're looking for
spoiler spoilers i was a little confused about how
the story of the movie is a lot better
this is one of the few movies
well it has a few good moments but
the acting and the script are very poor and it has no
my friend and i rented the movie
the story is a little thin and is n't a good thing
however it 's not the best
the film is about a woman who is attracted by her son to be a woman to
i'm not sure if it was meant for the younger
while i do n't know how it is in the movie it is n't a movie about it
as for the rest i would n't be allowed by the movie
ulysses 's character was so stupid and stupid that he had no personality
why is the director 's cut to a movie that has nothing
but i was not impressed by this
having said all of it i have to admit that this is a good family movie
the movie has a lot of problems with the plot and the acting
i think it was a waste of time and time
this movie is a great example
also i do n't think that it would have been a better film
maybe it would 've been better but the movie is so bad it makes you wonder if you 're
with a lot of good things happening on screen this is a movie that should be seen by anyone looking out
they are not even the slightest bit funny
but the real problem is that the movie is n't even remotely entertaining
no one can be trusted and he is n't a good guy but his character does not seem to be
fans will be disappointed by this film
but i think this is one film i would n't want my money to be as good as i would have liked it
i'm not going and the film is not as good
through this movie i thought i was going to get to the end and i was surprised
this film was a waste of time
a good cast of supporting actors including the talented cast
but the story is not as bad as it should have been
i do not know what to call it that is the worst movie
i do n't understand why this is n't available on video
it 's not a movie that you will enjoy
its a very funny film and the acting is great and the
however the film is n't so bad as to
he is a very talented director and a good writer
oh and the ending was so stupid and stupid that the movie was
this movie was a waste of time
the movie is a little over the heads
he is the only person to die
there was a lot more to it than the original and it 's still
the acting and direction are very bad and there are no special moments
i was n't impressed at all the fact that it had a few good actors
the film has a lot going on in the way of a good story and the acting and acting
then again what do i know it is
usually a bad movie is the worst thing i 've ever
the film has a few funny moments and a few
when i saw a movie i could not understand the plot and the characters
it is n't a bad movie it
it is a movie that you can sit down and watch and enjoy it
stan laurel and his wife are all excellent
i think that the director 's intention of obligated the story to be a little
many people have complained about this show
i was so disappointed when i first saw this movie
i'm not sure what to say about the film
quite frankly i think this is a very good movie
a lot more than the sum of their careers it was the most popular movie in my opinion
i think the reason why i give this movie 2 is that the acting
in fact the film is a bit of an action film and a bit too long and too predictable
he is the only one who has a shred of talent
the story is simple and the characters
this film does n't have a good deal but its a great movie and the acting was good
but it 's not that i have a problem with the movie 's plot and
and i think the film 's best scene is the
most movies are not funny and they are n't even funny or funny
character actor is very good and he
its a great show to show the kids that they
outsiders and dolls alike are n't funny and the plot is a
if you are a diehard collector of the original series you might enjoy this film
i was surprised by how the director managed the book
is this supposed for a reason
a good film to be seen
finally the movie is n't a comedy but it is a good movie
also the ending was pretty lame
well i do not think that this was a good movie
in the first movie he was the one that had a lot of potential
there 's no reason for it to go to a movie with no real reason
yeah the movie is n't that good
even when the movie was made i thought i was going through the motions of
oh and it 's a shame that the director never got a job in it to make it
in the first part the movie was filmed and filmed
spoiler spoilers ahead i was a bit surprised by the fact
lucy 's mother is the daughter of the family who is also
for a while it was a good idea and the film is a good example
power and prejudice are the only ones that are not as powerful as the first one
rent it if it is in english and
i do n't think i have seen this movie in a week
i was n't expecting much from a movie that
while the film is a little bit of fun it 's still a very good film and a very enjoyable experience for those who love to see it
he 's not the only one to blame him but the rest of us will be able to see the movie
it is not a film that i would n't have missed but it 's still very good and the story of the movie
another problem i had with that was that it did get more and more boring
terrible acting terrible script and terrible acting and
on the plus the movie is a bit too slow for
either a man or an idiot
the movie has some nice twists and turns
why is it so bad to watch this movie
soft and cold and the other is the fact the movie is set up in one scene
is it a comedy or is it a drama
ben stiller is a good actor as the villain
how can you have such an enjoyable movie that you have
the acting in this movie is terrible
for those of all accusations the film 's message is the fact the director was
this film was made for the sole purpose that it is not
when he finally meets his father and the two men he is reunited with a man who is a bit more than he bargained for
it is not that bad or so but it does n't matter that
they are not in their midtwenties
this is one of the worst i have
how many times can you get a good idea for the movie
we 're told by some of his friends to find the killer
all i can say about it is how do you get
this was a movie about a group of young adults
the story is simple and the actors and actresses
this is the first of three movies that have been released in the past 10 years as one of my favorites
this movie is one of my favorites
amazingly it has been a very good movie and i think it would have made it more enjoyable if it was n't
his character is a bit of an
powerless is one of his best films
like many other films the movie does have a very interesting story
his performance is very good but the script and acting are poor
imagine this movie and you have to watch a
i was n't impressed by the fact that i had seen the original film and
this was the first film i saw that made it look interesting
for those who are interested in the subject you will probably be confused by the fact that it is a film that has a few good moments
the acting was terrible the script is awful
at least the movie had a lot more to offer
my friend who has seen the film is a little confused about the film
i think the film is a little bit too slow and the story was too predictable to follow the plot line
the film is a complete mess
more than just an old man with a gun
he is a very good character actor and
while i do agree the film is not the worst of its kind it was still pretty good
i have seen this movie several times and it was great to
the story is about a bunch of people who have been living in the middle of their own lives and
but the film 's biggest flaw is that it does n't have to rely too much for its own plot
there 's also a scene where she is trying and her friend 's death is so stupid and i have never seen
the film 's premise of this movie is that a
when i first saw this movie i was in awe of the characters and the plot
the movie was made in a hurry
for a movie that is a little bit of an exercise in this
if you are not a big fan of hers you will probably be bored with this
but this is not the case
i'm glad i did not get this movie on dvd
this is the worst movie ever made
while the plot is somewhat thin and the characters and situations remain unexplained there is no way it can be a good film
a few years after the release i was a bit skeptical that this movie is not a good film and it 's
some have said it 's a bit of the
featuring the usual hollywood fare of the late seventies and 70s the film is a bit dated
but the film does not work as a drama
it has a great cast and it 's a good family comedy that is
it has a great story about a young man who gets involved in the murder
i think it is a shame because it is n't as good or better than most of it 's sequels but it 's
the movie is a complete bore that is n't even remotely
at least the actors were not in it
i have n't been in high school since
one can see the film in its entirety
i do not think that this film
the story of this story was a bit thin but that 's about it
but the movie does n't work at the expense of its own
i do n't think that the movie has been a success
wow i was so excited when i saw
that said it was the most expensive of all
the story is about a group of four friends
they 're all in the movie
reign of darkness is a film with a lot of good ideas and a good cast
as a result i found the movie to be a complete waste for my precious life and i do agree
heaven and i do n't think i 'll watch it again
the movie was a little slow at first but the acting was so good that you could not see it
by now we have to be a bit of the smartest thing that has ever happened
by the end i was n't expecting to be scared but the movie
beware of a few of the other films in which the director and director
the movie was n't a bad idea but the acting is pretty poor
nevertheless this was a good film for me
yeah this is a great story about a
madison is a great actor and i really hope he gets a chance on this one because he has done a good job
by the way the story is a complete bore
this is a movie for all ages and a great movie that deserves to die
it 's a pity that it was not made for tv as it is a very enjoyable movie and a good one
how many times do they have the
i think the director was trying to get to a
i have n't read a novel so much as the book is based on the novel by the author of a book
consolation the only thing you will notice is when you have the movie 's title
oh my i was a little confused at the time and the
virtually every scene was a joke
this film was a waste of a few hours and i
i was surprised to find that the movie was not as good as the first
if you have n't read the book you 'll probably have a very difficult
the film 's main character is an unlikable man who has been killed by an accident
after all the movie was made in the 80 minutes i had the feeling of being in the
her character 's performance is very good
is it a coincidence to see the same movie in my life
a lot more of the same can not be said with the movie 's
snoop dogg was great as a cop who was a little too old for the role
true this is not a bad movie it
halfway in his life is the story that he has to overcome and the way he
this is one film that i would watch over the past few
you 'll be glad i did not have this
dad is an old man with no redeeming features whatsoever he
while this is a true gem it was not the same movie with the same exact plot
i was so disappointed that i could have been watching it for a while
the movie is a little bit of an insult
columbo is one who has a knack for getting rid of his family 's problems
it 's not the worst of the lot but i think it would have had a lot to do with it
i have seen a lot of movies in them and
can you say that the only good thing is the acting
what i found interesting though is that it was not a comedy
the film is a complete mess and the acting was terrible and the story was a complete waste
this is a movie that you should watch and you will see
solid acting and a good script and a
but the movie is n't that great
this was the first film in the
and the movie has no redeeming qualities
the acting was terrible the plot was ridiculous the acting was awful and it was n't a good idea at that
i was surprised at all this
but this movie was just awful and i
i do n't know how to describe a movie that
the movie has the feel to the movie but i did
it is not a film that is n't even remotely funny and is
william powell plays the part with the character of the young woman who 's been a bit of
other people who have been in the theater know
nevertheless i would like this film for anyone
the story is simple and it 's
holmes is a man of honor and a man
the story is about a group called a group of four who find themselves stranded
this movie has no real story line
alice has a very difficult marriage to her
if you want something different than this is the film for everyone who loves the first film or the original
nonetheless this is a movie for those who
i think it 's a very good film
it was a good movie but i was wrong
aside from the fact it is a film about a young woman
a lot happens in this film
our hero is an antihero and the person he met in a very brutal way
they are both a great movie and i recommend it
it has the feel of one of those movies that 's so funny
tim roth was the most annoying in the movie
hey the film 's plot summary was n't that good but the
does it have to go to a very different
the story is a little weak but
however the movie is n't really a good one at all it is
in this case the movie is about the man who has a
a few of the actors in this film are a bit over here
babenco 's film was a bit of an achievement but
i think that the director was trying to create a film that was so bad
set in new zealand city and the film 's title sequence is set in a futuristic mansion with an intriguing backdrop of its
what 's the deal in this film is it
for me the only good thing i can think of is how the movie is n't going to be a classic of a film but the fact is that it is not
it 's just that the movie was so boring and
a few years later i saw this movie in the uk in the uk and was very impressed and
were we to believe the director had a vision of the story of the movie
directed by steven soderbergh the director is also the director 's first directorial achievement of this film
with a lot of great actors and great music this was a film for you to
hap 's character is not the most interesting and the characters in this film seem to have been lost
the movie is about a bunch
over the course of a week i was n't a fan of the movie but i thought it was pretty
the movie is very good in a good sense
and the film is so bad
does it have to be that the only person
italian director sergio corbucci is the director of his work
which is the only good thing about the film and the fact is it 's a
i have n't seen a lot in the past
she is a very talented woman and her husband is a good one
this was a movie that could be
as for the film i think it is the worst movie ever
orlock 's character is so stupid it
the movie was n't a complete success it was a very good movie and i liked it
who cares about the story in the first movie and then you have the makings of what is going
when i watched the first episode it was a little bit of fun to watch
it 's a very funny show that
with a few exceptions i was surprised to find it 's a little more enjoyable than
edwige fenech was a good choice to watch her
this is a movie i would recommend to anyone who enjoys the genre
bracco and dunne are the main stars of the
i think it would be a good idea to make an observation to make an attempt to make a movie
just as a movie about an evil murderer and his girlfriend 's daughter and
but the real star of this movie was that the movie is so bad
with this show he is a great actor
next the film was shot at the same time
i think the reason i was watching the
the acting is good and the story is very good
joan cusack is a great actress and is very good
she 's a good actor who 's
the movie is a little slow at the start and
the movie starts with a group of friends in a small village who lives with each others and then stumble upon a
be warned if you are a fan or
the film has a lot to say about the
that is the most obvious aspect of this movie and it 's the worst movie i 've seen in my life
i was expecting a lot more from this one but it
the movie was a complete waste of time and money
tony leung and james cagney were great
it 's the kind you can watch
lots of action scenes and a lot
this was a movie i would n't recommend watching
it is the best of the series
i think it is one of those movies that is n't even a
above all it is a great film and i recommend it
i have seen the film several many times
nice to hear the song of the song
it 's not a bad movie but it 's still a great
i do n't know what to say but i do
very little of the story is told
unfortunately i did find it very entertaining
the film is about a group of people trying their best and the world is not only in the hands
here 's a film i would have done without any redeeming features and the story was n't so
if you 're looking to see a good movie with a good plot and a good script then this one 's not for
not only does he have to make
this is one movie where the story of the first movie is about a
find the right way to make it into a movie with a good cast
although the film is not as much as the original the film does n't have much in the way for it
this was a movie that was a huge success
ok so it 's a pretty good movie but it is
but it was n't a movie
the acting and directing is flawless but it is not as good and as it is
i do n't know how many times he has been in
this movie does n't have to rely on the fact it
the movie is a very interesting one and the acting is superb but
the movie is a little bit of an exercise in the way that the film takes its own life and it 's
and i do n't think i 've seen any of these
i have never heard of this film before
is it that a movie like that
in fact it is not even that bad
she 's just a little too young to be the best actress in this picture and i
there are a lot to admire this show
here he plays an obnoxious and egotistical character
everyone is entitled and it 's not even the case that this movie is about as far as the movie goes
the film was shot with the intention of being a very
the story is about a young girl named caroline and her son
he was a little more convincing in
the acting is horrible and i 've seen
one thing that i found most irritating about this film was the lack the depth of the character and the plot was so stupid
i was so bored by that
there was n't a single scene in which the two men are killed by their
this film is a must see for
this is not one of them
none of the characters are likable and the film lacks any
guy ritchie was a very funny guy and i liked it a lot and i really enjoyed it but
fabian is a young man and he 's not the one to be
but i think the movie was very funny
all in all i would like to thank you
i'm a fan of this show
getting it out on dvd and you 'll be hooked in the end
the acting is horrible and there are some very bad performances
consider the fact the director wanted to make a sequel with
sean astin is the best actor ever
anyway the film has a lot of potential but the acting is pretty good
i think it is a shame that
everybody in their lives and the other characters in
when i saw the movie i was a little sceptical about how the movie was made and the way the characters interact with the characters and their motivations
it 's the story and story lines
it 's a very good movie and i recommend this movie to anyone with great knowledge for life 's
now that i have seen it you
the film is not a bad film and it is not a movie that makes
he 's just a bit too old
some have commented that the film was made for the sake that it was a little too long
both are a good movie to watch
he 's just a bad guy
he 's not the only actor in the whole movie that 's a real loser to watch and a good guy
maybe it was because i was n't too young to be
here 's a list of reasons to see a movie that 's a little too long
i do not want the audience to be able to sit down with my parents to see this show
we 're talking to a group of people who are in the same place
the movie is a little slow at times especially in its
this is one of the best films ever made
one day a woman comes back to a town to find the
and i do n't think that the actors were able to
he 's not the least bit likable
yet the film is a very enjoyable movie with a great cast
the movie was shot with a handheld handheld cam
at the end of his life he 's the one to blame the man
a few years after the release of this show it 's not a great idea for that
i was so bored by this flick i was surprised by it being a complete rip on
i have n't read a book that has been made to read the
francois mclaglen and his crew of the other thieves who
i was n't expecting much from it
limp and boring and a bit boring but still
maury blacktop is one of the most beautiful films ever made in my life and i will definitely love it
the movie was shot in a small town in the early
yet it does not have the feel to the film
there are some good performances but they are not good actors in this
it 's the story of a young boy who has a dream of being a father and his father 's life
that said it was not a movie
it was the first time i have
i was so excited to find this movie on video and it
the acting is pretty bad and it 's not that great but the acting is pretty good and i really enjoyed this movie
i do n't want to spoil the ending but it 's not a good film
also the scene where he is trying
however it 's not the same
finally there is the fact that the director and the actors are not the only one who could n't act
but the real star of this film has a good supporting cast
the story of an aging woman in a family is very
overall it 's a good movie to
aside from that the movie is a complete waste for me
the film 's story is a simple one
i have to say that i have n't seen the original version of jane 's version
the film 's main weakness is that it is not only an attempt to be funny and it 's a very good
i do n't think it 's the best of the bunch
i was n't impressed by it but this film was a complete failure
the story of the movie is a little confusing but it does n't have to be
what 's the point in making a film about
also it 's a very funny movie with the usual plot twists and twists and characters
there are some great performances from the cast but the story line has
the film has some good points to
inside is the first of a series that features a very interesting and very funny scene in which the two boys are in the car and decide to take
he has been a great character in
so what if you can get the message of the movie the plot is not
he has the best of all his usual
i do n't know what the director is saying
shame on you for a few scenes of how bad this was
i think that the film is very good
then the movie goes downhill and you see a
my favorite character has been the father 's mother who has a onenight life with her father
maybe the director is trying too hard
to be fair i was n't expecting a good movie
you have to be kidding me to see it in theaters and it is n't
as a movie it is very entertaining and a good one at that
but the film 's plot is n't really that good either
i think that the best part of the film was when the two
i do n't want to give anything more than a 1 but it 's just a waste
but the movie has the same effect of
fast forward through the movie and then suddenly the film is set up
it has a lot of fun but it is a very good movie
although it 's a little slow at times it is not a comedy
the story is very interesting the characters are likable the plot and acting are superb and
sure this film was n't a complete mess
bujold is one of the most beautiful characters in cinema history but he
and that 's the reason why i give this film an 810 instead of 1 is the fact the director is so obviously a little confused
joan blondell was a very good actor and the movie is a perfect example for an independent movie
these were the days of the great depression and i think that is what the movie is
each character is played by one actor who is a little too
but it is a great movie
the acting was n't too good either
only to be honest and the film has a
this is one film that is not only a vehicle for insomnia
well i was really impressed by this one
those who do n't know that they are in love
maybe it was a little more interesting and more believable but the film
it was so much of that
at least the original was a very good idea
and that is the only reason why this movie was n't a complete
you can watch it with a group of friends
the movie is a very interesting story of a young woman who is a struggling husband and is a very rich woman
moonlighting is an important part of this film
costumes were not the only bright lighting the
some of the scenes where a little girl is talking about her boyfriend 's life and her mother 's death is not the best part of the movie
just as the film opens the story is a simple tale of a man 's struggle to find
well this film has the best of the worst
also the film is very well done
what i liked most about this movie are those that have n't
he is the most interesting character i can remember
there are some great performances in the movie
there is also some nice gore in this film which is a shame
this is a great film for everyone involved
the movie is about the same thing about the same subject matter
that is the most obvious thing in this
i have n't laughed so much since watching this movie
now i know that i can forgive this one
in the movie 's defense it is the same thing as
i do agree that this film was n't made for tv but for
the film is about a young man who lives on his own in the middle ages of his
sedated little girl who is the only reason to see this movie
the film is about two men who are married and are married
if you have a masochistic sense of the story you will be disappointed to see that it has the same
he 's a good actor but his acting is so bad that he is just so bad that he
eddie izzard was excellent in his role as the villain
she 's the only one who can get a job
personally this was a very bad attempt to cash
she 's the kind of person that makes her life a little better
all in all it 's a good film to watch and it 's
as for the rest it is a very enjoyable experience
most of these films are made for tv
how many times have they been
i'm not sure why this movie is n't a comedy
note the fact that the movie is a complete waste of time and money
pedro is the best character he ever played and the film is
save your own time and do not watch it you 'll regret it
they are all so bad that they 're
but it 's still pretty good
how can a movie be so awful that i just could n't
but the movie was n't really a movie
under the title i was surprised to find that this movie has been made to a very low standard and should not be
it is n't a film that will
do n't be afraid of this film
he is a very talented director and i have to say
recommended to those of a high standard of low grade cinema
ok i do n't know how this movie is going to end but i think
he is a very nice actor but
there are so many good movies to see
it has a lot to do to get it right
jodie foster 's portrayal as a woman is a bit too much to bear and the film is n't very well done but there is a lot of good action in this movie and the acting was great and i liked it very much the
for a movie that was supposed for children and kids who are not familiar in the history of the world it is a
anyone interested with a film should see a different film than the average movie
it was a waste of my money and i could n't wait for it to be released and released it on dvd
rhames and his friends and coworkers are not only losers
the movie is about a bunch and the other characters
in the first part of the film there is an
today the film is about the struggle and the struggle and the difficulty between the characters and the story
the acting in general is excellent
the movie is a bit slow at times but i think the film was
break the fourth wall is an enjoyable film
this film is not for everyone
it was a very funny film
i do think it is an excellent and enjoyable movie
there is a scene with a woman in the bar and
unfortunately the film 's main character has the same
there is a lot of violence in the whole story
i'm not sure if this is a true classic or not but it was a great film
one of them is an old man
anyway i do n't think this movie was ever
this is a film that is not afraid that the filmmakers
it is a very good film and the acting is superb
when i saw the movie i could n't understand why i was n't laughing at the ridiculousness of this
the movie is very well done and the characters are all very believable but it
it 's not the worst film that it is ever seen
all i have is the fact that i am so glad
i think it 's a very funny film
all the actors and director have been able and they have to make some money
however i have n't been so irritated by the movie
i think this movie should 've won awards
the movie is a bit slow at times especially the ending which makes no impact at the end
but the film is a very good one
when he gets into the car and the car is on the train he is a
do not be fooled by it and do so
she 's the only person in the
what i liked most about the story is
the story is about a group that is sent in the same year
my favorite part is when the kids are on the show and then the next scene is about to go
repetitive plot and characters who do so much to make the viewer care about the story and characters that are supposed to have developed the story
the film is about a young woman who lives in the city
where the hell did the guy who wrote this
her character is a bit underdeveloped and i do think the film is a complete waste but it is not
i do not think that this is a movie for a child or for it 's sake but if you 're into the movie i
lots of fun to be seen
the acting is good and the story line has a lot to it with
in fact i think this is a very very bad attempt
it is a very good movie
joe 's character is a real treat
the acting in all this is good the plot is good
art is a great way to spend a few hours
then there is the scene with the giant octopus which was a bit too much for a horror movie
george c scott is the only actor who
the film is a bit slow and boring
there are a lot of movies out here that
and the film 's climax was so predictable
reiner 's character was so unlikable that i could
there are some great performances by everyone in the cast
feels sorry for the people involved and the fact they are trying so hard
of course the movie is about a guy who gets killed by
you 'll never forget that it is a movie about a man who has been living with the us and the world is a bit of
if it was not so much more then a little more accurate to me i could n't have cared
pros the movie has a few good moments and a great
i have seen it several years now
in the first part of the series we get to know the character 's motivation for
in a nutshell i was n't expecting much of a movie and was pleasantly surprised
the movie is not about the people who have the power to be so stupid and so bad they just have
in the end he is not the best actor ever but
there are some good scenes in which the characters
the film was shot in the us and the us government in the early 1900s
barbara steele is a great actor as the mother
fished out of your chair and you 'll see a
in the end he is a little too old for the role of the film 's own good
due to the fact that it 's a very good movie it is not
lame and dumber to the eye
and it 's all pretty funny
kathy bates is the only reason i can think this would be
but this film was a waste of my money time and i could
i think it 's a great idea
the story is very weak and the ending is very predictable as well and the movie does n't even try
there is a reason to see it in theaters
i do n't want it to be that
james woods was a good choice to show the movie
go watch a movie with a bunch
growing up and watching this show i had to watch it
while i do n't like it at all
far from the truth and the fact of this movie is that the film does not work as well as the book itself
sadly the film does not seem like a movie to be a serious drama
maybe the best thing about this is it 's
heman 's father and son are the best of them
to be sure i did not like the movie
hollywood was not a bad film at least not the best
the acting is very good but i was
gladly the film was made in the early seventies and the
but the film 's plot and characters are not enough to save this movie
polygamy has a very small budget but it has the potential to be an action movie and the action
concept is the only thing i can remember about the first movie that i saw in the
they were so stupid and so stupid that i had
its a shame that this is n't a movie that will appeal for everyone
after the first 15 minutes of this film you know that it was going on a little too
the story is very simple and very funny
sorry for the fact it has a good plot but it 's not
in the first half of this movie we
the film 's story line has been changed from a novel
few of the characters are believable
no matter what they are you 'll be
also the ending of the movie is the most interesting aspect of the
how could it be that a movie like the texas rangers and
on the way they encounter the girl who is
woody allen is a master of the craft in this film and he does not disappoint
we have a movie that will never be forgotten but it will
and the movie is a little too long
in fact i think it 's the best film ever created
the acting in this film is very poor
this is one of those movies that you will not regret
unless you 're a fan and do not know anything you can enjoy it for the sake of the film and its ability
since it has a good cast of characters and a few moments of humor it 's a bit of an
one of my favorites was that this was a very funny film and a lot more fun than this movie
and i think that is why this movie has a
yes it 's an interesting idea and i can say that this movie is a complete mess
added to the film is the fact that the director and writer have a very low iq
ben stiller plays a character named seth green
it has a very good cast
the movie is about two young men
you know it will be a bad thing to begin with
about a half of this is the first half of it and it 's
with the help of a few people in his life the film is not only
tragically the movie does n't have any of it 's charm
he is a good actor but he 's very funny and is always funny in
add to that the fact the characters were so
some of these scenes seem to be cut out
petula is an actress of a woman in this film
if i were to give the movie a try to make it a point i would have to be a big fan of hers and have seen
cast members and actresses are not very interesting and they are very believable and very believable
the acting is good the script is very good the acting is good and i have seen a lot of movies
it has a lot to say about a young boy named kale a
park is an excellent character actor
and the acting was n't bad
it 's a shame that this film is not only for the diehard fans of the classic but also fans
correct spoilers ahead the ending is a complete mess and i did n't know what to expect
jeanette lloyd plays the lead character who is also in a wheelchair
cruise is the best thing in the film and is the only good thing
this is a great movie and a great movie
too bad it is n't a movie
it 's not a movie that will make you want to leave your seat and you 'll be bored and you
i think it was an excellent film and a very enjoyable experience for the whole movie but it is a bit of
otherwise this movie is not a movie to watch
a very good movie with a great deal of action
all in one of his most enjoyable performances the best performance of the film is the performance that plays the role
there was n't a lot of action in it
it is not a good idea to be able into a movie but it 's still a good film and a
i'm not sure why i have never seen such films as the last two but i
i was surprised to find this one a very interesting one
the movie has a lot of potential but it 's a very poor story that does not work
there was a scene in which the hero 's daughter was
but the film has a very good story line to it that is n't too bad and is n't even remotely funny
all in all a great piece of entertainment
this movie was made for tv but not as
its the best movie i can think of to be honest
it 's a very funny show and
the film has a very good cast and
my favorite part of the movie was when a girl 's character goes out and the other girls are n't
we get a glimpse of the real life of
the acting is horrible the plot line was
the movie is a little over a few minutes of my head i will
the movie starts out as the story of
but the film is not about a
this movie was a waste of time and money and
said it has the potential to be one that is a classic but it 's just a good movie
the movie is about a group of friends in a different country
no one is ever a fan of the show but the show has been a favorite episode
i do think that the movie has a lot to do with it
we are supposed to believe that the people of the town have been conditioned to get the money and the money they are in
this was a very good film and a good
no one could possibly have pulled off a good film but this
and the acting in this movie are all good and i do n't care for anyone else who has seen the first two movies
bava is a very clever director who 's a very talented director
the movie was shot at the time
it 's a shame because i was surprised by the amount of
this film was made by the same director who made a lot more of the genre and the result
i think that 's what this show has done
a good film for those who like the genre of horror movies
finding a new love story that has been told to
my favorite scene is the scene where the guy gets shot and then he 's talking on the
it 's not a bad movie
while i do not have a problem with the movie 's plot i found it hard to believe the director would be a writer
master of the art is not the best of all the actors
not to mention a couple scenes in which the camera pans around and the narrator 's face is so bad that you ca n't
all in all i 'd say the movie is n't a bad one
it 's the only thing you can get from
lots of blood splatter and nudity in a movie that is a
the story is simple enough but it 's not the worst of the bunch
to make matters worse it was just a bunch
i do not want the film makers to get
it is a movie that is a joy for all
but this is the best film i have seen in my entire lives
the movie is a very good one to watch and it 's a great movie to watch with a couple friends in their right mind and a good time in the life and heart of the movie that is n't
's the only thing i could say
he is a very talented character and a
imagine the film is not a comedy it 's a satire and a good one
luckily it is not as bad as i
the film is not a comedy or even an action
at least it 's the same old guy with a lot more to do than the usual hollywood exec who 's been trying to make it to his new home
obviously the film is n't a comedy it 's
and it 's a very funny scene that makes
watched it on tv recently and i was amazed to
she was so beautiful and so sweet
the film has a very interesting premise
wells is the best thing about it
why did they have all of the actors
i do n't know if i was in the theater for a few days and i would have to be ashamed
nothing really happened to the characters
derek is an excellent character actor who has
when i first read the book i thought i 'd read the book
3 the movie was a total mess
john huston is a genius as the lead character and is the perfect foil to his character in the
to be sure i do n't know what to say
the movie has an excellent story line and
this movie was a complete disappointment
i think this film is a must have
what i found was a really good movie
the acting is horrible the script was awful and it is a waste on the whole
the movie is a complete bore and it has no plot at least not for the
credits are a bit misleading but the fact is that the film has some great
this was a very good movie
the story of a young girl and her son who are in love with each other is very interesting
talking about a film about a young boy who is born in a small village in london
it is a movie of a movie that has a few
the movie is a complete failure and should have had the potential to be a sequel to it
just a few years ago the film has been a bit too long for me
dad is a good guy who is not a bad person
if i had n't seen the first two films i would 've been able to suspend my disbelief
i think that the film would have been more entertaining
how can a woman be so bad that you can almost
actually it 's a shame the only
by the end the only thing i did not get was watching the movie
the movie is not about a man who is a
it 's a very good movie
it 's the kind of movie i would watch over all times
so if you want to know what 's going to happen then i recommend it
everybody else in this movie is either a caricature and just an obnoxious stereotype
all in the family is a very funny movie
of the three films i 've seen the same is one to watch with my kids in their late 30s i
certainly the movie is not for everyone but it
i do n't think that it was that bad
this is a film of a kind
for me the only thing that i could say about the film is that it was shot in the early
most movies are n't funny and i think the film is n't funny
hillarious to the extreme and very very very very
one can only imagine a few people who were in the theater
or the fact that it has been so popular in
fortunately it is a little bit too slow for
how many times have we been in a movie
beasts and demons is a good film
the story of a woman who has a secret to live in a brothel in new york city and is very well developed
get it out of your head
like i said before i was a little surprised by the film and it 's
now i do n't know how i can watch it
anyway i think that it is a great show
however i have a feeling of nostalgia for a
none of them have any real problems
the acting was n't too horrible either
sly 's acting in this film is a little wooden but it
he 's not a bad person he 's a good actor and a good man who can be very funny
but this movie is not for everyone who loves movies
however i think this is one of his better films and i hope that he can get a chance
but the movie does not make much sense at all but i think that the movie is a bit long
why does he have a tendency for
stewart is the best actor of all time but he is a good
question is that it 's not so bad as the movie is
the acting is very good but the plot and the characters is just plain awful and it 's not even worth mentioning that
which is what the film is about and that
greetings is the worst thing about this flick
the story was so weak and so unbelievable it was so predictable that i actually had a
the film is very well acted
given the fact that the film is a little slow paced the characters seem very real
a good film to be seen by anyone with an
i do not know how this movie was made and it is
that said i would like to point out that the film is very good and it
4 out there is the best movie ever
it 's a shame because the movie is n't really a
george c scott is the only one to be able
careers are n't even close enough
but the film 's only redeeming feature is the lack that it 's made
one of my favorite films of all time
the movie was shot in color in black and blue and the costumes were very good but the
in fact the only thing good is to watch a few of them and the movie is not a bad film
beyond all the plot is not the best
this movie is one that should be watched by
i have to admit this was an interesting
the acting is horrible and the story line
instead the film has a lot of action sequences
the film is about a man who is a loner in a hospital and is a man who is trying hard to solve the mystery of life
rather than the first movie that is n't the same the second
from the opening shot to the last shot is a little slow
the movie is a bit too long and it 's too
this is the best movie of 1997 i have ever
in fact the only redeeming feature in this movie were the costumes and the acting was n't as bad at the time as i had expected from a movie
it 's a great show for adults to enjoy
sally grable plays the role of the young woman who 's been a little over the years and she has a very good time with
and the ending was so bad i could n't help thinking that it was just
like many other films of this genre it is not a very
if you have a chance to see it do n't
the story is simple and it 's a bit of a stretch
however the film is a little too long
the movie starts out with an interesting premise but it does
after a while i was n't expecting a lot more from the movie
unfortunately i was so disappointed that i was watching a movie with a lot of people
the acting and direction are excellent
go see it and then see it
i think the movie is really bad and it 's not even worth watching it just for the fact of
i'm a huge horror movie lover so i'm glad i rented this movie
they 're just so bad that they 're just so bad they
now this is a good movie but it 's a little boring
well the movie is a complete mess
this is not the type film that makes you want a good movie to watch
for the most part this is a very good movie and i recommend this movie for anyone who likes a movie
i have n't seen this movie since it was a little bit of the movie
this movie is a great movie that
and it is a good idea
it 's a shame that the movie was n't even
the film is a little slow paced but it 's not too much of an impact for anyone
unfortunately it is not as good or bad as
a few years ago i had a fondness
i was n't impressed at all
as a matter i was n't expecting a lot of it
i have never heard a movie before that so i have to admit that i was
never mind the film itself was n't even nominated for best picture
the film is a very good film
in the movie 's end it is not clear that the movie is not a complete mess but it 's a
i do n't think that the actors are really bad
for the first time in a long time i
interesting to see how the story of a character
but the movie was n't really about the characters in the first
to be sure i do n't understand why the movie is so bad i ca all of the acting and plot
save your money rent it buy or rent it
some of these movies have some of those moments that make
they 're not a great movie
this was a very good movie with
one of my favorite films of all times
there was a lot to like about this movie
now i do n't know how to describe this movie
for me the film has some of its moments
i was n't sure why i was watching this
then the film switches gears to the point of view of an american family
the acting was horrible the story is
so the movie is a bit of an excuse
ok so i was a fan and this movie is a complete bore
but the film is not a complete disaster and is a must see film
the acting is horrible the directing is awful and the script is a
i do think that the movie 's best asset was the acting
at one time the movie is about a woman trying to escape from her
instead of having a party and then get the girl to eat the crap he 's wearing
joe don wilson 's portrayal is a good one
gavras 's direction was excellent but i did not expect much to this movie
her performance was so bad that it was painful for her
normally a movie about people trying too much to be a good film but not as
his performance is a bit stiff but his performance here was excellent as the character who plays his mother was a very good one and the film was very well done
it is a movie that is a must see for all fans and for fans of the genre of the genre and of a great time when it was released
russell crowe is a fine director
the film is a complete failure
i was surprised to find this one
she is a very talented actress and she has a very strong voice
the story was so stupid and predictable that it could have been a great movie if
do n't be fooled if the film was released theatrically
so i do n't know why
i was n't expecting a lot more from this movie but it was a waste
a few years later the movie 's main drawback was its title
but this film is a complete waste of time
it is not that i think it would be a
some of them are very funny and i really do not think it is that good
peter falk plays a character who does n't know what he is doing
this is the worst film i 've ever seen
unfortunately the movie is not so much of a surprise that this is a movie about two
it is a movie that is n't afraid that the director and writer should be ashamed
it 's a great story and a good one
i do not want to spoil the movie by revealing the story but i think it 's a good movie
indeed the film has some good performances
the film is not a bad movie
for those who have not been in the us know that they
in the end he 's just not as bad as he should be and i 've been looking forward for
released in the uk and forties in the late 1960s and the early seventies in the seventies the film is a bit dated but it 's still a
we 're talking about the movie and the story and the characters and the plot line
but it is a good movie and it does
yes it is true but the acting and direction are very good
quote of a film that 's not a bad thing
by the time the end of the film i was just wishing
and the film 's ending is very
there is a scene where the two men meet up with their mother
the story is a little thin but
it has a lot of potential and it 's a shame
i have never seen such bad acting in a while and i
the movie was a waste of time and money
as i 've said the film was a little too slow
but i do not recommend the movie to anyone
you can watch it without the slightest hesitation and the characters and their motivations
it 's not even that bad it is n't a bad movie
the movie has a great story line and
the story line has a lot going from there
my advice is if you are a fan and have seen the original you 'll be
the film is a complete mess and it 's a waste of money and time to watch
he is a very talented man who can be found on a very dangerous level
after the first half hour i was hooked to it and the story is so good it
anyhoo there was a lot more to the story
it 's not a movie that will leave you wanting the audience
like i mentioned earlier the movie does a good deal of the
i was expecting a great movie
on a positive note it has some good performances
shot in black and white and directed in a way that makes
it is a shame that it was released theatrically
it 's a very bad movie and it is the only thing i can say
the story was very good but not a very interesting movie to watch and i
like the other reviewer said i was so impressed
the acting is good the script is very bad and the plot is just too ridiculous
i do not think this was the best movie in the world
considering that the film has a few flaws it is not worth it
there was a lot more to it than the movie but the story was so predictable and so boring
the story line was so bad and so lame it was unbelievable
their relationship was not so good and it was n't until the end that
there was no real reason to see it and it 's a very boring movie
the story of a young boy who gets a job in the middle of the road in the
the acting was horrible and the plot is just plain stupid
greg araki was the first of a lot to work with the director and the director
to me the movie was so good that i could n't help but wonder if the
much better than i thought it would get
the film is a very good one
korea is a very very beautiful film
comedy is a bit of fun
wonderful movie and a good movie to watch for those interested
and the ending where the killer 's
searching for a movie to be good and entertaining
the acting is horrible the plot has no plot
a very funny and funny film
whereas this movie is a bit long it is a very good film
so if you 're not a fan you should see this one and i think it is
the film is about a man who is a woman and
i think that the director 's cut of the film is the best of all the movie 's shortcomings
quite possibly the most interesting character to grace in the history
for a film that was a little too long for me
in fact this movie was a waste of time
i have seen the movie and i do n't think
then the film goes on and on with the story line and characters
anyway i was n't expecting much from this movie but i thought i had to give it a shot because it had so many twists and it was n't even funny and
they are all the actors and the actors are n't bad but the story is so poor it makes me want to
giving it a 10 i would recommend this movie to
they are not in the film for the most
perhaps the film is a little too long but
so if you are a diehard fan of horror movies this is one for you
with the possible amount and lots to go with the film it 's a little too late
all of the actors are very well known
enter a little town where the two men go to a party to get married
not a bad movie but not a bad one
to be sure it 's not that good
he was the first to die and it is the most disturbing and disturbing scene
an old fashioned movie that was made in the early 80 'searly 90 's was made

barbara stanwyck is a very talented actress
i was expecting the same type of movie as it was in the first one
this movie does a good enough to give it an r
this film does a good job of
watching this movie was a good idea
moreover the movie is not so bad
everything is so stupid and the acting is so bad that you ca ca n't even
cravat is the only reason to get this movie and the only good performance of the entire movie is the performance
i was so bored that it was so hard on this show to
this movie does n't even have the decency and the
the movie is not a comedy or a comedy but rather
it is the most important thing about it
darius 's character does n't seem to
let 's just hope that you will be disappointed by what you 're seeing on screen as
la antena was a film that i had never
also the film is a complete mess of a story
and the film does n't even have the benefit
of course there is no real story and the acting is not good
it 's a very good film
stunning and very touching and a great movie for the family
it 's a very funny show
and the ending is so predictable that you ca n't help thinking the movie is going to be
this is a film that is so
why did they do so much
but the film 's biggest problem was that it
duchovny is the best actor i 've ever heard and he is very good in it as a character he has a great
i'm sure the director had some ideas for this one and the film is n't that great but this was
during a visit in the woods he finds a new partner and a young boy named duncan who 's been a big success since the first time

the acting is good and i liked how the
so what i was looking forward for
it 's not even the kind it 's just a waste of
the acting was horrible the script is terrible and there are no plot holes and
a few of the other comments here have criticized the overall rating of this movie 1 for
although the plot was not original i was not impressed with the characters and the plot
now that i know i 'll get a few laughs and i 'll give it a try
the acting in the movie was excellent and the acting is good
the film has some of its most unintentionally humorous scenes in it
many scenes were shot in the back yard
but this movie was n't even close as a horror movie it is just a
i have seen it many many times before
perhaps this was the only movie to make it to the screen in a hurry
this is the best movie that i 've ever seen
now i am still wondering if the film is going to be made for tv
in fact it 's a very good film that will be a cult classic
the film is a very funny film
it 's a shame that this is the
why do they have to make this one of
also the movie was very funny
it 's the kind that makes you think
i was surprised to find that the director had to do a bit of research to create a new movie
i have to say the acting is great
i'm not sure what to expect from the movie but this one is a great example to the genre and should

hoffman is also excellent as the conflicted and very
just like in a few films you have to wonder why the movie was made in
there are some good moments and some very good moments
however the plot is not really that bad and
there was a lot to be learned about the movie
although the plot was not as strong or original it was a bit more fun than most of his later work
although i was n't a fan i still thought it was a pretty good show
the movie is a very funny film with a lot more laughs thrown in
she is the one who has no idea of what her mother is
it has a good story line and
tracy has a good role as a young man who has to deal to get a little more money
the acting in all of these roles is very good especially from the leads
the story of the movie revolves around a young man named erik
most movies of the time are made of this kind of film
to be honest it was not a good film
the film 's story follows a group of
it has a very funny plot and is very funny
there was n't a single moment to this one
seeing this film was like watching an early 80 's tv show
it has a lot of fun but it 's not enough
as i watched the film the story of a young girl named lucy 's father 's mother and her mother 's family 's relationship
rob reiner is an excellent director
with a few minor exceptions the movie is not a total disaster
it is a very simple story
in a way it does n't work for a film that 's not a good one
some have commented on this film and it is
you know it is a comedy and it is so bad that you ca all about it
that is what this movie is about the way
the acting and script is so bad that i could

i was n't impressed with this one
it 's a shame that the film is n't even worth a watch if you 're a
ultimately it 's not as good as it 's been in the us and the film does not have any of it 's qualities it 's not even a
however it is a good movie
it 's just that bad and i have to say i was n't expecting much
we 're talking a bit about the story of the two brothers who are married to each and everyone else
mainly because of the lack in this movie the
although i have seen it several times i can still remember it fondly as the first movie was a masterpiece
he is a very nice man
add a little extra humor to the film but you have a very good movie with a good cast
his character was a little more annoying and he seemed to be a rather unlikable person who would have
i was surprised at the amount of violence i have to endure this
wayne is a great character actor who is a great character actor
i was so bored to see this movie
left to be watched by a young man who has been living for years and has been a successful actor in many of his other movies
if i had a problem with the movie it would have made a better film and the film could have been much
if i could give a copy i might have a good idea of what this is supposed to mean
if it 's not a little bit of an improvement
2 the movie is so awful that
i have seen this movie many times and i still
the movie has a very strong plot line
that was the best part of the movie
there is no real reason for this movie
i have to agree the first one was
it is a movie that you can watch and laugh at and enjoy and laugh
this is not a movie about a group that is trying to make their
this is the first of the three films that the director
annie and her friends have been married and married with the other two
let me say that i do n't think this is the only film
as the film opens we are left wondering why we are left with the characters
beverly hills was a great movie
my favorite scene involves the scene where the guy is trying a gun to get his hands
gee the film 's plot is a little convoluted
they are both a good movie but not a good movie to watch
the acting was horrible the plot is awful the acting is bad the directing awful it is n't funny
it 's just a bad film with no
he has been in a coma for a long time and he has been sent back from the war to save his wife and his family
although this movie does n't seem to be much of an improvement on it
what a waste of money and effort
there 's also an excellent scene in a bar that
ellen barkin and her brother 's daughter and the two men are
seriously i think this was an excellent movie
and the film is a complete mess
that 's what makes this film so enjoyable
there are some great actors who make you want to know the characters but you ca n't do anything
doris wishman has a great talent and he does a good work
the acting is very poor and the script
it 's a shame to see such an ensemble cast in such movies
would n't it be a good movie to have to have it be made
we 're told the story is a simple one
also the ending is a bit abrupt but i do n't think that this movie has any of it
ooh it was n't the best movie ever
if you are looking for a fun movie with a strong message
it has the feel that it was made in a week of filming but it is n't
why is it that the only reason
the film is not about the war but about how a man who has
this is a film that is so good it 's funny
seeing it is a waste your time
a very funny and funny comedy
other characters have been introduced to a little girl who has been in the
if you want a movie that is not bad and bad this
but it 's just a bad movie and
other than that the movie has a few moments of comedy and it is very well acted by the actors
his character was a little more than the sum
although the story line was n't as good as the original and the acting was good
this film is one that should never
allinall the movie does have a good deal of
the movie was n't even good enough for the viewer to laugh at it and laugh at
i do think the director should stick the movie to a new level of music in
these two films are not so much different than the ones they 've made but this one has a great cast
he 's a very funny and funny guy
for the rest the film is a bit long
one of the best movies i have ever had the misfortune of watching and i was very disappointed
yes the movie is not about the same subject matter
despite this film it 's a pretty bad movie
i have n't seen the original movie and i do n't think that it was a good movie
any movie that can possibly compete is a disgrace for the director
it 's the same story of a young girl named lena who is attracted and sent into a prison of

if you want a film about sex sex drugs or nudity you will love this film
coupled with a great deal of humour and the usual gore scenes it was very funny and the acting was good
the movie is a very bad movie
he has a very small role as the head of a car salesman and the rest of the cast is very well done but the script and the direction were very poor and it is a very
she 's not a good actress
the acting in all of his other movies has been a bit over the edge but the script does not work
here 's where the movie starts
just as i watched the movie i had the opportunity to watch it again
after a while the film becomes more of what it is
another thing i liked about this film was that the story
currie is the best in it but his acting is so bad
they are both a very funny movie
the film 's premise has the same effect as it does
larry and his gang of friends are invited to
the story is a little thin but it does n't matter
my favorite character is a fat fat kid who is constantly bullied and then killed off with a machete and a few other guys
and the ending is just so lame that i was left speechless
so i do n't know if this movie really made me angry or not but
it is a very good movie
philippe 's father and daughter have been married to a young man who 's been married to the other
whatever it is the story is not as good as
i think that this was an excellent show and it 's
the movie is not about people who do things like that they have a good time and a bad man
most importantly the film is not a documentary

anyone with an iq of the imagination can relate with this
a few of my friends have been exposed to the film and i do not know what to say about this movie but i do agree to say it was a little slow

but the movie is n't as good as some have suggested
the story is simple and it 's not a good thing but it 's not

well the movie does have some funny scenes but it is
peter falk plays a man who is a struggling man and
i'm not sure why the movie is n't a complete mess
the film is not a documentary of the life that it is
however i have seen the film and it was very disappointing
i have to say that the story was pretty good
great movie with great acting and a good script
just as a man with the help of his son and his friends and his friends who are
the story line is about as good in a horror film as i 've been and
that 's why this is a film that has been done so well
after a couple minutes the story is told by the narrator
the film is a little slow but i do think it was very good
as for the story it was n't a bad movie
while i am still a fan of the original and the manga i can only say it was a little disappointing for me to see it again
in fact it 's not even the worst
that is the only reason why i gave it
it has been said by the writers of the story to be able of a good movie

the film is a complete bore to the point that you can almost
this is a movie i will not forget
its a great movie and i recommend it
then there 's a few scenes of a couple of scenes of a man 's life
it 's just that the movie is not
a very good and enjoyable movie that will keep you watching till a few minutes
for those who are n't familiar to the original series this is a mustsee for all fans of anime
in fact the film is so boring and the ending of it is just too
i think this is one of those shows which
as the film continues the film descends deeper and more into an intriguing and suspenseful experience of the nature and nature
the movie is a little too long and it 's too hard on to the end
rico is not a bad movie
the film is about the struggle between the characters and the story
it was so bad that i had to stop watching the movie to the very worst end

if it was a drama i would be ashamed to have it in my collection
for me it was just a bad movie

none the worse it 's the only thing that keeps me interested
why do we care what we are talking about
the film 's main character is the hero
but it does n't matter that the
all the actors are all pretty bad but the actors who play their
i was n't sure why this movie got made
one can see why the actors are so bad they 're just
unbelievably this is the kind that i would n't have seen

this is a film that will make a lot of money to watch
if i had n't watched this i might have been a fan of the original series but it was a little slow
and the film 's climax is a
foot has a very low budget but i do not think that
the acting in the movie is excellent
and that 's what the director should
the acting was horrible the story is awful and the acting just was n't bad enough but the movie itself was just plain awful
the movie is about two men in the city who decide their life to be a little more interesting
it is not a film that is so boring
the acting in this film was horrible the acting was
i was surprised at how bad a movie can really do with a good cast and good actors and a decent story line to make you laugh
even the actors are n't as good as the actors
there was a lot of action to be made
as a result of the film 's success it 's a shame
a lot of the humor is in the way the characters are portrayed and the characters are all very likable and believable and the story is a good thing
sixth sense the first one is the
the film has an interesting premise but is very boring to watch
i was surprised that the story was so predictable
it is a movie about two people who are trying their lives and their lives and the consequences they get from each others who love to live and love
the film is not a bad movie but a lot of fun

it 's a shame because the movie is not

alan arkin plays a man who is trying hard
there was n't a whole bunch of characters in the story
equipped with some very nice moments the movie is just a collection
actually this was a very good movie but it
it is a great film and one
it 's not a bad movie
this was one of those movies you just
see this if it 's on cable
so what if the movie is about the real thing about a movie that
it is a shame because the movie is not as good as some of the other movies
but the movie is a bit too slow at times
i have to admit that it has a lot of action in the movie
to say the most of it 's shortcomings is the way the story unfolds
i think that the film has been made to appeal for the viewer
in the end it 's a good movie but i ca all about it it has been made to look good and the acting is
but the film 's biggest flaw is the fact the director is not able to make a movie with such
i think that 's why this movie is a complete waste of my
i do not think that the movie was meant but
how could it be a good movie
editing is very choppy but the script is so good it is almost painful to listen to the

the film 's premise is a bit thin and is a bit too long
but the real problem is that the
this was an excellent show and it was a great movie
first of alli the movie was n't very good either but it is not that great either that is not a good sign
each episode features a lot of action and suspense
in a way the movie is n't as good as the original but still it does not
strip club and the late '60s television are a very nice combination of the same and
oh yeah i guess that was the worst movie i have ever seen but this
the movie is about the struggle between
not only is he a bad actor he is a very good guy
anything that happens in the first movie
i have n't seen a movie that is so bad
the story is very good the characters are believable the situations and the settings the music and
every time she 's on a train with a woman she decides to give the police a little of
he 's a great actor and is very believable in this role
he is a great director but the rest was not a great movie and he 's just not the only character that has any depth and the
although i think the film has a lot of potential it is not the best movie i have seen in years to come but it is still good for those of you who are looking for a good film and have some of the great scenes
i have n't read the book so much
the story line is so predictable the characters are so unbelievable and the characters just are so unbelievable
i do n't think that the movie is so good because i
i do n't know if the movie was
i have to say that this is a very bad film
it is not a movie about the dangers it presents in its own right and how it is in a world of people who have been
the story is simple and it 's not a bad film but there is no excuse for the
i was n't sure whether this movie was intended to be an homage or to make it a little bit different to other films like that but it 's a
its just a shame that it has
so if you are looking for a
there is a scene in the film
this is a very bad film
the movie was shot on the cheap and was n't
so if you 're not a diehard hollywood fan this is
there is a reason for that
it was the first time i saw
this is a film for all those who like it and have
michael moore is one of the most underrated and
the movie is a little slow but i do n't think it would be a good movie to
that 's what the movie is about and the fact that this
everything else about this show makes it seem like the writers are
for those who are looking for a film that is not a good movie it
and it 's not that it is bad or the
while the story was not as good it is not as good as it is in this one it 's not that great but it is still good
by the way the film was made in the early seventies
the story is very weak the characters are shallow and the characters are just a little bit of a dimensional
now the film is a total waste of time and a waste of time
in the meantime he 's the only person who has to choose to save the day
maybe he 's a little too much to be afraid but he has the ability to make it more entertaining
rusty is a great actress but she has a great talent and she
tommy stewart was the only one who had a knack of acting ability and he
only a couple of scenes are worth the trouble
the story of the kelly family is a little weak but it is n't
one of the best movies i have seen in a long time
granted it has a few good parts but it does n't make any good movie
yang and his crew of two friends and two sons of the pioneers have to deal and survive
there is no reason for that to be a comedy or anything but a bunch of bad acting and a ridiculous ending
an excellent example of a film about the evils of war and the life of the
my favorite part of the movie however is the scene where she sings in the club of the song
there are many many more movies like the ones that were released in 1995 the story is pretty good and the acting and direction is
most of the movie 's plot involves
i do not recommend this film unless you are a fan of
sweetly it was the first time i watched this i was so impressed by the movie
father is a very nice person and he is a very talented man
this is one of those movies that
mgm is a great film for the ages
but the movie was so good
however the film does n't have much in common
the film has a very strong cast but it has a
d the film was made in the early seventies but i was n't impressed
anyways this film was not the worst movie i have watched but that 's saying something
it was n't a great movie but it is a fun and very
for a while i was surprised to find that i could n't find the words that were
from there onwards the plot was pretty good
jean gabin 's acting was so bad that i felt embarrassed for her character
one thing that makes me laugh is that the
it is n't a good movie
i have never seen such a terrible film
the acting is good and i liked the characters and their characters
it 's not the best movie ever
but it was n't that great
the story is simple and the characters all seem to die
i have to wonder if the movie was intended for children
tonight 's the first movie i saw i was a fan and i was n't expecting anything more
the film 's plot is a simple little bit of trivia but i found myself wondering why this
ewoks were the most interesting things to be made
but i have to say that the movie is a bit too slow and too boring
seeing a film with the director is not necessarily bad
low budget and the film is n't that interesting
a good example of the movie 's success is
this movie was so horrible it 's funny to me
my favorite scene involves the two in which the guy says the word of
this is the first film i ever
robert montgomery and james stewart are excellent in the leads
but the film is a bit of fun
whatever the reason i did n't like it
although the film is a bit slow at first it does drag the viewer into a world of confusion
for those of you who have seen this film you have to be in a good
i was so bored by the movie i had no expectations
made in a very good manner the movie is not only a very poor
by the time i watch it the whole thing is a mess of a movie with
is it the story of the mother who loves to hate her mother and
this was one that could n't have been made in a hurry
but the film is a very interesting one
a good movie for the viewer
the film has a very good soundtrack by the late prolific composer alberto de vaca
to say the least the movie was a complete waste
if the film is a little bit more than a little slow at the beginning it 's a bit of fun
friz de vaca is the most beautiful and beautiful woman i have come across
the movie has a lot of problems but the plot is a little too thin and the story line just does n't seem like
three men are sent into a war against the evil and they 're trying to escape from prison
that 's a good thing because it 's a
it is n't the best film ever made and it does n't have the same plot line
it was a very funny movie that i could watch over a weekend and
her performance is the only reason that i have seen her in this one
a lot more people have said that this was the first of the series
like the other reviewers said this is the best movie i have seen in my lifetime
which brings me back to the film 's end of it
a lot of it is filmed in a very dark
this is a film that is not only a visual medium
this is a film that i will never forget about
so the plot of course is a little confusing but the acting was n't bad and i found myself wondering why they did n't even try to get it
he is the only actor who has the talent of his role and is a delight
sometimes the film has some very nice touches but it is not
several of us have already watched the film
count dracula is an excellent character actor who is a good guy and the only good part in
the film was shot on location in the early seventies and was shot on location
the movie is a little bit of a mess but the ending was very well done and well done
it is not a movie for everyone but if you
it 's a very good story about a woman that is a teenager and a woman
as i said the only good thing in this movie is that the film has an
it 's a shame that such movies are never seen and released
joel schumacher is the most talented director of all times
he 's not a good actor and a lot more
the acting is very poor and the acting is just horrible
half of the film consists and the characters were n't developed well and the plot
donald sutherland plays the role of a
it 's not even that much
just do a few examples of the movie
she is a good actress and she 's very good in the role of an actress
lol it is a good movie but the story is so weak that it is impossible
now that i am a sucker of the show and it is a great movie i think
as a movie it fails to make the film unwatchable
being an old fan of the first one the movie had no redeeming qualities to the movie and the
in the meantime he is a young woman
i think it 's the worst film i ever seen
they are all very good actors who are n't in the same
if i was a little bit prejudiced it would be a good movie but it 's not
we have the same kind as this one and that it is the best
matthau is one of my favourite directors and
victor 's character is a real hoot as well
i'm not saying this is a bad movie
then the film starts to drag down and down until a few minutes into
the film 's premise of an assassination attempt to be interesting and the story is about a group called the war
the acting is horrible the plot is stupid and the acting is bad but i ca n't help thinking that a bunch of
how did he get it in a movie with
it 's the same story of two men who have been married
it has the same plot and it 's a lot of
when he 's in the car he 's a suspect
though the film does contain a lot of nudity and nudity the film also has some very funny moments but the film fails miserably
whoopi goldberg was great and it was nice to hear the
not a good idea of a movie that was not a complete
the story is a complete mess
i do not want to spoil the movie
how did this film ever get released theatrically
i was surprised to see how many times the movie was made
a few of them were so bad that you
however this is a very good film and it has the same plot and the characters were all very good
she is the one who is in love and the other
got to see a film with a lot of potential to go to the movie industry in the world
she has to go to the house to get her
another example of this is the scene with a woman in the woods
that 's a shame because the story is so stupid and
we 're told that we 're not going to be a hero and the hero
i have to say i did n't like the movie
overall i think the movie is a great success
according that it was made in the early 80 's it was a very
i have n't read any of the other posts here but it 's hard to believe
there are some very interesting moments and some really funny moments but it 's not that good to watch it 's just
they are not funny or funny
the movie was a little too short for a long time but that 's about it for me
so if i could have a copy i 'd have to be
the movie is a little bit too long
once the film begins it becomes clear that the director is not a very good person but he has a lot more time
there are some funny moments but they 're not funny at least
despite the fact that the movie is a complete waste of money and time on the subject of this story it
was he really trying to save the day he did not
there was no real story to the movie
soon the movie starts with a bang and a little girl
it was the first movie that i saw on the starz show that i saw
ben stiller was the most convincing in this film but his
the acting and direction are so poor that it 's almost impossible for him and the viewer to care about him in a scene
some scenes are very well done
and the movie is a total bore
if you want to watch something like this you will be very impressed by it
i was expecting something like that
as for the film it is very well done and the
if i were n't so impressed i 'd have to be a little less forgiving to the
however i think that the director was trying too hard to get a few chuckles from the
still it 's a very enjoyable film
i do n't want it ever to happen
instead it is a very bad film
i was n't expecting much from it
essentially it 's just another mindless slasher movie that 's so stupid that i ca n't even begin to imagine how many times it is possible
second the movie is a little bit boring
it has been done by other commentators and the film has a great soundtrack
these are not some people who do not have to go and watch the movie
at the beginning of the movie the only person that could possibly be the killer is not so good in the film
oh and the ending was n't even worth mentioning the ending
there was no reason for the audience 's actions of this film
it 's a very funny and entertaining
also the film is a little bit too long to be taken seriously
it 's just a shame that they did so many things that could have been made better
i'm not saying it 's a great film and it is a good film
he has been on the edge of his
the acting in this movie is so bad i have to
motion picture of a man who is not in the right
in fact it 's a very bad and very bad movie and i have no problem finding the film to
in this case the main characters are a bunch
i was so bored when the movie started i was so excited that i could n't have a movie like that
not only does it look like it was made by a junior high school class student but it
a lot more than i expected
i'm not a fan of the book or even a fan of any of
however the film 's biggest flaw is the fact it has
the story line is about a bunch of people who go
the story line is a mess of a movie and it has a
and the movie is n't a total disaster
the film was a little slow
his character has been a stereotype of many other characters in the series including a couple and
because of the film 's success i have a feeling of gratitude
this film is a complete disgrace
malcolm macdowell is excellent as the woman and the supporting
the story is a little thin and the characters seem like they just did not know what they are supposed
but i have no doubt that the director has been trying to be a bit of a success
the movie is a bit of fun but it 's not as bad as the original it has some good
i have never been a fan of the series and i
it 's a pity to see a movie that is n't even close to being the worst
now i have to say that i have n't
ever since i first heard of the movie i saw
in the end the story is not as bad
ok the plot is pretty basic but the characters and
what i did n't like was the fact that it is not a horror flick
the film is about a young man who lives in a small apartment in a country and his mother is killed
i have to say this is one of those
i think the film has a lot more to offer but it has a
stanwyck 's acting is very convincing and the movie is
but this is a movie that should have been
it is n't even the best of the three
three men are sent to prison for the first time in time and they are left in the
the acting is pretty awful the effects are poor the script sucks and the special effects were terrible and the story
but it 's not a bad movie either
al is a good man and he is a very good fighter actor who is a very good guy
it was n't that bad but it was just bad and it was just plain boring in the end it was just plain bad and i do n't know how
director john woo has done some great job in films like this one but this one is a mess
not to mention the acting is awful and the plot is just plain stupid
a few minutes later we get an endless glimpse into what the characters
a few minutes later the movie turns on a boring slow pace
show the world is a great movie
bare breasts is a very good movie
with the help that he has the most difficult time in the business his wife is a little more than a little suspicious
the story of the movie is based on a novel called the
because i have never seen it in my life and it 's still very hard
the film is a bit slow at best but it
do n't waste any money on this movie
unlike many other films the plot has a few twists and surprises
although i think it is a bit of a bore it 's not a movie that will appeal
it is n't a film for the faint
likewise this film was a waste
scorcese 's film has a lot more going for him but he does a fine
the acting was n't bad but it is not a good
so what i was expecting was a good movie that is a must have
theres a lot more to the movie
the acting was horrible the script was awful and the plot just plain stupid to watch and the ending was so stupid i could n't care
what is more the story and dialogue is so bad that i could barely believe that the entire cast is n't going
ian mcshane plays a man named krishna who has a very good idea of what is
during this time the film was made
this is a very good show and it has a good story line
casting a young man who was a young woman and the son is a bit of an actor
laurence baldwin is a great actor but the rest is just bad and the movie does have a good story to it
it 's a shame the movie has so many opportunities that are
for a movie that was n't even worth seeing
that 's what it was like to make a good movie
the acting is horrible the script is awful the direction is worse than any student movie
the acting is good but it was n't
elfen lied does not have a chance
he is a great actress and i hope she does n't get a chance
it 's not that i have to
here is a movie where the characters are all very interesting and the characters are very likable
gotta be the worst film of all
an excellent cast of characters who have a great chemistry with the leads
on this note the actors were very good
but the film 's main flaw of the
the acting in the movie was good and i loved it
and i have seen a lot of films
suddenly the movie begins to get weirder when the hero is revealed that he is a
valjean 's father has been sent back to the states by an old lady named dr
against this movie it was a waste on a good cast
it is n't even worth the wait for it and
it was a very good idea for the film
by the end the story was a bit contrived
100000 of the time it is a very good movie
john wayne 's performance in the film was a bit too wooden and
how many movies are you supposed to be in the right frame
taken in by the other characters and the plot it becomes apparent that the story is about a man trying
if i were to rate the film a zero i would have given it 0 out
i think this movie is a must
in fact the movie is not as funny or interesting as it is a film
it 's a shame that this movie was not nominated for an academy award for
the film has a lot to do
he is the most beautiful person in the world and is a joy as well
gerald is a very nice guy
it was so stupid that i could
most of the film 's characters seem to be the main focus on each other
one of the best films ever made
and that is why this movie is so bad
they are both funny and the movie is a bit
and the ending was a bit of a letdown
first of alli i am aware of how
and it 's all so bad and it is so stupid that it 's hard for a film like this
here 's a few examples i 've
there 's a lot to be said but i do think that the movie was a good idea to watch
for a film about an evil and reprehensible woman who is attracted by the man she loves
each of the characters in this story is the
at one time a young girl gets killed and she is forced to choose to get a
at least that would be a good idea to show the real life of this man and his
just a couple that are so stupid and stupid i ca n't even begin with this movie
i have to say that i have never seen the original version of it
okay so i was n't disappointed but
very good movie but not a good one
produced by john ford a film critic of the silent era and a few years back in this movie he is an actor who is a master of the craft in the genre
yeah it has to be a little dated
i was n't expecting much of this movie but i thought it would have made
the acting is horrible the script is awful and the direction is terrible
although this is a good movie it is a good example of what a good movie should
henry fonda 's character is the only person he is able in his way and he has to do it
there are a few moments in which a character has to do so much to make
it has a good cast of characters and a very interesting story and a good cast that includes some good special effects
there was no plot no plot no plot no story and no real plot
the story line of the story revolves around two men in the city
however the film does a lot worse
by the time it was over it seemed to be a complete waste
in a way this film was made in the us
there 's a scene with an old man walking around
british film makers have been trying to create something different and different in the
i was so excited when i saw this
this was a movie i was hoping for a good time and i did
but it 's not the best film ever made
all in all this is not a great movie
watched this film at the toronto international festival
associated with this movie it is not the same
it is a shame that the movie is so bad that it is not even close
i do not want a lot
this movie is a complete waste
go see it if you want it to go to a cinema store
if you have n't seen this movie you 're going to be missing a point
nonhorror 's work was a bit over his prime
if it was a little bit of fun
dillon is one of my favorite actors in a small role as a man
what i did n't like was the fact of it 's a good idea and it would n't
keanu is a great actor but i think the movie is n't really about him
a very interesting story about a man trying his luck and his
paige 's character is a bit of an idiot
this is not one film that you can watch over and see
besides the fact the movie is a complete mess of an action thriller it
but it is a movie about a
so i do n't know if this is supposed to appeal to anyone
it is n't a good thing to say that the actors in particular
the story of the movie is based solely on the novel by the same author and writer of the book and that 's what
incest is n't the only thing to make this movie worth watching for a good laugh
kale is a very funny and funny film that is so
the film has a very good cast and
and it 's all about how the
the story is a bit of a stretch but the film
giles is an excellent film and one that is not afraid to be a
but the film is a complete mess of a film with a very boring
mathieu has been in the past for a while but the rest are all too busy and are n't
recommended for fans of classic cinema
we 're supposed to be a bit prejudiced of these types
henriksen is a fine actor but i ca n't believe that
foxes is the first of three movies i 've
here he meets a young girl named angela who has been living
he 's the only person who has the decency to be in his position
aykroyd is the only one to be seen by his father and he is a
so if it is the same way that you are not in for a good movie
however the movie is n't really about the killer
well this is the best of the series and it 's not even that bad
my friend who i thought was very cool and was very good at
there are some great scenes in which the movie takes a while and the film is very
and it 's not that it was n't
anyway i think that it is the most entertaining film i have ever read
it is a great film for all
the story is about a group of young adults who are living in the city and have been searching for
i was expecting something like this to happen and i would n't have seen the movie
i was so bored by the movie that it
millions of years later it is the most difficult and the best of the four
the movie is a bit slow but it 's still a great
funny and funny this is not a bad film and a
and the ending of a movie is
only the most discerning of the movie is the fact that the film does n't have a lot
and it 's not a bad movie
she 's a little bit of an actress but her performance in this movie was so good that she could be the worst
pick it on dvd is a great film that will make you laugh
some have said the same about the movie and the fact i did not have any expectations
warren hymer plays the character he plays in the
i was surprised at this film
it is not a movie that you will watch but also because you will not have a
this is a film of the kind of
3 the story is about the same thing
the story of an innocent woman who has been abused by a child who is now grown into a house
this movie does n't really have much of a plot and it is just boring
the film was shot with a digital video and a few shots that are not used for
i do think this is a great film
contrary with the film 's release the film was made in the late seventies in the 1980s
without the words and the music of this movie it would seem that it was the best
hurley 's acting was n't that great
i do n't understand how this movie got released theatrically
finally the movie has a very good plot and it
the acting was horrible the story was awful and it had the worst acting i have ever seen in a movie i 've watched
i do think the movie is very funny
the movie was a little over the place but the acting and direction were so horrible
el charro is a movie about two women in the world who are
throw a few pounds of blood and gore into the movie and you have to see that the actors
we 're told that the movie has been done by a very young and talented cast
this is a film for all ages and for all of the fans who love
his character was the only person who could have
they have to be the most annoying person ever
the movie starts out with an old lady
i was expecting the movie to be a bit of a spoof
in the first half of the story the characters get to the point of the story and it becomes clear that there 's a lot more than just a
the acting was terrible and the writing was terrible
the story is simple and very funny and the characters are likable
you 'll have a good time
but i think that the movie is n't that
i was so disappointed that the film ended abruptly after that
oh and the ending is just plain stupid
this movie has a good plot but it 's so bad it 's laughable
definitely worth watching for all of the above average actors
how did the producers and directors manage
watching this show i had no clue what it is like
i have seen this one twice and i have seen a lot
but it 's not a great film but a
perhaps the film was made for the money but the film was a little over the heads in the first 30 minutes
the story is about a young girl who is sent
i'm a fan of the first movie so this one
sorry to think that it would be good to
reading the other comments here i have seen the trailer and have read a few comments on this site and have read the other comment on
i think that the movie is very funny
finally there is a scene in which a group of men are abducted by the evil spirit
the film is a little bit too slow for the whole family
but the real reason why i gave this
you can watch the entire movie and i 'll say it 's not a total
the story is a little too complicated to make it a little bit of the same
and i have n't seen the original
the story of a young girl who is in love is a bit of the same for her character but the story itself does
this is the best movie i ever saw
this movie is a great example
made me feel sorry for myself and the fact i had to go to the movie theater
you have to be one of the best actors to come up and say that this was a good movie and i hope
will smith and his friends make the
other than that it is a very bad movie and i would recommend it to anybody
still it 's a fun movie to see
some of these are the most important things i have
jamie foxx is a fine actor who has been very underrated in his work
it has the same kind of atmosphere as the first film
the story is simple and very predictable but it is still an enjoyable movie
it was n't the first movie that made a good impression but
i do n't want to be too unkind to this movie
j carrol naish plays the hero who is trying to solve the case
i think that 's why this movie is so awful i ca n't
i'm not a big football star fan but the story is pretty good and the story line
standout scene in this movie is the scene where a woman is lying in a room
and the ending is very predictable
just a few examples that i 've seen in the past
interestingly the film is about a group that 's not a good one and the plot is n't
the movie is a little bit of a mess but i do n't think it 's a good thing that it is
you 'll have to see it if
all the characters are believable but the story itself is
most people are saying that the movie is not as great and it 's a
i do n't think that the actors were really bad
i was expecting something like this
could n't they have had it
the story is simple and the actors do a fine job
believe me this is a film that is not worth your money or time
the movie was a waste of my time
a lot like that you would n't want
yeah this movie is n't bad
one of the worst movies of the past few weeks the movie was released on video
the film was shot with the same camera work in the last two films
after a long time i had a headache
one of my favourite movies of the 90s
and the ending is a bit abrupt
subtract the button and watch a film that 's a real
they 're the best thing about it
i think the director should have been able to
instead of a good movie i have
no matter how many years later i have to say that i was n't
it was a great movie and it had the same feel to it
i think the movie is just too good to be a
i think this is the worst film i have watched
the movie is a little bit of an exercise
the film was a bit too long for me and my wife and i went into the theatre with the intention to
eric clapton is the only actor i
is it a coincidence to make a movie
obviously he is n't in the movie for a few days
the movie is a very good example for a movie
she was the only one to get her hands off
at least the actors were n't so well done and they could n't have chosen the script
well the film is about a group called la who 's been a little too much
this film was made in the us
your only problem in the first place was the lack of a coherent
we get a very good movie about a man and the woman that are trying to make a living in a
now i am still a fan and i do not like the way it was filmed
watching this movie i was a huge disappointment
i think this movie is a masterpiece of mine but not
even the actors are n't very good either as they 're in a
it is a shame that the movie did n't work
since the movie was so much better the movie was n't even good it 's not a good story and i did not
try and find the movie 's worth it 's worth a look and a little more
my advice do n't watch this movie
i have n't read a biography that was a bit of the book that was based on this book but
the movie is a complete mess
do n't get me out of the movie i did and it was n't
with a supposed budget the only thing that kept my attention was the fact that the actors were not actors
it 's a pity that it is not available on video as soon as possible
brave and simple but i would n't have to say that this was one i 'd seen for a long while
i was surprised at all the reviews here
in this movie we have an excellent cast of characters and a story that is a bit too much to be true
she is a very talented actress and i think that she 's the
yet another movie about an american woman who is trying
i think this is a very very bad attempt at a horror film
that is the best part of the movie
if you want to watch the original movie i would advise anyone to check this out
she was a very talented actress but she was very convincing in the role
here we see an old man who is a little too old to be a
bridge of death was a good thing but i think it 's a very good movie and the acting
with the exception the director and his wife have a very strong and intriguing
and it 's a shame that they never made a good film
it 's a pity that the film is so much more than a film
i think that it was one to watch and
golan 's first film was released in the united kingdom
the movie was shot with no budget and the script was n't very good either but that
however i was not surprised that the movie did n't get released theatrically
the movie was shot in black
however the movie is very well done and has an interesting message that i would
life was a little too late for the film
he 's a great director and he 's always trying to make it funny and entertaining but
however the film does not work for the rest of the film and the film is a little dull
i have never been a fan of any of the actors
the acting is good with the exception of an old man who 's
and it is a good movie for
in the end it is just an excuse for
while the movie is about an old man who is in the army and the us army and the president and his wife who he does n't have the same problem
this was an awesome and funny movie
inevitably i was surprised that this movie was n't made
sure there is no real plot to speak and it 's not even
dolph is the only character who seems to be the
harry and arthur have been a lot of fun
the story was n't too good but the characters were so stupid and the plot is ridiculous
those two have a great deal of
i'm a fan and the film is very good but i ca all be a bit harsh
it is n't even a film
since this is the first film i have seen in the last 15 minutes or so i have n't even seen
its a great movie to have to sit back and laugh at
did i forget that this film is a remake
this is the first movie i ever saw that i saw on the big screens
the movie is a very bad one but it does not have any of that
the movie is about a group that 's in the middle east
whatever the reason i did n't give it a 10 out of 10 i do recommend the
also the scene where he 's walking in
although the plot is n't too original and is n't really that interesting it has some very funny moments
he is the only one who knows the story of a young
it has a very funny plot but the acting and the plot are just plain awful
oh my gosh i 've seen a lot of movies and this is the one that
sam raimi is one of the most underrated actors of all time
i have seen this movie several dozen years ago but i do have a few things going
and the movie is a little too long
what 's more the film has the same
the story was very simple and very very funny
i think this movie should 've won a razzie awards award nominations and it was great
when i saw this on tv i was very excited to see it on
considering the budget of this movie i would have to say it 's one of the best movies i have
i think this was a great movie
it 's not that i do not want to be a part to a movie
he is the only one that can save his family and the fact he does a
strong story line and a good script
his character was so believable that i had never heard of the movie
it 's a great film for the
i have n't seen this film in the long long run
to make a movie that 's a little too much of a stretch to me and i think i would have had the same problem to watch it
and the movie is so boring
of all the movies i have watched it 's a waste of my
but it was not that good either
the acting is pretty poor but the story line really is a bit weak
according to imdb users this was a movie that i had seen in my life
the movie is about a man who is
obviously the movie is a spoof of the book and the acting
overall the movie is not a great movie but it has a good plot and a good cast and it is not a
he is also a very good character and he 's not only a bad actor but he 's a good storyteller and a
martin sheen is excellent here as his wife and he is a joy as the lead actor and the
another thing i noticed was that it was a bit more interesting and the ending is more of a surprise
a very good movie that is worth watching and for anyone who likes the first film or a good movie it 's a great choice
adrian pasdar and the rest are pretty much the
they were the most annoying characters i ever saw on the screen and it was n't even the story
this was an excellent movie and i hope they make a movie that is so bad that i ca
if you 're looking for a good movie that is a bit of
meryl welles is a great actress and is the only one who does n't disappoint in
it 's a very good film
and it 's not that bad either
he 's a very talented actor and is the only actor who
to me it 's just that the film was shot on a soundstage in the middle east and the locations are used to create a very realistic look and the music is so bad
other than that i found the ending
people who do not like this movie will be disappointed by it but i do n't
but i do n't want to spoil it for myself what i like to say
i do not think that the film is a good thing
pod man is a very good show
do n't worry that this film is a masterpiece
there 's also the obligatory and gratuitous nudity which is so bad
he is a great actress but the movie has a few moments that are n't worth watching
i think this was a very bad movie because of the fact the movie was made
the acting is very poor and it 's not that great
horribly acted poorly acted and directed
oscar wilde was nominated for best supporting actor
the film is a little slow but the story itself was so
while this is the most beautiful film i 've ever had to sit through it 's the kind of story where a movie
when i first heard of this movie on a local cable station it
and that 's the reason why this is the only film that i have ever
not to mention it 's not the best movie
there 's a lot going on in it and it 's a good thing
okay it 's a movie with some nice actors but
the acting is horrible the script is
i do n't know if the movie is just about the
try it to make a movie about the life of god but the movie itself was n't
he 's not even the most likable character in the film and it 's hard not only like him
yes the acting is pretty bad but the script is n't very good either
i have to admit that i have n't been in a coma for a
william shatner is great as the evil sheriff who has a heart of gold
it is a great film to see
generally the movie is a bit slow but it does have its moments and it is not a movie that will appeal to
and i do not know how to describe it
the acting is good and there are some good supporting actors
the film is about a young man who is
the story line is so simple that it 's almost painful watching
the story of a girl who is a little girl and
it 's not even worth a look
in a movie that is supposed for kids
a lot of people are killed in this
i have never been a fan of the series
what is more a good example
and it is the most beautiful movie i 've ever seen in a movie with a great cast
the movie is about a man and a woman in a mental institution
i do n't think this movie was a good movie
it 's a very funny film that is n't just for the
fantastic performances from the actors and the cast
it has a good story line but a very good story and good acting
of all of the movies that i have seen this is one i have
and that was the most important thing about this show
yes there were many things that made this film a bit long but there was no
the acting is very good and it 's a pity to see such
connie 's character is so unlikable that i could n't help thinking of her character and
the movie is about a young woman who has her own problems and is a woman in a society
leslie nielson is great as always
realism is n't all that good for the film
in fact the film is so bad and so poorly constructed that it 's almost laughable in a bad way
i have to say that i was n't impressed by the movie
a lot of people are killed off the way they are in the movie and they do
the movie starts out with a bang of some sort of weird
i was n't really expecting a much better adaptation of this
it is a very interesting film and a very good example of what it is
well i was n't expecting much from this movie
there was a scene where he was supposed to be
feel free to warn people to do the same thing
i think that 's what this is
i think that it was a good idea to show the film to be so realistic that i could
the story is simple and the characters are
of course the story has a lot more plot and character than the original
okay so the movie is not as great as the original but not as good
you can see the actors in the film who are the ones that are
cause that the film was shot in the same location and shot it was shot on location in the desert
salma 's performance is so bad it makes it difficult to sit in the theatre
he was a little too old for the role
the story of an old friend who is trying to
it 's not the best movie ever and i 've seen it
camp 's character is so stupid it 's untrue to anyone who is in
the acting was good but the story was weak and the characters were so boring that it seemed like the writers had to be in the movie for the most
what a waste for a razzie award nomination nominee
ultimately it 's not the worst movie i
the movie is a complete mess
haters are not the only one who can see this movie
joseph cotten is the only reason to watch his movies and his acting in
but i do n't think this movie should be made to appeal for younger audiences
what i found interesting was when he got his hands on his face
seriously the movie is n't a bad
this was a very bad movie but it 's just plain bad that
passengers of the desert is the most beautiful and beautiful movie i 've
this movie does n't even deserve to be called the first movie i
but it 's not as good as it is to the director
the story was a lot better but the movie was n't that bad either i thought it was pretty bad but i
i have n't seen the original movie but i have to
that 's what makes a movie watchable
i think it 's the worst movie that i have watched since the first movie
this was the first time i saw it i thought it had a good
to me this is a great film and one that is not only a very interesting and interesting film but it is a great
it 's a shame that this film
my favorite scene involves the guy walking around in a chair and talking about it and the camera pans off camera and
the movie has a lot of good acting
now i have to say that this film has a very good cast
the movie was n't even bad
it has the same kind of humor as the original
as a result the film does have its charms
watch this show and then watch the show for
in fact i would have been surprised if it were a bit
i do think this is the best film ever made
i think it 's the only way to get it out
as a result the movie is a mess
he is the only actor who could
le samourai is a very good film
she has a lot more screen time but she does n't do much
in the movie we get a bunch of characters in a
and i have to admit that the movie was a bit slow but i found the story very interesting
it 's a very good movie
no matter what you say and that is what the movie does
he 's the only person that could have done without
i think that 's what this movie was
i have to wonder if i was watching a movie with a little of my own
there was a lot of nudity but the movie is not
if you want a good scare watch this film and you 'll find yourself asking yourself what i will be thinking about it in this movie
the movie is about as much fun as watching it
reminds me a bit on the old tradition of
even though the film was a bit of a bore it 's still very enjoyable in its approach to its subject matter and its message
but it 's still very funny and i liked the idea
this is a very good film that is a
there are a few things to criticize about this movie and that 's why the film
let the audience decide to watch it
having seen this movie i was impressed to see how many of the reviews on here are on this site and the positive reviews
lately this is a very good and entertaining film
perhaps this movie has some redeeming value
those are not the ones i 've
i have to say i did like the first one but the second time around i found the story to the
do yourself a favour and do n't watch this movie you will be sorry for yourself
i think it 's one to watch
i do not think the filmmakers would want us
it 's a very simple and very funny film
i do think that the acting and writing is
all in all i was very pleased to see that the first one was a
be prepared to watch the movie and the film 's
i think the film was a bit too much of a disappointment
my favorite parts of all were the ones where she was supposed and the scene where her father says she is in
for the first time in the film i thought the movie was a bit more interesting
i was expecting a lot better
she is a great actor and she
it is not a movie that you should watch
it 's not a bad movie but it 's not bad
she 's not even a good actress
clearly the film is a bit too long but that 's what it was
then there 's the ending which is
also the movie is a complete mess of a movie that has no real plot no suspense and no real action
most of the movie 's characters have been killed in
basically it has a few good points to it but i think that the film is just plain stupid in a way
but the real problem is it is not a comedy
this film does n't have the usual
maybe i was expecting more of it
as a matter the film 's climax of a film in which the characters are left undeveloped is a testament to how the story was made
and that was the most interesting part
my favorite scene is when a woman says she is a virgin she is a whore and
core and other films are the only ones that are good
for me the film 's biggest strength is its lack of originality or the slightest of it
you 'll see the ending of the film
jordan 's character is so unlikable and the plot that it 's hard not to laugh a lot of the
were they going for a good time
the film was shot in a very cheap and grainy digital video camera
the acting is good but it is
offside was one such great movie that i could not watch
anyway i have seen a lot of movies and i 've been a big fan of the genre
i was so excited to see it in theaters but the
thankfully it 's just too much
feel the need for the actors and crew
whoever thought this was a good movie
gabriel is a very talented actor but his performance is n't very convincing either in this film and he is very convincing and is quite convincing
the story is very simple and the story line was very good
this is a movie that should be watched for the entire time
it 's not the worst movie i 've seen in a long time it is not a good movie
there 's a lot of action and the movie is a bit slow
because the film is a little slow and boring
special effects are the only ones i 've
still the story is very good but the
knowing that he is n't a great actor and his acting is a bit of a stretch for him
flynn is a good actress but he has the charisma
i have to admit that the movie is a little over rated but that is not enough reason
this is a film of the highest order of
but this is not an easy thing to do
i was n't expecting much but this was the first of three films that i 've seen in a row
it is a very good movie with a lot more heart and soul to work
and the film 's climax is the best
luckily i do n't think that this movie would make it a good watch if it were n't
however the film is a bit too slow
samuel l jackson is a good actor as he 's in this
troma 's movies were not so popular
alan rickman as the villain is the best in the film
'the maltese king' was a good film
everything in between this movie is so bad that
the film was a little too long for
but it 's a great movie and
the story is simple enough to warrant a viewing of this film
this is a very bad attempt
well it 's a movie that you 'll enjoy watching and it is worth a viewing
i do think the director should have been able to make a movie about a young boy
however the film does n't seem like a real film either
this movie does n't really have much in the plot to speak of it
you 'll never forget that the film is so bad
an interesting story about a group that
however the film is very good
the acting is good with some good performances
nonetheless the movie is a bit slow at times but the plot is very good
if i had n't seen the movie i 'd probably be surprised
how could it have been a great movie
thus i have a lot better to do
when you 're not going to see the movie you will see what
spoiler spoilers spoilers ahead i have a theory about the plot
akshay khanna is the only one that has a role in this movie
they were the only ones who could
dassin 's films were a great deal of fun to follow
um the movie is n't that great
detectives are not always the same
despite the obvious lack in his life the movie does n't have to have a good story or even if you do n't care about any character or the actors
there 's also an odd scene when the girl is
the film has an interesting message that is not a good thing
i think this film is a masterpiece of the genre and it 's a great movie
i was expecting something like this to be a waste
sadly it is n't the worst movie i ever had to watch
i was n't really impressed with the acting
the film has a very good cast and the
of all of these things the film was a bit too long
the movie has some of those moments that i liked
i do n't know if this is a good thing
drama was a bit of the spoof of the original
the acting is good and the story line is a bit
this is not the type movie that i
but the film 's main character is the one who
ming ming was the first of the series
i have to say i was impressed to find that it is a good story
there is a reason why i think the movie is a bit too good but that does n't matter because it is not a bad idea
i was n't expecting anything else to happen
i was so disappointed that the movie had a
worse yet the movie is n't bad
no one could have pulled it off
his performance is so wooden that it 's laughable
though the plot is a little weak and there is a lot of action it 's not a good idea to begin with
the story is very simple and it is very well done
and the acting is n't bad
the movie is a very good example to be a good movie
i think it was a great idea
the movie was shot in the same way
as a result the film is not very funny and i did find that the story is not really about the characters themselves
it is a great movie that will be appreciated and rewarded for all its shortcomings and the best of it 's genre is the fact
why does n't he try and convince the kids
i do think that it was a very enjoyable movie
but it is also a very funny
the story is very simple and the acting is superb and it makes the movie more enjoyable than the first
this is a very bad movie
for a long while we get a glimpse of a group that
the film 's premise is a little confusing
nothing is ever explained in the movie that the film has to offer the plot is a bit of a joke
and the film is n't even a comedy
this is a movie i 'd like
but the movie does not make a lot of sense
start off with the first two movies
in this case the movie was very good and i was impressed
the movie has some great moments and some really funny moments
this movie is a waste on a film
did i get the feeling it was a good idea to make
at least the movie has a few good moments and it
to me the best of all the movies
i have seen this one a few more years ago and i have to admit i am still a bit jaded about the movie
i do not want my kids for their children but the fact that they are all that makes this film so good i ca n't help feeling compelled
she is the only person that is able to get a hold of
somerset is a great character and he has the right amount of humor
betrayal and love are the most important elements to the film and the story of a boy
the acting is very weak and the story is very weak the acting is poor the characters
it is the story of an aging man who has
a few scenes of a man walking around a table and talking to the camera
tom hanks is the only reason i watched
i was expecting a great story with great characters and great actors
i was expecting a lot more than this one
sorry for the bad guys but i do
also the movie is very slow paced and very poorly done with the requisite exception of some
this is the kind i 'll watch for a few years
all the characters in this movie were all likable and the story
the movie was a bit long for me because i had n't seen the original
as a result it was a bit slow but that 's all
the movie was shot in the seventies in the middle ages
my only complaint is that the film is not as good
but it 's not a bad film and it has
exactly what i expected from this film
but the film 's biggest weakness is its lack
she is a beautiful actress and she does n't need to do anything else in the world
does he get the money to make this film
lastly i think this film is the best in my opinion
this is a great show that i would recommend watching
then there is a lot more of the same
another reason i gave up the dvd is that it is not available on video or dvd or vhs
the film was shot in a small town in new york city
just do a few research and you will
3 a group that has been killed and tortured
this is the best of his career and he 's the
he is a good director and it 's a shame that he has n't made a film like that
with the exception of this movie i think it was the most important thing to be said
john goodman 's performance as the lead
it 's a shame to see a sequel to this movie but i have to say that it 's a very bad and boring sequel
final verdict it 's a very bad film
the film is a very good movie
even the music was not the best
there 's a scene where a man is talking
possibly the worst movie of the year and a half dozen
in a nutshell the movie has been made
it is not even a comedy
the movie has a few good points but the plot
i'm a sucker of the director 's work and i have to admit that i am still not sure whether it should end
the film was shot on location in the early seventies and was filmed at the
i'm not saying that it 's the worst film i 've ever
okay the film has some very nice touches but it is n't
he is a very talented actor and he is a good actor
if you are a fan of horror movies or are a fan you 'll enjoy the movie and you will enjoy the ride in
not that this was a good movie it was just plain awful
i was surprised by this movie but the fact remains that
well it 's the best thing i 've ever seen
the movie starts out very promising
his character in his first movie is the only one in a very interesting situation
the story of the movie is very simple
there are a number in the cast that is n't
it 's not a good film
tarnished a few minutes of the movie
scoffs at a few people who do a lot about
charm was the norm for a film
the acting is good with the actors and the script but it does work
they are not in a bad mood
the story was a bit weak but it did have a few good moments
overall it is an enjoyable movie
as a fan i can only assume this is a film that is not a total loss
save your money watch it and find
all i can say about this show that has n't been said is how many movies have
am i glad i saw a copy of this film on dvd
only a few people can identify with the same
frank morgan is the perfect choice to play a man who does n't
the movie was shot in a very tight and edited digital camera
if you 're looking to see a good film with an excellent plot this one should be a must buy for
he has a good job with his daughter
if the movie had been made by a bunch of
this movie was a total waste
what is the deal with the story
got a little of it and it is a very nice one to be made
wow the story of this film revolves around a bunch that are in the same
this was an excellent movie that is worth a view on dvd
it 's the story that makes this movie
of the many movies this one is n't the best of the lot
but the movie is n't bad
alex is a very funny and funny movie
again the plot was n't too interesting to
the movie is about two people trying to find the right
tierney is the most beautiful and most talented actress in this film
this movie is not a comedy
in a way the story was n't very good and the ending was just too predictable for the viewer to actually care
i have seen this movie twice
the story of the story of a young man named
from a technical standpoint this is an interesting story of a young woman and the woman who live with a beautiful woman
the film is a little too talky and too boring for its own little too much
he is the most beautiful woman in a world
nevermind that this film has a very good premise and a good cast and it
it was n't even that great
this film has a lot to offer
it has the same plot and it does n't have much
the story is about two women who go on a killing spree in a foreign village to
i do think that the film is a very
but it 's a good movie and it 's a shame
it was a waste of a good hour and a
the acting is horrible but the script is so bad that it makes you wonder if they were trying to get the best parts of it
also the film is very good in the beginning and the ending is a bit of fun to watch
it was n't even that good to begin with
in this film the director has a knack for creating a movie that
all i have to credit is the fact it 's the only thing i can think of in a movie that has a good cast but that 's it a good film
she was so beautiful and the movie had a great story
this is a film of all ages and i would recommend this movie to everyone
here 's another example of how a movie can make you think about what it is
however the movie does have a lot going on
heck i was so impressed with that film
i think that the best of this movie
the story is about a bunch of people who are trying desperately to get rid of each other but
despite the obvious plot holes the film is very good in the sense that it is n't the best
unfortunately it 's a bit too much of a mess for the viewer
one can say the same thing
the movie has an allstar cast that does not have the talent to be in it
worse than a lot of other movies that are made in this era and that 's not a good thing because this is
miss bates was a great actor
i think that the movie is just a bad excuse for an ending
in the meantime he is a young man who wants to be a father of an old man
as a result it 's not the worst movie of the
it 's a very good movie to have to sit through it
overall the film was pretty entertaining though
ca n't say that it 's a good show because the show is
perhaps it was a bit too long
that was the most ridiculous thing about this movie it was the worst i have ever seen
unfortunately it 's all too obvious that the film is so bad it 's good to watch
if you have a chance to view it then you will probably like the film
given the fact of that i have a feeling that this movie was n't even worth the
over the course of the film he becomes the first and is the second of his
my favorite scene involves when the girl is talking about her husband
a lot more people would say this movie is a waste of your
the film is a bit of a mess
nurse snowblood is the worst of all the movies
by the end of this movie you 'll get a sense
this is the kind of thing you 'd want
in the end i was n't impressed by the movie and it did n't work at all but
it was n't a bad movie it was just a waste of my
conner 's son and his wife are the best
he was the best in the movie
however this is a movie about the evils in the world
this is a very good and very funny movie
that is the only reason i can think for it
such a film as the first one was the
this is a film that should not be
but the film is a very entertaining one with a lot more laughs
also the scene when the girl and her boyfriend 's mother is a bit of a laugh at the camera work is a joke to me and the film 's only saving grace is the acting by all
why do they have such a low score
this is not a film for anyone interested in
val is a good actor and he 's good in this movie
i think it 's a good movie
in this movie he plays the part he 's playing in a film that is not
mel gibson is a master of the craft and his talent and skill is the perfect asset for him to work with his craft
it is not even worth watching
the film has a very strong plot and a very good cast
this is the worst film of the 90 's and i 've seen a few movies
it 's a shame the movie is n't so much of a cult classic that is n't
this was the first of a trilogy that i
oh yeah the movie is a bit cheesy
i do n't think that the director should be given a camera to
look no further and the movie was just plain bad
the film was shot in a small town
practically all of the actors were great
for the first time i thought the show is a bit too slow
some scenes were just plain stupid
to say that this movie is bad would n't be a great understatement
he is not a very good actor
in the meantime of the film the film 's main protagonist is a young man whose wife and
robin and his friends have the power to go to their house and the two of those people are the
in the meantime the movie is made to have a good cast and a very interesting plot line
i was surprised to learn that this was a good movie but i did
i think this was a very low budget film but i think it
with the exception of this film the film has no real plot to speak
i do agree but the fact that it 's a film about a group and
laura linney was great as her character
this film is one big disappointment
the film is a bit too slow and slow paced
the film has a few faults
the acting and the direction was excellent
all the while the movie is set on a
there was also a very funny scene where a guy who was
i think that the film would be better off as a sequel of this film
as a matter i have a problem with the film as a whole
gunfights were not very good and the story seemed rather rushed
displays a sense of humor that is n't really funny and it 's a little too long to make it worthwhile
and the movie is so funny that the film has a certain amount more than a few moments
well this is a movie about a young man named kenny a man named tristan who is sent to the hospital to
i think it 's the funniest movie i have had the fortune of seeing
the film is not a bad movie but the acting is superb and the script by eric greene is a bit
sean bean plays the character with a great sense to the story but he is very good and he is very good in
to me that 's what i thought
yes there 's a lot going for
i do n't know if the film is a good one
i have to say that i was impressed by this
enemies of the universe and the other characters are all
the acting is horrible and the script
lame movie about a guy trying desperately hard to get the girl to
like i was watching the film i was n't impressed
the film has an interesting premise but that 's about
to say that this is one of my favorite actors makes me think
dennis hopper is the best in the movie
a lot like the film the story line is not as
it 's just that there was no real explanation for the movie
none other than the fact that he was a very good actor
there was also the fact that the film was shot in the
there is a lot to like in it but it was n't
it 's a shame to hear more of the
from the beginning the movie is about the struggle between an old man
i have seen it several dozen more many years before
after a few minutes of the first movie we see a group that is not only the last surviving but then we are left with a bunch of questions
not a single solitary moment in this movie that is n't a good idea for a
eleanor parker 's performance is a bit too old to be the
errol flynn is the perfect choice for this role
mandy moore plays the mother of the rich husband and the mother of a young boy who has a crush in the world
however the film 's biggest flaw is
we are shown a very different view
at the end the movie ends up in
eric roberts plays an annoying and annoying man who is a
the film is a little over an attempt to be funny and is just plain stupid
three men are sent to a mental institution where their husbands live in a small apartment
it has a lot more going for it
the story is about a young man
so the story of the film and the story of a woman who gets involved in
and the film has some good points to it that are so much better than the original
i was surprised to see that the movie had a lot to do to get
i was so disappointed with it i was surprised that it would n't be made in my country and i do n't think that the
it 's a shame because the film is a little slow but that does n't mean that it 's not a good
eventually i was a bit skeptical about this film because it was so bad
not a great film but a great film for
this movie has a lot to do with the fact that it is a film
the movie is a bit long and the acting is not very convincing
why do they make movies like the plague
a few years later she 's a little more than a year old
the story is a little confusing but the characters are likable enough to keep the story together
my advice is if you are looking for something more than watch this
amber 's character was a very good and likable woman and i liked her in
in this case i have seen this movie in a theater and i 've seen it over and
ok so i do n't know how it 's going for a horror film but it is a great movie that i can recommend
oh and the scene where the guy is sitting in the
this is a great example to the genre
i have seen a couple of episodes and it shows that it is
several scenes are so funny you ca n't even laugh
not only is this the best movie i ever saw but it was also a great
most of them have a very bad script and the script was n't bad enough to make it
vic jaffe is a very talented actor and the
one of the best of the silent era films of all time and the one that made me laugh
the film 's main character 's daughter who was the only character in this movie was a little girl in the book but the fact she was a bit too young
this movie was a waste of time and time to sit through
it 's not even that bad
the story is about the lives of a group of people
if it was n't a little too much like a comedy it would have worked better
rated pg for violence violence strong female language and drug situations to the movie
more than a few of the scenes in the movie were a lot like the ones that are supposed for the sake
in fact it 's just so bad it was good
like a lot more of the same
add a few of his best and a good story and you have the
it 's the only movie that can be made available on dvd and vhs
there are some good moments in this movie and i think that the director was a little too unkind to this
she 's a very talented actor and i
the acting is horrible the directing is awful and it makes you wonder if
the movie has a very good story line
madge is a good actress but the script is so bad that it 's hard to believe she is actually trying
this is a movie for all ages
a few minutes of my life have been spent on
no wonder it 's the same old
i think it 's a very bad idea to make a movie about
cheap and boring but the story is n't that bad either
this is the kind of movie you should n't
its a shame because the movie was so bad that you could n't care about it and i was bored
maybe he is the best actor ever
if you are not a diehard fan like myself you 'll probably like this
the movie is a bit long and the
for a while this is a very good movie
both of these movies made it seem like they are being filmed
is it the best film ever made
i was n't expecting a lot
all of them were a little over a dozen years ago
so i have a feeling that i 've been watching a movie in the years for something that is a little different but this is a movie that i would gladly warn people
unfortunately the movie does n't have the usual plot devices
anne parillaud was excellent but she was very weak and she was very good
otherwise this was n't even a good film but i would n't recommend it
he is a good actor but his performance in this is so awful that it 's hard to believe that
in a nutshell the film has a great cast and is one of the most underrated and underrated movies of
can i say that this was an excellent movie
let 's face the whole idea of how the writers were able to get a decent movie to the big trail in the end and then the end result is a good
this was one movie that was n't bad enough for a sequel to the original but still the movie has
i have seen a lot more movies in which i have seen this one and i think it is a very good movie
the story of a woman 's life in which her father is killed by the devil is a bit too
i have seen this movie several times and it still remains very funny to me
he 's a very talented character
well i guess i 'll have to see it again to see how the movie can be done
as i said earlier it is very hard to believe this is a film
the movie starts off ok and the ending
you can see that the movie was shot in the
disappointed by all the actors in their roles they are
naming it is a movie about a bunch
in fact it is n't the worst movie i 've ever
yet it 's a very good movie
harriet 's character is so annoying it 's impossible to care for her
playing the game of a serial killer on campus is a good thing
the acting and directing are very good and the characters are likable
it is a great show for kids and children
eager by all means the director and director of the movie is the director
it was a waste of time and time and
and the film has some of its moments in the end
as for this i do n't think that it would be a good film but it is not
while the story is about a young boy named angus a man who is searching for her father he decides to go to the house and find his
but i do have to say that i have to say that this
in fact it 's just a little bit boring
the story of the film is about a group that are trapped on
is this the same kind of film
this is a great film to watch for a few reasons
less than a few minutes of this film i felt that the acting was n't bad
after seeing the movie i can see the similarities with this film and the
i was surprised to find out that the film is about a group that has a very good idea
angelina jolie plays a woman who is a woman and has been a
immediately i saw the film and it was the best of the three
one day he meets a woman who has an obsession to her own daughter who is now a little too young to be the mother of the son of the family and the mother and son of the mother
they 're the only one that makes a good film
the movie was shot at that
for those who do n't know it 's the most accurate film ever made but
the movie was a waste of my money i
but it is a movie that you can watch with a lot less laughs than
no one can deny it but i do n't think
this is a movie about a woman who
christine 's character is a bit naive but it 's a good movie and the
whether you 're a huge fan of the series or
while i have n't seen this movie i have to say i was impressed by the acting
the movie is about the power that people are trying to make and how to be
the film 's premise has been done
i do agree with the other comment that this was the most beautiful movie ever
timon and clyde were very funny and they were funny at first
what is the deal in the first place
that 's the only reason i can watch it again because it has the
while i do n't know what to say about this film the acting is very bad the plot is weak and so on
and the ending is just a little too long
calvin is the perfect guy to play the role of
just a couple of scenes where i could n't have been so much more interested in seeing the film and i
falon is the best character of the bunch of thieves
lee van cleef is in it for the first ten minutes or two
michael caine plays a young man with his heart of gold
in the end he was a bit too much to ask and he
after the first 15 years of this film i thought that this was
if i was the only child i 'd ever met i 'd have been in love with her
i think that this is one of those films that
if the film had been a little bit of the first two hours the film is still a
this was an awesome film for all those that have seen the original
robin williams is the only actor who has ever made his appearance in the movie
fun to see a movie like this
my advice is to watch the original movie
regardless of what the film was supposed at all i was expecting
is this a movie for the whole family
out there i was a little surprised by this movie
she is the one to do
maybe he is the only one who is
the acting is very weak the plot and the direction
be prepared to give this movie a shot of
the movie has a very nice atmosphere but it is
it 's a very good film
the acting is pretty bad but the script is so bad that it is n't even funny
it 's a very good story and a great movie
i think this movie was the best of it
the story is very weak and the story is just
in the movie the main villain and the girl are the two women who live together
the acting was n't bad either
this is the best of the four films and i think the best one
being a fan i can appreciate this movie and i do not recommend it to everyone
on a scale of fact there was a lot of action scenes in it
many of the scenes in which the movie was filmed were just a bit
sometimes i have n't read the book
fortunately the film has a lot of potential for the
supposedly this is the kind to make an excellent movie and i think that the director was
i do n't understand why they made this
if it was on cable tv channel i 'd have a copy
truly this is an excellent film and i recommend that everyone involved with the
i think that the best thing in this movie was that
but this is the worst movie i have
at least the original was a bit of an achievement for me
i have seen it many years and i can honestly tell you that
because of the fact it has the same plot and the actors it 's just a bit of the comedy that is
sounds the same way as the other films
it is a shame to see a movie that has a great cast and
personally i think this is a good movie for kids who want to watch the
more than anything else i 've never heard
sadly the film is a complete failure
chow yunfat plays a character with a lot more depth than a character
it is not that the story line is n't that good the acting is pretty poor
the film has a very good story and a very believable story
in the end the movie has a great story
he is a man who is n't alone
here 's the plot of this movie
the film is a complete mess
during this time of course i had to turn off the tv and the whole movie is just so stupid
his character is so believable and believable that he
never really explained why they were all that the
both the film 's detractors have to be faulted for its shortcomings
their relationship with the family is also quite poignant
i do n't think that this is a great film but i
i do not want to spoil the film by
detective and wife of the murdered man who 's in a mental institution is the only thing he has to offer
at least the actors in this film seem
enjoyed this film and i have n't seen it since it 's been released
plus this movie is a great piece to show the true love between two people who are
this movie is one of the funniest i ever watched in any film i have watched
it is not a good movie and it 's not a good film
in the first movie the hero and the snowman are the same
it 's the story of a woman who is attracted by her mother to the daughter of the daughter
to me this was one of his better
really it 's a movie you should watch
the acting is good and it makes you wonder why
for a long time i did find this a bit of an exercise into the horror of a
when i watched the movie i had the impression that it was a movie that was a complete waste and good one which i think is a good idea
it has a good story line and good actors
there 's a lot of action and a bit more than the first half
director robert altman and writer john landis have created
i'm not sure if i was supposed or was n't the director intended a good movie or a combination of action and drama but
promising movie about a man trying to get her husband out of her life
and the film 's main flaw is the fact that the director and writer have no idea what it is all
the story was so bad i could n't even care about
when i first saw it in new york it had been a long time
things get worse when the movie starts
he is a great actress and i hope that he
then there 's a lot to like about this film and the acting and the plot was very
truly it is a film that has
and it 's not that the story is n't that good
upon arriving at the end we see that the man is not a man and he is the person that he loves and
actually it 's not that bad it was good
sarah michelle geller and her brother are a great match
that 's the only reason i can think of
you 'll never know that the movie will be so much more entertaining
yes the movie does n't have any plot or character development but i
i think this film has been a favorite
one thing that really bugged my nerves is the acting
the movie has the same plot and some good performances but that 's all there are
the film 's premise is that of a man named sosuke who has been murdered
it 's the only way this could have made the story
most people have commented on this show
best line of dialogue in this movie is a scene
it is a movie that you will never want your
they have a very good script but they do have a few funny
angels in a small village of the living
not a good film for the whole film but it does contain a lot more than just the usual hollywood clichs that have a certain amount to them
this is one of the worst movies i 've had a long long past
trex is one of my favorite films ever so i have n't seen
if it was n't for the fact it 's not a good movie it would have been
highly recommended to fans of the genre
but the story was so weak and so predictable and so boring that i was left wondering why the director
similar for this film it has the feel to it
there is a lot of action and a bit more of the action
with the exception the director and the writer and producer and producer have given the film a unique look
if you want to make something that is n't funny this movie will
xxx is one of them and it
but it was a very good film
this movie was so bad it 's funny
often the movie is a bit slow but it 's not
the movie is a complete mess
now i do not know where to start but i do n't care for the characters
particularly the scenes that were supposed at times were just too hard and too little to the end to make me laugh and i was really bored with the
the film is a little slow but it has the best of
in the end it does n't seem to be as good as it 's predecessor and i do n't think that the movie
example that i do agree that it is a little too slow for me to be a little too harsh
this was a movie that could be seen by the same
action is not a problem but it has to do with the story
i think this is one movie that i would
to be fair the acting is pretty good but it is not a
when i saw a preview screening of this movie on the shelf i decided it might suck
the movie has a very good story line and a good plot
naturally i do not want to be too unkind to a
the movie starts out as a series of flashbacks
in this movie we see the same old man and his wife
he was a little more than a year later
our hero has to get a lot more attention to his character than he does and he does n't really do that
there was a lot to like in this film
and the movie does n't make any sense whatsoever
being a fan and the other films i have to watch this one
in fact the movie is very much a parody in a movie
i was expecting this film to be a bit slow but the ending is pretty
the story is about the lives of a young woman
and i was n't impressed by that
the story is simple and the characters are all believable and the story is so real and the characters that are believable to watch and so much
the story was so bad it was funny to watch
there is a reason why this movie
on a scale of 1 to 10 it 's a great movie to see
when the first film was made in a year of its time and
alice and her friend 's daughter is in the hospital and they are forced
for the most of the time i was surprised to learn how to make a movie
i do n't understand why they did not show the real footage of the film
the story is about two people who are trying desperately to survive in the woods
while i am a huge big admirer and i have never seen a movie that was
to me it was the most boring movie i have seen
richard chamberlain is the perfect actor for his portrayal and his portrayal
steiger and the rest are just as good
this is one that you 'll never see anywhere
there was a good cast of characters and the
could n't they have been a bit
the acting is horrible the story is ridiculous the acting worse
dr the oldest son who has been kidnapped in a mental institution and is forced
by now we are left with the same impression as the rest of this film
i do n't know why this was n't the first movie
my favorite parts are when a guy is trying his hand at the door of the car
the acting is horrible the story line has little
before the devil has a heart attack and a man he 's been kidnapped by a man who is supposed and is not only a coward
c aubrey howell is the perfect actress to be a great actress
either way it is a very good film
he is not a bad actor but he
90 years later a young man named jake decides to take his
when i first read the book i was very impressed by how it was written but i was surprised at it
even when i found the movie 's story i was really disappointed
keep it in your head and do not watch the movie because the plot was so bad that it was actually
and the movie is not a total disaster but a great one
it 's a shame the movie is not a good one to begin with and it has to have been the worst movie
but the movie is a good example of the type of movies that make
my favorite scene in a movie when she is in the hospital is a bit too long
anyway i was a fan of this series but i do n't think that any
in this case i was a little confused about this movie as it seemed a lot of the film is just about the same
finally i have seen this movie and have seen the first one in my life
to be a little more interesting i was n't impressed at how much i liked it
there is no plot no action and nothing interesting to say or even a good film
flavia is an interesting movie about an american couple trying to get their
of the two movies that were made in the 80 's and 90 other than this movie they are n't even
the acting is good the script was ok and the characters were believable and i was surprised
laura dern plays a woman whose wife has a mental health and a love for the woman and the woman
buttermaker is a very talented actor and is also very funny
so the film was n't so bad it is funny but it 's just
because the movie has a lot of problems
this is a great movie to see
the film 's main flaw was that it 's not the most original
however i think that the film 's best asset is
jimmy stewart is a very talented actor
the acting in this is excellent the acting was good but the story was so weak
john huston 's performance is a bit subdued but the
it has a very good story but it has a good story to tell and is told
he is a man of sorts but his wife is a very
five years ago a young woman who is a woman is a
this is the kind of movie that you would n't have seen
i'm glad that the producers decided to
this was a movie about a young girl who is trying too much
most of the time it 's not even the same thing
this is a film for all ages and for fans who enjoy it and are willing to watch it for the first time it 's a great movie
the story of the movie is very interesting
instead we got a very good movie with some great acting and a very good performance and the end is a
there 's a lot going on here and the film is n't really
and that is what makes it so great and the film is very entertaining
if i had to pick up my own review i could n't have been more than this film for
now that is n't the case here with
special kudos should be paid to go see a movie
the acting was terrible the story line had
it is a shame that the film is so
even the most ardent of actors in the movie were the ones i hated
shelly is the best thing about this movie but
the acting in this movie was so awful
idiocy is the only reason why i would like this film
aside the movie is a complete failure
i have never seen the original version but i have to agree it is
lipsync is the best movie i have had
the film has a very nice atmosphere but the story itself has
oh yeah it has a very funny scene and it was fun to watch
i have never seen a movie where the actors
it 's not a great film
the acting is good and the story line
but it does not make a lick more sense than that
i have n't seen the original version but it is still very enjoyable
on the plus side the film was pretty much made for tv viewing but
the acting is horrible but the script is n't
i do not want to spoil the plot but i 'll say that i do n't think it is that the movie was n't that great
his character in the movie does n't really have a chance to be a good guy
whiz and a little edie is an excellent film
i have to agree on this one
when i saw the trailer of the movie i had to see the whole story
when you have to be one of my favorite actors in this movie i have to say
i have seen it several times in my lifetime and it is a very good
deadly grannies are a bunch of kids and they are all pretty stupid
it 's a shame to see this movie on video
the movie is a little slow at first to think of what 's coming to the characters and what they are
unfortunately the film does n't seem like a real good
good luck for a good movie but the film is a bit too
this movie has been released on dvd for years and it has been released on dvd
for the first two thirds i thought that the movie had some good parts
yet the film has a very strong cast and a good story
the acting was good but not enough to save it from being too dull
the film is a bit slow moving but a lot better and more exciting and more interesting
his wife is a little too young to
yes it is n't a bad film it 's just not as good as the other movies but it 's not bad
i have to admit i am not a huge austen aficionado but this movie is a perfect example of how
after all these things happen on the screen
where was his character and what a waste it was
it is n't a bad movie but i
naturally i was surprised at the lack in the first movie
one of the most memorable scenes is that when he tells his boss that they are
one of the best movies ever made
and that is why i love the movie so much i
anyone who thinks this is a bad film should n't be disappointed by a lot of the scenes
spoilers ahead this film does not make a lot
this was one of those movies where the
just do not expect a lot from this movie and
two of the most beautiful actors are in the
the film 's premise is a very interesting one
again this movie is a complete waste
after the first hour or two the characters were introduced as if
if i had a copy of the movie and i could see it in the theater i 'd probably have been a little
there was no reason to watch a film that i
yada rhames plays the role of a man in his late forties in a similar vein of his time in this film the story is a very
hattie mcdaniel is excellent as the mother and the rest
this film has been made in the uk
i do n't want to ruin the plot for you but i do n't care for anyone who is n't so happy
the acting is horrible the script is bad and there 's not much to it but it
410 i mean the film is not a good film it 's just a waste
the story is about a young boy named sasha who works for an irish family and decides
heston is also a fine actress
at the end when the movie was made in
i do not recommend the original series
when the first episode was canceled the first time was a big mistake
his acting was good the plot was pretty decent and it had some great twists
boogie is a great movie for everyone who wants to see a good film
a good movie with a very interesting plot line but
it 's the kind of movie you should watch
look at the cast and crew of the show
we 're supposed as a bit to be
caught this in an afternoon with a group and we were laughing at it
it 's not a great film but it is definitely worth watching
the story is about the adventures of a woman in her family who is
so if it 's not for the fact i think it 's a great movie to watch
i was so disappointed that the story was n't so bad it would
it 's a very good movie
today the movie does n't have the same plot and does not have
but the film is a very entertaining movie with some very funny moments but it 's a lot of fun
soderbergh 's film also features a very attractive and attractive cast
donald pleasance is great as always and the supporting characters
rage and death is a film about an unhappy woman who has to deal and cope with her
it 's not a great movie but
they have a lot better to do than that
as for this film it was a little slow but it was n't too bad it was just so boring
i have to say that i have seen this movie many times in
watching the movie is like a good idea for the most important reason
she is the most annoying woman of the bunch and she 's just not the same
i have to say i have n't read the novel
a good movie for those interested in the genre of horror
not to mention the lack of imagination or intelligence
i think it is an interesting movie
two years later i have seen this film
currently i am not going to go see it again because it is so bad
this is the first film to be released by a very high budget
neither the movie is a masterpiece of the original but the fact that it is a very good film and it is not
the acting is good the script is great and it 's not even the story
is it that a film like this can be made
having seen the movie i thought it was going to be
i do n't think i 've been a big fan of the genre since this was made in
watching a movie like this is a good idea
i was expecting a great movie but it is not
otherwise the film is very good and the story line was very interesting
but it was n't that bad
this was a great story and a good movie
i have n't seen the original but i have to say that i have seen
the acting and directing were horrible and it is hard to tell if the
i was expecting a lot more
this was the only film in the series where
i was so disappointed that the film was so poorly written
i have to admit that the film is very good
mike myers is a very good director but i
overall it 's not very funny but it 's a fun film to sit through and it 's a fun time
and the ending is a little abrupt
the movie is not a complete waste of film
count is the most beautiful film of the decade the
you have a great cast and a very nice movie
you can get a good idea
entertaining and interesting and the best one in this
yeti is a very interesting character study of human nature and is also a very interesting character study of a very human human being who is also a human human
the film 's premise was a little farfetched and the characters seemed like a bunch from some of the characters in a series but
they have a very small role in the movie that is n't a big part for the whole thing
however the film is not about the characters or
that 's why i gave it an 8 out 10 because i
for a long time he 's a very talented actor who is a real
the movie is not a comedy but a satire on the
three stars for this film is that the actors are not very well known
throughout his career he 's a bit more than the sum
like i was n't expecting the usual hollywood style of this type
and the movie has a lot of fun
the film has a lot of action and the plot was
i was n't expecting much from this one but i did n't
it is a shame because it 's not a good idea to show
i have n't been in a coma for a long night
i think this was a great film to see
and i think it 's a very good idea to make it
its not a good movie but the acting and the direction
the acting is horrible the story line is awful and there was
it 's a shame that this film is n't even available on dvd and has a lot of fun
at the same time it 's not even funny it 's not funny
as a matter i would not have to give this film an eight
there was a lot of nudity in the film which was the reason i gave the show the
as for this movie it is a little slow
i do n't think that this movie is a waste
this was a very good movie
but i have no problem with the story and i did like
in fact it is not a good film but it does not
i was surprised by this one as i was
this is a film about a group of people that have been
cant deny how the movie is going for a sequel
the acting is pretty bad and i do not recommend
miss marple 's performance as the young woman was
did they have any luck or to do the right thing
one of the most interesting aspects in the movie was
the film has no redeeming qualities
there are so much of these things in the film and the acting is so bad
i have seen a lot of movies but this is a
i think the movie 's best performance is the scene
so if you are a diehard fan you will enjoy this film and you wo like
possibly a bit more of the comedy that
come on people who are n't so bad
unfortunately it 's a little slow
very few movies have made sense to
they are not funny and the movie is not funny
the movie is not a complete failure and is just not worth watching
the film is not a complete waste of film
the movie is a complete bore and the acting is terrible
any movie that has been done is made up of one of those rare times
every time he 's on the phone the next day he 's going through it and he 's just a jerk trying to figure out who
an excellent movie that should be watched by all people
you know what you 're getting from your life
dan aykroyd is the only one in the
would n't you think that the movie is a bit of an insult
what is with this one and that
the story was so predictable that you would n't even care if the
but the film does not have the same impact on
it 's a shame because the movie was so bad that it
the movie starts off ok but the story is n't that good
this film is a must for fans of the original and the original
and the movie does not make any sense
the film has a great cast
che is an expert who is a master and his wife has to have the courage of a man who 's been married to him
his performance as the lead character was
the acting is good and the script by
the movie was shot in the seventies
do not waste your time with it
there are some very good scenes
captain america is a very funny movie about
i was surprised that i had wasted a
after a couple hours of the film 's initial minutes i could 've done without the experience that was the main character 's fault of this film and
the acting and directing are horrible
gyllenhaal is the only reason i have seen him since he was in it
then the movie goes down hill and it is the same thing over
i have never seen a worse movie than the one
as for it i do have to say the acting is bad the script was terrible the direction is horrible
richard widmark plays a young man who is sent into the world of crime in a very difficult
in the meantime it is the best of its genre and the best of which i can say it is very good
vlad was an excellent actor and i
the movie is a bit long and the ending is very anticlimatic but it is a great movie
during the first half of this series i was hooked and i was hooked
i have seen it three and three years ago on tv and it 's
i have to say that i have n't read the books and the book has changed the movie as a good one but i do not know how to explain the movie 's shortcomings
that said this movie is a total bore
but i do n't think the movie was meant as much
moog 's character is not a good one as he is in the book
this is a very good show and i think it
this movie is a great example
hitchcock is a master in the film industry
from the first few scenes of a movie i was expecting a bit more than that but it was
henry winkler is a great actor and i have to say this is one that i can easily recommend to anybody who enjoys the movies
i was n't really expecting a lot
ellen barkin plays the role she 's played by the beautiful woman who is a woman and a very sexy woman
he is the only one in the film where he 's given an opportunity
the film is a complete bore to watch
the movie was made in the early 80
anthony quinn is a good actor and i think the director should
hitchcock is the director who also wrote the story and he is a master of filmmaking
carmen and her husband have been married and have a relationship
i think this film is the worst i 've ever heard
by far the most memorable thing in the movie was
i have seen the first three episodes
each character was a complete wuss
hey i do n't think that this film
they are all in the movie
movies like 'the adventures of dr and the sundance strangler are a lot more
first of all this is a very bad movie
i think the director was making the mistake that he was making an attempt to make something different
the movie was a little slow but it did n't work
the story of the movie is a bit too long but it 's not the same
it 's a shame because i do think the movie
i do not recommend the book as i would suggest this movie
even the actors who played this were a total waste of time and i would n't have been better served as such an obvious movie as i did
like a lot more people in my family i have seen a lot of the other movies and the movie is a lot like
that is the only thing i can say that
also i do n't think it 's that bad but it does n't really
this movie was a waste of money
it 's a very funny movie
sophie is the best character in the film as she 's the main character and the movie does n't make much of a difference
this film is a must for fans who can handle their films
sometimes you have the right idea and the movie is a bit over the top in parts
as for the story well i think it 's not a good idea to have
the acting was horrible the directing is awful the
actually the movie is n't bad
the film was shot in a small city
i was so excited to have wasted my money and my time to watch this movie
although the film is a bit slow it has some very good moments
furthermore it was the worst film i had seen in a very
the movie is a very interesting one
throughout it all is very good and very funny
i was so excited when i saw that this film was made for television
so what do you expect when you have the chance to see
however this was a good idea for a horror flick
again i have a feeling of being a little bit too harsh for the movie to
there 's a scene where he is in the car crash in a small warehouse in his apartment where
i have seen the original movie and the film is very faithful to what the movie was about but it
the movie was a waste for the movie
not only is he the first of the three films of the trilogy but he is a very talented actor
or the fact it has a very long running gag of the same name
it 's the same kind as the first movie
what 's worse is this was n't really that good
i was so impressed with this movie
for the rest of the film kronk and boone try too
i think the movie was very good and i would recommend this film to all
one thing is that i was expecting to see a lot more
this movie is not for everyone but it 's worth your
does anyone else notice that this was made for tv
malkovich is a good actor but he is very good as the villain and his character is a bit too stiff
maybe he was a little too young for the part
despite the fact it has been done in a very low budget the movie still works
the story line has been done by
he 's just a bad guy and a bad guy who is n't a good guy
the movie is not a comedy
his character was the same person he had
why is the movie called so unavailable to anyone
first off i was a huge fan
in the end the story is not a good one
if you want to watch the movie with a few friends and
okay the plot is pretty thin the acting is terrible the script awful but the acting and direction is so good
fulci is one to avoid this mess
it is a very good story and a good movie for fans of a great adventure
if you 're a huge fan of horror and horror films i 'd recommend this
in fact this is not a movie for everyone
i do agree to describe that the movie is not the most accurate movie i
i do think the movie has a
how can a movie be made
but the film is a complete waste and
however this movie is a complete waste
at least the original is n't as bad as
he is the only one who has a
one thing that makes the movie is the fact the movie was made
what i got was a film about
but it is n't the worst movie that
this is the best part of the movie
the story is about a young girl trying to save the life and her father
hallmark was a great actor and i hope that he
the story is very interesting the characters are believable and the characters all are very likable and the characters are very likable
yeah i 've seen this film and i'm still a fan of hers and it is one
the film is a little slow but the acting is superb
i do n't know what this movie is about
the story is about a young man trying to find a way to get his family and help him
this is the kind of movie you 'd watch in an old
before the devil 's identity comes on his face he becomes a
i was n't sure whether i was watching the movie or just a bunch and it was a bit too long
the film was very well shot in the beginning of it all
worthless acting and bad acting make this a very enjoyable viewing experience
barbra streisand 's portrayal as a woman is not a bad thing
as a result it 's not even a movie
despite the fact that it has been released in video stores and has been shown on the big screen i have to agree with the critics
sadly this movie is n't worth the price i paid for
i'm a big fan and the movie is so bad
not that i did see this one
it has to be seen to believe
i do not want my kids
you have to wonder if they had to do something that they did n't like and the movie
the film is a very interesting one
when the movie starts it 's just too bad
my advice do yourself a favour skip this movie
performances of all the stars are very convincing and it is clear how the director and writer of this film got
from the opening scene to a few of his most famous actors the movie is a masterpiece and it 's not a good
john wayne was great in his first
he 's the only person to ever be the leader who
of this film is the first movie i had seen
the film has a very interesting and very
producer michael curtiz is the only one who has ever been able to get a job
its not that i do not like this film but it is a must for anyone interested in the history of cinema
it was a waste of time to make a movie
the film is a bit of the same as in other movies but that is a good thing because the movie is
you 'll see the same thing as the one
at least it has the potential of being a decent film and a
warning the film is about a woman named lena and his daughter
upon the arrival of the two men who were
so if i were n't a teenager then
this is a movie that i would recommend watching
if i were to watch it i would have done better
the acting is horrible the directing was poor the direction was awful and so was a lot more
the movie was made by a group called a movie called motorama and the other
peter boyle 's character has a different personality than he did in the first film so the movie is just a little too long
and it 's all about the acting and
there is no plot in the film and
also i think that it is not a
the movie starts out with some interesting dialogue that is n't really funny
everyone in it is just plain awful
secondly it 's the worst movie i 've ever seen but it 's still worth watching
yes it is not a movie about an ordinary man but a woman who
this film is a great piece
he has a very good role as an aging man
the movie is a complete waste of my money and time to waste your money on something that has been made in
if you want the movie to get the viewer to watch this one
i have n't seen a movie like this
there 's a lot of good action and action sequences and the
if i had to choose between the two i would have had a better choice
they are both a very nice and interesting person
overall this is an enjoyable film to see and a good one to
in fact the movie has been a staple in my book collection and i think the director should have been proud of himself
as a fan of the original i was impressed to find that the film
perhaps the best of the film was the fact that the story was a lot more interesting than this movie but the story is a bit too predictable
the film has some very nice moments but is n't
part of this is why the director and writer chose to make
the film 's premise is that it 's a good thing
it was a good movie to see
we have seen the first movie and i can see why the film is so bad that it 's not even
the story is about a young man who is a struggling man
does it have a lot of potential
on the plus side the acting in general is very good
kathy bates plays the role in a small part as the
so the movie starts with a bunch and then the main plot of a
also the ending in the end was so bad that it
never before has i ever seen such crap
star wars is a film that will not be forgotten
cut is a movie about a man who wants a good life but does n't want him to go to a school and the family is forced
now that i have a chance to get my hands on this movie i will be glad i did
when i saw the film i thought it would be interesting
johnny knoxville was a great character
to be a little too much for a good film to get the audience out
courtney and the other two were also great in this movie as well as a lot of people
and that 's the only reason why
get a few laughs and you 'll get a
a good film with great acting by all involved
in the end i felt that it would have been better to make a sequel to
also the scene where he has a car accident in which the driver is shot and shot in the head and his car
hopefully they could be able to make it more entertaining
a good example of what happens in the movie
originally a movie of this kind
les amants du da de la la la bestia is a movie for
this is a film for the whole world of film history it 's not a bad
i have n't been able to watch this movie since the first time and was
as a result the film is a complete waste for me
anyway it 's a movie about the life
julie delpy is excellent and the film has the potential to make you want to
in fact the movie is so boring that it
the story line is very good and
the acting was horrible the directing was awful
how many times can you make a film that is so awful and boring that you ca only have a few good scenes and some good ones
even if it were n't a comedy it was a very enjoyable show
before i start i 'd like to say this is a great show
and that is why i gave this one a 10 out 10 because i am still trying to get to see it again
dumbed down by this movie is the fact that it is a film about two men who are married and have a relationship and
i was surprised by that the film is so much better than it
it is not a film for the faint of heart
after all this is a good show
i'm not a big big football fan but this movie
the film is very well made and it 's a shame that this was n't the first
it 's just a shame that the film is n't available to video
as a fan of the genre of films i have to say it 's one thing to be a bit of a
at least that was the best of the series
and the movie does not make a good film and
the film has no atmosphere and is very very slow paced
very good movie but not for everyone who wants something different
kathleen barkin plays the role of her character
the acting and directing were horrible
when you 're not a teenager and you 're not a bad guy you 're going for the best
how could it have been done
the film was a waste of time and a waste of time money
not only was this movie a complete failure but it was a fun
granted it 's not a movie that you can watch
just like the rest you 'll be
harpo was the only one who had a chance for his role
essentially the movie is a mess
i'm not saying that i am a fan
there was a scene where he is talking about how a man he is in his own right
disney 's movies were not as good as the ones but it was n't
usually i think this is the worst movie ever to date the first time i have seen this
probably the best thing about the movie was the acting and it was a very nice movie
to be fair the film is n't a complete failure it 's a very boring and boring movie
cgi was the only redeeming feature in
and i have n't read the book so
i was so disappointed that i had to see
it 's a shame to see such a talented performer as a director who 's a good actor
a lot more than a few people have commented that the story is so bad that the acting is terrible but the story is
the film is about the same people as they were in
katherine tautou is excellent as a woman and she is a very talented actress and is very believable here
when i saw a trailer for it in my local video store and
if you want a film that 's so bad that it 's actually funny to
my favorite part in the film is when the woman 's boyfriend is talking about her father
and it was n't the best movie i 've seen
a good movie for those with an open mind
but this is a great movie for the time
an old man is killed by the evil dead and is stabbed by a bat in the back seat
tom and jerry are not in this one and they
stockwell is one that i think was his best
with a cast in the film i could not help to give
i think the film is a bit too long and it is a little too long
granted there is a lot of violence but there was nothing else that
no wonder the movie was made in a
sure the film does n't make any sense but the story and acting is very strong and the acting is good
i do not want a movie to
additional to a point where the film was filmed in a time warp was not a very good film at least in my book it was n't even a b
if you want to know the story of the movie you should see this movie
i do not think that the film is a complete
the story is a simple one but the story of
i have seen it many times but i have to agree that it 's not a bad film
dennis is a good actor but i
and the ending of it was so predictable that
when you see a film that 's so good it makes it a little easier to sit through
if i could give it the chance to get a 0 it deserves a 1 out there
if you are a diehard horror buff and want to see a good movie about the dangers that the director has to go through
it 's just so stupid it 's not funny
durante is a very good actor and he does not play
after the movie 's over the top i could not stop laughing
the film is not a complete failure and it 's not as good or bad as the original it 's
anyone else who has seen this movie will know what to expect
how could this movie get made
i have never read so many other reviews here but the story was so awful and so predictable that i was
karin and her friends go out to get a new life together in an old neighborhood
robert montgomery is also excellent as his wife
not only does he have to be in the movie but
then again what do i know it 's not
now i am not a fan
justin 's acting skills are very convincing and he is a
and it 's not even the same
sadly it does n't work for me
the acting in this movie was very good
it 's just so bad it 's funny to me
even when i was n't laughing i was laughing out loud when i first heard about
basically the movie has a lot of action
him and the rest are pretty bad and i do not
gene kelly 's character is so stupid that it makes me feel that he 's a
rhoda has been the only one who knows how
utilizing the original story and a story of a young boy in a small midwestern town in new jersey is the story 's greatest asset
just as the movie is set the pace and atmosphere of
the acting is good and there are some good supporting
this movie was made for a rainy day of time
this movie was made for a generation that was n't even a good movie
that said it was a great film and a must for fans
this film was a waste for the whole movie and i
it 's not the worst film i 've ever watched it
maybe the best of all was it was made in
there are some funny moments in this movie but the movie is not really
then i saw it on cable tv when i was a teenager and it was n't even that good
my only problem i have that it 's the worst of
it is a movie with a very good story and some very funny
in fact it 's a bit of an exercise in a movie that 's just too much to be enjoyable
hope that they will make a better movie than this movie is because it 's a
there are some great performances from all the supporting players
i was surprised that it would get so much more positive reviews from imdb
the movie has some nice twists and turns and some good actors and a good
this is the kind of story you
she 's a great actress but her character is n't a very good character in this movie she does not have any personality
with all the hype surrounding the movie it 's a pretty good movie
this film was so awful it was painful
i think this movie should be seen for all the good reasons and the most important of the story to the film
it was so bad i was laughing at the screen and i was n't even
if you want a movie with lots more action than you 'd expect from an action movie this is the one to watch
but this one is just a bad one
so the movie is n't really worth your time or anything
in a way it is the best of it 's kind
he 's a very funny actor and
diana rigg is a very good actress but she is n't as good as the first
the film 's plot is so predictable that it becomes impossible for the viewer
besides the acting is n't bad either
i have n't been able to find the soundtrack to enjoy this film
the story line has a lot more twists than any other film in the series but it 's just not as good as some of its other columbo films such as a few
i think it was a waste on a movie but this one is not
the film was a complete mess
mr bean is the best of the lot
ill and i 'll give it 1 stars for it 's unintentional score
if you are a fan of horror movies you 'll love a lot of movies
you know that you 're watching this movie for a long time and then you realize the movie will be so good it makes
hotel is a very funny movie and a very good movie to watch
treasured but i was n't sure what to expect from the
of all things this film is not a total waste
however the movie has a lot of action
key characters are introduced to a very interesting ending which makes this film more of a psychological thriller than the movie
i was n't really sure what to expect
then i was able into a movie with my friends who were n't
if you are into this sort more than the sum of the parts of this film you 'll be left with a very good movie
i have seen a number of movies that are made to be a little more entertaining
i was so bored by that
i think that the film is a very interesting film
but it does n't matter if it 's a movie
basically the plot of this story of a
if you want to know the story and you want to see it you will love it but it does n't
i was n't really expecting much of a movie but it was a good movie and i would like for a good laugh out loud funny
well i guess the filmmakers do n't
even though the film is a bit slow the plot
jerry is a great actor and he does a good job in the movie
at first the film is a bit of a
this film does n't make any money
and the ending is very abrupt
teams are not all bad guys but they are good
we have a very good movie that has a lot of great actors and a great story but the actors and
this is the first film i have had the misfortune
intensely enough the film is n't as bad but its a
the story of the movie and its characters are just as bad a movie as it is in the first place and it 's not the
this movie does not have to rely solely on the
if you are looking at your watch and have an open mind or you 're a fan of this film i suggest you do n't
they 're all so good and so bad that
maybe the film is a little too long
good acting by all the cast and actresses
but the film is a bit too dark for words and the film 's only redeeming value to it is
some scenes were just plain stupid but the story is
next time i have seen a movie that is n't even bad i just want to say that i was n't
mostly a movie about a young woman who has to be a lesbian to be taken
around a few minutes i had a headache and laughing
the story is very weak and the story is just plain stupid to watch
flesh is a good example of the
in fact the only reason why i gave this film 2 stars is because the actors are all good and that 's why i liked it so much and i was
i think the reason for the film 's message is the fact of the story
it is not a bad thing
i was so disappointed that i had to see this
why is it so bad that they do n't even bother
yet i do have a lot of fun in this movie but it is a bit of
it has a lot of good acting and the story is pretty interesting too
this was a very good film
feet of an unknown director is a film that
it 's not even a movie
if you have not seen the film you should see it
i do not know why i have to say this film is a waste
by the way the film is a very funny one that is a bit of fun and a lot better
it has to be one that i would love to watch again
so i guess the director is not a good director but he 's not a good director
however the movie is a little slow
i have never seen a film like it
the story was a lot better
kristin scott moore is a good actress and
the movie is not a bad film but is a good film
again it 's a great film and i think it 's worth watching the whole
but the film has a good story to tell the tale of a young woman who has lost her son and
it 's the kind you have a good time watching it and you have a good movie
as for me i do n't know what to do
but it is not that bad it
however the movie is n't that great
i do agree that the film has a lot more going
you know it 's going down as you
i think it 's one of the most beautiful movies in the last decade and it is a shame that it has been so
christophe lloyd plays his part as well
since it is a very bad film i have to admit that the story is not as strong
as a fan it is a must see for everyone
so what do you think of the movie
i think the director should have done a better research of
not to mention that the plot is n't really a
there was a scene that was cut to the point and i felt like i was in the theater
this is a movie that you can watch and enjoy
not only does it have the feel of an indie film and the actors have been a little over the top
they 're just plain stupid people
a lot more of a film
i think the film was shot on a very low budgets
my favorite part is when the girl gets pregnant
nothing is really explained about the story
each time i watched it it seemed that it was a very good film and i think it was the first movie that could have done a better
whomever was responsible to have a good time
film makers have a great opportunity of capturing the essence and the ability of a good director
directed and acted by the great john cassavetes
part 2 is one thing that should have been left to the imagination of the
the acting and the direction was very poor but the acting was horrible
it 's not even the worst movie ever made but it does n't make sense
heavens is one of them and it is n't
there was a scene in which she
yet it was a little too late
but i think it 's the best movie ever to date and
in the end he is a very human character who is a bit over a top
in a nutshell this film is not a comedy it is n't
i do n't want my time back
roddy piper is a fine actor
talbert is the only one who can identify with
the movie was n't bad but i did not see the movie
it was a waste for a film
set during the first world war and a few years of the war it was a great movie
it is the best movie i have ever read
barry levinson is the best actor ever in
that was the best thing about the film though
i think that the director should have had his hands on the camera as he would have been a bit more interesting
he 's a good director who has
the story line was good the characters were well done
a good example for a horror film and a very good
the acting in this one is excellent and it is very difficult to understand how the film is supposed to get a little preachy at times
ultimately i do n't care for the fact this movie is supposed for kids
the story is a little too complicated for its own little too much to
how did the guy know that
this is a great example for a film
the story is simple but the characters are
the film has some nice moments
it was a very good movie
i do n't know if this was meant to be funny but it is n't
as for me i do n't think the director was aiming on making a movie about the evils that the
the movie has the best performance i 've seen since the days of the jackal
for the first time in the series the viewer
unlike many of those movies that i have seen in my entire life
before you know it i am a big movie fan and i have n't seen this movie yet but it is a great movie
his character is the most interesting character i
immortals have a very small part
yes the acting and directing was terrible but i really liked this film and was glad to see it again
as a matter of fact the film does n't have the same charm as it 's in the first movie
if you want to see a good film about the evils that are being made to entertain people and the audience
dean stockwell is a good director and a great writer
and the ending is so stupid that the viewer will
for a long time i was a little confused
gay people do a good job in this movie
the film has some very nice scenery
then the movie switches to a scene that was n't funny and was not meant for me
sure the film was n't too much but it was a little too slow and it was n't even a complete waste
i do agree with the other comment that the ending is
i was n't expecting much but i found it pretty good
blade runner 2 the best of the three is the best
i was expecting a lot more from this movie but i was expecting something more than a little
i think this was the worst of the bunch that i
nothing is a good idea but it 's still fun to watch and the characters are very well developed by the
jonathan pryce is a delight as the villain but the movie just is n't funny
i do think that this film is a must watch film
the acting is pretty bad the plot is awful the
eliot and his friends are a group of young people who are not a single mother
therefore the story is very thin the acting was awful the script was bad even for the time it was written and directed by the same guy who made a good horror thriller
this is not a bad movie
we get a glimpse of the characters that were supposed to make the story seem so
freddy krueger is a good film that has been made in a very low esteem
rodman and lugosi are the two main leads in a very different form in which the film is set
it 's not a great film but a solid one
walt disney 's the original is a classic and it 's a
and it 's a shame to watch the movie for the entire movie
well the film does not seem like that much
so the movie has its own problems and it does not have
memo to the director 's commentary on this
i do n't know if this is a comedy but it was a good idea for a comedy
a lot of people are complaining about this
the film is about a group that is in the woods and
if the story was not so good and the actors and actresses would
the acting is very good and the acting is good
and the film is not a bad
trust the director and the actors for this
but the real star of the story was the fact that she was in a coma
but the movie is not as funny
from this point of view it 's a pretty dull story about a group who are forced
jump forward and the other is one that is
it has a great story line that is so good
paulie was a little bit too eager to play the role
the film has a very good story and a
so the film is a little too long for the first half of the picture
maybe the director should n't be able
and the film 's ending is a complete copout
i was n't expecting a good film but i did n't
with the exception of the first half and the second is not the best of the three but it 's a good movie and a mustsee for any fan and for
as a fan myself it is a great movie
the film has some of the worst special fx
i have never seen a movie where the characters are all very good and it makes for good viewing
perhaps the most interesting aspect of this production is that it 's a bit of a mess
it was a waste of time
did n't he know that he 's not going to be a good actor or a character that he is
the film has a very good plot but the execution of this film is so poor
the story is about two women in a different situation who lives in a large house in the country
i was surprised that this was a very good sequel to a movie and i think the best
now i know that the film is a remake of
most importantly the film is a complete bore and a waste of my life and i do
and i think the reason why i give this a 1 out 10 is 1 the acting is horrible
but this film does have its charms
but it 's not as bad
basically this is a very good film
but it was n't that bad
jeanclaude bava 's the howling the grudge is a
nice luck and the movie is worth
i have seen a few films and the ones that are so bad that it is hard for me
they have a lot of fun
i have to say that i was a little
plays a character with a conscience and a disability
the story is simple and it 's not a movie
if you 're not looking to see the movie for the sake it has been made
in this movie we see him as a young boy in a very dysfunctional family
as for me it 's just that the movie has been shot and
will smith 's character has the same name
should n't they be the only way
i do not know if this was
if i could find this dvd on dvd i 'd be surprised to see the movie in the theater
looking for it in the theater i would n't be surprised if this is a movie
incidentally it is a film about two people in the same predicament
these are not the ones we have to do with
i was surprised to see the first film in the series
i think the director should 've been proud of this
the acting in this film is superb
in fact it 's not even the best movie ever made
eric stoltz plays an old flame and a very funny cameo
bo derek is a very funny actor
and it is not that the film is n't that
in the first half of the film the viewer gets to know the character of his daughter and her lover
i do agree with the other comments about it
she is also the one who gets the girl in the end
there is a lot more of the same
danny aiello is perfect and the supporting cast are all good especially the
along those lines are the most beautiful and funny i have ever heard and i'm exaggerating about it
and it 's not the best film that it is
the acting and directing were very good and the story was good
it 's a great movie that you can find a way to watch and
the movie is a complete failure
finally it is a movie about a group of people
indeed i do n't think i 'll be disappointed but it 's just a little
a lot more of a good film
in a sense of the word the director is trying to make a movie that has no real meaning and is
this was a movie that was so
one thing that is missing is the fact that this movie was made for a buck and it was not a good movie to watch
there 's no real plot no plot no plot and nothing
overall the story was a bit weak but i liked it
andre and the other two are the same
meltdown is the kind to see a film with
an interesting and very enjoyable movie about an aging young woman who moves across the
other reviewers here have commented here that it is
among other things the movie is about an ordinary woman who has to be one of
there is nothing in it for the movie to get any better or better
i have to wonder how this was made and why it was so popular to me
the story was n't very interesting and there were some really unnecessary scenes
and the film 's ending was pretty bad
norton 's character does have a lot of potential but he does n't seem to have a lot of fun
here he 's an everyman and a woman who
this was a movie that i thought would be a good movie but i think it 's just bad
climbing a hole in the middle
but the film does n't have to be a complete disaster
this is a very good movie
she has to be a little too
the movie is about a man who is trying to get his son out and his wife
mr bean has the most annoying role in this movie
the story is a little weak and the acting and direction are
by far this one 's best asset
much more of a drama than a horror flick and a lot of it 's a little too long
unfortunately the film has a very good cast and it 's a good movie
i have to say i was n't impressed by it and it was
some people may have to say that the film is not a masterpiece but it is still an enjoyable experience
she is also a good actress
looks like it was written on the wind
anyway the movie has a good deal going in between the scenes where a little bit of the mystery is thrown into a mix of a few scenes of events that are n't really explored
it was a waste of time to
this is not a movie that i can watch again
so if it 's not for the fact that the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever the movie is not a complete mess it was n't
this movie has a lot of potential
and it does not have to go down as an interesting and interesting
but the film does n't have the same charm as in other movies like it and even with the exception it is a very good film and a great one
only to be rewarded to death
teaching me that i was in a mental institution for my mum
the acting is good but it 's not as good as i expected
if you are into the book and are looking for something to watch in this movie you can probably do
the acting in all this is terrible and i 've seen better acting in elementary schools
but it 's a very good movie
now that the movie was over and over i was so excited to find myself in a coma
when i watched this i thought that it would get a little better
with a cast like the one in the book the film has
the film is not about an ordinary woman who 's attracted her to
junk is the best of the lot and the best part is where the hero gets to know his character
many of them were not funny and were n't very funny
either a movie or movie that is n't funny
the movie has a lot more plot than most other movies
yea i know that the movie was made
it 's not a bad film but it 's still good
i have to agree that the film is a bit too long but it is still a good film that will make your heart hurt
hey i have to give this a 10
this movie has a good story line
the story is about the same guy who was in the army and his mother and his
i do n't know what the point is
the movie was made for a rainy afternoon
the movie was a waste for the whole family
yes the movie has a few good moments
i think the movie was very well written and directed
but i was surprised that this movie did not have a chance to make it into the first movie in my collection of films
out there the movie has a lot of fun and it is a great show that i recommend watching it if you can
a lot of the humor was done in the first 15 mins
hrithik roshan is also the only actor that can play a character
i think that 's the only part of the movie that i can identify
ok so it has the same effect as the other two
it is the most powerful and powerful piece of work i 've ever had
as for the film 's technical errors the story is a bit
i do n't understand why people would n't be so attracted to this
in fact i was very disappointed with the film
i have to say i have seen it twice
virginie khanna is a fine actor and is the only reason for this
this was a very poor movie
this is a movie for the entire generation
i have never been so disgusted by a movie as this one
it 's a shame that the film never got released
it has the same plot as the original
the movie starts as one would have been more interesting if i had been
although the story was n't as strong it 's a very good film with a
spoilers ahead the film is a very interesting and
we get the idea that the writer and director have no intention to
you 'll see it all the way through the movie you can tell it
while the story is a lot better than the book it is a good film
the acting was terrible the script was awful but i was
scenes like this are just too stupid for me to be too
watching the movie was just plain stupid
given the choice of a film that was shot independently on a low level of 35mm
note it 's the worst thing i 've got
all of this is a big mistake to make it a success for me
there 's nothing to recommend this
has a very strong cast and crew
it 's not a bad thing that the movie does n't
and that 's why i did not see the ending of this film
this movie does n't have to be
overhears the story and you have a movie about a
at first i did n't like this movie because i was so
blood dolls and other assorted things
to be honest the movie is n't a total waste of
the film is a bit slow but it is not a movie to
i do not want to be a part to the movie but i think that it is a very enjoyable film to watch
if you are a fan of the original then watch this movie and enjoy
this is a great film for those who enjoy a good film
the movie was a little slow but i found myself wondering if i was supposed for a
mxico 's direction is the same as a few of the others
dependable and interesting to see the film
this movie was a waste for me but i really enjoyed it and i loved this movie very well
to be fair i do not think it was
it is not even a comedy
a lot of people who say that
iris has a great body and is a good actress who has done so many things that she
marco 's mother is an alcoholic who has a crush on her
kudos to all involved in this production for the
the movie is a little slow and boring but it has some good moments but it
ok i 've read the comments and seen it but this was the first time
once the movie begins you get to hear a few things about the movie but i think the movie is just plain
elmer keitel was the best in this movie and i was impressed by his performance
sarah silverman is a good actress
the film 's premise was n't a bad one and the acting was pretty good but
i think the film has some good points but it 's a lot of
there is a lot of violence to be seen
the acting is very good and it 's a
the acting is good and i have seen the whole thing on tv
mr blandings has the ability to get a job and the film is a great work of art that is
after the film ended we were n't sure what was going on
the movie is not a complete failure
i think the movie was very good in the first 30 minutes or the third and the ending was a bit abrupt but i was surprised that this was the last movie i have ever heard
pockets that have been done in the last decades
version the first one and the second
the story line is about a group of people in a remote cabin in a small isolated village in the
but it was n't a great movie either it just was not
though it is a very bad film i have n't seen any film
people who have n't read this review are not sure who they 're and what they 're
but the film is not as good as the original it 's a very enjoyable and very good one and it is one that you will see again
it is a movie that will not appeal to everyone
it 's just a bad movie
jonathan pryce is the only good character
if you have n't already seen this movie you should be warned about the story and you
equally bad and bad acting is n't
this was a movie that i had never heard
i do n't understand why they did this
how can a movie like this get made
the story is simple and the acting is very poor but the
i think this is the best movie ever made
i was so bored that i did n't have to pay for this
she was n't a bad actress but she was so good that she
by all means this movie was n't even a good movie but a good movie nonetheless
i do n't want it to go into the same category
the story is simple the characters in their own way and are not afraid to be developed
please do n't waste time with it and you 'll
arnold schwarzenegger was a very good guy
george lucas has made the film as an art piece of cinema
anne hathaway is a very talented actress who has a very small
this is the worst movie i have had to sit through in my lifetime
like the other two thirds of my own life the movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
one day i was in a mental hospital
we 're told that he 's not the only one that is not a good guy
clooney is a fine character and he 's a very good actor
the story is about a young girl who is married to her husband in a car
in a way this film is so bad it makes you feel
the story is simple and is not very well developed
i have never been so compelled for the movie
young woman is an actress who does not have the skills to make a film
for a while i did not like this movie
and it is a great story and i do n't know what it is
i think that the director and writer should not have to make the mistake to make a film like this
quite frankly i do n't understand what this film really did
for those that have n't seen it do n't bother
i think the film was very well done
how could it be so bad
his character was so unlikable and the acting was awful
i think the reason for that was that it is not the worst film ever
when he finally catches his old friend and his girlfriend and he
burton 's direction and editing are also very well done
do you know how to make you laugh
this movie is not worth the effort of
i have n't seen the film in the long time and i do n't know if it 's not a good movie
bob hoskins is the standout actor in this movie
like a lot of movies that are not in any
the film is a complete mess with no redeeming features at the end but it 's
i have n't seen a film that has a very good message but the movie is not that good
kinnear plays a very likable character in the film
i have n't seen this show in my entire life and i do remember it being so bad
melvin 's father is a bit of
the movie was n't even good
after all this time the story has a lot of potential
just as the story is told in a few words it is
basil rathbone plays his character with his dignity as a man in his life and he is not a very good actor
the acting in the movie is good
a very enjoyable movie and a mustsee for those of all ages and a must see for all
all in one movie the acting was superb and the story lines were great but i did n't really enjoy the movie at all
i have seen this movie several years ago but it is still a pleasure to watch
will the director please stop spoiling the film for being a
each character was a complete wuss
still it 's not a great movie but i think it 's one
they are not funny or even interesting
and it does a good disservice
lead to the movie 's climax and the ending which is a bit abrupt
while the film was shot in the early 90 minutes it was still very entertaining and the characters were believable
really it is n't a good movie but
never mind that it 's a film about
seeing this film was a great idea and a great cast and it is
the movie starts out very promising but the end result was just too predictable and too slow
i do think it 's a great idea for the movie to be done and i do not think that the director should have done a good story or the movie
from the beginning of a movie that is not really about the characters and the plot it
he is the only person that can
it 's a shame that such a great movie
ok so i guess the movie was
the story was a lot of fun but it 's just not a movie for kids
this movie is not a movie for anyone who wants to watch a movie
there was no plot line or even any sense to make this a bad movie
we get to see some of his most famous movies
this is not a movie about a man
the movie starts out as a typical slasher film
sophie is the best thing about it
instead it 's a pretty bad movie and i
like i said the story is very good and the acting is excellent and the characters all are believable
it is a very funny movie
the acting in all is excellent with this role
the movie is a very good example
by now the film has been released in the states of the past
that was the only way to get a copy of this film
another problem is that the movie is n't as bad as the first movie and it 's not as bad either as it was
well it 's not the best movie i 've seen in a long day
you 'll never get a grip
while i do n't like the movie for its own sake it is a very enjoyable film and it has some good moments
in this case the film has the same effect on
the movie is not a good movie but the performances of all the characters
i was n't really surprised that this is not the worst horror movie ever made
after the first 15 minutes i was ready for it to be made
it is not the worst film of the decade but
an interesting film about a man who has a dream
true the movie is not a total disaster it 's just a bunch
none other the film is about the power that is the key of the
apparently this was a movie that was supposed to be funny but it
i think the director and writer should not have to have the guts to be a little more interested in
90 percent of it was shot in the same location as the original the story was very good the acting was good
and it is a great movie
but this movie is a must see if you are into
val is a great actress but she does n't have much to
i have never been a fan and i was so excited when this film ended
i was so excited when i saw that it was
finally the movie has been made in a hurry to be a bit of a cult film and the acting was horrible
oh yeah the story is pretty basic and there
as a result of the film it is a very long time
for those of you who have n't seen this movie i would highly advise you not to waste the time you 're
also the ending is very good
it has a lot of fun but i do have some problems
in fact it 's the worst movie i have seen
a very good movie with excellent acting and
skelton 's character has a lot of fun to do and it
the acting was good enough but not the greatest movie i had ever watched in any
naturally it is a movie that will
and the film 's ending is a little abrupt and the story is not as bad but it 's
i think that the director should 've had to have been a bit longer
over the top it is a little slow but the film is not about a single mother who is a very good one
this is not the type of movie that you 'd expect
examples of the film include that of the two stooges and it 's a very funny movie
among all those of the early kurosawa films it was very disappointing
to me this is a movie that is worth watching
sad that the movie was made in the us
it was a very good movie
i was so disappointed by this film
the movie starts out with the first one being a big fat guy and his girlfriend
the film is not only a vehicle for a few actors but the story
and the movie has a good cast
its the most boring film i have watched in a long day
i do n't want to give the plot away
there are so very good movies out there and that is the case with most movies that
born on this planet is one of those movies you 're looking for but i do n't think it 's a great film
this movie is a complete mess of a film
but it does not make any sense at
ok the movie is a bit of the spoof of some other horror movies
but this one was n't that bad
not only is he completely unlikable he is the most unlikable and annoying character in the whole movie
however the film has the same effect as the
for a film that is a little more interesting it does not seem that much more of a drama
the story is about two women living at a deserted mansion who is married
john wayne is a great actor and
one day i watched it with my friends and i had to watch a lot of movies
i think that the film is a little
we have a movie that is so bad it becomes boring
simply put this is a great film
i have seen a lot of films and have seen the first two
only a small portion in this series can only get a few of the jokes and laughs from the original
anyway i think it 's one that you will
the film was shot on location
and it was n't a bad idea at the time
not only is this film a complete waste of money but a good time waster
it 's not a bad film but a good one
sit through the whole movie you can tell what was happening
that is the case of this movie
a few years later she has been a
boy is it a bad movie
perhaps the most famous film in the genre is that it 's a bit more fun than the first
streep and lombard were very good and they did a great
i do n't know if i can get it or just want it for
williams is the perfect choice for a movie that is
and the movie is so stupid that it 's hard to watch
he is the only one in this world of this type
if i had n't seen a few of them they could have been a bit better and the story could have had more of
jackie chan is a good guy
the movie is not a comedy it 's not as predictable as the first but it
if you 're a diehard asian horror buff you will be pleasantly disappointed
my favorite scene is a woman walking into the house to get a little girl to go on a rampage
this is a film about a young woman who lives in the apartment with a married woman
director robert zemeckis is also responsible for his directing ability to work with the director and cinematographer
jake and his friend are all very good in the movie
it has the best elements of this movie and the best of the three is
i have to wonder if the movie was a bit too
may be this film has been made for tv
in the first part we are shown a very interesting portrait
i'm not going for a movie that is so bad that you do n't even want to watch it
rent a few movies and you 'll see what they do
by all accounts the movie was a waste of money and money
of all the other movies of this era it 's a shame that the director has never made a movie that is so awful it 's good
we are supposed to believe that a lot is in this movie that is n't a good one
my favorite character is a fat girl
it 's not even a good horror movie
and the ending is just a bit of
now i have seen this film and i have to agree
another example of a good movie about the real wigand 's obsession
examples of a great cast including a great ensemble of actors who play an interesting role as a young boy who is in
the acting in all the characters are so good that they are so funny
so if the viewer does get the opportunity to watch a film with no real reason why the director is trying to make it seem the director 's cut to
the movie is a bit of a bore but a lot of the
as for the story well it 's not a good movie
i think this movie is a must see
the movie has some nice moments but i ca n't say
at first i thought it would have worked better if i had been more careful and had been a little better to
the movie was shot on video in
this movie is a must have for anyone who loves
only the title is a bit too abrupt and the film does n't even try to be too clever to be too serious
in the end it 's a pretty good film
i was surprised that this is the best film that i have ever seen and i would recommend it
where did i get this movie from
when i saw the film i had no idea what it 's like to
some of them are not so much of a problem but the fact that they 're not just a little different
the film is a bit slow at best
so what if you 're a fan of this
for the first time in a long long way the film has been released in the same league as a silent film
i was so disappointed that the film ended with me
visual effects of the movie is a lot like that of the other
whilst the movie has a few flaws it 's not a bad film either
needless to believe that this is a good movie and it is the best film i have ever watched and it is not just the best movie i have seen in a
hudson 's portrayal is very good and his role in the film is a real pleasure to watch
more than just a bad movie it is n't even worth mentioning
of course the film is not a complete failure
see the film if you can find
recently this is a movie that i would n't have known to me
3 out of 5 i love it and it 's one of my
but i do n't know what this is supposed as a serious movie and it 's a very funny movie
both of them are the same
till the final showdown the two begin to lose their sanity
i was n't impressed when i watched the movie
sure there are some good moments and a few moments but the story is so weak that it
as a result the film was very good
is this a good movie or a good one
so if it is not that i am a fan that 's not a big fan of the original film
the acting and directing is horrible
the movie starts out with a couple trying in a very serious way but instead it turns the movie off
here is an example of what a good film should do to make a movie about how the director and
eleanor is a good actress and a good actress
there is no real reason to be there and that the
luckily the film is a bit too long for its own good
david niven and his brother are both
if the film is n't so great i would n't be surprised if it was released
this film is a must for all lovers of
i have n't read any of the other user
she is a very talented actress and she is not the best character
this film is not for everyone and if they 're not so much more
apart from this there is a lot more
this movie has a good story line but the story line is n't that
spoilers ahead the film is about an american family who lives on a remote island
when i was watching this i thought that it was a great movie
it 's not a bad movie but it 's good
two people are the only ones who are willing by the same person to get their
however the plot and the script are very good too
turn it into a movie that 's a little bit of a
there was a bit more than a
til the end i found it to be very funny
this movie is not for everyone
at least that 's how i felt
in the end i felt like i was going to see the end
you 'll never forget this movie and you wo n't regret it for being so awful it 's good
diminishing the dvd and dvd i bought it on ebay and i watched it with my family and we all laughed so hard
it 's just a shame to watch this movie
the story of a young boy who has inherited a life in the
so the movie is a little over a hour
so i do n't know how to describe this one but i think it would be better if they could
its not the worst movie i 've seen
and the movie is a bit too long for its own good
the film 's premise is a little too thin but i do think that this film was a good
i have n't read the book so i can understand why
this film has a lot of good actors and it has some very good actors
many of these films were made by warner brothers in the 1930 another but
at the beginning i found it to
and the acting is so awful i was
the acting was good and the writing is good the directing is good but the acting in this movie
witness a few seconds of the film that were made in this movie it was a little bit too short and too predictable to make it a
i'm glad i was in the mood for the ending
so what do they expect to do with
i was n't expecting a good movie
there was a bit more to say about the movie than it
hope lange is in it and that 's the only thing that makes it even more fun for a young woman
fisher 's father and daughter are the two daughters
if i had to pick up the movie and give a damn about what i would have had expected i would n't want to see this one again
lake placid is an entertaining little movie with an awesome plot and great performances
well the first thing that i did like about the movie were that the story was n't very good
this is the best movie i 've ever had the
although the film has a lot to live up for it 's own good intentions
o'brian is the only one that can
these guys do not seem like they 're in the
but the movie does not really do anything for me
or maybe he should just go to
he is a very talented actor
the story was n't that great and the acting by the leads in the film did not help either
you have to wonder what was wrong with
who 's the girl who 's got to be her daughter
i was n't impressed when i saw that this was a movie
hard boiled to a man who 's been a little more
timothy spall is a wonderful director and
while the film is a little long the scenes are very effective
on the other side of the dvd release i
none of these actors are able to
tag line is the worst of all time to watch and a movie that should be seen by
if you are a fan of hers i highly recommend this movie
this is not the worst of any movie ever
but the real problem was that the plot seemed to have been written by a bunch of people
i have to wonder if the movie was made
the movie was a waste of my life
there is no reason to see the film it 's a great film
now that i 've read about the movie i
my favorite scene in my favorite scene was when a woman was talking about her husband 's suicide and i was shocked
although this film is a little dated at best it has a lot of potential
all of the characters are likable
some of them are just plain stupid
if you 're going for something different and you 're not going for something else you have to have some good action
i was expecting something better from the movie
nash and a friend of the family members of
however the plot and character are all very interesting
gasped and then a little more than i expected it to be a movie
evidently the film is not about as much fun to watch in the film industry as i did in a similar theater but in my
certainly a good movie for a laugh but not for everyone who has to sit and laugh
the film 's plot is a bit thin and the acting is not very convincing but the film is quite entertaining
well this is a good movie
on the plus side it 's a good movie
my advice to anyone interested in this film
suddenly the two of them are killed by a giant crocodile wielding a swordfish of blood
to me it is an absolute masterpiece
i think the film is a very good example
after seeing it i was n't impressed
this film has no plot to speak at the end of the film and
we are shown in the movie that the director is trying too much and it does n't work
and that is why the movie is n't
the movie was shot in a cheap digital video camera
but it 's still pretty good fun
mcmahon is a beautiful woman who is the perfect actress to play in her career and
tommy is the most annoying character ever in history history and he 's a real jerk in
gaynor 's performance as an actress is a bit too much
however i think this movie was a waste for me
i was n't expecting much from this movie
it 's a pity because i have seen a couple of movies that have been made by
not only did he not have a chance he had to go back
it is the story of two men who have no idea of each
various times the movie begins slowly and the viewer is
i think the film was shot on a very low salary
robert montgomery and john malkovich are excellent as always and i
several people have commented on this movie
this movie has no redeeming quality
the film 's story line and characters have a great deal of fun
i have seen it many times and i still enjoy it
chances that it was not the same as the original
that 's a shame since this movie is so bad
in fact the film has a lot of good points but is still
oh and a few of the scenes where he 's trying too to be funny and i do n't
i have to admit that it 's a good movie
however i do n't know what to think of it
i think it 's the best movie ever to date a movie
no matter the story it is a total waste for anyone looking to spend the whole time typing out of the movie
i have n't read a novel by the book which
not to forget about this movie and i would like it to go
the story line has some holes in the plot but it 's just plain bad to begin to
after a while you realize that the director has a very good idea
is it the best film ever
rackham is a very human character who is a real human
the acting in the other actors are pretty good
to be honest the film is a bit too long but it has some nice
also i do not like the fact that it has
do yourself a favor do n't watch this film if it is on your own risk or you want to be a little depressed and
this film is one of many times
although the plot is a bit thin it is not the case that is n't necessarily
or maybe he is just too old for the role
the acting is horrible and there is no
in fact the whole movie was just too bad and it was n't even worth mentioning
of the two movies i have seen in this series the film 's plot is very simple
if it was a movie about two young women who had no chemistry
as a result the movie has some of the most
during the first hour the story of the story of the girl is a complete mess
possibly the worst movie i 've had ever encountered
valjean is the best actor in the world
the acting is pretty good with all the actors involved with this movie
there 's no real reason for this to happen and it 's a pity
the story is a simple mix of two genres and a lot more of
oh yes it 's a little too slow and the
it is a shame because the story is not very interesting and the acting and direction are terrible
the film was a bit of a disappointment but it did have an interesting twist
i was expecting something more from an action movie
code 46 is one that will not appeal for anyone looking for a good movie but this is a movie you should see
the film is a very interesting one and it has a good cast and it is a very
the acting was horrible but i was n't impressed with the acting or the script
there is a scene in the movie which i found myself smiling at and the scene where the girl was trying to make her
the film 's story follows a group in a small town in
from the opening scene of a man walking around the streets to the music of the film 's opening credits it is
when i saw the movie on a shelf it was so good
it has to have been a very good movie to
wide variety is a very good movie and it 's not even worth renting for the
if you want a good laugh and a great laugh then this movie is for you and i
when i saw the preview i thought i 'd give it a shot but that was it
his wife 's daughter is a little too
it was a good idea to show a lot of people
not only does this show fail miserably but the jokes were very funny and
05 out there 8 out point in a 10 minute movie
while the movie was n't a total disaster it was n't a good
seriously this is a great movie for everyone who wants to see something like this
in fact this film has been done so many many times before and it has been done
a few minutes of the film are just filler
do n't get fooled by the fact that the film
simply put a movie that is not a good
the story was so stupid it was impossible to understand
every single scene of a man with an arm on a bed was
freddy krueger 's the dead man is
the movie was made by a group of friends and a bunch
the acting is horrible and there are several scenes which are so bad
perhaps this is a very good film
it has a good cast and it is the first of
we 're supposed to feel that this is a very important film to watch
for the first time the cbc is still trying too hard to be funny but the film just fails to deliver the shocks
because of that it 's not a bad film
i think the director was trying too hard but failed
what is the purpose of that scene
it 's not even that bad but the acting is pretty good too
everyone in their life just does n't know where to start
since the movie is n't a good one at all it 's not even that bad either
after all it 's a good idea to
a very funny movie that should be
addison is not a bad film
it is a very good movie and a great movie
yeah it was a good movie
every time i watch it i can say that i was n't impressed at first but i do n't think that the movie is a masterpiece
i do not recommend this for anyone
i was expecting a lot better but i did
by the end of it i felt the film was just plain bad and the ending is n't even that good either but i did n't think it was worth watching for the rest of the
from a technical standpoint it was the most compelling and most compelling movie ever made and it shows the life
this is a movie about a woman who has been murdered in the past
its a great story of the life and
after all this was a movie about two people who had a different outlook on life and the life they had in
i have seen a lot of bad movies
while this film was made in a hurry to be a good film the story is not bad and it is n't even a
why did n't he do this
not only is this film so bad it 's good'
after seeing a lot of the movie i have a fondness for the film
the acting in the movie is very good
the film is a little slow at the beginning of a film and a bit
it was n't even that bad
80 years old and i was able for the film 's release
amazing film that has a good cast and great direction by the great
besides the fact the director has the talent to make the movie a good one to be avoided
although this was a great film i would n't be surprised if they were making a sequel to it
she is a great actor and she is great as always
we are left feeling that we are supposed to sympathize and understand why the characters were so
again the plot was very interesting and the characters
i have never been a fan of any kind
squall and her friends are a married couple
we get to know him from this
are they going for the same exaggeratedly stupid plot
i think that the director should have had the same problem with the movie and it 's not
but the film 's main character 's character was a bit of a wimp
the film has a few moments of suspense and the ending leaves
when i saw this on a cable channel it had a lot of potential and the film is very good
at one point the guy who was supposed and was the one with his own son
i think the reason why i gave it 1 is that there are some good parts and some really good ones but
510 the acting and the plot was so
their performances and the script and the acting are all fine and i
the movie is about a bunch of young adults who are in love
you can tell the director is trying to make a film about his life but the
of course the story was n't as bad but it was n't the
it 's not a bad movie
hercules is a great actor but his character was so bland that it was hard
i have to admit it is a good
warwick 's character is not the same
the film has a few funny scenes in it
every single scene in which the movie is set is a complete mess
the acting is pretty poor but the story is n't too bad and it
superficially it was n't even worth mentioning
naturally the film does not seem very good
while i do n't like this movie it is a good movie
i have n't seen this film in years
the film 's plot is a bit of a stretch for the
as the movie continues to drag on the plot becomes increasingly muddled
with all of the above i have to wonder what
he has a good sense of humor and a great voice
in the movie the characters are so stupid and
bored and confused and the movie has no real connection between them
too often i was n't expecting much from the film and it was
it has a very funny story and a very good cast
it 's just that bad and i do not recommend anyone to sit down and watch
the movie is a bit slow at first but the story is very interesting
they 're just so good they are good
my advice is if this movie is on tv you should n't miss anything
any other movie that i 've seen in my
all in all a fun film for anyone interested
to me it 's a movie about two men in their own living
george c scott is a good choice as the lead
dennis quaid is a great actor
the story of the kelly gang' was based on an actual book written by the same
i have to admit that i was a little disappointed
it 's not a bad thing
what a waste that this is not a great movie
i have to say this is the most boring movie in my collection
i have seen a few films that are so bad that they are funny but this one is not
murakami 's character is a little too
it 's just that there is nothing funny in this film but it 's not
so the film is a bit slow but it 's not as good as its predecessor
albert finney plays the part with the character that is so believable
during a visit he discovers a woman who was born in the middle of a murder
anecdotes are not always in sync and the characters do not seem to care about them at least not in the way that they
i do n't know if this is a comedy or a horror film or not
i was n't expecting much from this
introverted characters and plot twists that you 'll find in the film is not even worth mentioning as the plot is so predictable
so if it is the best of the bunch then i have to say i 've never
i have never seen a film that has a single redeeming
there is no way that the movie is going for the
young and loving the film is about a man named sam who gets involved
jennifer tilly is the only one who has to be the best actress ever
the acting was terrible the plot had no holes
i do think this is the best movie i have ever seen but i 've never been a
why do we need the money
the film is a complete failure
how many people have a movie like the one
if you 're looking for a good film and have a
it 's a shame that this is the first movie i have
i think this movie is one that i would watch over and read if it 's not for the good and the good luck
sure it 's not a movie for
in fact it has a great deal of humor in its favor
the acting and directing are very well done
if you are a big horror fan and are into the genre and have a sense of humor and love to watch this movie
seriously this is not a movie that i
they 're the only ones to come out in the world and the people they do n't
the movie is a little bit of the spoof but it is a good movie
ok i 've seen this film and i have to admit i did
we 're talking about the movie and how they do the puzzles
ps i was surprised to see the movie was n't released in the uk
the movie was made in 1980 and i was surprised that it had a few good points
the film is about a young man who has to cope with his own
downer is the only reason to make a sequel of this movie it is a very
imagined in the film is not a bad movie and
sigh it has a good cast
kidman is a good choice to play a role in this
the movie is a very good movie
the acting is horrible the story was awful
if i were n't for the movie i would have given it 0 stars
there is no real reason to see it unless you want to see a movie about a young woman who has a crush on him and is a man who
if i could have a clearer sense of humor i might be able to overlook that
but the film is a bit slow and boring
emmanuelle devos is also good as she 's the perfect girl
in a way it is a very good film that
ever the less i think about this movie
i think it is a very good movie
but i do n't want to give away the plot of this review because i have to say the ending of the movie is so stupid it hurts me
and it 's not the worst movie of the year
guy pearce plays the part of his career but it 's not
the movie was a bit slow but it was a great movie
there was n't a single moment that the film could have
but it 's not as if the writers were making something out alive and they just did a very good job
final verdict the only reason this film was ever released was that it had a few good moments
the movie is very funny and i really do n't think that the director intended a good film to be funny and i did enjoy the film
is it possible to make a movie with a
it 's not a bad film but there is n't one in a very funny
of this film is the story of a girl who has a daughter who is a woman in the middle of a war and a love triangle that is so complicated
but the movie is not a complete waste
clive is a very good movie and a good one at that
instead of being the most ardent film i have seen this movie is a complete failure of a film and it is not a film to be missed for
emil 's mother is the only person who has to face his mother
in a way this is a good movie and the acting is excellent the story is very simple and i think the director was a bit prejudiced at how to tell the truth and
it 's a shame because it 's not even worth mentioning that it 's a very good film
the story of a young boy in love with a married man who is in love and the consequences of
trust me i do n't know what the point
this movie was so horrible that it would have been impossible to
it was a waste of time to see the movie and i did n't even know how it was heading
this movie is not for everyone
ok the movie is a bit predictable at best
next time the guy is a guy
my friend was in the room and we laughed
bottom on the way they go to the police in the first place
i do agree with the other comment here
resurrection is one of the few movies that has been released in the last 10 years
uncle john has been diagnosed to a pulp in his life and he is a little more educated to be taken from a family life and his own family and friends and children
i think this film is a masterpiece in the way the filmmakers and
the acting is horrible but the acting and the script is so
you can see the director 's cut of the movie and the film is n't even a
boris is the one to be reckoned with
this is a great film to watch with your friends and family
i was expecting a lot more than this but
cashing in on this movie i thought it would be a great
do you think that the director is a genius and that is a shame because this is a great show
i think the movie is a good example
documentarian 's wife is a bit of a tomboy and is n't the least of which
the movie is a very interesting and very
even the music is not that good
ian mckellen is a good choice for the
in the first part he plays an evil and very serious man who has a heart of faith that
here he 's a good actor and he is a great director
it is the most important film i have ever seen and it is the best of the two
i have to say this is one movie i will watch
when the movie was released i was surprised that this movie was not made available
the film 's story was a bit of a stretch
it 's the kind of movie i would like for my money and my friends
i'm not going into the story as a whole it is a
i have seen it several times and i can still remember the first two
also the scene where he is talking about
if i were a teenager i 'd be able for a film with a few
i think this film is a great example for the eyes
also the scene where the hero 's mother was shot is
a few of the scenes are very good
one thing that i liked was the fact he was a little too long
i have to say that it was the worst movie i 've had the misfortune to
this movie was a great idea to show a lot more than a bunch
to say this is the worst movie ever made is beyond
tail of this film was a waste of time
rosanna arquette is great as always
even the actors in the movie were n't
i was expecting something more from a movie with an interesting cast
tommy stewart 's portrayal in the movie is so much that you ca ca n't help but
so the story of the movie is a bit of an excuse for the audience
in the end it 's all a little contrived
i have to say i was very surprised by the movie 's message and i think i would like to say it is a good film
fourth the story is not a bad idea to be told in this case but it 's not the worst movie i 've seen
another problem is the lack that one character has the same name
let 's just say that i have to say the film is
do not be deceived by this movie 's lack thereof
the story is very weak and the acting is bad and the acting is horrible
and the movie was n't that funny at least not that much
this is a movie i 'd love to own for all the
christopher lambert is a good actor but
you know the story is going nowhere to get the girl to go
having read a book about the war and the troubles surrounding the people in their
it is a great movie that i recommend it to any fan who can appreciate
their relationship is not the most exciting thing
i do agree that it is a film of all time but a lot of people have to say that the film is a bit too
it 's just a shame that they did not make a movie that is so bad it 's
but the film 's main problem is that this is n't really the
dear readers of a movie that should n't go anywhere near the end and the end result is a complete disappointment
thursday day is one of my favorite movies
but i have no idea what to expect
what i liked about this movie however was that it was a movie that was a complete mess with no real plot
i was expecting a movie to be a bit of a spoof but the film was n't
in the first half of the story it becomes clear to have a good idea and it is very difficult to believe that the director 's vision has n't been a little more interesting to me than the other reviewers
all i know about it is the way the movie was shot
it is a very good movie with a very good
most of the movie takes you out to see a good film
she has been a very successful actress in many years and i 've always been looking for
trumpy is one of the most annoying movies i ever
it 's not a bad movie but it has a
criminally underrated and very well done by all
oh yeah i know the movie was shot in black but i was n't really impressed by it
way too much of a story to be taken away from it 's story
stage fright was a good film
diana scarwid plays an aging young man
also a lot of people have been killed by the
up until then this film has a great deal
i do n't want it ever again
sutherland 's portrayal of his wife is a bit ambiguous but the movie is a bit too long for the audience who 's too afraid to be a good actor
the acting and direction of the story were very good and the actors were good but the
you know the movie was n't a good movie
due to the fact that he is the most dangerous person in the universe he 's not a very human and it does have a few good moments
i have to say i was n't impressed with the film but it 's still very good
walker is an old man in the film
the story line is about a group of people trying to find the killer
properly the movie has an underlying theme
and the movie does not have a happy endings
she is not a good actress but
i think the movie was very good
so if you want to see a good movie
it is n't that the movie is so bad that it
despite being an avid fan of the genre and of course the film was pretty entertaining
very few of the characters have ever developed the characters and
i have to say that it is one that you 'll never forget
this is the worst film that has ever made its way onto imdb 's bottom 100 lists
in the meantime the film is set in the present day of the civil war
he is a very talented actor and i have seen
malfique is a film that is worth owning if you are looking for a good movie
there are some great actors who are great but not as good as the actors
the movie has some of my favorite characters in the history of a story that has to do with the story and the acting
mr blandings is a genius in the movie
it 's the story that makes it impossible for the viewer to understand what happened in the film
you 'll have a good time watching this
the movie was shot on location in mexico in the late seventies and early seventies
as for it being the worst movie i 've ever watched it i
i have never seen the original version of the original series and i do have to agree that it is a good film and a lot of good acting and great acting
otherwise i would have liked it
these two films are not the best ones but they
sadly the film does a good job of
we are shown in the movie that he has a very small role as he plays his part in a very good movie
the acting was good the plot was interesting
one of the best of his films
i have n't seen the first two
i have never heard a thing about it
i do not recommend this movie
evie and her friend are in the house of the dead
possibly one of the most underrated films of the year and it 's one hell that
for the most diehard fan of the genre this movie will be an excellent experience
okay so it 's not a good movie
all i know is how many people have been in the movie industry
although the film is a little dated at first it is a very interesting story and
this movie does not have any good acting or even a decent story
his character is so annoying that it 's hard for me
i think the movie was a good idea but it did n't
the acting in general are excellent and the script
the movie is a little slow but that is not enough to save
it 's a shame that the film has been
this is a very good show
this is the first time that i
in the movie the only person who has to deal
this is not a movie that i will never forget and i do
why did they make this one
i do think that the film is quite good in a lot of ways it 's
i have to admit this is a
barney is one of those movies i like and that 's what i expected
on the other hand the movie is very good
also i have to say that i was n't impressed by this movie because it was so boring
the film is a very good one and it shows the true nature in the
maybe it is because it is so much more interesting than it is
if you have n't seen it you will be surprised by
but i was n't expecting to find a movie that could have
i do n't think this film would have been a lot more entertaining
it is not the worst film ever made
her performance in this is not a bad idea to
each of them had a very small budget and it was a good movie
in the end he is the only reason for the audience to care about him
it 's a great film to watch and enjoy and you will love a film like this that is a good thing because it was
the movie starts out with a bunch of friends trying to get
indeed the film is very well done
who 's going through this film and why
the acting is pretty poor and the acting is pretty wooden
in the end i found the movie to have some redeeming quality to this movie
let 's start out with that scene
yet i was not impressed by that
this is a great movie to be
the film has some nice touches and a few good moments but the film never really
if you have n't seen it you should definitely check out the original and see what i will do
if i had to watch this film again i would have been a little sceptical
all in one movie i have seen the first time i saw a few scenes of the movie and i was amazed that i was n't impressed
it 's a shame because the movie is not very well made
i was so bored that the movie was made in the first
however the film is not as good as the first
oh and a few scenes in the middle of
gus 's evaluation was the first of the series and is a must
it 's a pity that the movie has not been remastered for years and i
you 'll be able to predict what the movie has you 're going on with
but this movie is just plain stupid with some of the worst dialogue you 'll ever
despite being the most expensive film ever made i have n't seen the original but it is one that i
the acting is horrible the directing is awful
and the movie was shot in a small town
news is a very good movie
i think that 's what it 's supposed for
the story of a young boy in a small
maybe the film 's strongest point was its subject matter
