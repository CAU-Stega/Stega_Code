i do think it 's one of the funniest comedies
an old friend of a wealthy family is a young man
this is a great movie for those who like good movies and bad acting and bad
just do yourself and do n't waste your entire life
will smith and the rest of this movie are all so bad they 're
the story line has been told in a way by a few of its characters
a lot of things are happening in other countries
the acting is good and the script is a good mix of action comedy comedy and romance drama
although i was n't impressed by this show and the plot it is very well
he has a great deal to do but he 's not a good actor either he 's a good man but his character is so
i was so disappointed with the movie
the movie was a little slow but i did n't think it 's really bad
on the other the film has the most memorable scenes ever filmed in film and in a very stylish scene where one of them is in the street and another scene is
the movie was n't a complete waste of time
when i saw it on tv and was hooked i thought i 'd give up
this is the first time you see this movie
or maybe he 's a little too much of
from the first few frames of this film i felt the need to give
and i do n't want to spoil it
while the film is not as good and the story line it 's still a little too weak to be a serious movie and the film does a good enough job
please do n't waste your life with this one
that 's a shame since i have never seen a film like this
no matter what the characters were supposed or they are not supposed as
but the film 's only redeeming feature was the cinematography
generally the plot was a lot better and it
there are some funny moments in it but the movie does n't make a whole
what a wonderful and wonderful film
it 's a very funny movie and i would recommend it to all who
i have never seen a movie like it before
also i think the film is very well written directed and written
i do think it is a very funny movie and a good movie
mastroianni 's character was not as funny as he was in the first
same as a man with a beard and a beard
the film is not about the war or how it is about the war but about a man who 's been trying to get away with it
the story was n't too bad
but the film is n't as good
seven years ago i have been watching it on dvd and i have been waiting for it to
amusingly the movie is a little slow
sure it 's not a great idea to call it a
the movie was a little over a decade but it 's not a movie that i would recommend it to
but the story was n't that good and the acting was n't
oh and the ending is a bit abrupt
it 's just a bunch that you can get a kick out from the beginning with the end of the movie
it 's a shame because it is so much fun to have fun with it and it 's not even worth the time of it
so i have a feeling of disgust and sorrow that i have not seen in the past
the acting is good and the story is very well done
despite the fact that this movie is based in the book by james stewart
when he is a girl in his apartment he 's a teenager
i have to say that it is one hell i 've been waiting for
it is n't even the same thing that i did like
but i think that the movie has a lot of problems with the story and characters that have been made
i think that this movie has been made in my estimation
the acting and script are so poor it 's almost
dr jacques mankiewicz 's novel of this film
but this movie has a very low budget and is n't really
to me this was a very good movie and a great movie
if you want to watch something else you should definitely check this out
i have to wonder if the movie was meant by an older man
the film is not a comedy but it is a great piece
she is a great actor and i think she
there was a lot to be desired in this movie
what is the difference between this and
what 's the point of this film it has the most
i was n't sure why it was so good to watch
in the end he is a very good person
ricco 's character was not so funny
anyway i do n't think it is that bad
but the real thing is this story is about a group who go to a remote island where the world is ruled
every time i see it i can only conclude the movie was made
he was the most likable person in hollywood 's golden age of his time and the only reason i watched it
what 's more interesting was that it 's so hard
not only is he a great actress he also has a very good performance and is a very
it 's a very good film
it was n't that bad but the acting was n't as good
the movie was a little slow
however the film is a bit long and
well the first thing i noticed about this movie was its title song
with all the faults of the original film the film is n't really about anything
the film is about as good and not as good
i do n't think that it would make much difference to the movie and i think it would make a great
what 's the point of the story of this movie is that
this is a great movie for everyone who loves a little bit of
it 's the story of two friends of mine
the film is a complete failure
also i have a feeling that the director should
from the first few scenes of the movie the film wraps up and ends up being a very satisfying film with the same theme as the first film
if the story is not bad it 's not that good
this is a movie that should be seen by all ages of a lifetime
timothy spall was great as a woman who was married to the other woman and she was a bit too old for the
the movie is a little too short
they are both funny and funny and are n't funny anymore
connery 's character is so much more than he is
david carradine plays a man who is trying too much to save the life of his father and son who is a little more than a little more tolerant and a
plus it 's not a great film it 's not a bad movie either
whilst it 's not as good or better than that it still has the same effect on the whole
luckily the film is a complete waste of
the story of the story of the young girl is played out in
first the movie was a bit slow and boring and i could n't help
phoebe and her friend have been a bit
in the first film we see a young man who
that is the best thing about this movie and i do agree with other comments about it
she 's a very talented actress and she 's very sexy
that said the movie is a little over the top
with the exception of a few other actors who are not the best actors ever the
i have never been a huge austen
this movie was so awful it was almost unbearable
this is the best film i ever watched
so the movie is not about a woman who is attracted and the other is her father
the film is a complete mess
or maybe the movie would be a little better if it is not for a few laughs and it 's not a comedy
part 2 is an excellent film
she was so good in her performance that i was
from this point on the movie goes nowhere and the characters are not believable
michael ironside is the perfect choice to play a man who has a good time and is a very likable person in his own way but he
i was surprised that i wasted my money and time on this movie
and i was surprised at the end of this movie
cartman is not a very good character
my advice is do not rent the dvd
do n't worry to see this movie if it
it 's not a bad movie but
compelled to watch the film for its entirety
let it all unfold the story is about a young girl and
this movie is a great example of a great movie
to me this was a pretty good idea
the acting was horrible the story was awful the dialogue is bad the dialogue is
insights to make it look like a documentary about a bunch of people who were n't a big city war star
keira farrow is the only one to get
i was expecting something like this but this is n't
no one can replace him for a good performance but he has a great voice
what 's the purpose to the story line and the plot twists
it 's a shame the movie is still a success of a movie
then the two meet up and then they 're forced to kill the girl
definitely the worst horror movie i 've
the movie is not a comedy but the characters in this movie are very funny
in the first half of this movie i was n't sure if it
in the end i was hoping that it would be good and i could n't wait for it next to a sequel
but the film has the same effect on the whole thing as it 's
like a lot to the movie it is not a movie
unless you 're an avid viewer who enjoys the original and you have a great time with this film you 'll love it as much
however this is a film about two different characters that make the film
they 're just as good as a couple of scenes that have
having said that i do have a lot of respect for it
but the movie was n't bad
it 's not that the acting is n't that terrible but the
however the movie is a little too long
pranks were not all that bad but
unfortunately i did n't think that it would
she 's not even a bad actress but she is a real treat and i think she has a very small part
yvonne is a very beautiful woman who is not afraid for a moment when her husband is a teenager in the middle
michael caine plays his character very convincingly
in a way it is a great movie to see and i will give it an
ford 's character was a bit too old for the role of john wayne
also the ending is so predictable and predictable that i could n't care about
it has the feel of a bad tv series but it was n't
this movie was not even funny
however it 's not the best movie ever made and the only good one was the
yeah it 's all about a bunch of girls and
she is also the best thing about the movie
but it 's not as bad as some say
wolf and his mate are a group and have been sent
damon is the only actor who has ever played his role in this movie
if you are not a big fan of the book then you will love this one
and the acting in the first half was pretty good
scarlett johansson is a great actress and she 's very good in the role but the
some people say that this is a bad film it
the film is a very good film
in fact it 's the best of it
this movie is so awful i ca
i have seen it several many times already and have never heard of this film until i saw it
they are both very attractive but the
eleanor parker is a fine director
can you imagine the film as a comedy and a comedy it 's
the film 's story is a very interesting one which is a little too much
the acting is pretty good and the story is very good
80 's movie is a great movie
we get a lot of the same shots of a young man being transported to the prison in
valjean 's father is the son of a man named seita who 's
5 the story is not very good
the movie starts off with a bunch and a bunch and a bunch in their car
with all the shortcomings of the movie the acting in this is not bad but not bad enough that the movie
there was no real chemistry in the story
at least it 's not a total loss
the acting is pretty good and the script is a good idea
i'm not a prude but it does have
bad acting bad script bad acting and bad direction
just a little bit of fun
hitchcock 's film is a great film for all ages
4 the story is a complete mess of mine
not only is it the best movie i ever saw it
okay so i was n't expecting much from it
once the movie starts you realize the whole time around the corner of a movie and the movie itself
you 'll have a good idea of this movie
scott 's character in the movie does n't seem like
when he gets a job of his job and is sent to the police to get the job to be the police detective the cop is the suspect
i think it 's a great film to see
and i do n't think that this film was
or is he trying to get away from the world or the evil that he is
wake in mind you 're a little
this is a great movie for the family to enjoy
i do not want my kids to watch a movie like the ones in
what 's with all those white hats
hera green was a great movie that was n't afraid
it 's a shame because the movie
the film is a bit slow at best
if you 're a fan like the one i 've seen you 'll probably enjoy this one
thinking about it i would say the movie was pretty funny
examples include the scene with a man who 's a witch
i think the film has a lot of fun and the
both of them have a very funny
funny how the movie is made to look like a
he is a great director who has done a great work of art
there 's a lot to like here
alberto is an old man who has a
however i do n't understand how the
we 're not talking like we 're supposed the answers
on the other hand the movie 's plot
one can see that there are people out to be in charge of the plot and the
it was n't a movie that i would n't have seen it
ted is not only the best of the two but the film does have some funny bits but the movie is just plain awful in every aspect and in every way
closed up and i have to say the acting in my first film is a bit over
our heroes are the only ones who have been in the business for their past and their lives are still very well done
it has a good plot good characters and good actors
see it for a good laugh
i think that this film has a very low rating but it was so good it
i was so excited when i saw that this was made and the movie was released on video in the us and
this movie is one of the best of the
i was surprised that i had to write a comment to the movie
ginger is not a good actress but she is very good in her role
but the film is a little too long
then i realized it was the worst movie ever
he has a great sense of timing and a lot
it has a great deal of action and a few twists and turns
at least the actors in this movie are able in a movie like
there 's also a very funny cameo
the film has a few moments of humor and it is a bit of an
the story line was a bit farfetched at times
bring the movie down to a point where it 's not the worst movie ever but it has a lot to say
the movie is a bit of an insult
just do n't waste your money or your time
plus the film 's plot is a bit thin and predictable
what is the purpose of this film
it 's just a shame because it was n't a great film
i think the film was very good
i do n't think that a single person who has ever seen this film has anything to complain about is
and that 's why the film is so good that it 's hard for me as i did n't know what to
ok i do n't know what to call the movie
the film has a lot going for it
this is a great movie for all the good reasons it is
i do n't know how this movie could have been made but it was a great
starting in a very funny way
for the first time i have to say that i 've seen the movie dozens of
everyone in it 's life must have been desperate to go
the acting is horrible the story is awful and it is n't funny
at least i have a few lines that are not so funny and so stupid
some scenes were so bad they were good
other than that it is a great show for adults who
if you are a diehard collector of horror films and you 're a fan like
other reviewers have commented on this film
another example of how to be a classic
in the end it 's not the best of the genre and the film is n't even that great
the film is a bit slow but it does not matter
helen mirren is the perfect choice for her role
sometimes the plot is so stupid that it becomes laughable but it 's not
in fact it was a great movie
that 's why i did n't like that
this movie has a very good cast and i have seen many many other movies
elizabeth shue plays an actress who is in the wrong of
the movie is very slow moving but it 's not that great either and it has to be
why do we need this elvis' to make a movie about the evils
if i had n't been in the mood to see the preview of this movie i would 've had it on my dvd
however i do n't think that a movie that can be so
i think it is an important point to the film and the film is not for all tastes but
throw it all together and it 's a
lori is a great actress and she 's great in this movie and i have to admit she was a great actor
i think that the director should 've been a little better if the director and writer had a more coherent script
in the end i was surprised to find myself in
alec guinness is a great director
a very good story about an obsessive and honorable relationship
sorry to be fair i do commend you for this movie but
i think the film was a little bit more than a typical example of what a
i was expecting this film from a similar standpoint and the acting was pretty
in the first half of this movie the characters
and it was a bit of a shame
each episode features the same plot as the original series
like i said the acting in this movie was horrible
but the film 's plot was n't that great
a few of the actors are good but the script
im sure the director had a sense of humour and i was n't impressed by the film
oh and a few times the film was shot with the same sound
anyone who thinks the film has an agenda to say that this movie should not be made is a must
anyway this is a very bad movie
material was a big hit for me and the film has been released on
so if you 're not a fan of either of them you
there is also a very good amount of suspense
there was a lot to this show
it is a great film to watch for the whole family
could n't they just have done it
the movie starts out with a couple of
the acting is good the writing and directing are good the directing is good but the
the movie has the same plot as the first movie which has the same plot as the original but it is still a good movie
i do n't understand the ending but it 's
i think this movie is a masterpiece for all of the above mentioned
it was the most expensive film i 've seen
the acting was horrible the directing horrible and
this film is one of the best
i think this is a great movie to be watched
the movie was shot on a shoestring in the desert
i think that 's the only way to
and the acting in this movie is horrible
in the end i did n't care for her but she was a little over her top as a child in a very small role as the main mother and the mother who was a bit
pitching a few of his best movies i have seen this one
since the film is set to a new level of
it has the most interesting characters i have come to associate on the screen
and the film is a bit slow
since the first film is a bit slow paced it is a very slow paced and very boring film
no wonder that the movie has a lot to be desired to me
now this film is n't for me but the film does have a good cast that includes all
if you 're looking for the real thing you will find this film entertaining and enjoyable to see and it 's
the story is about the lives and tribulations of
roman polanski 's the great depression of a film is a masterpiece of its own
this movie is not a bad movie it just is n't good
the acting is good with the exception that the movie is a little too much for me to be a fan and
robert downey sr plays the lead as a
karen and her boyfriend are not the least bit
a very interesting film that is not just about as bad as it is a film
the movie is a very interesting one
after the death of a young man he 's been crucified by his wife who is a bit of a jerk but
it 's not even the worst of any movie
i was expecting something like that in
like the other reviewer i 've read that the movie was made for a
and the movie does not have to be made
the film has some nice moments but it 's
only a couple of people have seen this movie in the first ten minutes or two
alert to a lot more than a few years ago i have seen the movie
i was so excited to find this movie in the theater
i have seen the film several many times and i have seen the
but this is the only time that the director
twins do not get to the point of being
five years later she has been a little more of the same
young woman is a very attractive and very young girl in the movie
not only was the plot very interesting it was just the story of a young girl who moves in and out of
from the beginning of the movie i was really bored
ms de havilland is excellent as a woman in her early thirties in
saif khan plays a young man who
the movie starts with a bang
you have n't heard about the plot but the acting is good the
fled from the bank and the two men in the film are also a very interesting one
so what i did n't know is that the movie has a very good cast and i think
izo is an excellent film with a lot of action scenes and a lot more action
i have never been to a film before that even the worst
remade by a group of young people in the same predicament as a child and his family is a bit of the same for his mother
this is not a movie that you should n't have
if the movie had been made in a hurry i would n't have to say that this was one bad bad movie
but the film is n't so bad it 's
the film 's plot revolves around a
it was the first time we saw it on television that i had a lot to watch
for a while it 's a very good movie with the best
walking in the woods and a few of the other actors in it are a bunch of people that are n't in any danger
they are the only one who 's been a member of the team and that the only ones in which the
yes it 's an excellent film and i will give you a chance to
and it 's not a movie
colonel 's daughter has a onenight life and she is a little bit too
which i believe is a very good movie but it does n't
i was so impressed with the film and its story
the movie is about the power to heal a young man who is the one who gets a job in a life that is not so much more
but this is a film that is n't worth renting for any laughs
day and night is a film that should have had a bigger impact
your only complaint with this one are the bad guys
as a result the movie has some of its own problems
while the film is n't as good at all it was a good idea for a good thriller
the film has some nice shots and some good performances but not by any means of the greatness
this is a great show and i recommend you to
most people are not interested at this film because
but it 's still not as funny as the first one
avoid this movie at all costs
it 's just a shame to watch the entire movie
it 's the only reason i gave the movie 2 star
i have seen a number of movies that were made in my hometown but the
i think this is an interesting film that is a
the film has some good moments but it 's not
the story of an aging man who is in love
murphy 's acting was so bad that i wanted to vomit but i did laugh once
the film has a few good moments but overall
that was the only thing that made this so bad and that the movie was n't even
so i have to say i was n't expecting much from this movie as
she was the only person who was the only person who could n't act
with this film i could n't wait until the film 's release
yakima lewis is the only one to die in a long time to finish
the movie has a lot going from start to the very end
the story of the movie was so predictable and the characters were so unbelievable that you could n't care
overall the movie has a lot of potential
that 's why it is a film about an obsessive family
its a very good film and the acting is good but the script and the
even if you 're not the type you 've been looking for and will be a bit
it 's the story and it does n't seem that it 's
it has the same kind of thing as the first one
if the film is a comedy and the actors do n't have the ability to do it it is not
terence howard is a great choice
on the way he meets the girl and falls in his car
a lot more of a movie than a lot of
i was surprised by the way it was shot
the film is about a young boy 's quest and the family 's
interviews with people who are not in a movie like this one is just plain
it has to be one to watch if not for the fact
from there the film is a very long journey to the very end
despite its weaknesses it is a very moving story of the man who has a heart
humor was n't bad but it did not work at the box
you 'll have the same problem
it has the same kind of humor that it
in a nutshell the only thing you can do was make you think about the movie
i have to admit i have seen this show
classe tous risques is one that you
but the film is n't so bad
he 's a very good director who has created a film that has a good cast
the story of the movie was very interesting but i found
if i were to watch the movie again and again it
secondly it 's just not a movie for the
that 's the only reason to watch the
not only is the acting bad but the story line is so bad and so bad it
as the story unfolds you get the feeling that the characters are just
there 's a very nice twist at this point and the end is a bit unexpected as it 's not a surprise but it is n't a bad movie but it 's still
a very enjoyable movie with a great deal
unfortunately it 's not a bad film
i think it 's the worst movie i have watched
the story is a bit confusing but the story is n't too bad
highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good film with an excellent story
if the movie was n't for kids i 'd have a lot of fun watching it
there are some great performances and the movie 's plot twists are
he is a great actress and he does n't disappoint in any movie that is n't bad but
people are saying this is a good idea for an action thriller but it
the story of the film is about a young boy who lives in an isolated apartment where he is a young boy who 's
the movie is a complete failure
if you have seen the trailer for the movie it 's a very nice
the movie is about two young men who are living on their own
do you want a film that has some good actors
like a few other movies i 've seen this movie and the other two others have made a very good impression
of this movie is the fact that it has no plot and no action
filmed on the cheap in canada it was filmed in the us in mexico and the story
i was n't impressed when i saw the film
scenes are filmed in the background and the camera is shot on a stage screen
it is a shame that the film
this is not a movie that i would
aimed for a movie like this i have to admit i was not impressed by the
but the real problem with the show was
and the ending is just plain bad
nikita is a very good film
the story line of the movie is very interesting and it 's a shame
this is a very funny show
do n't waste any of your valuable bucks
the story of a young woman in the early age is a bit too complicated
back in time the film 's only redeeming quality was that it was not only directed for a few years but a film that deserved
no one is ever going for a movie to be a good movie but it is not for the squeamish
i think it 's not worth watching the movie for its
i think that the movie has a great deal of fun and it 's just not the best movie
the acting is pretty good with all involved
yes i have n't seen this film in a while but the movie
i was n't sure if this movie was a spoof
other people who are so fond of this movie are the ones who have to deal with the subject matter
one can only hope this is a film to make it to the big apple
the acting is good and the script is great but the script
fine film with great performances by the two stars but it is not
anyway this is one of those films where you can see the director 's intentions for the camera and lighting and lighting and lighting is so bad
the film is a very moving film with
we 're talking with the same characters as the rest
anybody who has seen this movie can appreciate it
light hearted is a film about the life and times of the
the acting in the movie was very good and the writing by the
while i do n't have a lot for a movie it has been a very good
as for the rest of this movie it 's not bad
i have never seen the movie so much
the film 's main flaw was to make a movie that 's not even worth
this movie is not even worth watching if you like to laugh at the stupidity
i have n't seen this movie in years and i still have n't
the movie has a very good cast and
but it 's a great film for a rainy day
the movie is a bit slow and drags over the edge but it 's
every character is a complete wimp and the
but this is a movie for all ages
there are some good scenes of dialogue and the movie
days later the girl is kidnapped and she decides to kill her
of all the cheech chong flicks that i saw the first three decades after this movie i was impressed by this
the movie is a bit slow but it is still a great movie
i think that this film should be viewed to be appreciated for all the good acting and the excellent actors and the direction was good
being a fan of horror movies and seeing the trailer of it is a great movie
this is the first movie that i 've seen so far
if you have a chance to see this movie do so it 's worth seeing
what is with the characters in the film which are so real that i could not help but sympathize to the
not that it was a great movie and it was
and i was impressed by this movie
i think that the director should have been proud of his own life and his own personal life and how it is in his
as for me it 's a shame to watch this kind of movie
izo has the power to be an entertaining and entertaining thriller with lots of twists and turns
it has a good cast and great performances
ms allen 's character is a little too unlikable to
thus i was expecting the worst to be seen and it
they 're the only one in the entire theater where their
the movie is not a comedy or a comedy
her performance is so good that she makes you want a movie to be made
i have seen a lot better movies than i can say and this is one where the film has a lot of good points and i really liked the movie
without the words that are being made in a movie like that i think it 's a very poor attempt at a film
as for me this was a very funny film and i would recommend it
especially the final confrontation between two men and their girlfriends
if you 're looking for a good horror movie with a
one day the girl finds a woman and her daughter
he has a lot of fun to work on and the
salsa was a big disappointment in the first season and the only
this is not a movie for everyone
and the film is a complete failure as it 's not a
with the exception that the movie was made in a few weeks it is
everything in between is so funny
the story is very simple and it 's very hard to believe that the director 's
this movie is one of many movies i can think
even the music is n't that good
match 3 is a great movie
if you have n't seen this you 'll like this movie and you 'll enjoy a great deal of the movie
these two men do a fine work of their own lives
other reviewers have commented on this film
her acting is a bit stilted but she is a great actor in
i was expecting a lot more than a few other horror movies and it was a great movie
if you 're not familiar to the genre this is a
however i have n't read a novel that was n't published in the same breath as the
the film is about two men in a different setting
this movie is a complete waste for me
following the film is a story that takes a lot of time to develop a story about a young man who is a teenager who is searching for his son
second the story is a bit confusing at first it seems like it was filmed on a cheap budget and the acting is bad
ms allen 's acting as she is in this movie is very good
i do not know why this movie was made
woody allen is a great director who has done a fantastic work of art and i 've been in
the story of a young girl and her mother
though it 's still very good it is still an excellent film
through all the hoopla and the fact that the movie is about as funny as the book and is n't a great movie it
there is no real reason that it 's not even a good movie but a very
i'm sure it is a movie that you
the acting is good with the exception from the actors and the actors
she 's a great actress but she is not a bad actress she is a good
the film was a waste on the big budget and it was n't
the film 's plot was a bit of the same but it did
the film was shot with a budget that would have made this film better
if i could find a way to make a film i 'd be
all in the name of it is the same
the movie was made in the early seventies but it was
the film is about a young girl who has to deal with her daughter 's problems with her family and her family and the way the mother treated
but this movie was n't bad enough
a very funny and very funny movie that
marky 's mother is a beautiful and very very very sweet movie
who would have liked this movie and would n't even have been a fan
however the film is a little too much for
but the film is n't a complete mess
or maybe the film was made for tv
this is a film for the ages of a young man
this is a very good film and i recommend it highly
the story is about a young girl who is a little bit too infatuated with a girl who is a teenager
whilst it is not as good or better than the original it has some good acting
a lot happens to be in this movie but it 's just a bit of a letdown
but the real problem was that the movie
someone who was n't a good guy
it 's not a bad film
in fact i have seen the movie twice
john wayne 's portrayal in the film is a little overdone
but it 's still not that bad
i do think that the acting was great
both films have a lot of good things going for it but the plot
it was the most expensive and funniest movie
we have to watch a film with a bunch of people who are so bored that they 're not funny
its the kind of thing you would want a movie about a group
the story of the film was very good but the characters were n't developed
the movie was n't even good enough to make a good impression of
it is a great movie that is so good that you can tell the
the acting is good and the script is very good but it 's
i do think this is the worst movie that i have seen in quite some long time but the movie has a very good plot and is
then the movie starts to drag
plagued the first half of the movie with a very good story and some good acting
i have to say i was n't expecting much from
indeed the movie has some of the
the story of a woman and his family are all in their own way manifest to each others and their relationship to each other in order
the story is a little weak but the characters are likable
beginning to a point of view and the film has the feel to it and it does
it is the best thing i have ever heard
another thing that is good about the film is the music which i thought it was a nice little diversion
either way the movie does a good job at
read this if only the first two are a little better than it
sure the film was n't too good
bad acting bad script and bad direction all around this movie
this film is one big disappointment
apparently this film is the worst of it
anyway this is a very good show
faith domergue and a woman in a dress
and the film is a complete bore to
a few years later she has been a big star for the role
this is a great movie for the entire family to watch and i recommend it to anyone that enjoys
of course the story is about a young man trying his life to be a hero
the film is about a young woman who has a boyfriend who is a little too old to live
for a long time i did n't know that it would be a great movie
but i think that the film 's biggest flaw is that it 's just a bit too long
then the story of a young boy
i do not think i 've ever seen a movie like the one in which the characters are portrayed in a movie
where did he get the idea to go
the acting was good but it was not the worst film ever
there is no real story here and there is n't much of a story
a few years later i saw this movie
he is a very good guy
snider is the best thing about it
after the first 15 years of the movie i was a teenager and it was so funny
watching a lot of the movies in this movie
it has the same kind of humor the first time around but that was n't the problem
when you 're watching this show you will feel that the film has a lot
two of the best films ever made in the history
garage wrecks has a good story and some good acting
what 's the point in this movie
one of them is an actor who plays the lead role
if you 're looking to watch a film that is a bit of a letdown then you will enjoy this
the film was shot in color in the early 90 's
they 're not the best but they are all so good
jodhaa keitel is a good actor but he does a
another reason to watch it is the soundtrack and
and the film 's main theme is that it has the most memorable moments of the movie
she has a good job as a writer
another thing is that the movie was a bit too slow at all and the story was too confusing
besides the acting and the direction it 's not even a bad script
this was one of the most enjoyable and touching movies of the last century
no one has a chance to make the film and the film is not a complete
several times the characters are so stupid that i could n't care less
proving that he was not only the most successful person in the world he was a very good actor
all in this movie was made up of a couple of scenes that could have easily used a little bit
you know that it was n't the worst movie ever
this movie is a great film
just as you might have guessed the movie was a total waste
the film is a very interesting portrayal of the life of the great depression of the late 19th century
or is it a good movie that is n't
not only is he a bad movie but
at the time the film is made and its not a great deal it
this is a movie that you 'll
10 out 10 stars and that would be good
the acting is very good and the script is very good
yet it was n't a bad idea to show that it was n't a movie that could be made
as a result the movie does n't have a single redeeming
but i do n't think it 's really bad that the filmmakers did n't want to make it
the story of this story is about a young woman who moves into her apartment in a country
a very good movie and a good movie to view
do you want me for a movie with a good script
when the film finally gets the audience it 's the only thing that makes this
this is a very bad film
they have the same idea of a good guy and the girl that is
we have to watch it to see how the director managed in making a movie
luckily the film is n't really that bad
we have a bunch of young actors who are not a real person or a person who can act
leland 's father and son are the only
the film is about a group who have a relationship with
a good example was when the film 's first major flaw is the
throughout the movie you get a sense that he 's a little less interesting and the film
it has a good story line and good
the acting is good and there are lots of great scenes
the story is a simple mess
the film has some of the funniest lines i
avoid the plague like the movie
one day he meets a young boy who is in the middle and the two men are in their
paul rudd is excellent as the lead character and the supporting character
i was expecting this to happen and i could not help but think that the film was going for a very long time and then i realized it was n't going anywhere but i was wrong
charles bronson is the only actor who has ever been in the film business and is very funny
i do n't know why this film has so much hype
plot is not as simple as some
to be fair i have to say i was very impressed when i saw this film
unlike most of these films the story is very simple and it has a few moments to it
in fact the movie is very good and the characters and situations were so real
you have a great cast and you have a great cast that includes all the
a few scenes are very interesting and some of the dialogue in this movie was a bit corny but it was n't a good idea
it 's the story that makes the
i have n't been able in the us to find it
gant is the best actor ever
and that is the only part of the
let me start by saying that the acting was terrible
hardly ever since that the first one and that
as a fan of the original i was impressed by the acting
and the ending is so stupid that it 's hard
if you 're looking for a movie about an assassination mystery
it 's a shame that it has n't received a higher rating for me since i was in the mood for the best
i have to say that the story is a lot of times i
i have seen it many many many years ago
the story line is a bit confusing and the plot line seems contrived
the film is about a young girl who is sent by her father
no one could possibly be a good movie but it is
but it 's not a bad movie
there 's also an excellent scene where a man who is
michael ironside and christopher lloyd have a very small screen presence
the movie is not a good film
while i have to say i am still impressed with how the movie is going to end
this is a movie that is n't even a good film
i think the film was a little too ambitious for its own sake
if it was a movie about the evils of war and how it was done i
i do n't know how to describe this movie
the acting is good and i think the actors are great
in the end i did n't think i could ever see the movie
the film is a very funny film
the movie is a little over a few times
it is not that i would want my children but i have to admit
that is the only reason i can watch
it is the best film of all times
it was a waste for the movie
in a way this movie has no redeeming qualities
acting wise but it 's not a movie to be
i do n't know if i was a
before the movie is about to be discovered the plot develops into a series
luckily the movie 's plot is a bit
it was so bad i could n't believe that i was watching a movie
i'm not saying this is the worst film i 've had to endure and i 've seen the worst
this is a movie about the evils in life and it is about the struggle of a child
in the meantime of the war he 's a
i do n't want to spoil it for you to see it and you will be glad you 're going
though the film is a little bit too long for its own problems
if you are a big horror movie buff you 're going for a treat and then you will find yourself in
now i do not know what the director was thinking
while the plot is a little weak it still works well
i have never seen the first two but i do not think it 's the best
and the film is not so much in the way of the
also a lot more than a few scenes are
it has the feel that it 's trying to portray
after a while the story is about two young girls trying desperately at a time in the lives
days later the two are the same two guys who live together in a small
so i guess it was a good idea to make a film about the holocaust of the west
and it 's not a good movie
they are both the same and that is the case of the film
both are the same actors and the same is one of the
i'm not sure whether it 's a good thing
some people may think that they are making movies
i was so impressed by this movie that
douglas fairbanks is the most talented actor in hollywood history and the rest was just a
sadly the story of the movie is so bad and so bad that i
just like in other films it is a little bit too
this is the best movie of all times and it 's a shame because it is not
the film was shot in a very tight location and was shot with no digital
john wayne and his crew are a group of thieves who go on a mission for the war to be stolen and killed
the movie has the feel of an old school movie and it is a little bit of an attempt at a horror flick
says the film has a very good story and it is not just the story that makes you want the movie to end you will not
i'm not a big fan of movies but the story
this movie has no redeeming features to make
the film was very entertaining and it was a great film
it 's a pity to see a
the story of the movie revolves upon the two men who are searching for the missing love
jamie lee nelson is the only actor who
it was a very nice movie
but it 's not that great
more than a year later i was able to see the
i do agree with the other reviewers who say this is a great film
until i saw the preview for the dvd i saw the trailer and i thought it sounded pretty bad but i did n't have a clue of
i think that 's a good idea because the story is so
in the end it 's a very good movie and i think the reason i love this
very funny movie and a great movie
i do not think the movie is a masterpiece
can i say the acting is bad
for me the best part of the film are the ones that do n't have any real impact
when i watched it i thought it was a great idea and i liked this one
the story is simple but it 's still
unfortunately the film is so much more
i have never read any other comments about this movie and i have to agree
while the film was n't bad enough to be good enough to keep my interest i found myself wanting to be entertained
and the film has no real story
it has a lot of fun to it but it 's not
there is a lot to say here
in the first movie we get a lot of fun and some of them
then the two meet up in the end
it was a good idea to put it mildly
indeed this is a film that should be watched by a younger audience
at one time a group called an
dressler is a good character actress
even the most ardent franco fans have seen this
i was expecting something like this but i did n't think that the film was good or even good
i do agree with the comments here
creepshow 3 was the worst sequel ever
that 's a shame since the movie is n't
for a film about a young woman named wentworth who is a woman in a mental state she is a woman
this film does n't have the usual plot devices that were made
i was surprised to find that i had n't watched the movie for years
uma kristofferson plays the lead character in the book
and it is n't the worst movie ever made but the fact it 's so bad
i have to admit that this is one of the worst movies ever
i'm not going to spoil it
but it is n't a great film and the acting is so poor
i do n't know why i watched the
instead we got a movie about two young people who have been married to the same
c rated the movie a 1 out 10
it 's not the worst movie that has ever been made
the movie is very well made with some nice twists
indeed i think this is a great example to film
overall it 's an alright film
even the actors in the movie were very bad and they were all very bad
they 're all a bunch of people
even the music is n't very good
at least that was the case
there was no plot and the acting was n't very good but the acting was good and there is no real reason to watch it
son of the bitch is the first film to have a great
this is the first of the three films that the director and
no it was a great movie
anyway it is not a good movie
um this film is n't bad
i do n't know what to say when the
they 're just plain bad actors who do n't even try and make the film
on this one i think the movie has a lot
a lot happens in the film
for a film that is so bad that it 's almost impossible for the filmmakers to
you have a good idea for a movie
because of that it 's just another film that has a lot of action and it
the film has an excellent story line and good acting
this is the best part in the film and it does not matter to the viewer to the extent it is a movie
kate capshaw plays a young woman in a small town in france in london and
what 's the difference between this movie
too often i was n't expecting to see a lot
only to be rewarded with a few of those who have n't read a book about the film
the acting was n't bad either as it
okay so i have to say that this is a good family movie and it
on the whole the story is a little too thin and predictable
should n't you be able to suspend a belief
it 's a shame that such movies as these are not the same ones that are made in
it is not even that good
the acting was n't bad but the script was terrible at worst
because i have n't seen this movie in a long
i do n't understand what it is
what is more the story of a boy 's family who has a heart attack that is so simple and bizarre that you ca
the acting was good enough but not the best in the movie
whatever the movie has to offer the audience to think that the director
this was an interesting film and it would make a great
this was an awful movie that is so bad that i could only watch this show because i was a little skeptical at how bad it was
i have seen it several dozen times and i can still feel it is a great film
but the movie was n't that bad either
i was so impressed with that i was so excited
i have to say that i have n't read any other reviews but i do not know what i am trying
further the film is not about an american couple who have a relationship with each other
until then this is the first movie i 've ever seen that has been
see it if it comes to the us
me and my friend were watching this movie and it was one
the story is a complete disaster
with all the other actors in this film i think that this is the worst movie of 2008 and i 've seen a few
suitably it is a film about a group who have
or maybe it 's a good idea to show it to
it has a good story and good actors
as for me this is a very bad movie
in fact i would not have been surprised by the ending of the movie but it was n't that bad
this movie is a waste of money
nevertheless this is a very enjoyable movie with some good
you have n't got to watch this one and you wo as much
this is the worst film ever made
which is a good sign for a movie to be a good one
extra the acting is a disgrace to the movie
there is a lot more to this movie
it has the most memorable scene in history ever
thanks the cast of the original film
this was a very bad movie and i
daughter and son are a bit too much
i do agree that the film 's title is
i have never heard of this movie before i saw it on tv
well it 's a great film
this film was so bad that it would n't be made
it was a great show and i was really impressed by the
actually it is n't that bad
i think this is the best movie of the decade
the story of a young woman who marries a young woman
it 's a shame that the movie has not been made
it has the same kind that is n't a bad thing
but the film 's only redeeming quality is
but the film does not work as a documentary and as such it is
why does this movie not get any better
the story of the film is a very simple and original one
this is a film for the entire movie
but this movie does not work
there 's a bit more than a few scenes but it does n't
that 's why it has a very good story
just as the movie goes on and
with all this being done i can say i am a sucker for a film that has been made to make you feel like it was filmed on
now that i know i have seen this movie i am glad it
even the music and dancing were n't even good either and this was one that could have used a bit
i do n't want to spoil my own life but i
nice luck to see the movie is not only for the sake that it was but it
there is a reason for watching this movie
the story is very interesting and there are some interesting twists
he is a good guy but not a bad guy
so if it were not so good it was a little better then it is and it is not
the movie starts off with some good dialogue but is not
another thing that is good about the film are
i think the reason i did this was because i was n't a big
given the choice of the film the actors in the film are not even able to save this film
dudley moore plays the part with a very funny and understated performance that is a
well this is a good movie
totally devoid of anything remotely resembling a coherent plot and
not to say that i was n't impressed but the whole
you know that the film 's title is a bit more interesting
at one point the film is shot on a soundstage camera which is the only reason to watch this
all of the above mentioned the film 's plot was very good
it 's a very good movie
but i do n't think that 's the case with the movie it 's a bit
the movie was a bit slow but it was n't
and the acting is n't bad
it is a shame the film has n't been remastered on dvd or video release
this movie is a complete mess of a movie that is so boring that you ca only laugh out laughing once
if i were to rate this movie lower than i could have
10 out of 10 stars for it 's a great
every character is a stereotype and a complete moron with no redeeming features whatsoever and that 's not a bad thing in the end because
what i liked about the first film were the great
the film was shot in a very cheap and edited manner but the director was not able to tell the difference
the movie starts out with an old man walking through the streets and then disappears
that 's the only explanation that the movie does n't have to offer
i think this film is very good
i have n't been able to watch this movie again
a few years later i saw a preview of this on a sunday afternoon
then the movie starts to get worse and more
i have seen the movie multiple many times
he is a very talented director and i do n't know how he
i have seen this one a few years ago and i still remember it
mr blandings 's performance is very good
the story of the film was interesting and
but it was not a good film
in the first part the characters were not developed
while the plot was interesting enough it 's not even a movie that the director has made it to his own
nick is the only actor who can be played in
first off i was very disappointed in this movie but i think it 's not the same
but the film is a bit too much of an excuse to watch and it is not
still the film has its flaws
i was expecting a lot of this movie to be good but i was not prepared for a
the movie is a complete failure of a plot
i was expecting something like this and i could go back and finish
i do not know what to call the
it 's the only way to make a
and the ending was just plain stupid to listen to
the movie is a very bad movie
here 's the spoiler it is n't that bad
the acting and directing are horrible and the acting is bad
i have never heard a movie before i could n't get into the
about half of the movie consists of the characters being introduced to the
i think it 's not that i do
both of them have a very small part in their relationship
the story is simple enough but the acting was horrible and the plot is so weak and contrived
otherwise i would n't recommend this film
shocks are not the only thing that can happen to the viewer and the viewer is not a fan but i have to admit
from this point of view i found the story to the story of the film as a story about a young man and his wife who have to cope with a married man
but i was n't sure why
i think the movie is just as good as the other
oh yeah the movie is n't a bad movie
you have n't even been in my seat for a long time and it 's just that i ca all be a little
the acting was n't great but the actors were good and i was surprised to learn how to get the money
all i have to do is give this one an oscar
once again this is not the best of it
but it 's not a movie to be taken to a level where the
the movie was shot on a cheap budget
and that 's the only reason i did
through a few years of training and the most heinous of the world i still love this movie
it is n't the best movie ever
this film is not for everyone
the movie is very slow and boring at times but overall a good movie that you will not regret
the acting was horrible the plot was bad and the plot was stupid
this was a good movie for me but i do think that it was just too much for me
let 's just say that this film is
romantic comedy is the kind of comedy where a lot happens and the jokes and gags are just plain stupid
moments of dialogue were so bad i was laughing hysterically
practically every single one is just plain boring
watch it with the lights off
lines are delivered and the story is a bit of a bore but the ending of this film is just plain awful and the ending is just as stupid as
the story is a simple one but it does n't matter
the acting is pretty bad but the script and direction were horrible
and the acting in the film is pretty good but
i think that 's the reason why i gave the film a 2
there is no plot no story just a
i have to agree with the reviewer who say this film has a lot of potential to be made for it
blah blah blah is a very good movie
this is not a good movie
presumably the film has been released in dvd format as
this was one movie i was waiting for
i think it 's not a great movie
i was n't impressed by this film and i was expecting the worst movie i 've had to sit through
i think that the best of the series was a great idea of a new generation who is trying hard
well the film was n't bad enough to be a good horror thriller
sadly the story is so ridiculous that you 'll have no idea of what
she was a good actress and i think
my favorite scene is when she is talking
i do agree that the film 's main focus was on that level of the film and its
the film 's plot is a little
so the film is about the man and
another reason why this show was so
unfortunately the film 's plot is a
this is a very funny and funny film about how
his performance is the only one of his two films
it 's not the best movie i can
the film is a bit too much of an
she has a great deal in common with this one
clara is the only one who can get away with it because she has to go to a nearby school
410 rated r graphic violence for nudity
she is a very beautiful young lady who is not a
the story is simple and it 's not the same
but the movie is so bad that it 's actually funny watching a bad movie with bad dialogue
this is not a movie for everyone involved
by far this is a movie for all ages to be watched by all
there was no reason to watch this film
performances are excellent but they 're not very well done
it is n't the best movie that it is but the acting and
we have a very good cast and
there is a lot of action to be found in the movie
i have never been a fan and i was n't looking for this one but i was n't impressed
once in a while i was a bit skeptical
directed by john hughes and directed with flair to the camera it 's not a bad movie
the story is simple and the characters
i was surprised to see this film on the sundance film festival and
this movie is so bad it is funny
and the acting is so awful
we are shown that we do n't have the usual hollywood fare that we are used in for the first time and the next one is a little bit of an allout piece of fluff
the story is about the adventures that
if you have n't read this review you should see this movie if not the funniest
the acting in this one is very good
great movie for those of you who are
with a supposed budget of about the first
the film was very good and the actors were all very believable
and it is the most disturbing thing i can
the story is a little too convoluted for its own good but the acting is n't as
but it is a great movie that will
you can see this film on tv
after the first half of it it was n't even funny
later on he finds a bag in the middle and finds a new body
and it was a good idea to
i do n't understand why people would like this film
then the movie starts and ends with an interminably boring ending and the
the story is very good and there are
and it is a good thing that the film has
there 's a lot going on in it
it was n't that great but the acting was good and the story was great
kathy bates was the most beautiful actress i had ever witnessed and i have ever seen her in
jack frost was the first movie in a trilogy of this kind to be released on video and it was a great movie
if you have n't watched this movie you 're not sure what to expect from this film but you can tell that this is the only movie that has the guts to be a good movie and it has a great plot and great acting and a very good plot but the movie just does not work
this is one of them and i have n't even mentioned the name of this show and i think that
despite the fact that the movie is set in the same time the characters are very different from the book
i do think that it is a little too much for me to be able
i was n't expecting much of this
the acting in this movie sucks
unlike the previous two films this film is a complete failure
the film is a complete waste of time
the acting was horrible the directing is poor the editing is worse than a lot more
come in a few days to see the movie
we 're told that we are watching a documentary that is not as important as it is
the film is about the same people who are in the war and the us government and how the government is in their prime
for me the best part about this movie
i have never seen any other movies of this caliber that i have seen in quite a
the movie is a bit of a mess but it does n't have to be that much
it is the worst movie that i have ever watched
also a very nice film with the great cast
there is a scene where a young woman has sex in her bed and the camera pans up and her face
yeah this is the best i have seen
oddly the story is not about how the two are in war
besides the fact that the movie is a little slow paced with a few
this movie is a great movie to watch for
what a waste of money and talent
the film has a very good story and the actors and actresses are good but not
i do agree with those who have not heard the term and read that this is the same kind of film as in other films
the story is simple and is told in the most unexpected way possible
although i think the film has a very good cast i think the actors are really excellent especially timothy spall and john malkovich
how could they possibly have done a remake of a remake of this film and
the movie is about a young woman and the woman in a different place
the film 's story line was so predictable that it was difficult to believe it was actually
first of all the acting is horrible
i'm not sure if this film was meant for the kids
william powell is the only one who seems able to make this film worth
from this movie the story is a little thin and predictable at times
another thing i noticed was a bit of the movie 's ending
this is a movie for all ages
i'm not sure whether it 's a bad movie
or maybe it was a good movie for the first half
alongside a lot more of a story it 's not a bad movie but it does n't have a
if the movie does not have to do with the fact of it 's problems
nobody has to worry about this one
neve is the only character in which the movie has any depth
we have a very interesting story about how to make one 's life and a love triangle between the two
they are not the ones in the
what 's worse is that it 's not
the acting was terrible and the plot just did not work out
so i have to give this a 1 out
this is not an easy movie but it is a good movie
joe pesci is a good actor but he was not convincing at all and he did n't even
i was so bored by the movie and i was so disappointed by it that it was n't even funny and i was n't even entertained by the ending
all in all a great movie to watch with a group of friends
cleanliness is the only thing that makes
let me just say this is the most awful piece of crap ever
some scenes of the movie are just too much for me to handle
since it is a comedy it 's a very entertaining
i have n't read the book so it was
i do not want to spoil this film for
people who have seen it know that they
some scenes were just so funny
so what 's the point of this
this is one of the best of the
overall it 's pretty good and i
i was so impressed by the movie that i was so bored and confused that i had to register it to
if the director had to make the movie and he succeeded in creating an
this was a very bad attempt at comedy and the comedy is very funny but it 's still funny
dixon 's character is the only reason to see the film
i do not know if the movie would be good but it was just a waste of time
only the most rudimentary and interesting elements of the film are not present in the film
yes the acting is n't good and i 've seen a couple of good movies
his character is the best thing i can remember about it in the movie and it is a shame
after the movie was done it was just another film with a
i was surprised to see that this is the worst film i have ever had the displeasure
others do a disservice to the original
there 's a lot of action to be done
and it does n't work out as the movie is a bit of fun to sit
what is the deal with the film
so i have seen this movie
there was a lot to like about this film
i have seen it several many times before i have been hooked
do yourself a huge favour do n't waste your money
nope i was n't impressed by it
futuristic and the movie has a lot of potential
guess it 's a bad movie and a
it 's a great movie to see
she 's a great character actress
these are two of us who are the ones who are the best of our generation and that our lives can relate with our own
and the ending was so stupid that i had to turn it off
you know the drill was going nowhere but it
lloyd kaufman has a very good track of his own films
a very good movie and i would definitely advise you to stay awake and watch
the acting was n't as great but the script was so bad that it 's hard to make a good movie out of it
i think the director should be ashamed of himself
i was surprised to find that the movie was n't really about the
i think that the movie is not as great and it is the only one who
the acting was terrible the plot was awful but the actors did n't
consequently the story is not very good
perhaps the most famous part is that the characters were n't developed in the first movie and they had the
you can see this is a very good movie
some of the actors are very good
erika eleniak 's character is the best actress ever
but it 's just a good film
my advice to you is that you do not have to see the movie for yourself if it is n't for the good
these are the two main points of the film which are not even the most memorable
the story of a young boy who moves into a world of his past as an outcast is a bit farfetched
the story was n't bad enough
as for the rest of the cast i was impressed with their performance in the
and it 's a great movie
as a result the film is n't a bad movie but it is a good movie to watch and it is worth watching
demme was a master of his work
little did they know that they were the same person who had to do the same for
this movie has a lot to do with a lot of
on a positive note the cinematography is very beautiful
and it 's not that i do n't like the way the characters are portrayed but
where was this supposed to get in
the acting is horrible and the story is a complete disaster and i could n't help thinking it was a bad attempt to capitalize on a real story
as for this one i was surprised to see that this was a low budget film
really it 's a good film but not a good thing
in fact the whole thing has a very very bad ending
that is what this movie is
hitokiri is the best movie i have seen
whoever made this movie must 've been desperate for a good laugh
i do n't know if this is a good movie or a bad thing
it 's just a bunch that you can do a good job
they are the best in all of them
i was n't expecting much of it but it 's really really good
it is a shame that the movie is n't so good as the first one
really it does not have to have any real meaning
the movie starts with some of a good cast
haha i 've heard a lot of people saying that this is the funniest movie i have had the
anyone who has seen this should be ashamed of themselves for their work
how did this film ever end up in such
the movie is a complete failure and should
maybe he is n't a good person he is a
afterward this is a great film and
i'm glad i was able to find the soundtrack to be a good movie
cue a great cast and a very good movie that
in the end i was surprised to find that this film had
the movie was made in a hurry
on a positive side the acting was pretty good but the script by eric greene is
on the other hand i have to say that i
this movie does not make any sense at least not as bad a horror movie as
of course he does n't know it but it 's the same old same old
but it 's a good movie to watch if you 're a fan 's fan of the genre
for the first time in years the british revolution has been released in the united states in order to get the president of the world and the united states
unfortunately i have to say that it was a waste of time and money
it is a shame to see a good film like this with such a
i do not know why this is a movie for kids
strangely it is a movie that will make people laugh and cry
and it 's the best part of the film and it does
tweety 's father is a good guy who gets a
well this is a very good movie and a very good one at that
i do think that the director was trying too hard and
and that 's the problem with the movie
problem is that the movie is n't even a complete mess of its kind
occasionally i have to say this was one of the worst movies that have been released
the film has a lot of potential but i think the film was
winkler 's character is so unlikable it
as the story continues to unfold in its entirety we have a film about two sisters who
meg ryan plays the young girl who 's been married to a man who is
it 's not that it 's funny
st is a man who loves to kill a man who is a little bit too much of a jerk
i think the film has a lot of problems with this film
all in all this is a very bad film
intertwined in the story and the film is
now i have seen this movie
chuck norris is an excellent director who knows how he could do this
this movie has a lot to it but that 's all i can say about this one and
arau 's character was a little bit too
none of them were able to get a good idea
that was one reason why i did not
truthfully the film 's success is to get a bit more attention than the first one
the film 's premise is that a
if you 're a fan like the ones you 'll love this one is a
this movie is one big joke
but the story line is so weak that you ca only have to see the film to find out what happened
the movie has a lot more action and more action
the film 's main flaw of the movie is that it 's not even
i have n't seen the movie yet but i do not understand why
there 's also some nice cinematography and a nice atmosphere
do n't get fooled up by a movie like that you have
i do n't think i have ever seen such a bad film as i
shots of the film 's most controversial moment are not the best but a
towards the end when the movie is finally released i found myself cheering at the screen
i have to say that it was the first of the three films i watched
in the end the movie is just a bunch of bad actors who are trying too far too hard to get out
thankfully i do n't know why i did
that is what makes this film great
our hero and his friends are a bit of a loser
the film was made in the early 80 years of
finally it is not a film for the
the film is not about an american family
while i am not a fan and i can handle the film i do not
he was also the most convincing character of this entire movie
the acting and the script were terrible
the story of the movie is based solely around a young girl named sasha 's mother who is a teenager in a hospital
i was so disappointed when i saw it i thought i would give it a
though the film does contain a lot of the same themes and other things it 's
however the film is n't really a
i do n't know why i was n't watching
the movie is a little bit of the same for me and i have seen the movie
how can i not see this movie in the theater and
but it is a very enjoyable movie
however the film is not as bad as the original
in this case the film has the feel that is the real deal of this movie
ivan is the only one to be
a lot of the movie has a
the story is about an ordinary man and the woman who are searching in a marriage to a man who has to cope with his own death for her
my favorite scene is where the guy goes to the bathroom and then he 's talking to the guy who is the guy who
i think that the best way to describe this film
it was n't that bad it did n't make much of sense
it 's a pity that this movie is n't available on dvd or
quote the movie is a complete mess with a lot of plot holes
only the acting is n't good
his wife is the daughter of the
at least it has a good cast and some nice
the movie was n't bad but i was not
like the other two films i have seen in this genre and this one was very disappointing in my opinion
what i found most interesting about the film were the performances of the actors in the cast
set during the depression and so many people have been there to see the film
and the film does a good job of showing it to us and we 're not afraid of ourselves
the movie has a great story line and the characters were well developed and i loved
the film 's plot involves an aging woman who is a young girl in the world
the acting is good the script well written and the story really works very nicely and
was he trying to save his wife from being a good one and a bad
prot and his men are a little too much
for the record the movie was a bit slow but it was a bit too long for me
this is a very good movie
finally the movie is not so bad that it 's just too boring
from the first few minutes to the final scene of events and then to be resolved the film is a mess
i think this is a very funny and funny movie
flashbacks were n't very good but the actors were very well chosen
well i guess the only reason i gave
i think it 's the worst movie i 've had ever
denise richards 's character is a bit of an actress
the story is about a group of young adults living on a deserted island in london
but the movie was just a little bit too long and
i have to admit that i am very glad i did but i was wrong
could you have a better movie
he is the most beautiful person in this movie
she is a beautiful woman who is not the only one who can act and she 's not a good person but
i think this is a good movie
you can see that there is a difference to the original
a very interesting film about a young girl named jakob whose daughter and her sister are trying to cope and live in
instead of being an old school man we have the
he has a great sense to the world
the film is a complete mess of
stunningly funny is one that i would love
visually i was n't impressed by any movie
a very interesting film with great performances from
deniro plays a man who is a bit more subdued than his wife
the movie was a little too much
that 's the only reason this movie was ever released
the film is about a young boy who is sent into his family and his family to get his family together in a
those are the things that make a film such a classic and it
this film was a total disaster
the acting in all the actors in it is superb
there are some good points in it but the story is so weak that it is hard to believe
death bed 2 is a movie about the life of two
it was a waste for this film
we are shown to be a little bit of both
al pacino was great as a tough
a good cast is wasted in their own right
as i watched this film the only reason it was so good was because it was so boring it was so bad that it made the movie unwatchable and i
the acting is horrible the story is awful and i do have a problem that the director should not have
the acting is good the writing is great and the story lines are good enough
they are all very attractive and very sexy
i have never seen any of these movies in my
this film is not for everyone
the film 's story line and its execution are
i think that 's what i was hoping to see and i would recommend it to
i think it would have been a better film but the director was not
if you are looking for a good movie with a good plot good acting and a great storyline then you 're
the story of the movie revolves around the characters and how their lives
though this movie is a little too much like a typical hollywood
the film 's main character is a young man who is in
the movie is a little slow but i found the ending
the acting and direction are so bad it 's hard for me to laugh
i was n't expecting much from this film but i did n't think that it
i do agree that the film has a good
the story was so predictable i could n't care
danila is not a great movie
bruce dern 's character is a caricature
there is a lot of violence but it does n't make sense to
if it was a comedy it would be a lot more enjoyable to see
dr jacques feinstone 's character was the only reason
there are a lot better things in this movie
stevens is an excellent actor and is very convincing
i think this was a great film
no one is going to die but they are not
you know it 's not your typical runofthemill slasher movie with a lot to do with a plot line
but the film is a very good one
alison is not only a very nice actress
it 's the story of a woman 's quest to get rid of her husband who 's been kidnapped and killed by an accident
as the title suggests it 's an action movie
the acting is good with all the characters
your first reaction to the plot is that the characters were so stupid and uninteresting
well the story is n't too bad
what is the difference between these two movies and that is why
for a long time he is a very handsome
from the first episode i was hooked to this movie but i still have to give this movie a 1 out of 10
probably the only reason i did n't give a 1 is because the movie
and that is a shame because i was a little
acceptable to see him in the lead role
a good film that is a bit too long to watch and is worth a look
blair underwood is a good actor
well it has to be said that it 's not a great movie and it is very hard not
screen adaptations are the only good ones in the series
nevertheless i do think that the director and director should be commended for their work
another example of the classic film of the late 1960s when the two stooges and the marx 's were in
he is the one who 's the best of the
there are some very funny scenes
i was so disappointed when i saw this film that it was a very long and boring story
he is a good guy but not the best actor in this movie and
her performance was pretty bad and the plot was pretty predictable
not to mention the lack of a plot
but this is one movie you do not need to miss
well this is a good thing
all in all i was very impressed with the acting and acting
not a single solitary character or two of his own
2 the acting was n't bad either
take the scene with a woman and then a guy with her mouth and her body is n't
this is a very good movie
of course it does have a few moments but it has to do with
many scenes were so bad it could have
it 's a shame that this film
in the movie he 's a very talented man with the ability and his ability to get the right amount of attention and the way that he
he is the one that is the only one in the film who has to do
here 's where it belongs to this film
i think it was a very good movie
every time i watch it again i can say it 's not the worst i have ever watched but
the story is a simple and very interesting
the movie is a bit slow but it does n't matter that the story is not a little bit of a
while i am a huge john lennon fan i am very impressed with him
somewhere in this movie is the story of the same woman that is a little girl who has to
in the end it is a very good movie that is not just a vehicle but an excellent piece of art
after the movie was released i realized that this movie would make a good impression on a movie
make it a great movie for those with the patience to see the original and the movie is a great film
the film is very funny and it 's very well done and the performances by the
i think the movie is very good
i'm not going and the other actors are not the same
its the best movie that i have
interestingly it 's a very good movie and it was very entertaining in its own right and it would have helped
the movie is about a bunch that has a
answer the question why do i give up on the film
she was so good in it so well
how did this film get a theatrical
i do think this is a good movie
secondly it 's a shame that the film has been released on a cheap dvd and vhs
every character has their head examined
for those who are n't familiar in the history you 'll see that the
i think the reason for this is that the film is not a total failure but a very
i think this is one movie you should watch
in the end the movie has a very interesting story and the characters and the story lines make this a great experience for those who like to watch movies
had he not gone to jail to save it
scott bakula is the only reason i watched it till the last few years and i still remember that it is a great movie
if the director and his wife have a little more screen writing than they are then it 's not a great movie
it is a movie of the highest order
you can tell the story was a good idea and i was
i have n't laughed so many of the people i 've ever seen
this is a film that i recommend
whether you are the real fan or if the movie has a very funny plot it does n't make sense
and i think that the director was making a film
i do agree with the other reviewer who commented on the
it is a great story and i think it was one of the most memorable movies of
he is a man of honor and a great actor
johnny is a very talented actor but he 's a good actor
the acting was n't bad but the story line is pretty poor too
is that the only thing i can remember
all i could say were i was watching a movie that i could n't stand to watch
the story is very weak the acting was horrible the plot was ridiculous and it was n't funny at all and the acting was bad
in the first film he is in the movie and is a very good guy
he is a very good character actor but his acting is not very strong
this is a very good film and it is one of my favorites to the top ten
i was so disappointed that i was n't able in the
is the most annoying film ever to be released _EOS
my favorite scene is when the girl says that she was the best friend of the movie
he is a man who 's been a little over his head
anyone with a brain and a brain can relate to a character that is so stupid and annoying
he is the one who is the most powerful
the story is very simple and it is n't
it has to go to extremes
but the film has a lot of problems
the acting is pretty good and i have to admit that this film has the potential to become a classic
dixie and his friends are also the only ones to be able to find happiness in the movie 's story which is the story of a man who is a loner and
then there is that scene where he is
most people who have seen the original
beckett is a great actor but i think he should be more than just a movie
the film was shot on location in new mexico city and was filmed with the grainy
overall this is a great movie and it is definitely worth
the movie has some of the worst dialogue i have ever witnessed in a movie
willingly the plot is a bunch of people who go to a remote cabin where their friends live with their parents
with the exception of the first half and a little bit of the end it does have its charms but it 's not enough
carly and her friends are not as bad as they are
only the title would suggest that this film
the story line of course was the most exciting thing i 've ever
in the first movie the main characters have the most interesting character in
do n't be fooled to death in
for those who like the original the series will be a bit more fun to view than the original
my advice is to skip it from the rental store and rent it
let 's face it the story line is
the movie was made for tv and the
also i thought that the director and the
being a fan myself i have to agree that the film is a bit dated but the story and acting is
eccentricities were very good but they had to do with a
as the movie progresses it becomes a little more exciting
man 's angels is the worst movie ever
well it is a very good film and the actors are excellent but it is
i think that 's what this is supposed to mean
lost in the world of the devil 's rejects the movie was a little bit of a disappointment
a very good movie with a good cast and an excellent soundtrack by a very talented composer
you have to be kidding me
the movie starts out very good and then becomes a bit of an allout thriller
it is a very good movie and it is a great movie
it was a great movie and it had me laughing out
labor of love was an excellent film
should i be surprised that it has been released on a dvd for sale
the story is simple and the story is a complete bore but the movie itself is
you know the story is n't a bad
in the end it is not a bad idea for the viewer and to make sure they
the movie was a bit of a disappointment
now i do n't know why i was so impressed by what i saw
but the story of the movie has a very simple premise
yes the movie is n't bad but the acting is horrible the script sucks
the story is very interesting the characters are well written and well acted
uh this is the worst movie i have ever seen and it 's a shame that the film
it was so bad and so bad that it was actually a
you have to be kidding me
the movie is a little bit too slow
a good film that is not for the faint or the average viewer
the acting was terrible the plot was awful and it was n't even funny enough for the kids to
so i do n't think this is a good movie
those who have read the book should see the book
although i think it was one that i enjoyed
it was a very good movie and a great one at the same time
the film has a lot of good moments
a good example is the way the story of how the film was constructed
craft is a great film and i think the best thing about it is that it has the best music in the movie and it is the
it is not the worst thing i have ever
the acting is good and the direction was very good
it has the same kind to it that i 've seen in the first two
the story was n't that bad
the film is a very funny one
no matter what you do i can only hope
i was surprised to discover how the director managed this movie
the acting was n't great either and the script was so
it is a great movie and it is definitely not a movie for those who enjoy the
from there the movie is a bit of a mess but it 's not a movie that you can watch
worst of the worst movies i ever saw
the film is a little slow paced
no it is the worst film ever to be made
it has the most annoying character ever
as for me i have to agree with another reviewer that i have seen this film several many years ago on the
there are some funny moments but there was no plot line
hackman is a very bad guy who has n't seen any of these movies yet
the movie is a little bit boring and it 's not that good but the film does n't
those are the only reasons i watched this movie
one thing that i liked was the fact he did n't have a clue
you know that the film has a lot of action sequences and a lot
how many times can i say this
of course there are some very nice scenes but there was n't enough of
my favorite parts of the film include some very good actors and an amazing soundtrack
the movie is very well written
poor editing bad script poor acting and the whole thing was just plain stupid
shylock 's father and the other tenants of his family were killed and killed and killed
sex and nudity are not all that good
i do agree but i have a soft spot for the story of an american who was in love with the
if you want the real movie you 'll probably enjoy the film as it is the only way to watch it
other people have commented on how the movie is so bad that
there are a few things to say about this movie but the acting and direction of the movie were
aging in his first movie and he 's a very good actress and a good actress
also the ending was pretty stupid
let me tell the same story of a young girl named lena
here 's a few of the things that made the film a bit more tolerable and it was n't even that good
i have seen the movie several times and it is one of
bob hoskins 's performance is the best
first of course it has the same effect as the first one
i have seen this film several times and have been waiting to get my moneys back
unfortunately the script was not as bad as the original
while the film has some interesting elements it 's a little slow and boring at times
i was expecting a lot more than the movie
i think that the director was the only reason i wanted to see it and i would n't recommend the movie
if you are looking for a good movie to watch and watch a movie you will
the story is a simple one and a little bit of a stretch
sadness to the director is the director 's intent
in this case the film has a lot of action sequences
but the film is n't so much
this movie is a great movie for all generations
i think it 's a great idea
it was so funny to watch and i was n't bored with it
i was surprised by the fact of this one the only reason why i gave it a 2 was that it was made in the early 80 another
the movie is not a good movie but is n't bad
the story is very simple and it 's not that bad
they are the ones who have been trying hard to make a film that
sadly the movie is not so good it does n't make sense to the viewer
then the two of them start acknowledging that they do n't have the money they 're doing in this movie
yesterday i was looking to find a copy of this film
anyway it 's just not a good movie
it 's a shame that the film
the story is about an evil witch and his daughter and a woman who is trying at all times
but i was n't sure what to expect from the movie to get a hold on the plot
he is a very talented director and
unique characters are introduced in a way to show a real life and that 's what makes them so believable
the acting is horrible the plot is
this movie is not for people who like movies that do n't have to be so stupid
this is a film for the ages of all
the acting in the movie is so bad it hurts me
i have seen the movie twice and i can only say it is very
the story line is about the same thing as in
it 's a shame because the plot is so stupid and the characters seem stupid
this is not the worst film in the series
the story is about two women who are married in the same year of the same year and they find themselves in the middle
although i was n't really expecting much from this film i was n't impressed
james woods was a great actor
is it a good idea that it
i'm not a big fan of the genre but i think it was a great idea to make a movie that had
he was n't a good guy
all i could say is that i have a problem that is not
we 're supposed as if we are not going to be a
she is a very talented woman and she is
she is a great actress and she
lead by the great actor of a young demi moore
the movie has a lot to say and it is very well done
the film is a bit slow moving but it 's not the worst film i have seen
he 's just a bad guy
these are the kind that make this film worth seeing
and the movie has a lot to say
a good example is the scene where a man is talking about how the woman is going
any of those things are not so bad
i do not think the director should have made a sequel to it
the story is a little weak but the acting performances and the story line are excellent
i'm not a big fan but this movie was
i think this is a very bad movie and that it has a very good
that 's a shame because the story is n't that great and it does n't really make
it has a good premise and a very good cast
further the film is not a comedy but
it is a movie about how the media is treated to the us military
when i saw this i was expecting the same type of film as i had seen the first time i saw it
matter of fact it 's a bit too much to take a dive in time
that was the only reason i gave it a 2 because it has the best
if i were n't for a little of the first two thirds of my life i could not be more wrong about the story
this is the best movie that i ever saw in
his character has no depth and is not even remotely convincing
plus the ending was so stupid that i was laughing at the stupidity
terrible acting horrible script and bad directing and bad acting
is this a movie about the war
in the first movie the characters and the story were just a series
oh yeah it was a bad movie
i'm a fan like the other reviewers but i did not like it
there are some great moments in the film
antonio banderas is one that makes you feel like you 're watching a movie
i think this is the best movie that has made the movie to date and i think it 's one of the best movies i have ever watched and i have watched this movie every night
it 's a very good movie and the acting was excellent and there was
one thing that is wrong was the fact of that
it 's a very funny movie and the acting is great
there is nothing to be said about it
john huston was great too but i was n't sure what to do next
i was so bored when the movie ended
anybody who thinks this movie is a good movie should n't watch
it was a waste of time
michelle yeoh plays the part of her mother who was the one
with a supposed beard and an occasional amount more than an hour it 's still pretty good
first of all i was very impressed when
one of his most famous films is that it 's a
do n't worry about the acting
also the ending is a bit abrupt as the movie goes by
if you are not a fan of the book you 'll find this one
clincher the film is very well directed
i have n't read a lot of the other comments here but i do not think that it is the best film ever made and that 's what i would have done with the movie in the end it was a good film
robert duvall is also the best actor ever
anyway i do n't want you
the story is about two women living in an abandoned house
i was surprised to discover that the film 's
chris farley was the only one who had a decent time in the movie
this film is a must see for
the story is a little confusing but the acting was superb the story line is good enough so i can forgive the movie
when he 's not a big boy it 's a pity he has a lot more money than this
i have n't read the book so far
rich and beautiful the film is about a young girl who has been abused by his father and his son
as the title says it is not the greatest movie i can think i do
but i think it is a great show
all i could see in my opinion was that it was the best movie
you have the feeling you are watching
this film has a great cast and the actors and actresses are all
the acting in the other two films are pretty good too
obviously this is n't a good movie
i was n't sure whether it was the script or a combination between the characters or the
i have n't been so impressed
supposedly i do agree that the acting is bad and that 's
although the movie is about a group of young adults who live their way across
afterward it 's not a great movie but it 's a good one and worth
okay the movie was pretty good but the acting was terrible
this movie is a great film
i think the reason for the film 's message is the fact the story is not so much a drama as it is about the lives of the people who are in the movie
however the film 's biggest asset is that the director is not able to make
why is it so hard to make
for a film that is a little slow and drags
do yourself a favor avoid it at
the story is about an ordinary man who lives in the past
i do agree to give this a 2
the story is a little confusing
zombie bloodbath has some good points but the story is so predictable that it is almost
i was so impressed by the story and it
overall i give the show a 7 for being
for those interested in the subject matter and the idea of this film the story of how to make a movie with the
too many people have n't even seen this film
it was so bad and so horrible that i actually laughed once
if you 're a fan of hers or are interested in seeing the same movie you will probably like
maybe it is just me but the movie is not
we get an idea of what it 's like
this is the kind of film that makes it a mustsee
as i said the film is a bit slow at the end and it does not make much sense but the film is a very good one
silly movie with no redeeming quality whatsoever
a few scenes are very good
in the end the story is not very good
should have a more serious view of the subject
surprisingly enough this is the first movie that makes the viewer feel like a voyeur
i have to wonder why the producers did this so much
the film is very slow and it 's not even worth mentioning that i was n't impressed at all
pretty soon the movie starts out like the first movie
it is a movie that is n't even a comedy
then there 's the scene where the two boys go to their bedroom in the woods where they are talking
if you have not seen this film yet do not bother
what a great idea that is
this is a very bad show that should be seen by anyone looking at something that should be avoided
from the first scene the camera pans into an old building of
american pie is the worst film that is made of
one of the best movies i have had to endure this year
i do agree but it 's a good movie
as for it 's message the film is a bit too long
practically the entire film takes the first of its
in the first movie he was just the right man to be the one that he was
it is not that i do n't have the patience of a movie
it 's a very funny movie and the acting was excellent the directing is superb and there 's
instead it 's just a bunch of random characters who do n't know what to make of their
cable has to have a great deal
most of the actors are very good and it 's a shame that they did n't try
what 's with all the good points
liked the movie and i would say it is a great film for all ages
well the movie is a little too long for
instead of being a big budget movie this one is a complete mess of
haiku is a very bad movie
but the film 's only redeeming quality is the fact
the movie has a lot of action scenes but there 's a scene with a couple of guys running through some of the
an excellent film with excellent performances by both mcqueen
i think the director and director should not have made this movie at all
it 's a very good movie with a
that 's the only way i can think
on a side note the movie is about a young girl trying to get to the bottom line of her own life and is a little confused
i was n't sure what to expect when it was originally shown in my hometown but it was n't
the story was a bit confusing but it 's not that great either it 's a very good movie that i would
in the first film there is a lot of action
it 's just a bad film
it 's just a bad film
i do not recommend this movie to anybody who has n't
i have seen it three times
they 're the best thing about this movie and it
the movie is about a man who is in love with her
this movie is not for the squeamish or for those that are n't interested in seeing a good thriller
i do n't think that the actors were trying to portray a character that would
story line is a bit of the spoof but it is n't a bad
and the acting was so bad that i could barely care more about any of the characters or the actors
a very interesting movie and a great movie
this is a movie that should have been banned in a
think of it as the worst film in the world
he 's a very good director who has made a good film
those who are n't familiar in this film have a lot of fun with this one
from a technical point of view it 's not a movie to
john cusak is one of the most talented directors in cinema history
but i have no idea that the film was a real treat and it was not the best
a very good movie that is n't even funny
on this level it 's a very good movie with a lot more of a good script and a good cast
after a few minutes i was laughing hysterically hard
ballistic is one of the few movies that has a good plot and
from there onwards the film is not as bad
there 's also a good deal to be found here
it 's not a bad movie
but the film 's biggest problem was it had a lot more to it than the first two installments
every scene is the same as the first two films
the film is not only boring and boring and the acting is wooden
the film was a waste on the first two films
if it were to be shown on tv i 'd have given this movie a zero instead of the
hotel is a film that has no plot and is a very good movie
its a shame that it is n't available on
upon the arrival the movie begins with a group in the desert in the desert and the final battle between the three protagonists in the film
sam raimi 's direction is the best i 've ever
the movie starts off as a series of events and is
despite the fact that the film was made in color and
very little of that is the case of the film
ben stiller plays a character named sam and he is a bit of a jerk
anna paquin was the most convincing and beautiful woman i 've seen in years
i have n't been a fan for the past few years and i was n't impressed by the story
however i was not impressed by the movie and the movie was so boring that i was laughing hysterically
i think this movie is a masterpiece for those who
or even a little bit more than that
nevertheless it 's a very enjoyable and very entertaining movie with some very memorable scenes but it 's
apart from the fact that the story is about the characters the characters and their personalities are all over
what 's more the story is a simple one and one that is not
similar to that of the original and the original film
the story line of the movie is
i think that 's why i gave it 7 out there 10
robert montgomery as a young woman who has a onenight stand in a hotel and has a very small affair and a young man who has been in
some of the acting was horrible the story was weak
the movie was made by a bunch
i think that 's what this movie was about and i do n't think it was a bad film but it was n't bad
this is not the case with the film it is a very boring movie
instead the director is a master
even if it 's not a good movie to say the same
it is n't a good movie
pat morita was great as the villain and his character is very good and i think
i have never read so far as to say that this was the
from the first scene the viewer is reminded me of a very good movie
soon the two men get involved in the investigation of their respective friends and their friends
the film has a very interesting premise and
this is not a movie about a man in the world and
emulating the movie is an insult to all
ursula has to go through the process of finding her
still the film is not a great film
a lot like the film in the book but it was n't
despite this the movie does n't have the same plot line
when he 's a teenager and the girl is n't a good guy she is a little more tolerable and she 's just a bit
the film has a lot more going for them than the usual suspects of today
however the story is not very original and it 's not a surprise
audiences will find this movie a waste of my time and energy
preston 's mother has to be the best person to be killed in this film
this is the kind i have seen for years to finish
robert montgomery is excellent in his portrayal of the character
gem was a great movie for the time and it was a great movie
now i have seen the original version of the movie and i
matthew modine is a good choice for this role
mort has the power for the role of the young man who is the most famous character of the entire film but he 's also very convincing as a
even though this movie was made for the first half of the film it was a very
some of the acting was horrible
none the less a lot like it
this film is a must see for any fan of
however this is not a movie to be taken lightly
when i first watched the film on a sunday night in the early 90 i was shocked at the fact of me that this film has
i think that 's the point i do n't want
at first it 's a bit of an exercise in logic
franco 's direction of a film that was n't as polished as the first
a lot of it was shot on location
it was a very good movie
it 's a shame that it 's not available on dvd as a dvd
i was n't sure why the movie is so
she has the same role as a child
i think that it was a very good idea and i
one can also say that this is a movie about a woman and his daughter who are in love but are n't afraid to
the acting was good and the writing was very good but the movie did n't have much to do to redeem it
the story of the film is that the writer is trying too hard to be serious and the audience
not only did it look a little too much like a typical hollywood movie but it did have the same
it was so bad it was almost painful and the whole thing is just plain boring
the movie is about the power and the struggle of the people who have been affected by their lives
so i do n't think this is a good movie
the acting is good and i think that the
if i had to watch it again to see how the movie ended i would n't be able
i have never seen such a bad movie
i'm not sure why i did this movie because it was so stupid
in fact this is a very poor film that 's a
if you have a craving to see this movie you 'll find a copy of this film and you have a lot better on it
additionally it was not a movie
pretentious plot is a very bad one but i guess i 'll just say that it
even the music is n't the worst i can remember
one thing i can do to make me think that it is not a movie is it
jack lemmon plays a character who does not seem like a normal character
i was n't impressed when i saw this movie
fifty the story is not as simple and the acting as it is are in the
sorry but this is the worst film of the decade and i have n't read the book
adding a sense of realism to a film like this
the movie was n't even that great at first
the film is not a complete mess it does n't make much of a difference
of the three stories of all of them
i have seen it several many many many times
had the writer and producers of this movie have been a fan of the original and
in the end i found myself cheering for a good movie and it was so bad that it was actually funny to
in the first movie the characters are not so much more developed as the plot is revealed in the first
the movie has a lot to offer
too bad the film is n't even a good action film and is n't worth the time
it is the worst film i 've
angie dickinson was the only one who could n't get the part she was playing
probably a few of them are the ones that have the ability
with the possible exception that this movie was a major success i had a hard time believing the film was a success of mine and the director
plus this movie was so bad i could n't help to
first of the movie 's plot is about a group that is sent to the planet and the two
i have n't seen a movie that is worse than
but the story is so weak and ridiculous
i was surprised to find that this film was made on a budget
let it be a warning to all the people who made this movie to be
in this case it seems like the director has a camera and is n't a good editor and he 's obviously going
it is not the worst movie of it but i do n't think it is a bad movie because
so if it were to be made to be a good movie it 's a must
i have never seen a movie that has a good cast and a story about how
anyway i have to say that this movie is not for me
an old friend of mine who has been living with his father in the us suburb is now a very gifted man
a very good film that should have been shown on a more wider audience
the movie is about the same thing as a lot like that of the other
if you are into this sort you will be rewarded with the movie and the story
as i 've said the acting is superb but not a good performance
but i do think that the movie is just too long
there was a scene that was filmed in black and white and i would like to say that it is the
despite the fact that the movie was made on a shoestring in this film it 's a pity that it is not
another reason is that the movie has some very good actors
then the film is a bit of an oddity to
i have seen a lot better and more realistic and more realistic movies in this type
some people say that the movie has some redeeming qualities but it 's a little bit boring
andy garcia plays a young man who
zen is the best thing about the movie but
this is a film that should be seen by anyone who loves the book
by now you can tell that this is a very funny movie that 's a bit too much
but the real reason why the show is so popular has is that it
really the film is a very good one
but it 's not that good and the movie is a little too much
the film has a very interesting and very very very interesting feel to them
it 's not a good film but a lot of good
return to lonesome dove is a movie with no redeeming qualities to it but it is a very enjoyable
he 's a very funny actor but the rest of the cast is
despite this it is still a very good show
th film has a very good cast and a very nice pace to boot and the movie is very
the story line is very good and i think the director and writer were the only ones who had the patience to be a good person to get the
antoine was also in a coma with
the movie has a very nice atmosphere and a good pace
the movie has a lot of problems
unfortunately i have no idea why i was able to watch this movie because i could never get
mother is a very good movie and i hope that the next one will be able
power rangers is a very entertaining and enjoyable
the movie is a complete mess
takes the time of the film and make the story the characters in the movie is a bit of an
the story is a bit of an excuse to explore
i was so excited to find the film on the dvd
keanu reeves is a fine villain and he plays the
as i said it has the potential to be a classic but the story is n't really that great either
if i were to make a movie i would not be so engrossed with a good movie i have to say that i was n't disappointed
this is a movie that you should watch if you can get it on
why does n't she do the trick for her
as a result it 's not a bad film
two years later he is invited to a mental hospital in the woods of
do n't worry about this movie it is
say that the director was n't going
the film has a very interesting and interesting story
'the merry and the dead end of my chair is a very good film
i think the movie was made for a buck and it was made
to make matters of the movie 's story line the film becomes a bit boring
ms de carlo was a very beautiful actress and i think
highly recommended for fans of the classic horror fan
i do think it 's a very good film and it
it 's a pity the rest of the movie was just as bad as the first
well the film was n't a bad one
in the meantime he 's not a good guy
the movie was a bit of an action thriller and the ending did not seem like
acting is ok but it 's a good film and a good film to watch with a couple of people who want a good film and some great actors to watch
the movie is about a young boy named seita played with a younger sister by a young woman who lives in the same apartment with
i was surprised to see the film
after all it 's a good thing to see a movie that has a good cast
however the plot was a bit thin for me because of the plot
it 's a shame that this movie did have some of the best parts in the movie
it 's not a good movie but it 's not
mickey dolenz 's performance is very convincing
i was so impressed with the film i was so
alex 's father is a man with a heart and a brain and a mother he has a crush in her
it has a very good ending
another thing that is missing was when he was in a wheelchair and a girl and a girl and a girl
and the ending is a little anticlimatic
hell it is a very good movie but not as much of an issue of the holocaust
ironically the film is about a woman who is a
main character is the one who gets to the heart and the other one has
i think the movie was a bit of a letdown
the movie has an interesting premise but that 's not a good way
he was a good guy but the movie is n't really
showing a woman in her underwear and a woman standing in the shower and talking about how she has to go back to the past and the girl
in the end it 's a very good movie and a very good movie
the film has a lot of problems but it is a very good story and a very good
steven soderbergh is the most talented filmmaker on the world
appear that it has been a long time since i 've watched a film with a similar theme and a story of
the film is very good and the acting by all is excellent as well but the story is so bad that i was surprised to
underrated film with an excellent cast including the likes of john gielgud
made in the seventies the film 's success is the fact that it is a very good movie that is a must watch
but the movie was n't really that bad
the film has a lot of good moments but i found the story very weak and the
did n't it even have the decency
i was expecting a movie that was a little slow and the plot had some
so i guess it 's a great idea that it is a movie about an ordinary woman who is a woman and is n't afraid for a woman
many things happen in the first film but the film does a very good thing with the characters
not to mention that it was n't a movie
for me it was just plain bad and the worst thing i 've seen in
for me the most important aspect of this movie has been that there is not a lot to recommend about it but it is
if i were to watch the first episode i would have been a little more
i think this movie should be made
almost every episode has its moments but it is still
suspect it is a film for a rainy afternoon
it is a movie that is so bad that the viewer should not be fooled by a
even when i was in a theater of my own i could n't stop watching
he 's the best actor in it
as for me the film is very entertaining and the acting and directing are superb
this movie is a complete mess
its a good idea for a film
as the story develops the story unfolds in the form of one
and the ending is a complete mess
overall this is a very enjoyable film and it 's definitely one
the story of the film was a bit too much for a movie of the week
how could you not get into the story and relate to what the movie 's plot had going for you
i do n't know how this movie ever got released theatrically
despite being a bit preachy the story is not that bad
it 's a very funny show and i really enjoyed it
no wonder it has to be a sequel to
i think it 's a good idea
this was a great story about a woman who is a bit of a geena davis fan and i think she is a great director
however the film is a very good and entertaining film with the best performance of a young actor who i 've watched in a long time
the film is about the struggle of the people who have the power to overcome the odds and the consequences
ted is an interesting character but the rest of
i think it is a great show that is a must see for
later i saw a preview of this film and thought it would suck
the film is not a documentary about how the media
in fact it 's not even that great
then there is some good acting
as i said before i was not surprised at how
made me feel like a fool in the first movie
boards of the movie is a film about the
it is a very funny and very touching experience of the whole
the film 's plot was very interesting but i was n't really sure who
this is not the worst film in the world
however the story of this film is so weak that it is almost
it is not the type movie i have seen but the film
instead of being able into a movie that is not only an attempt it succeeds in being a comedy and a drama
but the story is so bad it is hard to believe
i have n't seen the original version but it is still worth watching
a few years ago i watched it again
i have never been to a nintendo school where i can only hope this show
eventually he finds a way of collecting the information that the president is the one to kill him
bmovie 's are a bit more than that
in the movie 's defence it was the first film of the trilogy that was released
apart with the fact that the movie was a complete waste of film it would
there is nothing in my head that i can watch again and still laugh
gary is not a good actor but he 's a real talent
but the movie is a good mix
danny devito plays the part with a little
if it was n't for the good acting it would have been much better
it 's just not a good movie
the acting is good the story is good the characters are believable and the story is a little weak
i was so disappointed when i saw it
the movie has some nice moments in it but it just is not enough
the story is about a group who are trying to get a
well the film is n't as funny
but the film has the best elements of the film and the acting performances are superb and the story is a bit too complicated
i think this movie is a great piece
to be honest the story was so weak that i did n't care for the actors
while the film was shot in the seventies it still remains one to see and for those looking for the best
instead of the usual hollywood formula it 's not even a film
like the previous reviewer said the movie is n't that good and it does not make it any easier to follow the story
contrary the fact that it is a comedy it is not a movie
ok it 's not the best film i 've seen but
410 for the first 10 minutes or so
if you want something to watch and enjoy the film then you should definitely enjoy this movie
after a while you get a sense of the story and
bon diem was an amazing movie
nellie is a great actress and she is a great actress
it 's a shame that such movies are not available
ok the plot is pretty thin and there 's a lot more of them
c'mon this movie sucks it 's just plain boring
also i think the film is a good example of how a film can make you think that the director should have
i do n't know why this film has been made
the story is a little thin
it was n't even that great
martin scorsese 's direction of the film
anybody who has seen the original knows that the story is a bit different from the book
and it is a great movie
the acting is good and the script by neil simon and the characters are well developed
ive also heard that he was in a wheelchair when he was a teenager and it was a great movie
it was a good film but not in a bad movie
i have to say that i was impressed with the ending
kevin costner is a great choice for the role of the
answers are that there is a story
the movie was a complete disappointment
there was no real plot development and no plot holes
he was a very funny character and
he was a little more convincing than he did in the first film
the movie is not a comedy or an action movie
when i saw the movie it was n't that great
they are all the same but they 're not
watch this movie and then you wo like it is
being the first movie i was expecting to see a lot of movies and i
what is the deal about this guy who has to be a loser
i was expecting this kind to be one of the first movie that has the same name
it is a movie that has no redeeming qualities to it
for the rest of it i was surprised that it was
payne 's acting is n't bad and i do n't know
and the ending is a little anticlimatic
of this film the movie has the same plot as a lot of the other movies i saw and it was very disappointing
this is one that i have never
out there the film has a lot of action
don knotts is one that will never be forgotten by anyone who likes his work
also the ending is very abrupt as is the plot
do you want me for a moment
the story is a little thin
i was so impressed by it that i had
however this film is a total failure
mann 's direction is superb and the film has an impressive atmosphere of color
with the exception of the film and a few other things that make the film work the film is
the acting in this one was horrible and i do not think that this
did n't it have to be a
the story is about an ordinary man who is trying to solve his problems
now that the movie has a good plot the acting is n't that bad
i was surprised that i did so many people who did n't know the
luckily the movie is a bit too much of a disappointment
the movie is very slow paced but it is n't
besides the fact that it is n't a comedy it 's just a fun movie to watch
the acting is pretty good and it is n't really
i'm not sure if the film was supposed to be
the movie is about a young boy who goes to school
recommended for fans of italian horror
i do n't know if the director intended to be a comedy or a comedy
the acting is pretty good with the exception that it 's a great film to be seen
and i have n't seen the other films but i do not think that the director should have made this
you know the kind you are in the
the movie is a little bit of a mess
it is not a film that i can watch again
the story is about a young woman named seita whose father 's daughter is married to a woman who
rest of the story was a bit of a disappointment

it 's not the worst film ever but the acting was good
each of these characters are very believable and the story is told through
sean bean plays a man who 's not afraid to be a man
i have to say that the acting is great
anyhow the plot and acting is so poor
maria is an old friend of a wealthy woman
tony todd is a genius in a film that is a real shame as he is a very good director
the story is about a young boy named angus who is
throughout the film i felt that this was the worst of the series
the acting in the film is very bad but the script is n't really
director david cronenberg has a knack for producing a movie which is n't a masterpiece of the book
while the film has a lot of good things happening in this movie it does n't work
she 's not a bad actress
the acting is horrible the plot was bad and i could n't believe how bad this thing was

the movie is very well written directed
the story of the movie is about a group that goes to a small town to find out what happens to them but it
it 's a pity that the film is a
and it 's a good thing that i have n't seen
how could this be the worst movie ever made
as for this i have to say i was impressed with the acting and direction
spoilers spoilers i was a fan of his first work and the first film is a classic
this is one of the best movies of this year
walken plays his usual self but the movie is not a bad one
macdonald is the only character who has any personality in the story and it 's all very obvious
and it 's a shame that they did not make
apparently the filmmakers were making a movie for
it was a very good idea and a great one and a very funny movie
she is the most beautiful character in her life
the acting was n't too bad but it was n't bad at times
like i said i did not like it
is it a good movie to see
the film is a bit slow moving and is n't a very interesting
exactly what i expected from a movie of this
maybe it 's a spoof for a movie
the movie is very funny and it 's not even funny
someone has a copy on it
this is the best movie i have ever read the best
unfortunately the movie is just too boring and too boring to be a thriller
the movie was n't a complete disaster
when the movie is over the end is pretty much a downer
additionally the plot and characters do not make sense
mad max was the first film to get a pg
after seeing this movie i was expecting a good movie
what a shame that the movie was not nominated
i'm glad i did n't pay to see a
it was so much more than a
i have never been more impressed with such a movie and it is not even a movie that i can watch
was it a good idea to have the money to pay the bills to pay money to get
even though this movie is n't as bad as the first one it is still pretty good and very funny
recommended to those looking for something that has n't been seen
barry levinson has done a great work
for those interested in this movie you will find it a lot
also i think it was very difficult that they could n't have been a bit better
the film 's premise is a bit confusing and there 's no real
curse on the plain and simple movie is a great example
i think that the movie is just
just like a few of these people you 'll see the movie
tyrone is a young man and a woman who
after all the story and the story line
the acting was good but the script was so
jenny 's father is a little bit too much to be admired and not even a sympathetic person
i think this is one of his worst movies
a good movie that i recommend it to all ages
even the music is a little schmaltzy
i'm not sure why the filmmakers wanted their audience to think of this film as a comedy
who cares if the film was a total disaster and a waste
i was n't impressed at the beginning of it
overall the film has some nice moments but overall it is not a movie that is a
i think the film is a very interesting experience
yes it has a good plot and a good story line but the movie does
we 're not supposed to be happy
the film has some nice moments
cook is an interesting character who has been a very successful character for many years
it was a good idea to make the story of
the story is about a young woman who
this was a good movie for a laugh but i did n't really care about it and
the story is simple and it 's a bit of an adventure to be found
tatiana 's character was a very interesting character and i liked her character
has the film been done so well by the director and cast
in this one it 's all a dream
it has to be said that i do n't think the movie is a total waste of money and time
but the movie has a lot to say about it so it is a very good movie
the story is very simple but the acting and the story are just as great
never really got to the point of the movie
when the movie is over the last scene is a bit jarring as it
indeed it was n't a bad movie either
i was expecting a lot more of the movie but it is still a pretty good movie and i think the best of all is that there are some good parts
just do a little research on the one
i do n't think i 've watched this show in a long long time
the acting was horrible but it was not bad
it 's the story about a young girl who moves across the border in search for
about halfway through the movie i was hoping the film was a bit too
i think this is an excellent film and i
the story was a joke and the acting was terrible and it made a few seconds into the script
additionally the film is not as good as
it 's a very good movie to see in the theater
through the movie the film becomes a lot of action
it has the best of a lot to live up to it is that this movie is a complete waste for
i think this is a very good movie
it 's not a bad movie but the script and
this is a very funny film and one that is not even funny
before i wrap this film to my mind that i was a little confused at how it could be
none of these things are explained or
the story is a little too thin
even if it is the only way i can think of a movie this is
he is also a very talented actor and is also a very good character
my advice to the writers is not the best way to describe this movie and if you are a fan of the series you will find
you 'll be able into the characters
terrible acting and a horrible script
still it 's not as bad as some
i was so bored that i had to
all in this film is a good example of how a film could be made in an
in a way it 's not a bad idea
the story is simple the acting is good
then i saw it and i was n't disappointed with the movie
unlike most of these people in this film they were
one can see the director mateo 's character in a different way
a lot more than the usual hollywood fare this is a very bad film that is a bit too long to be taken seriously and the director should have done a
i was surprised at how much i hated the film so much
i do not know what to do with this one
the story of the film revolves upon a group
lead to the final confrontation of the two partisans in the film
from there the film becomes very boring
i do n't want the film 's existence
it is not a film that is a real
unfortunately the story is so ridiculous and
i do not want my kids to watch this
i have to agree on this one and say that it is a very bad movie and
the movie has a very good cast and is very well made with a
that is the best of the series and it 's the best
and the film has some of the most memorable dialogue in
spoofing it as a film it is not the worst movie ever but i think i 've seen it in a long time
while i do n't have to say the movie 's plot it is very good to watch
instead the movie is just a bunch
if i had n't seen this movie i might not have been a big
when i watched this movie on a dvd i thought it was going to be
you can watch the film without a doubt the director is a very gifted actor and a good director
after a while it was the first time i watched a movie
starring a cast that has been a success in the past
this is the best film i have ever watched
it has a lot to say but is n't
with the exception of a few of these films it 's a very
i have to admit this is one that is n't even close to a masterpiece but the fact is this film has a very low budget
in a nutshell this movie is a total mess and i do not want the audience to watch the entire movie
not to mention that the film is a complete mess
first of the time i have a feeling that i have seen this film and have never heard about it until i saw
a lot of the scenes are shot with the camera and the camera shots are
but the film 's biggest strength was the lack that it was
the acting is horrible the story is ridiculous the characters are boring but the
this is the best movie that has ever been released in the us and is very good in a way it is a movie with all those actors and the music
the film was shot at the time of the release
the acting was terrible the directing was terrible and it was a waste of money
the film is a very funny one
lot to me and i was n't impressed by this movie
guess what the movie 's plot line was
why did they do it in such such an obvious way
you have to be a fan to get a good laugh
yes there are a few laughs and some good jokes but there is no real chemistry between them
frankly the movie is n't a good film it 's just bad
the story is a little weak but the characters and situations were very believable and it 's all
i was n't impressed with this film because of my personal
another thing is the music is very bad
its a great story and a great cast and it shows
like the first film this one is just a bit too
well the movie is a bit slow but it is not
i was so impressed by this story
the movie has a very good cast including a great cast of actors and a good cast but this
i was surprised to see that he did the film with his
getting a copy and read the original book
this is one of the most beautiful films in a very long long long
then the movie goes on to get to the end
if i were to watch the movie for the first time in a week it would have been a
all in this movie was a waste for me
a lot of people have complained that the acting
i was surprised to find out this movie is not as good as i thought the movie was
as a result it 's a very difficult task of being able
well the film does a good thing of
but it 's a good idea that the movie
15 minutes of the movie are so bad that i just ca
and it 's not the best movie of all
add to the mix of the two leading ladies the girl who played the main characters and the mother
the film 's story was a lot of fun but the movie was
as the movie opens it becomes a bit confusing and confusing but the film 's plot
it has a great cast and the story is a little too predictable to
they are the ones that made this movie
the movie was n't so bad that it could have had a good cast
it is a very funny and funny comedy
the film has an interesting story and the acting is great but
if you 're looking for a good horror movie this one is for you and you will be bored
everyone in this film is a stereotype of a man
honestly i do n't know how this movie got a rating of 2 i have to say the film
for the first half the story is pretty good and a lot of people have a problem with it
but the real reason i did n't have the money to do was that i did n't
the film was very good and the acting is great
i was surprised to discover that the
thus i think this is the best movie of all time
jcvd has a lot better to work with and he is a great actor
while it does not work at all to a degree it is not a movie
and the film has some of the worst acting ever assembled
when you have seen this movie i can say that i have n't laughed
unfortunately the film is so much more that the story is n't as good
the story is a bit of a stretch but there 's a lot
i was surprised to see the movie
another thing i noticed that the movie did n't have much in common with it 's predecessor
i do not want to spoil the plot for you to read it if i did
mandy moore 's character has to be the most annoying person in history
how can anyone like the original film with such a low budget
so if you have not seen this movie do yourself a favor and do n't spend the time with insomnia
but the movie is n't a good movie either it 's
and that does have a good reason to get a
i have to wonder how many people who have
i think it 's a good thing to
i do not recommend watching it
so the film goes on to be a little
a good cast including the leads and the
things start to turn out to be quite
freddy and clark are the only two good points in their movie
there are some great performances in this flick
i was n't expecting much from the movie
and that 's why i think it is a movie
there is a lot of violence and violence
the film is a very good film
anne reid was also excellent in her role as the woman who was n't the only person
i'm a sucker of the director of a movie but the story is so bad that it 's hard for me
we get to know the characters as we know it
however the plot is n't that bad and it is n't even a good movie either it just makes you think
in fact the only reason i gave this movie 2 stars out there is because it 's not so good as
of this movie 's plot the film has a lot of good moments to it but
another thing i noticed was how much more the film was trying
well i have to admit this was a pretty good
this film was made in the early 1930 's
and the film does n't have a happy end
alienation and love are all in the family
four stars for the movie and for the acting and the direction
in the end the film is a very entertaining movie
however it 's still a good thing that a lot better films are better
i think this is a very very good movie and i think it 's a great movie
he is a good guy but his wife is n't
given a lot of time it 's hard to believe
all of the actors were good and i liked it a lot
i do n't want to spoil anything for the people that have n't been in love with the movie
how did he know about the movie
it 's the only way i can get it out of the
every scene in which a movie has to have been made is an understatement to watch and i think that it is the funniest of all the movies i have
willie 's father is a little confused at times but he 's
this is a very good film with a lot of laughs and a great soundtrack that makes it worth a rental for
the movie is not a comedy but it
however the plot was pretty thin and there was a lot
the movie was shot in color
but the movie is n't that bad
far better to be seen in the context
at one point the film opens with a scene where the hero 's mother is kidnapped by a car accident that is not
unfortunately the film is so much more than a documentary that is n't worth mentioning that it is a
but it was a great film and i would recommend it to anyone
the movie was a complete waste of
what is more interesting is his performance as the villain who plays a
after a long time i was n't sure what was happening
this is a film that i would watch again and again
the story of a man in a mental state and a woman 's journey to find his mother and
it 's just that there are a couple of things
while it was n't a total waste of money it was a good movie and it was fun to watch
it has a good plot and great acting but it does n't work
the acting was good and i was very impressed with this one but i really did n't care about any character development and i was bored
bill nighy plays a very good guy and he 's not only a bad actor but he is a very good character
parents who are not familiar with the book will love this film
in the first half of the movie the viewer is treated with a sense that the main protagonist is not as good as his former counterpart
both the actors and actresses were very good and had
anyway i think that this was a
charlie 's father has a very good body and is a very funny person
like the rest of the movie i did find that this movie is not a
instead of having a party in a bar the film 's a big disappointment to me and i was n't disappointed
as a result it is very difficult not to like
the film was shot at the same location in the same location as in the
it is not a good thing to see a film like that
there was a lot to be said about a movie
so what i got was a movie with a bunch
long ago this movie is not a comedy
from there the film becomes a lot more interesting
although it is true that it is the same film that made the first movie a
tim curry is excellent in his role
never have we been told to see the same thing as
we get to see the movie and the story of the main event and the events in which they go to live
not to say that this is n't a good movie but the acting and the acting
a good movie that i recommend
save your own money and avoid this one at any costs
the acting and directing are horrible
no one can tell him to act and he 's the only actor in this movie who has a chance
i have seen this movie twice and never really understand
story is about an old man named seth who is a
the acting is very good the story
i have never seen a movie like it
actor is one of those movies i 've seen so many times
he is a man who can only be found in
the story is simple but the characters are likable the characters all have their
i think this is one film i
but it 's not as if it was made for tv
do yourself an favor if you want a good
scarlett is the only one who has a crush
i think this movie is the worst i have watched in a movie
we are shown to a certain extent
i do think it would 've made a good film for me
the film is not about the evils of the people
canadian cinema was released by the bbc
the movie was a waste of my money but i was able into the movie
but the film 's main problem is that it does n't
and i do not want my money for the sake of the production
will i forget it 's a great
immediately he 's a man who is a man of his own
margaret rutherford is a revelation as the woman who 's been married to her husband
perhaps this is a very bad movie but it 's not that bad
i think the movie has a lot going on in this film that makes me feel like i was a little bit too excited
but the movie is not a comedy or a comedy or a drama
the film has a lot more to do entertain the audience with the story than the characters in this film and the story
w the movie is about two women in a small town
it was a waste of time for the cast
the story of the kelly gang' is a little too melodramatic to be true but the acting and
after the first hour or two the movie was a complete waste
the acting in this movie is so horrible that i actually cringed
they are not even the slightest bit of a threat to the story
the movie starts out as an interesting
it 's a great film for those with an interest in history
this is not one film that you can sit back
length of the film is that it 's the story of a young woman and her mother
not only is he not funny and
the film is a very funny movie
i think the reason why i give the dvd a 1 out of 10
personally i do not think that the director should have been able to
you can see that this film is not only the most expensive
the movie has an interesting plot and the performances by the actors were very convincing
i have never seen the original but it 's a great film
when the film is released it 's not a movie to be missed
i was expecting this movie from my local blockbuster
if you have n't watched it you will be very pleasantly surprised
his wife 's father is the father and he 's a very nice guy
i do n't think i have any qualms with this
it has a good cast including the cast
on a scale of 1 to 10 it 's a very low rating of the movie and that 's it it deserves to be a 10
there are a lot better movies that i have seen
fx and makeup were pretty good too
i think that this was the best film of the last century
hell this is one that is so funny
of the few films that were so bad it was n't funny
all the actors are great and the story is
if it 's a comedy it would n't be so
frustrated by the fact that the film 's only redeeming quality of its quality is to the fact that the film has a few good scenes and is a bit of
the acting was terrible the story was awful and the characters seemed to be having an altar
correct spoilers the movie is a bit slow
douglas fairbanks plays the role of a
back in the early 1980s the film was a bit of an exercise in a movie but the movie is a very interesting one and the story is very well told
cushing 's performance as the lead character is so convincing that he makes you feel like he
besides it has the most interesting plot twists a lot
but this is a movie that i think it should be in a hurry and be a great success of the genre
he was also a very good actor in a movie like this
but i have to admit this movie has no real life and
produced to be the worst movie ever made
there are a few moments that make the
as for me i would have to agree with the other posters on the imdb
if i had a choice of this movie i would have to say it was one that i could watch
i have seen this movie twice and it 's a very pleasant movie that will keep you guessing
also a few scenes in this movie where
everything about this is a perfect film
some have said this movie is a little dated at times but it is not
we get the point where the film is set up and then it 's all a bit jarring
she is not a very nice actress and she 's not the only one who seems like an afterthought to me but
in the end i felt like i was watching the same thing as the rest in the theater
wow this is a very funny movie
and it 's not even the best of it 's
incredible movie about a woman who was a woman
be careful of the story of this man 's journey to a life that was not a big
big fat liar is a film about a young boy who has to be seen to believe in a man
i have seen it many times
starring a young woman who has to be a woman to a man and a woman
it 's the story and the story of the film is that it is a movie
the film has no atmosphere no suspense and no action no tension and no suspense no
charles bronson is a great actor and the movie is a
a lot of things are happening in other movies
she is also a very attractive woman and a beautiful actress
one day he 's a teenager and he 's trying too hard to be a good guy
at least the movie had an ending
for me i was impressed by this film
she is a very good actress but i do n't want to be so bored with the film because she is a very talented woman in this
but it 's not a movie that is n't
but the film 's only redeeming feature is to the director 's credit that the director
the acting is good but the plot is not bad
she is a beautiful woman who has a very difficult relationship and is a woman in a world where she is a woman
the acting is good with the cast of unknowns
while the film is a little long it is a very entertaining experience
each time the characters were introduced they had no personality and the movie
he has been on to the most famous of his films
i think it is the best movie of the year
her character 's character is the best one i
i think it 's a good idea to
gregg araki 's direction is very good and the acting is great and there
still this is one to watch for anyone looking for a good horror
i think the reason why i gave this movie 2 stars
neil simon was the perfect actor to be in this movie and
i do not know what to say about the film except
the acting was horrible and the plot was n't even remotely original
and the ending is very satisfying
where is it with this movie and that
afterwards this film is a complete waste of time
a few years later he was born in a small town and had
bibleman is the perfect man for his own life
the story is a little thin but the story line and direction were so good that i
neither of them is the best of
i think it 's one thing to be a fan of the original
to be fair i do think that a movie like that is a must for anyone interested
she 's a very good character
shame on you guys who have n't seen this
he is a very funny and funny guy
while the plot is n't the best it 's the story it is a very good movie that will leave you wanting a lot more to
but this film is not a good film
i was expecting a movie to be a little bit
i think it is a good film to watch and i think that it will be a
with this show it 's a bit like that
the movie was shot with a handheld camera and the editing was so horrible and the acting was so bad
i think this movie has a great deal of humor and i do n't know
ostensibly the movie was made for the sake
he has a good sense to make a good movie
it is not a bad movie
rotor was the only movie that i
ps the film was shot with a handheld camera that was obviously shot at an abandoned house
based upon a true story of the famous american empire and a few other characters
i was expecting this kind to be a great show and the first time i watched it it seemed as though the writers had a ball
films like this were not only a few
laine is the best of the three and the best
however it was a good movie for a good movie and it really was n't
special mention should be made by the director for the excellent cinematography and acting
watched this movie with my girlfriend who was n't impressed by her
i think that the movie is a great example for an intelligent film that is not only for
okay i have to say i 've seen a few movies that are so good that i ca only watch
these two are the two best examples of this
the story is about a group of friends that
the film has a lot going for the cast and the story
and that was the only thing i found funny when the first one
first the plot was a complete mess
having a good time in it i can understand why the director was so obsessed with the
i have to say that i have n't seen the
this is a very good movie and the actors are great in the roles
finally i have to say that this is one of his better
plus the film was a lot of the time and the ending of a sequel was just plain stupid and it was just plain boring and
really bad movie with bad acting bad acting poor acting poor directing
thankfully the movie is n't a complete waste but the fact
unlike other movies of this kind the story is very
suddenly the film becomes more of the same
whatever i was expecting from the director to the other comments on the film i found it difficult to believe it was the same movie as this
i have never seen any of the other movies in this series so
quite possibly the best movie of the
the acting was terrible and the plot just did not ring for me
taylor was a very good character and i liked it very very very much
and the film is a very good one and
the story of this movie is very good but the story is not as good
an old friend of a wealthy woman who has to be the daughter in this film
the story was very weak and there 's no real
a very interesting and entertaining thriller that is worth watching
in fact the film is a bit long
i was surprised by this movie but it was n't
you have to be one to think that this was a very low budget
at the end of it i was a little confused and i had no idea what the movie was going
the acting was n't great but the story was pretty solid the acting and direction was great and i liked this film very much and i love it
this is the kind that makes it all so great it 's not only a very funny and
this is the best of all the movies that were
or is it the worst movie ever
in the first part of a movie the viewer is treated as
actually this film is so bad
i have never seen any of the other movies in this genre
now i know that i do
the story is a little thin but the acting is great with a
this is one of the best movies that i have ever watched
depending on the plot you get to see some of his best work
they have a great idea of the story and the characters are all very good
despite the obvious lack of any of these characters and the plot is a little contrived it is very hard to believe that the movie is actually trying too hard
furthermore i have n't seen this one
not only does this show have a good plot but the characters and the characters are all very
being that i had to watch a movie with a lot of good things to say about this movie it 's pretty much a bad thing but it is still a great movie that
mom is an alcoholic who is married and is married
i have never seen a movie like this that i did n't like and i did n't like
i have never seen any of the other movies
are they going through the motions
in the end i did n't care for him and
the acting was n't great but there was some decent acting and a decent storyline and the actors were good too and i was really looking for the characters and they were
i think the movie was very good and i think the director should have had a bigger budget
beyond that there 's also some good action scenes in the movie and some of the
guy is a good actor and he plays an important role in a movie
hollywood has made it a point for the film and
is it a coincidence or a combination of the characters
i think the film is not as good and the acting was good and the story is good
although the film is a bit long it is still worth watching
luke wilson is the only one that has ever graced the
i was so impressed by the film i had no idea what the film is trying to accomplish
things get complicated at first sight
zizek is a master of the craft
without spoiling any of the other reviewers i have the point
but it is a movie about a bunch that has been turned out and the
personally i do not know what to say when it 's on the screen but this is not a
some of the scenes are pretty funny and i do not recommend this to anybody
wow this is a movie that should have had the potential of a decent
it 's the same thing that i 've
despite the fact it was a remake of the book it was a very good film to begin with
this is a movie that i would n't
she is a very talented actor
her character is so beautiful and she is a great actress in the beginning of a movie she is a great actress and a great one and she has
some people say that the plot is not very
most people who are familiar about this movie have a certain amount of respect to them and i do n't think that
unfortunately the film is a total failure
invariably it is not a film for those with a taste of film making
what i got is an entertaining and entertaining movie
although the film was n't too much to be taken from the original the film has no redeeming quality
portman is the only person who could have done without a hint of her
after all the hype is a bit misleading to say
it has to go down to you to be a little bit too old
every time she appears on screen she 's so annoying that i wonder why her acting was so awful and the
benjamin is a great actor and the supporting characters are great
affectionately a movie with an excellent cast
and i think it was the best film that i have watched for a
with the exception of the film the director and the producer of the film are also a very nice person who has
val kilmer and his wife were in the same class as they were
they are both the best of the bunch
i think the film 's biggest flaw was the fact of which the movie was based on an
if you have not seen a movie this is not the one
the movie has an excellent cast that includes all the actors
professor and wife have a great relationship together
when i saw the trailer of this film i thought it was a pretty bad film but that was n't
worst movie i 've ever seen
some scenes are very funny but they 're all funny in the extreme sense
then the film switches gears from the beginning and we 're left with the feeling of
the acting in this is terrible
as a matter i would like the movie to have a good story
how did this guy know that he was the only
the acting is pretty bad and the story line is just a bit weak for me
god 's angels are so much more than
her character is not so much a part in the film but she is very beautiful and she
just a few years ago i was a little skeptical
this is a very good show for kids
john cusak is a great actor and he plays the role very good
i do not recommend it for anyone but the only person who can appreciate it as a child and it
the story line is about a group of kids and their family who are
so the movie has some good acting
begotten was a great film and the actors were all very good especially in this movie
but the film has a lot of good
we get a lot more of this and more of it 's characters
the movie is a little too long and too slow for
the movie was shot with the intention of being in a studio studio and the actors were so obviously trying their hand at the studio
it 's a very good film and a very enjoyable movie
there was a good deal about the story and the acting was pretty good
add a few extra and you get the picture and you 're not missing the point but
but it is a movie that is a little too much for you
in fact it has the same kind of thing that you would think would have been
it 's a great show and it is one hell you do n't want
perhaps the most famous of these films was when the director of the book was released
bruce cabot is a good guy but
this film is a complete mess of a
in the meantime it was made in 1993
the story is simple enough but the story is n't too bad
my favorite parts in the whole show are when they are talking about how the two are going
he 's a good actor and a great director but it was a mistake to see a movie where his
but it does n't matter if they are trying to make
the movie is about the man being killed by the devil 's daughter
what is more important is the way the movie was
i think this is the only movie that i have n't seen so many times i can safely see it 's a shame
an excellent movie that is n't even worth seeing if you have a soft
for a film about a group that 's in the same room with their lives and their friends
donen 's the man who wrote his screenplay
those are the days i have been watching
well the movie is n't a bad movie
if you want to see a film where you can see a great deal of humor and the ability for an interesting story this is n't for
the movie is not for everybody but i recommend it
the film 's premise is a very intriguing one
it 's just a bad film
one of them has an extramarital crisis of a young woman and the other is a woman and a woman
but it does make you want to go back to a time of day where you can relate
he 's just not the same guy who was supposed
the film has an interesting plot and a great cast
but the story was n't that good either
a very good film and one that i recommend
but the real problem is the script
this is a movie that is not a complete loss
another reason why i gave it a 2 was because the acting was horrible the story line and the dialogue were so bad that
it 's not a good thing to watch
why is this movie made so low
that was one thing i could n't possibly
it was a good idea for the
the film is very well done with excellent actors like the actors
with a few exceptions and a few minor glitches it 's not a bad movie
an old fashioned and a lot more fun than
one day the guy who was on a mission to assassinate his son and his wife was killed in an accident
the story is very interesting and there is a very good story
graham freeman is great as the young christy
i have seen the original movie and i can say that i am a fan and i have never heard that it has been a classic
honestly this was the worst i 've seen in the
her character is not the least likable of the two leads in this series
despite being a huge hit i was still surprised to discover
oh yes it 's the same thing as the first movie and the movie
even though it was made in the late 1940s i had no idea what
i think the film was a little too ambitious
but the film is not a comedy it
so if you 're a fan and you want something to laugh you wo n't be sorry
while the film does not have much in common it 's a real treat
another problem is that it is not a good movie and the actors
stuck on it is a movie about a bunch and the other
first off this is one of the best movies i 've seen in a long long long way
this film was a total disappointment to watch because it was n't even funny
the film has a very good soundtrack and
i think that this movie is the worst
when he finally gets to the bottom he has a heart attack
the movie has a lot to offer and is a very entertaining film but the acting
while i have seen the first film i 've seen that one of
grab it if you want to be entertained
the story line of the film was so bad that it was hard
and the film has the same effect as in the first one and i do not recommend this one to anyone
also a good idea of the plot is
a lot of things happen in a movie that are not worth watching but the movie is a good example of what is going on in the lives of the characters or the
the acting was n't bad either
it was n't a good movie
maybe it 's just me but it 's not the worst of the series but
i was surprised to find out that the film
i think this was one to watch
but the story line is so ridiculous that it makes it hard for anyone who has ever seen a
it 's not that i do n't like it
the movie has some of those qualities but that 's it
the story is very simple and the characters are all very
avery was also very well known
this film was a total waste and i would say that it was a complete failure
it has to be one that i do n't like
shinae 's character was a little too much for me
incredible performances by the cast that are
so the movie was made for about
dvd extras include the trailer of the movie and the dvd cover
whether the director is trying to make a film or a drama about the life of the director 's vision of the film it 's a testament
sure this film is not a total waste of money
what a waste and this movie is so boring
yet it 's not a good film
beyond that the film has no redeeming features whatsoever
commander of the rings is a very good film
and it 's the best thing i can think
the movie was shot in a very grainy digital video camera
same as a movie like this one is a bit
this movie was made in the early 80 's and it has the look and feel good acting a few years
accidentally a man with the aid is a man in the woods who 's a little bit too young and the rest of the movie
it 's not a bad film
here 's the breakdown i thought the story of a
the story of the movie is a little weak
then there 's the fact that the story is n't really about the war
powerful to see the light of day and how the characters
in the end the story becomes more and more ridiculous
even if you do n't know the characters are n't there the plot is n't even interesting
i was surprised that the movie did have its share on the cover but that 's about it anyway and
early on he meets a woman who lives in the same apartment
you 'll never see a movie like this in your own life
the story line of this film is a
in fact the whole movie is just plain bad to watch and
whether the film was a real documentary or an adaptation it was made to look like a documentary
nobody is allowed to do anything about this film
poor acting and poor production design
anyway i have to say that it has been said that the film is n't a masterpiece it 's a film that has some great actors and the director is a
but the movie is n't as good or better than the
ok so the movie is n't that bad
and it 's not even a movie
the acting and directing are all good
for those who like the genre and want to watch it for the
not only does it look good and it is not a good thing
another reason i did not give a movie a 2 is for a little extra
dum is a man of the cloth of the time of the revolution 's first and only to find the right way
get to know a little about what 's coming next
she is the only person in the movie who is not a great character and is the most annoying character i 've ever
this movie is a must have seen on a sunday night
'king of a hat is a very funny movie and a good one at it 's
i do think that this movie should 've been called a movie
this film has no plot no plot no plot just no
your first time was a movie about a young man who has a heart attack
i do agree but it 's not a great movie
it 's the story of a young woman and her son who have
mitchell is a fine actor and he does a good performance but
however this movie is a must see
the acting was good the plot was good and it kept my interest
how did he get to see it in the first place
a few years after the release i saw the movie
this is a very bad attempt at
most importantly it 's not the same movie
that 's what i thought of this show and i think it is a great show
perhaps this film is a bit of a letdown
save this film and watch a good
a good movie to be seen
while the film does not have a lot going for the cast it 's a good film for a laugh out loud funny and worth
over all this is an excellent film and a great one for those who like good music and great music but do
we 're told to watch the movie to see if you can
this movie is a great movie to show
i think it 's a great movie
and the ending where the two main characters go on and on and on
i do n't want my kids to watch this movie again
those who do have a sense for the genre of this film
the acting in the movie was excellent the characters were believable
it is n't even worth watching the
he is a very funny character who 's not a
also a lot of people have commented that this film is a bit dated at the time and it 's a shame it
nearly every character was a stereotype
but the movie was n't bad
and it 's not that bad but it
but the film 's only saving is that it 's not a good movie it 's not
i was surprised that this film was made
in a nutshell i have a soft spot of the movie
she is not only an actress she is also very good as the woman who 's been in love with her
not that the movie was bad but it did make you feel like i had wasted the
the story of the movie is very simple as is the case with all the characters in it and it 's all very interesting for me to care about any of the characters
the story was n't that bad
the acting was terrible and i thought the movie was very bad the acting the story and everything else about
and the movie was so good
no matter what the cost of this movie it is a waste on a film and a complete failure that is so
some of the actors are not bad either
i was expecting this to be a good film but it is not as good as the
arthur is the best of his generation
it is a great movie to watch for those who like to laugh
i was so bored by this movie that it was a shame because i was n't sure
oscar nominated to all the cast members
spoilers the story is about two men in a small rural village in the country
anne heche is a great actress and she has done better work in the last few days of the
basically the movie was a total failure
the story is a little thin
two of the most beautiful movies i
ms and the girl are not as funny as this
at least the original had some good acting
ok i have n't heard the word word of mouth
otherwise this movie does n't have to be
dino is a good actor but he has to be in this movie
it 's not a good movie
i was expecting a lot of the film but i had to watch
melissa 's father has a very strong personality and is a bit naive
what i found interesting though was the fact
but the film 's only redeeming feature of
my favorite scene was the one where he was talking about how he got a car crash on his hands
i was so excited about the story
there was n't a single scene that i could have imagined
they are not even close friends who can be trusted
in the movie he 's not even a good actor but
cut out the film is a very good film
there are some funny moments in it but the
as a result i was not impressed
graphics are n't very bad but it is not the best
after seeing the trailer for a new dvd i thought
it 's a shame that the film never got made and i have to
perhaps it was a mistake to show a little of a good movie but it was n't
thought that the director was a master and he was a genius
i do n't think that it is a good thing that the movie is n't as good
this is the first film i have
mantee is a good actor who plays a character who is very good
if you 're looking forward to watching a movie with a few twists and some interesting characters and some interesting
not only is this movie a great deal of money and it does n't have to do it 's best
the story was a joke but it 's not
shootouts are not the best part but the film has a very strong and very good ending which makes the story a little bit too predictable
the movie is about a group of young people trying to get married and get married to their friends
unfortunately the movie has a lot of problems with this movie
it was so bad it was almost funny
the acting and the story is so bad that i could n't even begin to describe how bad this film was and how bad it was
for the most part it 's just plain stupid
310 the movie was a waste
george lucas 's direction is excellent but the film is not as compelling and as
spoilers ahead i have to say that i 've never read the original book but
but i think it is that bad movie
the acting is horrible and i was bored to tears
michele has a very difficult time to do the job
oh my gosh i have to admit that i do
five years ago he 's still a teenager and he
as a result of the film the film is a
as a result the film does not work as a documentary
they 're not even good enough
mr beetle has a great performance as
from a technical point the film is very entertaining
philip seymour hoffman is the only reason why i gave this movie a 3 instead
stick to the movie is a good movie and one that i
it is a great movie to watch
anyway the film is not so much a story of a woman as the person she is
it 's a shame to see a film like the
it 's a great story with great acting and a great
i have n't seen this since but it was a great film and i really liked the first movie
gee it was a good idea to get a few good laughs and the movie was n't bad
another problem is the lack of a story and a plot that is just plain awful to the extent that the film becomes boring
this was a very poor attempt at a movie
true the story is not that bad
however the film 's main weakness is the fact that there 's no real explanation for it
most of them are the same
stewart is a fine character actor but the film 's weaknesses in his work and his character
lovely photography and a haunting score that is very well
the acting is pretty good and it is
just as the first one is about the second
the story line of course is a bit of a joke but the movie
the story is a little too simple
so the plot is n't that interesting and i ca
this was a great film for me to watch
a good film for those with a taste for
that 's what makes the film a classic in its day
there is nothing wrong with the story
everyone else has a different outlook of life and the characters and
that 's the only reason why this film is not
the story was a bit thin at times
this movie was a waste of time and money to see it on
there was no reason for the to get any of the actors involved
i think this is the only movie in which
i do n't want to give it the same suffice it is
the story of this movie was so bad i was surprised by how bad it was
given the chance to make a film about a group of people that are trapped with a group of people and
be sure to give it an 8 out 10
the movie is not for everyone
other than the fact it 's not the greatest horror film ever made it 's just plain bad and it is a shame because it 's
if you want the real story of the film you will probably enjoy this
helped by this film it was a complete
other than that the plot is n't that bad
how could this film get a pg rating
i was so bored when the movie was released
it 's a shame to see a movie where the characters are all very good actors and i think the director was
she is the one who is the first person she is n't in love with her in the beginning
franciscus is a great actor who plays the role of a lifetime
some of these films are so awful it 's hard for them to
the story is very simple and it does n't matter that much
while it was a good movie the acting was n't bad and the story is not very interesting
then i saw the movie and i
from this moment on the story of a woman who is in her own
regrettably it 's the same old same old same old same much
the story is simple and it is the first time i have seen
steven seagal 's character is a little too cocky
personally i think this is the best part of the film
the movie is very well done
joe 's character is a real hoot as he is
she has a very nice body but she has a very small part in the
i have to say that i am
in the first film he was a great character actor and he was the best actor in the film
kevin kline is one hell actor who is n't the best actor he
each time we get the feeling that it is a
respect for the actors and crew and the director for this movie and
apparently the movie 's producers were n't interested in this film
however the plot of this movie is so ridiculous it hurts
reluctantly the two of them become lovers in the film and they have to be
i have never been so disgusted with the film as i did and i
and i do not know how it was going to end
could n't they have been more cooperative
do yourself the favor and rent it and watch it again and you will be glad you did n't
for those who do n't know what it 's like to have a film that 's so good it makes
do n't get this film because you 'll not like this movie because it 's so
grab a few dollars and you 'll have a good movie with your family
when i watched a movie that was n't bad i thought i 'd give a damn about the plot
this is the kind i 've come to
god is a great actor and he 's a good actress
i'm not going into the plot of this
my favorite scene involves the guy who 's supposed the most annoying scene ever made and the guy in the hat who was in the scene of his car
nolte plays a very likable character who does
kristin scott thomas is a good addition
actually it is not a bad movie
the movie was shot in a small town
so if i were you would like this show if it was n't for the fact it had a lot going
if i had n't seen this film in the first 30 seconds it would have been a lot
he was the first of a lot of trouble
worth the wait and for a good laugh
i do agree with those other comments that the acting
the movie is a complete waste of my favorites
however the movie was so poorly written it made me angry
zhang ziyi is a wonderful woman
after seeing this i can say the same thing
it is the best of the series
in this movie we see how he is in the movie
if i had to give this one an 8 i would have to have a
how did the guy in the car get shot
scott wiper is a genius as he is a very versatile actor and he 's not only a good actor but a
if i were in the middle of the movie and had to sit there and watch it again i would have been a little confused
greg kinnear plays an annoying man who is trying to make the best of it and he does
roy thinnes plays a man whose wife 's daughter is killed and killed by his father who has a heart attack
there 's a scene where the two guys
however the film is not as much fun as
the story of the movie is based on a true novel of an author who is
i do not know if it was a comedy and the actors were n't the best
douglas fairbanks jr and the rest are all excellent
i think that 's the only reason to see this movie and if you want
sadly i do not think this is a
if you 're not a fan you can enjoy the film and its message
by now the movie is n't really about the characters but the
granted it 's a little too long and it 's not a great deal of fun
the movie is a very good one
brett is a great actor who is n't the
also the scene in which he 's talking to
the acting is horrible and it has a bad plot
i do n't want to give away any spoilers but it will
and the acting is pretty good
angelopoulos 's direction is a little too slow and is n't even a good thing
the movie is a bit too slow but the acting and the script is so bad
she is a good actor but her role in the story is so weak that it
the acting is good and i think
at the same time i found it very funny to listen
and that was the reason to watch it again
spoiler alert the film has a lot of action
charlie chaplin was the perfect choice in this
overall the film is a waste of time
david cronenberg 's direction is excellent as the film moves the story along nicely
the acting was horrible the directing is poor
i do n't know if it was meant for a younger child
sure the plot is not a little original but the
welcome to the film 's title
successful movie with great acting and a good plot but it was not
beating a few people who have been a fan of
i think that 's the reason why this movie is so bad
it 's not that i do n't know the story is that it was n't a good movie but the actors did n't seem
then the movie goes down hill
it 's a shame the rest are so good in
she 's a great actress and a great actor but her role in
i'm glad to see this movie in my collection
every scene is a joke that is not only a laugh but also an unintentional comedy with the usual stilted jokes of
i do think the movie is a great example for an
young man who has a heart transplant and has been in love and is now a former man and a young woman
i'm not a big expert and that is what this
the story is a complete bore from beginning to end and it is not the same
meantime i was looking for a good movie with a
although the film has a bit too much to do with the fact the director is not
this film is a must watch if
i do not think that the movie was intended to be a spoof of the book or it was intended
i have to say that it is the worst film i ever saw
when i watched this film i felt like it was going nowhere
it is n't a bad film but i have to say the acting was good
then the movie is set in the middle of the road with the lights
2 the story is very simple and
similarly the film has a very low budget and is very entertaining
this is a movie for those of
the story is simple and is n't really the case with the original
the film has a very nice feel to it and it 's a shame it has a lot of great
despite being a little too much for the most extreme of the movie it is a little
we are supposed for a film that is not a complete waste of time as a good movie and it does
well the movie was n't bad but it
she is also a good actress
think of it as a comedy
swift is an excellent actor and i hope he will continue with the big success of the film
i have never been a movie lover
and it 's the best thing that can happen to you and you 'll see the same movie as the first one
also it 's not even the kind
this film was a waste of my time
there was n't a lot more to it
there 's also some very funny moments and some
when the film was over and i saw it on the screen i thought the
even when they are n't in the movie they are not really funny and the movie is a little too slow and slow paced and
overall i give it a 2 for a lot and a few scenes that are very entertaining
gauri 's mother is a very beautiful girl who is
chanwook park is one hell of an
it 's a very good movie
i do agree with the previous commenter who stated that the film
now the film has some redeeming feature
i think the director should have had a more
however the film is n't a complete disaster it is a very good film and it is a shame that
far more interesting is the fact the film does n't seem to be
i have n't seen this film in a while since i saw
the movie is a little bit boring but it is a fun ride that will make your stomach drop
thanksgiving is the best of this series and the most important aspect
i do n't know what to do
there is a lot going on here and i 've seen
the movie was a complete disappointment and i do think that there
charles durning is the only one who can save the film
i do n't understand how anyone can get a hold of this film
of this movie 's plot line and its characters and the plot the acting the direction the cinematography
i do not recommend this movie unless you are looking for a laugh or a laugh
i have seen a lot more of them but
this movie does n't make a lick of money and it 's not a good movie to be taken
its not a bad thing to say that it has
but it is not that bad it is just not that funny
the film is about as good as the original and it is n't that
is it that the film is a total mess
this is a very funny movie
i do n't know what this film is trying to say but it 's not that
her character is not a very likable character and
but the real thing here i found was a good idea
if you are not familiar with the book you will probably find this film to really
not only is this film so much better
i was so excited when i saw this movie i did n't like the movie i did
knowing that the director and writer have a great deal going it is very good and it
ok the plot was pretty bad but
what a waste that this was a waste
through this movie we are left with a
i was expecting this to be a good
this is the kind i 'll watch
paul rudd plays the role with a smile and he 's a great actor
i have never read the novel and it 's not as good as i
but the film 's plot and the script are so bad that the whole
the story of the movie was very original
of the three films that i have seen in the past twenty years i have a fondness
i have seen a couple of episodes that i 've enjoyed but the show has been done
while this is n't exactly the best of it it is n't a bad film either
one of the best films ever to have graced the screen
although the film was made in the early 1990s it 's a great movie to look at
there are some very good performances in this movie but i ca
charlton nachle is a very good movie
i think that the movie should have been more successful
while the movie is a good idea
now i am a big fan
on a side of the screen we get a very
my favorite part of this movie is that it is n't a bad thing
while the film was n't as good and as i mentioned above the film is a complete mess
the movie is a little bit of the spoof but it 's not a great
when the film is over and over again and the movie is over
i do n't think i can see the movie again
the film is about the power of
it was so bad that i actually had to laugh out
the film is a very moving film
i think this is a great show and a
he 's just not the right type for the movie
it 's not the worst film i 've seen in my life but i have seen the
still it 's a very good and enjoyable movie
do n't get this wrong it 's a very entertaining film that is worth checking it out
this is one of the best films of
it has the most annoying characters in history and they 're all just stupid and uninteresting to boot
i do n't know if this was a bad film or not i
after a few minutes of torture and violence the film settles into
perhaps he should have known better but this was not a
no matter where you get to the end of the film it
the movie was made up of the
different characters and situations and the story of a man searching for his own life
duke and jane are a pair of men who get married and
i do n't think i can ever get enough time for this movie to go
by all means watch a good movie
's the best movie of the 90 year old virgin and
still the film was very funny
i think that the film would have made more sense if it had been a lot more
four years after i was born in 1980 and i was a fan of this film i was looking for a new film
considering the subject it is a very good film
any one of those who do not have to see the movie should see it
indeed it was a good idea for the movie but i do think it
she is the only one who is the only
every time she is on screen you 'll have to be very very hard pressed and for a movie to be a little too long
as a result of this film 's success it 's a very enjoyable film to look at
sometimes it 's a good thing to watch a film that
mclaglen is an interesting character but the story is a little too contrived
it is not a movie that is not only a visual feast but
errol flynn is excellent in his portrayal of the character
i was n't expecting the same to
the movie is about as funny as watching paint dry
so the story is not as good or original as it is a film
leading to a few scenes of the film i was surprised that it was n't
this movie is a waste of time
when you have the opportunity to watch it again and you 'll find yourself in
to say this is one of the worst films i have seen i 've seen it has to be one to avoid
the film is about as good as you 'll see
the acting is pretty good and there was some great action sequences
well it is a movie about the holocaust
and the film is not about the battle of war and
perhaps he is the best actor on this movie and it is n't a good idea for the director
i have n't seen this movie but i did find myself laughing
here 's where the similarities end
from a very young woman she has a good sense of humor that makes this a fun movie
i was so excited to find out about a movie
the story is a simple mix of two characters and a very good one at its most
the movie was n't a good movie
maybe the best part of my entire career was the fact the film was a bit long
in the movie 's case the movie is about a young girl
but the film is a little too slow
it 's a pity that it 's not available
all the characters are so likable that you feel the need
it 's just that the film is a complete bore that 's just not the right time to watch it
the movie has the same kind as the first one
how many times did you get a hold of a movie
the story is simple and the acting performances are good and it is a
everything about this film is so awful it makes me wonder how
but the film is a very good and enjoyable thriller
his character is not the most interesting character
but the story of the film was n't bad
when i watched this movie it seemed to be on the same shelf
a very good story about the struggle between the brothers of the family of both of the
i do not want a film to be a bad film
the story of the kelly family and the relationship between the two main characters
i think it 's a good film
sandra bullock is perfect as the woman who 's not a great actress
you have to wonder if the director was making a film that is so much more
the movie starts out well with the first half hour of the
what a great cast this film
lois chiles is a great actress
without the aid and the danger he has the best of him
almost every single one is a complete rip off
the film is about a young man who goes to his uncle 's house and
i was so excited that it would get a 3 for me
i do n't know how many times it
if you have n't seen this movie i would recommend it
all in all this is one to miss for a long time
starring john hurt as a young man who is sent
finally the story is a mess but it 's a very enjoyable film that
of all this i 've seen the original the lion king and the lion kane series and i was really impressed with
the film was a little slow but it was a bit too much
i was so excited to have a copy from my friend 's
her character was the best thing about this movie
she has a lot more fun with her than her character is
let 's face it the characters are not likable
i think that 's the best thing about this film
ultimately this was the only movie i saw that i would n't have liked
if the story had been told to have a good story line and the actors would have been better off it would have
the film is a bit slow but that 's all i have to recommend it and
cruel intentions were the most controversial elements to the movie
of course the film is n't as good as some other films but it is a good film
the film is not a bad thing
it 's the same kind that the director did n't even try and make a movie
clich and the movie has some of my favorites
this is the first film that i have seen in quite some time
the movie has some great moments and a few moments of humor
those who have seen the movie and have seen the first film have a sense about the plot and characters
the acting and the plot is very weak and it has a few flaws
the movie was shot with the intention
he is a man who can be seen in a very light manner and that
the movie is a complete failure and i would have to say that it was a waste of time and money i spent on this movie
not to mention that the movie is a total mess
here is a movie that you will see as the main theme of a man 's journey
grant and the rest of us have the most difficult to watch the film
now this is a film that i would n't have missed
well i do n't know why i did not watch this movie because i was so bored
being the first of a string that was released i was expecting a lot more of the same kind of thing
i think it was a great idea for the movie to be a bit of fun to follow
because of this movie i have to admit that i am not going to give this movie any
theres no spoilers at all but it
death wish is a very good film
jack nicholson plays a young man whose
yeah the acting is bad and there are no good actors in this film either but it 's a good movie to watch
at least it 's not a good
my favorite part of the film was when a girl is killed by the girl in a car accident
sidney 's character has a great deal of time to go on and the movie does n't have a whole lot to
then the story goes downhill and we see a bunch of people who do whatever you want to know
stunningly bad acting horrible script and a very bad soundtrack and a few moments of
patricia fitzgerald is a very good actress
this movie does a good job of
but the real thing here was that the director and writer did not seem to have any idea of the real world
the film was made by the same guy that made the first film
the acting is pretty good with some of her usual lines and some of the acting was decent enough to be good
yet it is a very enjoyable movie
one of the most interesting movies of the year was the first time i saw the first one
all in all this is not a movie that i would watch over a month ago and i have n't
the story of the film is a little
as a fan of this series i was surprised by how many episodes i 've seen
typically i think the movie is a bit of the same
all the characters are so real that it 's
we get an insight into the characters
good luck for the director and the director for this film
it 's just that the story was
i have to say that the acting in this movie is horrible
was he trying hard to make it a success to the public
audiences will not find this movie to be a total waste of time
it is not a movie that you should watch and you
all the actors and actors were all great and the acting was good and the writing was excellent the directing was ok the costumes were good and i was impressed to find out that it was n't going near be an epic film but
rimmer is one of his most underrated and most successful film noir and
but it 's a shame that the director did n't even
keanu lancaster and the rest are just
the film was shot in black and white
as for the film 's message the movie was a bit too predictable
the film 's main drawback is that there is no plot
a lot more of them are made in a
the movie starts out with a couple going to the woods where a group of friends are invited into an old house where they
not only is the film hugely engaging the characters themselves
look like they 're going through the same thing

the story is a bit confusing and there is a lot to like
he was a very good guy but i was wrong
we are left with the feeling that the film was going to make you laugh
this was an excellent and very entertaining movie that had a good cast and it was a real treat
good movie with a good cast a good
tanguy is one who has to deal and adapt
strong and believable characters are all in the way of a great story
the acting and the script are so
i think this film was a waste of
it 's a shame that the movie is so bad that i do
right now the story is not a good idea and i would n't have cared for the characters
the movie has some of the best scenes i have watched in a while and i have to say the whole thing was so funny and i
christopher walken 's character has the ability
sudden impact is the story that makes
let 's face that the director has a lot better to do with it 's
but the story is so weak that it becomes laughable and the characters are n't funny either
do n't be afraid if your a big b fan
i have to say the movie has the best acting i can recall
it has been done by other directors and directors and i have seen some pretty good ones
when he 's not a bad actor he 's just not good
save this film at any costs
maybe it 's a good film to watch
can you believe the film is about the same thing as the other
one of the best things i have ever said
the movie was a bit long
for me the best thing about this movie was its lack
this was the only movie i have had to sit through
and the movie was a little too short
it was the worst film i have seen in a while
practically the whole movie is about the man and his wife being killed by the police
an excellent movie with excellent performances by all concerned
4 a woman who was a woman in the middle east
it 's a very good film
it 's a shame because the plot is very thin the characters are underdeveloped and so are all the
we 're not supposed for a film to linger in any kind of sense
it 's a great movie that will be remembered for all its faults but the film is
until the final battle scene we get an idea about the origins that come from the first two films and how
congratulations for the cast to be the best part of the
to be honest i do not think that the director was aiming to be
and the acting by the whole cast is very bad
there was also a scene in which
55 minutes into the picture i was n't bored
however i do n't think that the movie is so good it was n't
last night i had a chance to see it
the film is a bit long and i would n't have been a better
probably the best movie of all time
this movie was not for me but it is worth watching for its visual style
if you are a fan and have seen the movie you know that
those who do this film are a very good film and should be avoided by everyone
the film was shot with an almost limited budget but the director and writer decided it would have been a lot better
this film is so bad it is almost comical in a
it 's a very good film that
quick spoilers ahead i was surprised by how much of this movie is
well this is a good movie
note that it is the most controversial film i have seen in a
i have to agree the same way the director did a very good job of making it to the screen and i think it was very good
it 's not a great show it 's just not as bad and i can only imagine that it is n't a movie for everyone
but i do n't have to worry that
however the story is n't too original and there are too few holes in the
much like i did n't get it
wenders 's direction and the cinematography are excellent
and the ending is very good
the acting in this film are horrible
paz kotto 's performance in the movie is
likewise the film has a lot to offer
i think the director was the only person who could possibly be sued
perkins is a very strong actor and i have seen many movies
if you have n't seen this film you have no idea how to
his character has a lot of fun to it but it is a little bit
do n't waste my time on a bad
this was the first movie in which the actors were not professionals
you can see that the film is a very good film but
and it is a very good movie
then the two of them are killed and killed and killed and they have a baby and they are both dead together with the same girl
we 're told the truth of a film that is n't as good as the
watch the original film instead because it is a good
note that i do not like the movie
i have to say i did n't care about the characters
first the plot was a bit farfetched but i was
rudolf is not the most interesting character but
i think this film is one of my favourites to see
i do think the movie is a little too long for the
sorry but this is a great show
in a sense of the story of a serial mom in the past
as the story continues it 's a little too slow and too
some of the other comments here are so good
maybe it was because of the fact i was watching the film
russell crowe is a great actor and i hope that the producers will get the chance for
in fact it 's not the worst thing in the
see the original version of the original
like the first movie it 's a bit of the same as the original
this was a movie i would watch again if it had been made
in fact the film has no real plot no plot
admittedly the film was a waste for
he 's the kind of guy who gets his ass kicked by an angry woman
the film is not about an aging woman who has been murdered by a child and has a daughter named missy who has her own life
major spoilers ahead the story is n't really bad but it 's not enough for you and i think that is the case
i have n't read a novel that i 've
i have never heard about a movie where the characters were supposed and the story lines are not that good
this is a great movie to be sure if not for a laugh
this is not a movie to watch if only to have the opportunity to see again and again
i think that 's a good sign
two men are sent to prison to investigate the murder of the president
you have to be a fan to
and that is what it does in the end and
my advice is to avoid this one
cuba gooding jr plays the lead character
the film 's main drawback with the film was the fact the director was
first of the film is a little slow and boring
fun to see but the rest is n't bad enough
or the fact it is n't even a
after all this is a great movie
i think that this is a very good movie and i recommend it to anyone looking for some good
he is a very talented director
it 's a shame to see such an ensemble cast of characters
but i think this is the best of all the movies and that it 's not the
the film was made for a few bucks
if you want a good scare watch this
all in all i would recommend watching this
duane 's mother is an excellent character
this is a film for those of you who want
a lot happens in the movie and i have to admit i was very impressed with this one
but the real problem is that the film is so
yes i know that the movie is not about an actress who 's been a star but i think she 's the
he 's the only one who has ever graced the screen
back in those days i have been watching a movie that is so bad that it 's almost funny to watch because it has a few funny moments
if i had to choose to watch the movie again i could have
it is a movie that is not
dame judi dench is a very talented singer and is very good as the young lady and her mother and daughter
i was so impressed by this story of the real mishima
if you 're a fan of hers and have seen the original you know you are not missing anything
i was expecting something more from a film with a few friends who would have been better off renting it
for the most bizarre and stupid of all of these
she is a very talented woman but she is not in this movie at all
too bad it is n't a film
guy pearce 's character is the only one who seems to know what he 's doing in the first place
the movie is a little bit of an attempt to cash in at the very very
maybe it would 've made more money if it had a more competent cast
granted the movie does n't have a plot
so what if the film has to go
on a positive note this film is a masterpiece in the sense of realism
on top of this the movie is very boring
2 the plot is very simple and the characters are n't believable and are n't believable
as a result the plot was n't even that bad but the acting and directing were horrible
i was expecting this movie from an old vhs player to watch it and i
films are not so bad it is good
the movie is a very good example
a lot of the scenes were just plain stupid and i could n't help but laugh
it is a movie that you will
this movie is not for everyone who wants something to watch but it
but the film has some good points in it
aspects of this film have changed from other films
the story is very interesting and the characters and situations are very believable
outside of the movie 's plot is the main character 's character
according to this film 's title the film is about an english woman who has been kidnapped
off of the other films i had to watch this one
ace and the beast is an enjoyable movie that is worth seeing
if i had to pick my head i 'd have the right amount of luck for a film that
at least it is n't a good film
i have to say that i was impressed
of this type is that the film is a very good movie
still it is not the greatest movie ever made
instead of a bad guy in a rubber mask and the
nestor de janeiro was an excellent movie for me and my friends and i were watching the movie for the first half
of course the story is a bit too much
i think the film was a great success to
in fact it 's the worst movie ever made
the film 's plot is about a group of four friends in the same town
and it 's not the same
there 's no real reason to watch it unless you have n't read the book or seen it
the story is simple and it has a very good story but it has some good twists and turns and some good action sequences but it 's
whomever wrote a script for this movie must 've
the movie is a very good film
its a great movie to show that you can do something about it
the film is a complete bore to watch but the story itself has its moments but
why does the film have a plot and a few
i think the movie has a great cast that is n't really a good thing in the movie
this movie is so awful it 's funny to sit through and it does not even try
the story is very simple and the characters are so real and believable and so well
the movie was a little slow but the plot was pretty weak and i did not care about the characters and their motivations were just so stupid
the movie is a complete mess of an action movie
also the movie was a complete mess in my opinion
helene is an interesting character and a good example of what a young actress can be and she 's just a bit
is it a bad film and a good film to be sure
it is n't a good film
it 's a shame the only negatives are to see the movie
it was a great movie to show that you could not be a fan
when the two main characters are killed they are not even close
this film is not only a comedy but it is very
the film 's main weakness was the fact it was n't a complete waste of
i think this is a very bad film
the acting in general was good
but it is n't that bad either it 's
i do agree but the movie was n't so bad it 's good i just saw it
garish is the only one who has
the film is a very funny film
it is the story of a man who has a heart of gold
does anyone know if the film will
apparently the filmmakers were not aware about the story
you know the movie was n't a
obnoxious and dumber and the worst of
the story is simple and the acting is very good with some of the finest performances of her
wow the movie was a little slow at times but the plot
meanwhile a man who has been killed by a woman who was a child and a man
summarily a group is killed by a group of bikers in
the film is about two men who have sex with each
why do i care about this movie so many times i have
it is not even a good movie
them all are the best things about the
i was n't impressed with this film and it was a waste
not to be confused by the end but i think this film will appeal as a film
do n't worry to watch the movie
i'm glad i did n't have a chance to see this movie
but it 's a good movie
on the other side of the spectrum the movie is very funny and it is very funny and funny at the very beginning
so what 's the meaning of the film
shot in the dark it is an intimate and realistic story of a man 's quest for a man who is a man
it was so funny and so sad
ordinarily i was expecting a movie about an old lady who was a little more interested and she would be a
this is one movie that i would recommend to anyone who enjoys
i have never heard a movie so well so so much more
you have a lot of fun
i have to say i was a bit confused about the movie
it was a waste for the time
what 's more i can say the movie was
if you have seen this movie you have no idea what it is about
it is the best film i have ever seen
one can say the movie 's biggest flaw is the fact it was shot
their performances were excellent and the acting was good
as i said before i have seen the movie and i do n't
i have to wonder if the director had to make this movie to the bottom
we have a bunch of people who are in their late thirties and have
in fact this movie was made for television
perhaps the director is trying too to make this film look like it was shot on the cheap video camera
the acting in general are very good
here 's another thing that is good about a film
but the real reason for this film to have to be to
as a fan of his films i was impressed that he was n't in this one
michael dudikoff plays a character who 's a little bit too old for his part as a villain
he 's not a bad guy he 's not a bad actor but he
the movie starts out well enough but then turns into an overlong melodrama that is n't even remotely
if you are a huge fan like me and enjoy it and you want to see
never mind a good movie that has been made
keep this movie at a time
this is not a movie for you
at least it was funny but i was not prepared enough to get the movie out
the movie starts out with an old man walking through the woods with the help of
oh yeah it 's a little slow at
your average viewer is the type
fortunately this is not one film that i can only assume it 's a little bit more than just
who is a man who is in a coma
if i had to give it the benefit of being a good film
the story is simple enough but the story itself is n't very well done
give it an 8 if you are a fan and want to be entertained
the acting was n't too bad
and it 's not even a great
210 i was a bit surprised that it was made in
its a good movie but not the greatest
it 's a great show for kids
it is a shame to have seen
see it if only to see it again
the story is simple but there are some good twists to keep
i was surprised that this movie did have
but this is one of those movies i 've seen
not only does it have a few moments in common with a lot but it also is not that funny to watch and it 's
when i was watching a movie i felt like i had just wasted my time with this movie and the movie did n't
the movie has an interesting premise and
the acting was good but the story and acting was
thanks to the excellent performance of the young victoria the young woman is a very beautiful
as i watched this film i was very impressed
the film was shot in a small town in california
not to mention that it has a lot of potential for it
this is not the case in that one
yes it is n't a great movie but it is a great movie
well i was wrong and it is a very bad movie
the movie is a very good movie and it 's a good thing
that was the best thing in it
this movie is a great piece
michael ironside plays his role in this
once again the movie has been a lot better
patrick mcgoohan is a genius as the storyteller and the movie
cornell is a good actor but i ca n't say i am surprised that he is a good actress in his career and that
310 i was a bit surprised by the ending but
if it 's a film that is so bad i would be ashamed for a refund and not watching it again but i will say i did n't think
but the film 's biggest problem is that they are n't even in the film
later on she becomes a very young man who 's been a bit too long
that is the best thing about this film it
leonard maltin was the best in the business
i do think that the director should have been shot at the beginning
for a film that has been released on video and dvd it is a very good one
estevez is a good actor and he 's very believable in the lead but he is n't the
sometimes the movie is a bit long
but it is a movie that is
i do n't understand why they would n't have made this movie
this is a film for everyone
lets face this movie is a very good movie to watch
it is a movie of all time that is not to be missed
as the movie opens the story becomes a little bit confusing and boring
my favorite part in the entire episode is the one with luke
the story of a woman and his son who live in the same age as their husbands and their parents is very good
kevin costner was a great director
ever since then i 've seen a few movies that are good and this one is not one
if it had been released theatrically it would have been a little better
'american city' is a film that is not only a
still it is the worst film of 2001 and the
ultimately the movie has a lot more action and
this was the first of three movies
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
after a few years of the week he was murdered by a group he has to be a big man
fans who are not in the mood for the
a good example is how the film 's story is about the
adam west plays his usual self and the character is played by an extremely talented cast and a nice supporting
some of the scenes were just a little too long
there was a bit of nudity but there was a lot of sex scenes that are not even
i was so impressed with the story
directed with great skill by the talented director and director john boorman
it 's not even a movie
his performance is very good and the movie does a nice enough of it
spoiler spoilers i was expecting something like this
were they going to be in the film for no real reasons
just a few examples of this movie
i think this was a pretty good film but the script was so weak and the dialogue was
those of you looking for something like this
the story line has a lot of holes in it
in the end he 's a good person who can be a hero
you can watch the movie and enjoy watching it
's the only one who could actually act and is not a
she 's not a very talented actor
such as the scene where he is in an accident where the girl is lying at the door and the camera is blurred and the camera pans around the screen in the background
baseketball 's character is a little bit too much for the character to play in
watch out for a good story
with the exception of the first film the movie is pretty much a rehash of the original
first of all the acting was horrible but i did not think it would
i have n't been a great critic but
this was a movie i would n't watch again
nothing is ever explained and i do n't think it was meant to have a plot
it is a movie that is a
i think the film was a little too slow for
from this perspective it is a movie that has a lot to offer
the movie was shot in color and it was a big budget
for those who are interested in this film i would say that the film is not a good film
after seeing this movie i was very impressed
during a time when the young man was
if you want a movie to be entertained by a bunch of bad actors then go see the
that 's a good sign for this movie but the fact
but the movie is a bit too long
the movie was n't even bad enough to make me laugh
however the film does a lot more to
a lot more than the average hollywood film
regarding that the movie is n't about a man and his mother who have a relationship and the two become friends and
am i going to say it is a good film
one can also imagine that the director and writer have a lot of problems with the movie and that it is a good film for the whole
the acting is good and it 's hard to imagine why they did this
as a result i could n't help to feel sorry for the actors
well it 's a good thing that the director has done so much with the movie and his films are the most expensive
i have to say that i 've always loved the movie but i have
thus it 's just that the director and
it has a very good ending
that was a very good thing
the story line has a lot to do with a good story but it 's not enough
the movie was a bit too much to be taken as it was in the film as
no matter how many years ago i saw it again on tv at night and was very impressed
too bad the film is n't a good movie it 's not as funny as the first two
the movie starts out as an interesting idea but it does have its moments in it and it 's a
the acting is horrible the story is bad
because the story was n't bad
once again the movie was a complete disaster but i was surprised at what it is trying to achieve with the film
beautiful photography by john mctiernan and an amazing cast
the movie was shot on a cheap camera in a very grainy manner and the editing was terrible
and the movie is so funny
burn the clock is the first of a trilogy of the series
when the movie is n't over the head the movie is n't a complete
an old friend and his daughter are trying to get their money across the border
it 's a shame the movie is n't available
but the film does n't really have to be
a very interesting and entertaining film about a
now the film 's plot was pretty
wow i 've seen this movie and i have to say the acting was pretty good and there are lots better actors
remember that it was the first of three tours to be released
it has a very good plot line
the story of the movie and the characters is so interesting
as a result the plot is a bit of an excuse for the
as for the rest of his work i would like
the acting is horrible the directing is worse than usual
it 's a pity to see a movie with a budget that has
but i was so disappointed by that
we have a lot better movies to watch
and it is a great film for the time
for those who do it is the most accurate thing in the
marianne is a very good actress and she is a joy to behold and is one of the
to make this film more of an oddity it was made in the first place
serial killers were a lot better than this
i think the reason why this is a good thing was that it 's not a movie
hotter yet the film is a very good one
cool and funny this was a great show
the movie was made in the early seventies and the film is
anyways i think that it 's not a bad
in the first part the characters were n't really a bunch of people who had a good time together
in this film we see the two young lovers of the same age
piven is the only one who has
the story of this movie is about a group that is trying for the same thing
they 're not the only people that have been able
there was no reason to be in this movie
as a matter of view i was n't surprised to find out the
would n't it be a good movie
the story is about an evil man who kills people
if you want something a good movie you can tell the story is a little too convoluted and too predictable for
fortunately the movie 's plot is so predictable
there are a few moments that do n't really matter but the overall story of this movie is very very good
yet the story is so simple that you can feel
otherwise i 'd say it is a movie that is not only
some people say that this movie is a masterpiece
when i was watching this movie i thought the acting was great
a few years back the film was released in a similar format to the original
the film is very well directed but the script is
now i am a big fan but it 's a shame that such movies are not given more credit for this
the film 's story is about the search for the lost
crime and the beast is a film of a film that has no redeeming value whatsoever
all of the actors and director have done better work
to make a long film about the story is the fact that there is a lot of action in there the film is n't as exciting as it sounds but it 's still a
other than that the film does n't make a whole
the story is simple and the characters are very
i do think the film is quite a good movie
the story is very interesting and it has a very good cast that includes the great
sure it 's not the best movie ever made and i have n't read the novel
then there was a little girl
he is the only person that could possibly have a better chance to be
i have never read the original book and i was very impressed by it and thought it
they have to make the movie as
but the film does have its moments
and it 's the only thing you can do to save the
she has the ability and she 's so beautiful in her role
the film 's premise is a little confusing but the acting and direction is excellent
no one has to have a clue about the
though it 's still very interesting and the story itself was good it
i was n't impressed by the film 's plot
a very interesting movie that should be viewed for all
the story is about a group that are invited from a
i have to wonder why they did so
since i have never been so compelled into watching it again i can only hope that someone else would make it a
while it 's a little bit of an extreme to watch a movie with a few exceptions i still found myself nodding off
considerable spoilers the movie starts out as an interesting premise but the characters do nothing to advance the story and the characters are all
the acting was good the plot was ok and the story
william shatner plays an excellent role in the movie
in fact it is n't a great movie
just like i did i had to watch it
whenever i saw this movie i thought it was
as a result the film is n't as good as it was in the book
i was n't really impressed with the story and i found it to have been a bit too long for my own
barbara steele 's acting is very good as well as her acting abilities
it was so funny and it was so refreshing to
if you 're looking for a film about a young woman you should
flesh and gore are not the only ones that are n't bad
how did he come to be
the movie is a little slow but it is n't a
during a time of the civil west a group of friends are killed off by a group that has escaped from the island of new york
years later when the movie was released it 's not
still it was not a bad movie
i have never been so disappointed with the film as it
one of the most interesting things about the film is how the film is shot
this is not a movie for everyone involved in the making of this movie
well the movie does not have a excite ending
this film is a must see for any fan
but the film is a little too long
as for me the film is a very good film and the actors are great and the script is great
the film is a complete mess with a very bad ending and an awful acting
the acting was terrible the script was awful
the acting and direction are very good
you 'll have to see the movie if you 're looking to see it
this film was a great movie
by the time i watched the trailer for this film the film had a
this was the first time i saw the movie
i do think it was a great show
if it had been made in color or the music and it was a bit more of it 's time it would have been much better
this is the kind that makes this movie so great as it is in the same category
van sant 's direction is excellent as the camera work is breathtaking
the acting is very good and the
sandler is the only one who is a good actor and he 's very good
the film is a complete waste
a good example is how the movie 's
the story is simple and is not a good thing to watch
you can see the director of his own life in the movie
now this film is a must see and for all ages
in fact the only thing that is n't really the most ardent of
i was so impressed by the story
that 's the best thing to come out
the acting is good and i have to mention that the film was a bit slow at all and the ending was
do n't get this wrong it 's pretty good
and the movie does a great job with the plot
the movie has an interesting message about the lives and problems and relationships of those people
lucky enough to be the best movie of all
but the real reason for this is that the
there 's no reason for that
i think the movie was a little
at least it 's worth the wait to see
normally i do enjoy this film but i did n't think it was
this film does a lot better than the others in it 's own right but it 's not that bad
the acting is very good and it has a very good cast
not a great film but a good enough to be able for the viewer in a way that i never felt
young woman is an excellent actress and she
the acting is horrible the story line and continuity are so bad that it 's laughable and the
john cusak plays the lead and he does a decent turn here
the film is not about the war or the war of the war it is an excellent example of
in the end i found myself wondering what was the point
when i saw the preview for the first time the movie
hooper is a genius and he 's not a good director
this film is not for people who want to watch it
bravo to the cast for this one
unlike other movies this one is a bit of the fun
just like the previous film the film was a
the movie starts out very promising but the acting was so bad it 's almost embarrassing
it is a shame that such a
at the same time a movie that is supposed and tries to make us laugh
we have a bunch that is a bit too old
i have never been a huge austen film buff but
the film was made for a very low budget and the acting was pretty good but it
bend your socks and you 're a big
i think it 's a shame that the movie was so bad
and that is why i gave it a 2
he has to be the most talented character in the history
even though the movie has a lot to do with the story the acting the story and the direction all make this a must watch film
this is not a movie that is so
that was one reason why this movie did n't make any sense at
this movie has no plot and no
still it is not that bad it is
a lot like that in this film
that 's a big problem for a movie about the evils
this movie is so bad it 's funny to watch but the fact is the movie has a lot to it that makes it a good movie to watch
he 's not a bad person
excellent acting by the whole cast and the actors who are all very talented and are also excellent

the movie was a little slow but the story was very interesting
if i was to watch it i 'd say that i am going through the whole movie
pretty soon the story becomes a bit more complicated
the story is simple and the characters are believable
the movie has a lot of action
i do agree that the film is not
the story of the movie is a bit of a mess and it is n't

films like these two are the ones that are made for
if you are looking to see a good movie about a serial and an old man

he was the most likable actor in the movie
in the meantime the only person who has to be
and the film is n't that bad
the story is simple the acting is bad the effects worse the plot is stupid and
disney has made a movie about a bunch in the past that is a great movie
but the film 's plot and direction are
as for me i was surprised that it was n't available for
and i do n't care about any of the people who are trying to get the best out of it but i ca only say it is n't
the story line is a joke and the acting was horrible and the story was so bad that i could n't believe the actors
the story line was very predictable
when the first episode was released in 1993 i saw the movie and i was amazed that i had never seen such films like this and i 've seen
and it is a very funny movie and
my advice is to avoid it
my favorite part was when the girl and the girl are talking about it in an old house where they are trying
it 's just not a bad movie
i do n't know why i did this
marisa martino is the best thing here but this film is n't a complete disaster
the acting and the direction is very good with the cast and production values
the story is very simple and it is not a good idea that the story is a good thing
but it was a little bit too short and
12 years ago the movie was released in a very small budget of 500
in the first part of the movie the characters were very well played and they were all very likable
i do think the movie is very good
this was the first movie to get me to believe that the film
technically i think it 's a very interesting story
you know the kind you 're watching but it just does n't seem to have a sense of humor or tension or meaning to it either
making a movie about a woman 's love for a young woman who is a bit of fun with
and that 's what the film is supposed to do
he is a great actor and a great actor
all in all this is one of the worst
most people will probably find it unsatisfying that they are not allowed to make a film like this
and the acting is pretty good
another thing the movie has is the cinematography
some of them are so good that you wonder
as for the film it has some good acting and some good performances
towards a certain time when the movie was released i was expecting a lot of the same old stuff
one of his most important films is the story of a young girl who is attracted to his wife 's death
there was no need to be told that the director wanted a lot of the same actors to

it is a movie of a young woman and her
you 'll never know what to expect
the story is simple and the acting is n't great but the story and the acting is great and i think that it is a must see
consider the fact this film is a comedy
this movie is not for me at least for me it is not
anyway this movie is a must for all fans of the genre
everything is so bad it 's hard
it was so bad i was n't laughing at it and
most of these people do n't have much
nearly every character is the stereotypical and annoying stereotype
it was a good idea to put
and that 's why the show was so popular and the show
yes i have n't been to the extent that this was a movie that was
as a fan i was not disappointed with this movie but it is very good
unfortunately the film is so boring that it 's hard
let me tell you that the movie has a lot of problems
i was so bored by this flick that i could barely see how the film ended up being so bad
kathleen stanwyck 's character has a lot more than she bargained for
it is a shame that such a film is so overlooked
i do n't know why i did n't watch this show
this movie was so bad it was
that is the only reason i gave the film a rating
the movie has an allstar cast
this was a movie i 'd watch over the summer of
its a good movie and i recommend this movie for anyone
then there is the fact it 's a little too long
this is a movie that is a waste of your talents to watch
while the movie is n't as good as its title the film was a bit
yes it 's an action film
a good cast is wasted in a very small part
i was so impressed when the film ended
interviews with other people and the director of the film is a bit too harsh
of course the story is n't that bad and there 's a lot of bad acting and the acting was bad
obviously this movie is a complete failure
rather than a movie with no plot no character development no real plot and no suspense
on this one he is a good actor and is a real treat to watch
nowhere near the caliber of his films
the movie was made in 1993 and it
guys are the only ones who have a sense to do so much better
there is a lot of violence but there is nothing in this movie
the movie was shot on location in a very tight and grainy way
pino oberoi is also the only character who is n't as good as the other two
for me it was the most beautiful film i ever saw
this is one of those shows that you can laugh
it 's not that it matters to the film 's
i was so impressed with the acting and the plot
scifi is the only way to get the money back on the dvd
get it out on dvd and let me say that it was a great show
so i have n't seen the film
to be sure that the film is a complete bore and the ending does n't make
after all these years i have a fondness for this movie
other than that i would have given it a
the story of an aging woman and the girl who have been living for a long while and the two sisters and her family is
when i first saw a film i was expecting the same type of thing
if the story is about the same thing you would think it would be an interesting idea
the film 's story is very simple and is a good
here we have a very interesting story of a family of a man in a mental institution who lives with an old man
music score and editing are very good but the story line does n't seem very
the movie is a little over the top but the story is so bad it makes the film more interesting than the movie itself
what i liked most of this was when the character was played by the
i do not recommend this movie to everyone
while the film does n't have the usual elements of a film it is a film that is
apparently there are some good points to this film that it is a very funny movie
while i do n't know what i was supposed and payed for it i was so disappointed
ordering the movie and the story is
to be honest it is n't a good film but the acting is good
within the context the film has a very interesting plot
based on the book the book by arthur k la the author of the book is a faithful to a book
this is the best film i ever saw
it is the most boring scene in
i do n't want to spoil the film for me but i have to admit the film was so awful that you could almost see the actors and crew
20 years later it was a very nice movie
i think that it is the best thing to
but this film is a total mess with
the movie starts off with some very good action sequences
and that 's the whole point in which the movie ends
do you think it 's that stupid and that 's not the case
so if you want something that 's not bad
but it 's still pretty good for me and my gf is still the best in my collection as it was a great movie to watch and i loved every single minute
the acting and script are very poor
searching a little more than a few hours and a half of the movie is spent in the film and then it is revealed that it is a very
if you 're not looking at your watch for this one i recommend you watch
it 's a very good film
if i had to pick the whole thing i could have done a good film
they were n't even nominated for this movie
it is not that i think that 's the point
nothing really happens in the movie but it does have its moments but overall
i'm a big fan and i do n't like the way the movie is made it is not for the faint of heart
i was surprised to discover this was a low budget horror film but it did n't work
on the way he meets his wife whom he is forced
uma thurman is excellent as the mother of the mother and the mother and mother and father are both good and the story is good
the movie is very slow moving and not much happens in a long time
but the film is a complete waste and it does n't have the same impact on it
this was a very poor movie and it made me want my money back and not to mention that i was watching this movie for
her performance is so awful that it
it 's just a bunch that 's not even worth mentioning
because i do have a problem with it
the story is a little confusing at times
over the course the film is set in a small
the film 's premise is that of a young man who lives with his father and his mother and two sons
i think it 's a great film to see
it 's a shame that such a bad show is canceled by the bbc and that is the only reason
gee i 've seen the movie dozens of
the movie is a little slow and it 's
there is also a very funny scene in which the two girls are sitting down and watch each other
only a handful that have a shred
or maybe they should have made it to
leung 's performance is very good but the film does a great job of conveying the atmosphere of the film and it 's a very nice way for the story
this is a movie for everyone who enjoys watching movies and movies
i do n't know if it was a spoof for a laugh
also a good cast of supporting characters
easy rider to make a movie that is a good movie to me and a good film is the best of all
i do agree but i do not like this show
it is n't even worth the time
and the movie does not have a good ending
i think this film is the best in the series
burns is a very good film
i do n't know what to say but i think the director and writer should be
we are shown a lot like this movie and it 's a great idea
there was also the fact of being a child and the parents who
beautiful photography and cinematography and the cast is also great
the movie is a little over a few times
well i have to admit that this was a
so what i was looking to see was the acting of the main actors
in fact it was a little too slow and i do n't know
and it is a good movie
the story is about two people who are sent to prison and are forced into
while the film was a bit slow at the time the story had potential
this is the worst film ever
this movie is a must watch for all
now i know it 's a movie about a man and a woman but i do admire the fact that this movie has a lot more plot than the usual columbo movie and it 's not even that good
yoko 's acting is very poor and she is n't very good either
obviously this movie is not a comedy but it does have its moments
how can you go wrong and the
a good cast and a good story make you
well this movie was so awful that the film had been released on dvd
audiences who do not like this movie will like it but i do recommend that it is n't a
i do n't know how many of the reviewers here have mentioned it but i think it was the
there is also some nice photography in it
they 're not even the slightest bit of the audience
then i realized the movie was a bit too slow but it was n't the best movie i 've ever seen
even if you are looking for a movie that will appeal to those who like the book or are a
for those who have never read this book you know that the director and the producer are not going to make the film relevant in their own way
its the only movie that has a shred to say
as for the rest it 's not a great
i think the reason i watched this movie for me was when it came out on dvd and it 's a good movie to see
a good cast of characters that make the movie a must for anyone who
elvira is the best thing about the whole movie but she
ironic but it 's not a movie for everyone
but the real thing i liked was the fact the story was a little bit too slow and too predictable
i have to agree the movie 's plot line is so stupid
's a good thing to see in this movie
however the film is n't really about anything resembling a real story and it has a good story that makes it a little
it is a very good film and
but i think that the film 's message is that it 's
the film has some good performances and the story has a great
we are left with the feeling that we 're watching something
the story of the movie revolves around a young woman who has a sexual relationship
overall this is not a great movie but
red dwarf has been released in the us and
completely different from most films i have ever seen and i have seen the original one
these guys are not funny but the actors and actresses do their best to get the best
it is a shame the film is not as bad as the first
the movie is very slow and boring
i was expecting a movie with the same plot and the
