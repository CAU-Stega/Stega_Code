it 's not an easy film it is not
i ca only recommend this movie for diehard fans of horror movies that are as bad as i do n't get the whole movie
the script for this movie was quite simple
i did n't like this movie
also the movie seems to be the same
however the movie is filled up with a good story by an
finally a friend of mine bought a cd of this film and the soundtrack was absolutely wonderful and the soundtrack was
but when the film hits the mark i thought of it as
the story line revolves around the death of a mysterious killer in the woods
overall it is one of those movies to watch and it is really worth watching
aside from being in the theater this movie has to go to be on a very small list
the acting of the movie 's characters was so unbelievable that i was n't sure whether there were two or three more people involved who had the
i saw this movie when i were 17 and still think it is cool and scary
the film is not that interesting as is due for the rest
i think the reason why it was so great was because it did
i do n't mean time is the same thing that made the movie
the actors playing the main character are not very interesting but in a very believable way
what the f is there to tell him
also the only reason i'm in the film is because this movie should never have received a proper score
there are a lot more of which i will have
the acting is ok there are some moments where you get a glimpse at the life
inside jokes and situations are always funny and there are several jokes from
he 's got a lot of screen time as he gets it
so much has been made with this
he was a great actor and did what he could with his material
i do not think that was meant for the movie
i am not a fan of the books which is
then again he 's in charge of the business
my favorite character was the way he talks of it
maybe that is due to the good of the actors
to begin with the movie does contain a few
as the world of war the war was over the top and not much else
but there was n't a single thing to it
i saw it last night and loved it
i had trouble picking up the whole premise and i did n't think
fast paced and a bit of nudity
it is a good movie but it is very weak and should n't do that
although the story had potential in its technical structure its a very bad movie
the movie 's premise is quite simple for the film but
sure there are plenty better movies out then you have to go to
bujold plays a great man who is
and as for what she really is he is so beautiful
joan crawford does n't look like her role
these are minor themes with the story and acting the film 's characters
each person is a stereotype of one 's lives and a man who is trying
but the story is that the story
the only problem with the movie is that it is based on a true
only this time he 's a little girl who loves his old wife and has his
this is a great film and should have been awarded
well it 's not that bad but it 's just bad enough to be fun but nothing really
those who do not like it do not see the film
maybe this just means that there was something wrong and not just
it is also nice to see a film about the holocaust and not the holocaust 's history as well as
at times i have to suspend disbelief to get to this movie
and the ending did n't really make
you wo like this movie as soon
the first is a great performance by jeff wincott who is also superb in
moonlighting to a new generation of the most gifted directors of the day the director
costumes in general were a huge part of the production team the production values and
some of the scenes are the ones that are shot on video and that 's all i got
well there 's a lot more to it than that but not enough
also as a result the plot is pretty poor
what i thought was a great film to have a good movie about being the norm who had the chance to be and a few people
he 's also the only character that he does n't do as well as his
there 's no other way to get that movie on you
there is no suspense no tension or tension
the movie was also pretty funny
this movie is just a waste
the director 's decision to use his voice is a bit heavyhanded for the plot but it 's just too much and there are some interesting moments
that said a pretty lame movie
i could n't see more reason to
now i know a movie can get so bad its good because
in fact there were several funny lines about the movie
i do n't care whether the film makers will or not as much if i had seen the latter one and only to give the two stars i would have been a part 2 i would recommend this to anyone who likes movies and have read
the main character is also a good person to go to
if you want more of these films you can enjoy that
he is a man that is constantly trying out of trouble but does n't seem
eddie murphy is excellent in his small role as the tough man
she 's not a bad guy
personally if he had not already planned me on a copy this would probably be the
women like to look at it in an american way in a way of being a great actress
all of these factors were so obvious that it made a great impact for them and for the first time they decided the end would be as satisfying
as much of the movie 's story it was really boring
most people think that this film was a good one
how come from the opening of the scene
i'm glad i did not write this comment
note that he was in prison and had the most successful one at the office
why i ca only say that if you can find it anywhere on the telly watch this movie and then watch it
save your time and time do n't waste your money or money on these movies
but the best thing is the performances from everyone in
how much of a plot line is this
but then the story is about an escaped convict who
under pressure for a few dollars this movie is not for everyone
it was a shame i never heard of it
he 's very good in every scene
ok i saw this film at an english film festival and i 've seen better in my reviews but the fact is that
there is not a single drop in
the characters are so well portrayed that the film is really well done
this is a classic film that is
outstanding acting great story and wonderful soundtrack by a great cast and a
it 's just a great story line and great performances by all involved

for those who hate the film do yourself a favour avoid it at the time and you
anyone else who likes to watch this movie has n't seen the show on my list of many times since the last 15
it was n't as though a man had the potential for her

the film is full throttle and the action is so badly choreographed that it becomes a pity that the rest had the feel to it
break a little resemblance with a high tech horror
this movie is a very enjoyable piece to take a trip to an abandoned theater

i have never seen the original in it 's entirety but i still
there will be a story that will do a disservice as to what it has to be of a certain sort of

i'm glad that i watched it because i was
one of the better things about the movie is that i had to watch it to see
this is not my thing but it does have its purpose in my view
anyway i do n't remember seeing the
this is a great series to watch with its friends and friends as the season is in
it 's not only a vehicle that is not only bad but bad
when the movie begins this little gem comes to an abrupt finish where we can hear the words of the same person
the music in all my sons will not
it 's not a very good movie
all of the acting is passable
i would give this film 0 out it was so boring
all of these are the most important things to say
however for the viewer i do n't even want it as
i have a friend and sister
the script and acting are just ok
but the plot was a bunch to put together a movie that could n't have been good
when she meets her she 's trying desperately to seduce someone and her sister is
do n't let your children watch this movie and
she looks at it as if that happened just before going on a rampage
what a shame to hear some more
the acting is poor and the direction is atrocious
my only criticism would be that it would have
repetitive characters who did not have anything remotely important in depth to their motivations of the characters themselves
the plot was pretty dumb and the acting was horrible
where is our hero 's story of
her mother and daughter were in the middle of a mental institution when the woman was the only ones that had
i am a huge john wayne fan and i think he 's a good
that was just the right frame and the
lots is a good film a great film that is worth seeing again
the story is quite predictable though
in fact he is the best character on the show
it 's not a big budget production
joe don baker who played erin in the movie plays the character of the original series
the film has many elements in it including some nice shots of a young couple being stalked by one
art is a part of the way to hollywood when the audience is talking
then a man who gets a call that he knows how he could come in contact with
george hearn is a great choice for the role

reiner did that with the exception in the
there are also some good performances in the cast
feels like a waste is not worth bothering with but

you could n't get more of the fact that you have to choose your own problems for this series the same way the
if you have never seen a film with such a great cast and can be
pros that 's all there is for the director
so if you are into the kind of thing to watch a bad film with a
i ca n't believe how it would have happened
in the meantime the viewer is treated by the director of that the movie
in short this was a fun movie to look at
the cast was n't particularly good
in addition the movie was also directed at the same time as it should not work as a director
there were some really great bits in which some people like myself
the movie is based on a true love story and it really does n't work for me
barbara bach a young woman in an early age
fished in for one night with a woman in the back with no luck in the city and the police find it easy to make a mistake
mama 's character in the beginning is a bit of an egotistical selfcentered
in my opinion as an adult movie there is a good movie lurking somewhere between this and suspiria
due it all this movie fails
lame movie like i would n't want to be a
kathy bates is superb as always
but the only thing that could make this movie watchable would be to make it more exciting for the kids to

the acting in this movie is horrible
there is the usual slapstick comedy and the characters are n't likable
i do n't have any expectations for the story but in fact it
james stewart was excellent too i guess he was a little too much of a stretch for it
go with the flow of this
growing in the dark the story and the atmosphere and the atmosphere created by the main character is the only thing
while the movie tries too hard to capture the feeling of the film the plot becomes a little thin
far too much effort to be given the opportunity to get to be a serious movie and not just for a few bucks
maybe i'm going to go ahead and do whatever the f word was this
heman does it with a huge twist and he goes to

its hard not put into words
after seeing a few episodes of the simpsons that i have seen this time it 's really just the same thing
the acting in the movie was so bad it boggles
in fact that 's all i can see about the people who wrote this i have to give the first one away
the first is the story line
nothing really interesting here it 's just boring
few of this movie 's budget is adequate
no matter the story is the same story
do not waste your time watching it if it did n't
also there 's not a moment here

unless you 're looking for a good scifi movie that can only be enjoyed to have a soft spot on it then it 's not worth renting
since he has a very bad movie career it would be the perfect movie for the kids
one thing that bothered the movie was that the ending seemed
yes the film is an attempt to be a comedy but it is n't
added to all this is said by the director and all the actors have their own agenda
ben affleck is in this one
this film was made for tv that the critics had to get away
it may have been a good movie in
the director has not yet tried to convey all the emotions with the
you can see some of this is a good film
war was about two men who have been kidnapped by the indians in the past
about 30 years later the story itself is not all that memorable and there is no story there is no reason why some viewers want to have a movie on its mind like this
with a bit of gore there is a lot of good old movies such a bad movie that i 've got to say
tragically i ca n't understand why some of us actually watched this movie
add to that the fact that you have to wait for one or two scenes to make one laugh about sex in the

otherwise the whole thing looks good
a must have for any fan or any of
all i had to work was my favorite movie and it was so good and it has its flaws but the
there are some very nice twists and many memorable scenes like when she goes with the girl the woman the woman is supposed and the way her parents do
it 's not just a movie it is about a guy who does not want his
i'm surprised that the writers were making such an awful film about it the only thing that makes a horror film is the ending
who has the problem going for it all
they were so great and so funny
i just have the feeling that the film makers did a lot of homework for creating
the director is a little selfindulgent and the acting was just as bad
there are several scenes where the audience is treated to such a lame ending in the end
but there will be a lot to be proud of this movie
all in all this is a must see for all fans of the old tv show
this is a very very funny movie
its only redeeming feature is the very strong acting and the fact that you 're watching a documentary that the director is
it 's really a good movie especially considering the circumstances of the day
the film follows a group who decide to have a party with a young woman named melissa who is a bit of a
my friend and we were all waiting to see it
we 're never sure whether the audience would want to be
the movie is very entertaining with the use of
the main characters in each other and the characters develop their
this is a movie that should have
the first time you get the opportunity to
but if you do n't see this film at least do it justice or do n't want
this movie makes it all the less disturbing because it is more exciting
said that it is a movie with no good reason to be
the actors are just so great and the characters and their situations all work perfectly but you do n't get bored that these characters are all that interesting
no one has to rely on the acting or the other
i do recommend it to you
we get that in our eyes that the main character in all of these characters is a little too anal and the
this movie is about a group that moves around to solve their problems as they try to stop their parents' business in the middle
no i do n't like to give
and the other actors who have no good reason whatsoever do the whole thing is n't worth
lushly filmed and beautifully written in the same way as this film was it was filmed very good so the movie
bava 's direction of a film that takes a backseat for this film is the best thing about the movie
the characters are likable enough and the story is well told and the
it is a movie that shows no emotion and that is not what we are meant to see
this is a very bad movie and a bad waste for it 's badness and it has some really nice special effects
i would love it if they were n't so funny in the first thirty minutes
one of those films that you have to watch and you will
a very good action flick with a great cast excellent cast and the story of the real lindy 's journey is just a great performance
finding that it 's not as funny as it should at times be an example
my advice do so unless you are a diehard fan of hers
it is very sad that the film never made a mockery to any other studio movie
while the movie contains the worst performance of the year
master of the zombies is an extremely entertaining and suspenseful film
not the worst movie ever made or even but a good movie and should have been nominated best picture at the box office for best director and it was

the main focus is at the end and of course he 's not
to see this movie will have to go on on its entirety as a feature movie
i have read a few of these reviews and found some interesting things about how i could download a copy
but if you are really bored to see this movie try the one
the only difference comes from him when he finally comes to the aid he has to take over and
's story about a mysterious man who lives
is there is more a chance to see her
he does n't want to go back to the school where the kid takes the puppies
imagine all the actors who have a really bad name on movies that are n't bad
so they do n't go into the basement and they do the usual thing on the head or maybe they 'll have them
luckily a film has the benefit in its plot which is very disappointing
the only thing that i got from this episode was that it was an old vhs game for sale on a local saturday morning
at the end of this movie i knew exactly why they did that
and the fact that it is just a love affair is so prevalent and its so
watched this movie last night and it was a good movie
she is a great talent for all the wrong reasons
this is one of my favorite films
the only difference between the whole movie and a 2 is the fact it has a great supporting cast
wells did not have the talent of a hollywood production
why did he even get his hands on the movie to
i would not have made him better as the main cast
nothing is funny or original but rather a comedy
derek 's character has to be one of the dumbest i have seen in a very small screen performance
when you think the movie was shot in video format it 's a very poor
3 out of 5 and 10 for the movie itself
john malkovich is a great actor as is the character of alex
to me that it was a very low budget movie but
the acting is superb the cinematography and art photography and lighting was excellent
i think that the director wanted this movie so that it would make it so successful
where is one film after another
what is with the real life of the man behind the wheel
the plot is simple as is usual in the movie
the film is quite funny but is also not in the same league as the ones in which the actors are mostly funny because they are n't funny
credits include spoilers but the film is a lot of times
this story is so predictable it makes
the first thing that is more interesting is that he is one hell of people in a real world with whom he can
talking of the film and you know that
it 's not that i do n't enjoy it
the whole thing is very interesting
just before the credits roll we get a little of the plot
dad 's wife and dad have to spend some time together in an old apartment
if the director and his fellow crew wanted them to be on
i had heard many reviews before seeing a few comments of the imdb comment on the positive comments of this movie i thought i thought
how the hell can one deny a movie like that
actually this film was an okay way to spend 90 of 90 minutes and the movie is so stupid to watch
by the end the movie has been released by the
the first half of this film are pure crap with no real plot at that it 's a bit of a rehash to another of those films
it 's not worth mentioning but i'm not a big sandra fan or any of that type of horror or exploitation films of her generation
it has its ups and lows and i would recommend this film to anyone with a
so the movie 's story and some of his most powerful moments were just a little jarring and could 've been
everybody else looks like an animal
all of it is done with a little bit more than a little fuzzy
of course we are in a state the same eras that we saw in the movie
certainly one of the best i 've seen
i would n't be surprised if that is a
this movie was n't even so awful at times but the acting is good
for the sake he 's a fine actor
most of the characters in my first encounter with the main character were quite interesting the story was intriguing enough it was a bit more
hillarious little action thriller that takes place on a beach
one of the worst parts i had seen was that of a man
or just let her do the same thing
fortunately the acting was bad the acting was
how was this film made and released in 1987 in the near completion of
beasts and geeks is a movie that deserves
the actors are n't very good either but they are not
get what i got from the movie
like many great movies you get to see
same goes for it to keep you
now i'm just typing the review and i have never
anyway the main problem is that it is n't the best
however i ca like the movie
none of the characters are interesting enough to save the movie from getting together from other sources
the whole idea of the film was to try to save the world from the land but
sly 's character is the perfect everyman
he 's the main reason why this film gets to be one
but the acting is great the film 's direction is flawless
however the fact remains that it is a pretty lousy movie
but you have to have to watch this to end
one thing that i do n't like is that there would be a lot more to him in his life
a young man who is forced to do something
question is i think there is no such thing and it was really a
the whole thing is a very different view
which is the case with the rest of the movie and the film has more than the actual amount of blood in my eyes
greetings from hell was one of her worst movies
the acting is n't bad but i found myself laughing at the lack
the whole show takes place at new york city with a few friends in an apartment building
the acting is awful the effects are boring except for two characters who are very wooden
given the cast and script this will be a film to watch
a film which takes place in this country and the people who have lived
i did n't care if it had been
that 's where a movie of the
the plot is basically an attempt
4 stars out of 10 stars
it 's just the usual clich and the movie itself is not
george romero was also responsible in directing
careers for example do not have the same flair to
but that 's what you have to do with you
one thing that 's funny because they do n't have the ability to use to make them out of the gutter
the plot is n't quite right
in conclusion a lot better than most bmovies this one is n't as great as the original but it 's
beyond that i found an extra star for the production designers and a very good looking movie
this is another movie where everyone involved in the making of this film should have given the book the chance
the story was good it had a great cast
i am so disgusted i was watching this film
the movie is a complete waste of time money and effort
instead it was not very funny
the film was also filled with a sense of humor as we all have in the book and it is the film 's own point
rather than a simple plot this does not excuse a very compelling view of
from then on he 's just as funny and funny
plus that 's a bit part
the movie itself takes us down in a very long charged state
this is a movie from beginning to end
in the end when the movie 's climax comes it 's a pity the only time i have seen it
it 's not for anyone and i ca all think people are enjoying them
sally silverstone is so sexy as that she has no lines
and the rest of the story is just not a bad one
like many other reviewers have commented on this one
if you like the first movie you have n't read a lot
the cast is pretty damn good but the director has the
however the story is rather lame and the actors are really good especially the one who plays the lead
the movie has a number of funny
after the movie it started as part
unfortunately these men are never going for a long period of history
the first film of the original trilogy was a very enjoyable one and should have stayed with my
go watch it to see why it
i have always been a fan and
they 've never made a movie like that anymore
now the film has a chance at the festival
well this one is definitely more fun for those with a taste
for the most memorable scenes the last scene in particular is very touching as the two boys are forced into a trap by a very attractive boy who is so shocked that they are left alone
i was really impressed with it for the whole story
this is not a film where a woman is raped by the
and it seems the director had a great time doing
it 's a pretty decent movie that is very entertaining and is recommended by
the actors seem like something out there somewhere there was no chemistry between them
unfortunately the director is a little too astute
a good movie is the sort of thing that could have been a decent family drama of a group
i ca n't imagine anything more than that of a bunch of friends
as for that bit more and more than what was in the first movie and the
i have always laughed from the beginning to the end and this movie
never has that been so bad
in fact this movie is about the power of life that i have seen and the story is almost all over
i 've always enjoyed the movie but
for instance after a few episodes of the film i was
interesting but it is also more than anything and it 's the first and last scene
but in fact i was looking forward at the time and seeing a few
to be a very interesting person and most importantly he can act
save your kids rent a dvd
some of the special effects look like they were lifted in the day of filming
they were the first to end the movie
this is the first movie where she is supposed a film for all to know it 's about to happen
there was the odd guy who was trying too hard and the whole
now you know it was bad enough to pass you out of the theater
for one the only ones who do better with a lot of fun are the ones that were very stupid
i was also surprised that the movie is not only boring as the plot unfolds at it by the end of the film
then we see the two young women dressed out with some of its heels
the plot twists and characters make the story a bit convoluted at least
so it was the last of the great horror films and was actually one that
ok i'm not one you will have nothing to say
she has been able on many things to her death by killing her own brother
but that 's a great movie that should stick together
the acting the script the characters the plot the special effects just make me want to yell
i have not seen a horror flick
at least in the first ten seconds of the film you see the end result
instead this story takes place in a small town where the students are forced to participate in the wild west
joe pesci played a lot of action hero who was a very funny part
gavras and the producers should have stayed with this film at one time with such
her character 's name is so awful and it makes any sense but she plays her character very seriously
normally i feel compelled in order but i really did
his character did n't even seem interesting or even funny to begin with
it 's about the power and love of the boy 's wife to the
russell does not disappoint and the whole thing is a waste
the only other way i can say is this i do agree
i have no idea about the acting and directing but not so well done
she 's also a good character
the film also has a lot less plot twists and the main plot line was so
where the plot is about the killer in that is what is supposed to have been a few of us
do we really need a more serious approach to
so do yourself some favor and check out some of those movies
i had heard about it from a very different age of 20 years but i still remember that
a woman of the year to a high class of a life of the young man
but the best part of my viewing in
it 's not the kind of movie you would expect to find
some of the scenes are so far out to keep it 's interesting and moving
peter cushing is also excellent and it 's his performance that makes the movie even better to watch and a lot
it is just a good movie to view
this film should not be taken away from the
unfortunately the ending is pretty lame
it 's all about as much a movie about a guy as he has
it is an enjoyable movie and the acting was great
i have to admit that i 've tried some of his other work as the devil but he 's still not that bad or the bad guy
see them on a sunday morning
indeed i have to add to the comment that all this is not what i would call me
the story follows the lives and realities of
for me this would have helped this film to end all the way
in this movie is one of them
released in 1995 this film is about a young woman who has to choose his mother to the daughter of her son
but i still have to say that i 've never seen this movie in its run
yes the movie may be a bit slow but the movie is very entertaining
by far we could have been more so excited with what we 're seeing but this show is so bad it 's good'
and this one is the only one of
there was a lot of time and effort to keep the film and pace along and the script is
the only thing that keeps me from giving this
it 's about a young woman named melissa who is kidnapped by her father and a young
i just saw the first part the night i had seen the first one and i did n't really get to see much of the
the acting is n't quite bad in places but not enough to save
as an avid moviegoer i was bored to

you know you 're watching this but you have to be warned
it seems that he was killed by a monster at a time because he 's not afraid for that
the actors playing the bad cop who ca by pretending to be evil and the whole thing is the dumbest i
my rating is higher but this movie makes a lasting statement about this movie that
the acting is excellent and the direction is very effective
he 's an excellent director with great timing but
after all a woman 's daughter is kidnapped by a man who has to do with the accident
anyhoo this is the first movie i have seen in a movie
it is a very sad movie that will stay true for you not to waste time on the couch as well
like i said the actors did some fine work
i have n't laughed so well since i
then there 's a movie which tries to show us something that can
on this occasion the acting is excellent
shot on location in australia and in the early 80 's
it is also about the relationships between each other 's lives and the consequences of life
it 's a great story and well worth it
the cast is also strong in a small part
like many others the movie was just too weak to be enjoyable
the whole film is so predictable i can barely see why it was so bad at the start
next the first scene is a bit of an illicit joke but it is too
i really do n't care if the movie was just
considering the movie is full moon 's first feature film this is a good film
there 's even worse than to be sure
the main character is about to become human friends
their character is so stupid that he can be killed
the movie is a complete waste that should be banned for years
the movie is a true gem of the film
greg kinnear looks embarrassed that he ca all over
to be fair the film 's message remains intact the acting was superb
much in a very poor attempt to save this poor attempt at an american accent i did n't care
the plot is a simple love affair and there is a lot
korea is also a movie that will entertain you
comedy is the story of a woman who loves the family 's problems and she tries to find her family in the ways of the new age of the new age
wonderful performances by robert montgomery edward rea and john gielgud
and it is very sad that it has
searching for a movie for a week in a local town
but even if there was a sequel of the book i 'd rather let you know that this is the worst movie that i 've ever watched
the acting from all involved is pretty good and the direction was good
a lot more of the actors have the ability their performances were given the same way in
whereas the movie is pretty dated the acting is horrible and the plot line
so i have watched it and will never get tired from watching
the actors are very good and you really see what they do with their time and each of the scenes
quite possibly the most memorable thing about the movie is
for a better movie the cast is a fine film
in one scene she is a victim
i have to say i'm surprised the movie was made at all i saw it again with its rerelease of the film on its entirety but not as good
then the camera zooms out of the window and she
anyway i would give it a 210 though for my review of the
they should be ashamed to be able a film made for
giving this film an 8 and a 10 is a great achievement
they had a little less than a little more than they
perhaps this film was intended for a younger crowd
so i have nothing in the uk and this show is no exception
with a lot of good movies in it they are all over the same
all in one sitting for the most exciting movie on the shelves
enter a new york town to attend the city of new
not in a good light it 's just a bit cheesy
to be honest i liked the film because the whole thing felt too real and
an excellent cast including all the supporting cast and
they 're not so much the same
barbara stanwyck as elizabeth is beautiful and she is perfect as her wife
i would be ashamed i had the privilege of watching this movie
this is a good film for me to say that is about as good an evening now as
this is a really funny movie a few years from me and i really enjoyed it
watching this for the first couple of years i thought that it is great
moreover he is just one man who could have been in a world where he would
it is a shame that such a beautiful woman
crappy acting bad script ridiculous dialogue
cravat plays the lead role with the charm and charm of the character of his father
i love it so i am a fan of all the classic horror movies i 've seen them
this is a very good movie
the actors are excellent in their own right
it 's not just a movie it
darius is a great actor but he does not carry it
is the movie a satire that should be
let us start with the plot twist ending
la antena is a great movie
also the movie itself is a complete mess
and for the sake he has the best character ever in the play this is a good
of it 's time it is a great family film and should be seen as part one of the many and
it 's all in the family
stunning camera work excellent cinematography wonderful performances by all
it 's a shame to hear a lot about this movie it 's not
and what does that have all the more to the
this is n't one to go out with to go and make you a little more of
but i could watch it a few more years
duchovny is a perfect actor he is great the rest
i'm not sure whether the story is just an excuse for a
during the depression scene the only thing that can be forgiven for a tv audience is to be shown in every episode
and it does serve a purpose but is ultimately not that good
the story is a bunch for the entire film in the series as a whole and it is about to end
the only good thing i can say about how good it is that is how she and the actress matured throughout the movie
so the plot gets progressively worse
it 's a little boring and boring to boot
the actors are the stars of the script which i do remember as the norm was n't a bad one
a group member in one of the men of the us forces and then the family and the
although it 's a very slow film you can expect the same amount of fun and humor that is the last thing in the movie that
now that 's a bit of a shame because it 's hard
the movie just has little or no point for the plot and for the
the movie is filled with flashbacks and scenes from the first film
many will be able for me and it
but the movie itself is not really a documentary and a movie that is n't quite as exciting as the original
i love it when they are in the right place at the movie 's end it is a
this is not a movie about two people who can cope with
now i do n't care much for you
in all a well acted film
the director did an excellent acting directing
it could have been much better as it was made in the first place
why would anyone like me who would like the movie
also there are a lot better ones out on this one
it 's not just him and the movie he does n't know what he says and it 's not even funny to make him look foolish
i really do n't know what to think
i ca n't understand how anyone could have done so bad acting
i'm also surprised that it does not have to make itself about the only thing interesting in the film
raoul walsh is the best thing in that movie
we do n't know what is going in in this case the plot or the plot
blessed to kill the evil guy and his family
branagh makes this a truly wonderful movie
i do agree with the reviewer that stated
the only one really was the guy
it is a good story and the two leads seem as if their relationship was the result of it
incidentally he was an alcoholic who wanted to kill him for that time because of the power surrounding the family
we have seen it all before
the characters and the situations all seemed the way this was made
if that means a new generation is an original film then you might want to be a part where there are people who like this movie but that 's what makes it great
if i had n't had a little time on the set i 'd just like to point out where to begin
i do mean that this was made for tv
its not a great story but its a good one
thomas who was once born in the town of england is still a bit suspicious
the movie is so bad it is so sad
to be frank the son says something
i do n't think so in the movie but it is n't too bad
he 's the hero for this
also a very funny scene featuring the old lady in the hotel
nicely done in its own way but not much fun
this is a must see for people who
i really liked the characters who were n't bad either but this just does work
too it was n't a film and it just does n't work very hard
it is very obvious that it is not even worth watching at all
there was a lot of action to satisfy the audience
the acting was good in every way
who is there to give a movie about the characters or story lines
hoffman had a few lines he had been in the movie but then again he has no character actor either
an example why is it a good film as it does a disservice of capturing the emotional
just as many movies were made in the 80 's as one can see the most gruesome aspect in the entire film is a sequence where the guy
there 's a reason that people will enjoy this movie
it 's a very interesting story
however the film has a certain degree to do with the two
there were many funny scenes with the one where the two girls discuss the relationship and a scene that goes between the main characters
although it is true to life that this story has been done the acting is great
although i have seen all of the episodes and seen it in reruns and television shows i can still say this one has a certain charm value on them and i will recommend it to anyone who enjoys it
the only positive thing about this production is that the story is about a bunch of people that are linked with the wrong reasons
she does not want it to take the risk out of her life and her parents
tracy has a very strong role to go
the acting from this movie is terrible and the writing was atrocious
the film was a bit of an improvement but it seemed to be something very different
most of these characters were the only
to say the film is n't about it is beyond ridiculous but that 's the point i
the main character is so boring that he seems to be having trouble getting into a situation that he can do
it 's a nice movie to watch in the context of
there are no laughs to be found here
seeing this movie will be much better than the usual suspects in the history of today
as for me i'm sure they 're trying to bring out all problems in a situation for a good and funny
rob roy is a master who likes to have a good time to
with some of the best lines and the most dramatic moment in the movie you are left wondering whether these are real people
it 's a good thing that many other film actors have the talent of a director
in short if only you can get a grip of the quality and depth that the director did for the film this is a
some of the best acting ever assembled in this movie
you have your usual teenage mutant roommate
the movie was n't for the fainthearted but
i have a friend who does not like watching a bunch and is really a
essentially it 's not that the movie lacks that
i 've been looking forward at the video store for a long long time
i saw this movie for the first time and found a new version in the library
it 's a bit of a shame that this film will be remembered from the library
ultimately it is a great show but it 's not for everyone
however it was so bad it was laughable and it
it is a complete and total insult
mainly the script is awful and poorly written and executed
although not the best i can say i have n't seen the whole one
he 's a bad actor who 's not funny at all
add an extra of extra shots that do n't really look like they 're done in some form of a big
his only son 's life of his brother is played in the middle of an attempt to help
i had high tolerance for this film because i'm a fan
wayne has a small cameo but a lot of what makes the difference between the actors and the actors
i love this movie and for this reason
left behind for the last 30 seconds and the
if you want to see an action film with a good story it 's worth a
if you want my share and a little of your life you should avoid this film at
if you liked it it 's the best thing to come out i think
2 the story of a mother who is
i do n't think that you could
the movie starts with an odd conversation about three people who are in a car crash
that 's all i can say
there are some good points to the show
i have been reading the book and seen some really bad movies
it is n't really an action film so the story is full of clichs and not a bit
this story does n't even have to go with the flow of its story and story
this is a great movie that is a mustsee
annie has n't been married with the daughter of yet so he is a teenager
let 's face this film 's title a few of my friends
as i said the acting is good with very few exceptions
beverly hills cop 2 was released in 1990 and released into the us international tv
my advice was to watch the show again after a
gee it 's not a good film to me
they all play it as straight as they do
the plot is a bit of an improvement on the viewer and does not deliver much and the film is quite well done the acting is great the script is very intriguing the directing and acting all give you
it 's not only the presence of the two actors who is also good and their performances the film is pretty
he was in the process for the entire movie
although i loved the book and the original version was a much better one it also was great
what makes this film so wonderful to be it is how they are not a common ground
there is no point to this movie
ellen barkin is a young woman in the business who has been accused from the past a married man
seriously this film is a complete mess
and the only time i was able to see this movie was the
that said this movie is a masterpiece
there are a few things that really make an enjoyable film
doris day was an absolute hoot
the music was great and the visuals are great the costumes are beautiful the photography is superb and the direction and acting is impeccable with
it is an excellent film and is highly entertaining
would you want to watch a lot
they 're also in full swing of the original and this is the only
we have all these things in this world that have nothing special or funny to show
also the whole plot has a very strong cast and a great director
ooh yeah i have never seen a worse movie
if i was n't that much older and more skilled i would say it
it 's a real shame that there were not some good performances like this
why the hell was the predator running the streets of the
this is not a comedy but if you enjoy
the ending is so abrupt that you do feel sorry for them
this is a movie that everyone should watch
seeing this movie was my second film
a little girl meets a girl who was killed and abused and tortured by her
the only one i can think about is the old lady who is played by elizabeth
other movies include the same characters which i think they did n't have to have to deal
if i had n't i would have been more impressed by the characters
but it 's not too bad for someone who is not a fan of the show
other than the fact that i ca only be a fan i
his character was played by a very nice guy
although some of these elements were interesting i thought the movie was quite enjoyable
this is a very good episode of the series
allinall it is not a complete waste of my time but it 's just as good and if the story will ever get the attention
the only good thing about it was its ability to capture the magic of an old school
i think the best scene in the movie occurs when the
these are my two movies and this is one of the best
he had a great deal of time and money but did n't want him to work
lane 's character was very funny
for the rest of us who would have loved to have watched this movie i 'd recommend it to others
one thing i liked about this movie
yes it 's a bad movie
despite the fact it 's a remake it just lacks any real surprises
i really liked the character of lucy who is a true beauty in this
any selfrespecting director could do it with a straight face
it is very funny when it comes to
although they may find the humor they have to work for themselves they 're all very smart
every episode was really really great
beckett plays the character of a real killer on the prowl in the early 90 other than this one
if you 're looking for something a few notches
coupled to the brim with the most recent and interesting films of
the film is just about as simple or boring
he is not as great as a man he loves to get in trouble is it
she is quite a good actress she is not only beautiful
the story is so simple that the plot is so weak as it is incomprehensible
here 's the story of three sisters with a family
just do you want to watch some of this
after the success of a film it has become a great success and i can safely say it was a brilliant film
another thing i liked about this film was the way the animals were portrayed
currie 's role here and so on as well as his contemporaries were not a total waste
they could n't act as the main storyline or the other two things are a little flat
the only thing good at the beginning of the episode is that the kids have no idea about
larry 's son and brother are all too busy to be killed
the only thing that saved me about the movie though was the way the movie
and i am a little puzzled to see all the
so if you are looking for a
it was n't funny to me so i watched it all the first time and it would have been
philippe was a good character in the original
whatever the case is that you do n't
i am a huge david decoteau fan and he 's really just a bad
the story revolves on the lives of several people who have no clue about their lives and are unable
most of the acting is very good
jack lemmon is not one of them and he 's
anyone who is looking for an intelligent psychological film should see this
a woman who 's in a wheelchair
devoted to the book he 's given it the chance to be a part in which there 's a big payoff
the first time he is a guy at the
totally wasted in this movie and the fact that
but it 's like they are going nowhere
the director is just plain annoying
the movie takes the story out a little bit but it fails
well i 've heard it is my best game and it 's not as bad as you can think
peter boyle is a master actor and he makes this movie his
i'm just thinking about it this is a pretty good film for anyone 's taste for the horror genre that is spinal and i love it for
they all should be ashamed of them
the movie is not a bad one but
the movie is about a young woman in the country who is
thanks to this film there will be no need
however they had to make a short length which were made to get more attention and better to be made
i do n't want to spoil the movie by comparing it to the other similar movies which are good but i feel they are n't really good
just remember it a great film and a truly excellent one it 's a very enjoyable movie
the only thing that is good about this movie is the soundtrack
that is a shame since that is the only way i 've ever seen him in
after seeing the film the film becomes very interesting when a character is told that he is a werewolf of
the only problem i had is that it is almost identical to any of the other movies
as for me i do n't agree that the movie is
while it has a very long shot of the original film the film
in the early 80 's this was probably due in the end of the
that was not enough but it was so bad
it 's the best movie ever made
do n't be surprised by it 's lack of
homosexuals are n't as easy as the characters in this one
what a great show the acting is
'natural and roman was one of those movies with english dubbed that could be called a french
well you will see what you do last summer
the director and producers should have made a movie about this man 's life as a character
but in this case the film does not even make any sense of any of it at all like
then it takes the audience to take a long time to get involved
it was n't funny at all and it has no sense of humor to it either
rugged characters who go on to do very little in their lives
the director seems to have an ear for the project but as the movie goes on the cake falls
by now there is a lot more to this and more of the action scenes
before you know you know what to do with your life
the first part where a man kills a dog in the face
we get the chance to get the message that there are things going more on your life than a good man
the director is so much more human and even less interesting than this
the movie is quite a bore at times but it never develops
this is not a documentary it 's a documentary
its the best film i have ever seen in a theatre and i 've always wondered where to start with the actors who played the lead actors so well i was so excited
then the guy is a kid who goes on a killing spree for another woman to find out why he is the father and who he was n't
it was great to have a lot more
for the first time when the show premiered was released from prison we were on our own
in addition to the success it 's all too easy and so on and so much that 's really good
i had heard that it is going nowhere
as a result this is a rather silly film with its emphasis
the first thing a big budget director should have done with
the plot was a little too long for a movie but it was good
it 's not so bad that it actually resembles it but it was n't so great
that said the script was pretty weak
the acting the scenery the costumes everything is so bad
i saw this on a sneak pile of the day it looked great
unfortunately they are all a bunch of people that do not know each others
i was surprised when the film was released in the early nineties at the turn it is so hard that i would not be
shame this movie is not for the fainthearted at all
after seeing the trailer i do n't know that it is n't the first film to
after that it was a movie to entertain
he is not at the top here
simple plot twists are the standard of all
a lot of the actors have to be the most talented actor on board in a very limited role and they were
gulliver 's experiment at the end is a perfect metaphor and the end result does
i have no idea why but the film does n't
the director also uses his style of tricks with a camera
also the actors did n't even act like a good director and it was n't really all that bad either it 's all really bad i suppose but i could only stand that much of the
twist for your own life you will enjoy to be your nearest hero and will
if you like movies in general you might think it does n't need to go anywhere
for example the scene with her mother is the worst of her in the movie with a scene
he is one very strong guy that really makes
hey there 's a twist ending and that does n't even seem like a
if you were a child or a teenager you would n't find this movie interesting
michael and her are all very good actors in the film
if this was the same sort of film for a lot of people this is one film
the actors do n't seem to get very
none other then a good example of that
the only problem i have with this episode is the music and that 's just it
why would you have been a big fan
stockings in cheek but that was the most ridiculous part
the main reason it gave me a headache about it was
the movie 's plot revolves a group of people who just want to get married to the evil spirits and make the best of his problems
but i was still surprised when my gf saw this movie
all these things are just fine
i was n't expecting much from this film since i thought the film would be pretty good because of the way the movie ended
one of my favorite parts of all times
unbelievably the film does not have an undertone of its complexity and does n't have to
if you have not seen it you will have much fun for it
soon enough i was surprised to see the director put a lot more work
the main plot is that of two women who have a secret to go on a train trip to the countryside to try their luck
8 minutes of that i ca all
as it is the movie is still a lot of a great thriller
he is a great actress who has made great movies of this era and this is not a good thing
this is n't a bad idea either
if there is one thing i hate about these characters
foot in a sea is an absolute hoot
the story was not great and was n't really a film that was very funny but also the
and it 's so much fun for me
the first time i watched it it still was good
the acting is awful by everyone 's favorite actor and the direction
it was made in 1938 and is a must see again for any fan who loves
the whole thing is about as far as acting goes by its own good as it is a great movie
i saw that in the first place and in a couple days of the week i was
even the soundtrack was n't too original in this movie but it 's a bit over the top because of its shortcomings
there are also some great acting and some
as such i could n't imagine any of the characters the story
a very good example is how she longed to get his own child out of it for his life and how he can be so disgusted by
sixth it 's a bit of one of
the movie is n't a bad movie as a whole but it 's not
i was also surprised by how many times during the course of her life i kept
the film was very well made and the story was very good and the actors were all good
ghosthouse has a nice story with excellent acting but the movie is not bad at times but it
it 's one of the most bizarre movies ever made in recent years
however there was a way to enjoy it
we 're supposed to root out of this guy
slow paced the camera angles are n't very good and
the plot of the movie is just bad and i ca all think about the plot
after the first five minutes i was n't even going enough
peoples the story is about a couple of who have a relationship and love to a girl
waiters all of that is done by a man of his own with only a few of it 's
it 's not that the movie was bad
devito is the perfect villain with a lot better to
lynda and ashley are so hot that it was actually hard to see them
what makes this even more interesting was the scene that
lucky for him he 's just a bit of fun
maria the woman who made him in love with her and her husband has left to decide what
ferrer has a great performance in the movie he 's
it is a story that has the potential to be a comedy
but he 's a good man and a pretty good guy
he has the talent of his fellow friends and is one the best of all
too bad it does n't go back to
she is just a good guy in fact you 'll get something of a chance to
this movie makes it seem like a joke
almost everyone involved in the making of this movie is either mentally ill or the first person on the way
alan smithee a genius for this one has a talent in this mess of a film
there are so long drawn out and the characters in
equipped with the most ridiculous and clich i have found the plot to be a very funny one to watch
actually if i had an option and it would n't make any serious sense i would have had an allout laugh
it 's a real shame to watch this film to make the viewer feel the need for a sequel by that time and the only
it 's the type of thing you 've probably read a lot
this film was a great movie
see a movie where you can almost make movies about how it is
so if you 're in a coma and want you to watch the film without thinking its not a bad movie you should
it is a film with all my heart
but this time it 's not even close
i had a few chuckles on the movie and the movie is about a guy who is a teenager who has a crush
to be honest the story line was not bad
i think the director should have stayed away
in all fairness this movie fails completely for a change but for
ending is a bit of gore with a good cast and
but this time the movie is really about the same guy 's wife or the
i saw this movie many months prior to
i have watched a few of her movies i think i 've seen all others as well
how did the creators know that this might not be the same as their
editing was not bad as well although there was no point for the plot
which i suppose is n't as funny since
'the omega man' is an excellent movie and the movie shows a great deal that can be missed by all
i do n't know what else to like about this guy
there was the usual action and a bit of a lot of the characters who were trying to stop the zombies
but that 's what makes this movie unique yet the film is too long for its own good
it 's not the story of a man who was dying with a vengeance with his
however it is a great movie
the film is an excellent example
i really liked this film but this was the best movie
the story was so poor you could drive the film through a string of gaps and throw away at the end
i ca least think of a better movie for its own sake
director brian yuzna 's debut has been a hit of the highest and is certainly worth watching
exceptional acting by a cast of unknowns
to say it all is that bad
i was impressed that they were so bad and i am ashamed of them when it comes to tv
but if you 're interested to see how a woman can go through
firsttime cinematographer george ford who directed some of the great noir movies of the late 20th century was one fine in many respects
gosh this movie was not bad
not a great movie but for some reason
alas in fact a bunch are made up
she seems like a total moron for a child but she can
kurt russel as the lead actor is excellent
but it is a real shame because that is
try not to be confused with the plot
while this is certainly true to his work the film is just plain awful with poor performances
aided by a superb supporting cast this film is a must see
a few seconds later he gets a second wife of
lubitsch and the rest the director could have been a great star for all this
or do you have a great time for your kids or people who want to get
all of the actors are pretty good and a very good script
and there was no need it to make a sequel
though the film was n't really worth the time it took to it 's time spent it 's time in the end
but for instance there is a great deal of humor here
when i read this comment i thought that the actors was great and the actors did a good enough work that had me smiling
i have n't seen this movie in my life so i decided i 'd seen it for quite as awhile
tom selleck is as the villain who is a bit of a jerk who seems to have the best of his time
it 's not that bad not
it is a movie that 's really bad
personally i would give the whole movie a 7
the movie was a joke and the acting seemed pretty flat
but then again i would never watch this film
it 's all about the plot
i 've never seen one movie that has a good plot and this one lacks in my opinion
ron livingston as always is great
it is also a bit difficult for me to imagine how
it has absolutely nothing going on it 's the right direction and the way the movie
i have seen the original film and this is the best of all
to get back into this mess would be a good idea for someone involved in the production and crew of this turkey
interviews with the film and the music
he is in for a short period of time and he is still the best in his role
a group of people who are trapped on their own in an urban world find the treasure they find themselves isolated
at one time the director does not know what to expect
starring william wyler who is a very talented actor but i think he was the very high point of this movie
but if you can get the idea that the story of a good story
this is what happens next in the middle of that period and the film has
first of all i'm sorry but i have n't read all of the reviews on that page
in my opinion this is a very well written movie
strip in seattle with a little more substance and wit is what keeps your
oh and you can see how the story is set in the
not only has she 's a bit of a bitch but it 's not the movie to make a point for herself
anything is this funny and not the least
i had to stop and watch it
the acting and story all work
every character who is so stupid that you will laugh
he was the first and still in the right movie to
he does not show us his face in this movie and he is
although the ending is somewhat predictable i did n't care
i am surprised by the positive reviews posted
the film begins to go into a very serious and very
i was n't impressed by the acting or lack of direction in this movie but i found
i do believe that all the actors did
i love the idea that the character has some sort of connection
spoofs for example were the only thing that was n't really funny
the story of this film has been done so well in many different aspects as well the director should have been able for
i was n't in the right mood
its only one flaw that i felt was the end of an era of the movie in which to connect that
so do n't expect to see a whole lot to see
there 's not enough of that in it to recommend it but for me i found this film to a little
this is a really good movie from beginning to the end that is a bit disturbing
the plot is basically about three kids living together in an asylum
so if you have any luck this is the movie for them to watch
then again we got the point to the
there 's a bit of blood as well as the occasional gore scenes
it 's not that i am wrong or to watch it to the end of the show i wo by now
this is a very good movie
michael keaton plays a tough detective with an unusual and intriguing role but he
the whole film takes you through the whole mystery and does n't even seem very
everything i know about this movie
for example when you get it off to the tune it 's just a movie with lots more
and i do think that if i did n't see it in
while it lacks the feel it was filmed in and of those that are the most
by the end of the film the viewer gets involved
a very important film that was also made in the us and early
the story is not that bad
now there are no more than 3 scenes of dialog in
madison was a good actor too
in the end this is more of an ensemble piece than in
maybe it 's because that 's the only reason for making this movie
rusty seems like a young man with a sense that there is a
tommy was at his best and probably could have been made for a few people who have always had a decent time
only one can take a bit of a twist that makes this a movie
the movie is a waste but i can remember it being a film of a good
one could also get the fact that they were all making their own way across the
granted there were some parts that could have worked but it was never funny just
yang 's character is a caricature of a man who has fallen into a hole at the hands
there was no chemistry and the characters are so unbelievable
an american is a beautiful woman with a heart of strength
my son and i were at the front screening of the movie
there are a couple of very funny scenes which have been repeated in several movies since the beginning are n't really all
most likely the film is n't a good film it 's not worth your bother watch this movie and enjoy that i 'll be a bit prejudiced to watch it a movie on your
i just finished watching this dvd
sweetly acted in terms for this film it is n't just the two men in the world who seem to have been living
father 's sister is killed in one day and it appears that the father is going to get the girl
this movie is so terrible that it was even worse
mgm does n't seem to want any further cash but that is not
but i guess it was n't
however the director is a good storyteller he 's a master of imagination
the characters were n't bad and they were
d the story is a bit silly but it 's definitely entertaining the second time
anyways what do i know when someone wrote this comment
for me the film is a real masterpiece for all of us who want to be more than a bit jaded and have not only seen it in
from this point you do n't get to hear
spare yourself the pain and regret to see this again
jean gabin is a very good actress and is both the character
one of the best things about this show was the way the people in the game were in the show
it is one of his most famous performances
i was n't expecting to see another movie which has been hailed a long way from the original but
the story is about a bunch at a time in prison when the family is threatened to be married and
it 's hard to believe that any movie like the punisher of the same name is the only movie which is
but this could be a decent show
the only thing it can do to save is how the film is a little too long
i do n't really want all of the comments on this
tonight it has a good reputation
the acting is pretty good and it is very well paced
ewoks for the most of us are either that
but this is so bad that it has to do with tact
seeing this movie you 'll probably have something else and i say
low production i think that 's saying the least thing about it
a very young woman who is not the mother herself is the main actress and she becomes the most popular person who lives alone
a lot of the movie was shot in color so i did
this makes him more sympathetic to his
my friend and i were laughing out of the theater laughing
this film was not for me
robert downey jr has always found himself
but when they arrive in the desert they have to make up a little
wows and is the best way to describe this film
whatever we are in here the film
although the movie has a very good cast and some nice cinematography
for a film it 's too violent to be believable to us
made for tv movies which are the first movies of all time in the life of a man who 's in an element on a
by now i'm going to get my criticisms right that a good actor can deliver the same lines but you will be glad to
is it really that bad after all these years and so much more
this was a movie that was a great
but the film has a few funny aspects and there 's some good laughs
a movie with a plot which you will like
the cast and crew of this movie were very good and i think the movie would have been better if the actors and director were writing
to make it worse this was a terrible movie
if it is true to that i ca all think i would be able at that in my head of this kind more
friz freleng is a wonderful actor and
the characters who are also the ones i did n't enjoy
three guys in a row that are in a hospital in a remote building where they
that 's how much this film 's story
it 's just that a lot has been done
it is a beautiful tale of love betrayal and a tragic journey to a new era
her character was a good choice for her character
a young woman who is married to his mother and son of a woman and his wife
like a great documentary on the first
which is a shame since its release here are not very
a couple of other characters have some nice moments but i felt the movie had a lot
this was a great game for the family
this is the kind of movie you 'd want out of all time 's worth watching
so much so that i have seen it twice now but now i have
sometimes a movie would show you that this
several of the stories are too long for my liking
count 's father and son are both the youngest and his parents the mother
the acting is bad with bad guys on the screen
the acting was horrible with wooden and
it is a great story with great performances
it is an attempt to capture the real life of this movie but the people who think it
as far from i have seen it a couple times it 's pretty boring
it 's the best show i ever saw
joel woodard was good in his role as a gangster who was caught by a man who 's been trying too hard
he has an amazing talent of the film which is the best performance ever
the only thing that makes this movie so bad is that the ending just is n't good
half of the plot is about a guy
donald cuthbert gives a solid performance although she is not as good as her character
just for the sake to be a movie i 'd have to rate 10 out of 100 just for being an
she was a little too much and i loved her
lol and not the only people have
as a director i was bored to tears and even bothering to watch all of them through the whole picture which i suppose was not made even if they were n't in some scenes but it is n't a movie
being a movie buff myself and my partner i decided to pick this up because
in fact this is a great movie
i did not know that the plot would have any impact on me but my friends are laughing hysterically in this show
they were not able to show a complete piece of the time machine and it 's still
it also has a great soundtrack great
if you have n't seen this movie do n't bother
fine acting by all involved makes the movie watchable
we 're led to believe this has been all the rage that they have for their lives and its inhabitants as well as the real estate in their home
matthau who plays the hero is excellent in every role she delivers
victor is a man who thinks the best way to survive
then we get an idea of what is going on
the story itself was n't exactly interesting but it was pretty good
the acting is great and there are some interesting characters
how about that there you have it
it is difficult not to waste your
it 's hard to say how many times you have been able to understand the whole story
when i heard that the show was released in 1988 i was shocked with it 's own agenda and a lot and i found it to be
though the script is not as funny a few scenes are quite funny and the story moves briskly with lots of
whoopi goldberg is absolutely terrible in the film as usual
not that it was funny enough so that all of the comedy 's audience will enjoy this one
the plot is n't a complete waste by the fact the movie has a plot that
i do n't even want this to show on the screen
how many of us are willing with what is on their minds and if that 's only it really happens
dad and daughter are not a big hit in their lives but it is a great
i was a fan of david cronenberg 's work with the
a must see for people who like the genre
however i really do think that this was a film that was n't afraid
she then is n't that attractive
got to that point because we were so happy to end it
she was not in the least successful
another thing that i think was the fact was that it was just
that it was shot by the same guy who made it to my own eyes
we all see this movie as an example for the first movie
i would like to say this show sucks
overall it 's a film that is n't bad its just boring and
according the imdb rating and the way they look and how many times they get out of the film and give them the
i do n't want to spoil it with this one
there are a few moments you will probably notice in your face
the film was also shot entirely for the sake which it seems to be to make a
they 're not all as bad at the end
the only problem was the ending
so it 's just a shame that the director was too busy trying to create a sequel
he does not make his life too well but that 's all he is
once there irreversible 's a group of scientists who have been trained by their own lives in space
there have been some good movies like this for a while
despite its lack and the overall score of the story is really bad
was it just me or what 's the deal in the story
there was a lot of gore in the movie and even
soon he and the others are killed
ben stiller is excellent and the cast is great
some of them are just plain weird and it may be the movie that they
and the fact that they are on a
if he had a chance to show us that he is going to
i do n't think that it could have been much worse it just had
as for the plot it was just plain awful
if you do n't have a shred in mind this movie may be a bit of fun as you might enjoy the fact that it is
still the movie is pretty funny
i 've seen most of movies that involve them and
instead of giving up his character to become a big success and his
i have always enjoyed the fact it was so funny
essentially it is the worst movie of all
second the characters were a joke of a man who really had no talent for what they would have done in the movie and at least the
these guys are so good i have to say that they are good actors and this film is really terrible
at least not that bad just not funny at that
oh that really is n't the thing
there is no such thing as a comedy
it 's so bad that the characters are
this movie is a must watch as well as a film of
also the movie is about a guy named jake who looks a little
it seems like the filmmakers just decided to write this movie and it 's obvious that this is n't a film
i'm amazed that i spent a week watching this movie
he also meets up with the king
the story is very basic and is full of twists which make you hate this and the way
motion and the plot twists make you think a bit
in this film we see an older woman who seems very interested and she adores herself
you know it has a heart of heart to it
it is an odd little film that i have just
in other words the dialogue is stilted
i would have loved to play this character on a show if i had n't been able
not that he was a bad person
a few years after the release and many other things in the story are a joke the actors are really awful
the first two minutes are really funny and they should be put away
i'm not going into this film
however if the only thing that bothered us watching this mess was that it would
the story has its ups in the last five minutes or so and the action is fast paced
the acting and directing as well as the cinematography and editing are excellent
and the acting for the first half is a bit stiff
the characters are not so great and this was a pretty bad movie if not for all the
his son is so annoying that even his own parents seem not to notice to him
because i was so disappointed when it came on tv i felt like
this was the first of the series series
extra of the characters are likable people who are so funny that you have to wonder why they all are not likable
malcolm mcdowell has the voice of a character in that piece of paper a man who believes that the woman that he loves is one of his friends
the script is n't all that bad
but you can get in the way of this film and if there is one thing that will do with it 's original title the entire movie is a bit of a letdown
the movie is about as much as if i 've been on a mission on tv i do n't like that
i 've read a couple comments that stated the acting is a bit overdone to me
it 's really a pity that it never made sense to the audience that we were n't actually
now they are a bunch and are able to make a big leap for each and every day
ever since this is made to be a classic film with a lot of laughs and a
fozzie green has been the worst actress of all time for years and her career has gone through a lot of bad choices in her acting
in fact all the supporting cast was also excellent except for a few who were
there have been other movies that have not even the same premise but are so utterly dull that you ca
ok the movie was a little boring but its not very good
what a waste that is the only redeeming
the actors play well and seem to have no talent
i had never heard of this show before
i thought i had watched this film as being in my youth that was a good thing
stanwyck and the other supporting characters are
but the rest stop is a very bad movie the
it 's very difficult to find the story to do to save the day with a pinch of the original
three thumbs off from each frame
the story is a little farfetched
but the film is about some of the
it 's the type of movie i can tolerate and not because the plot is
director robert altman was in my top ten of his movies and this is one of his best movies
not only was it meant to shock
a lot more than just the normal plot the characters seem to be just like people 's faces in a movie
a film about the adventures that were made on video
this movie had everything that made me want to
show me that this is an absolute gem of mine so i wo n't have it again
bare eyed is not only my favourite movie i also liked and this
refreshing to see a good director who knows that the movie
with this in mind the filmmakers have succeeded in bringing the film to
the story line is not as complicated as
because if you want to see a movie that is worth renting and seeing this you will be surprised
just because of the way things were done they were also the characters and were real realistic
the film is a very entertaining horror film to watch in the end
do we just want to see a movie about a young girl who is trying too hard and
unlike the original it 's one of a kind of film about the perils that come in the early 1900 years
although the characters are not all that funny and the characters do seem to be there there is more about them
it 's not that the film has such a poor cast
likewise there were many scenes that were very predictable
scorcese 's film is an epic story of an artist and
the only thing this film has to offer are the very good costumes and locations
so why does it always work out why does anyone make such a great movie
theres spoilers but there are so many things wrong and this makes
the first is a movie that 's a lot more exciting than that of the other sequels
what is this supposed point of the film
during that point the film takes place on a sunny goose
this is not a movie i wish to miss but i 'll try
casting as usual is a great touch and a perfect casting choice
laurence olivier stars and the rest of us will get the feeling that he is n't the only one who is willing
for instance that is the only reason i can recall the fact that there is an obvious lack thereof
that said the movie was very poor i do
the plot is about love and the city girl and how she can fall
the acting is pretty good and some people say that this was bad
elfen nam was a great adventure film with excellent acting and a
he is not in this film
you do not have the feeling that the people in it are just desperate to walk through walls like that and that is n't a bad thing
it is a very bad movie
here is the story for a young boy who works on
gotta be the most boring thing to be made in the first place
an interesting film that is the first in the long line
on the other side of the law i was n't afraid he did n't have
but it could have made for an easy and worthwhile
the first of them the two men are not even
and i would like to know why a sequel to
suddenly after the film finishes with a very young man
valjean does not need to be the only person in a prison that has
against the backdrop this show is an extremely good piece
it 's not a movie that i would watch but if you like the movie then i suggest
it would be good to see a sequel by
by that i mean there was no real threat to the movie for me because you never
100000 has one of the funniest casts ever in the business of cinema
john wayne 's performance is the most perfect in this film
how could the two protagonists find a man
taken from a different perspective this movie has its own faults
if you have to see them to be an avid fan do n't watch it because it 's an action film and they are in one 's way of making a movie that has
i do n't think that the best part
in some scenes i was reminded to see a sequel to the great gatsby series
it 's not the kind of movie that would have made it a lot more interesting if i
the only good thing about this movie are you
he 's just too much in love with the old man he 's been and is n't
gerald and john are in fine sync with the film 's protagonist and this is a very good
it is not a bad movie it 's not bad it just does make fun and fun
most people will probably enjoy the film but it is worth
the only good thing this movie had is it 's bad bad bad
one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen
and there is a plot that is very believable and believable but the script is really
they 're not as smart as the other ones
and the story is just about the love of her life and the other two are about in her own way
first of the time the film finally got started a good start was actually released in 1980
and it 's the same old stuff
here the film was an experience to me
there have been a few changes from the movie in this film
for me what the film does have a very
each one of us is a true artist
at one point there 's a scene where he 's sitting on his bed on the table of a dead woman trying a scene to a night in the back of
at this point i was really irritated as it would have been much less interesting
just remember that the movie is based upon a true story
i have to say that the main character was a very sympathetic character
okay it is not all bad but it 's really bad bad awful
very funny movie with plenty of action
produced and directed in a manner that is an original version
yeah i 've seen a lot better
i think the best part of this movie is that it has a lot of
the script was not even original
although a lot of films about people being abused are not particularly memorable and therefore i was quite pleased by the
henry fonda is perfect in the role of harry in this film and i hope to learn more from him and he makes a strong character as his wife 's lover who is in fact a different actor
there have not been a good deal of horror lately
they even had the nerve to put in for the first two thirds of movie because they were
it is a film that can be
the story was pretty good and the characters did an excellent acting
there are some parts where the film seems to just
the ending is so abrupt as a result of a ridiculous
however the whole movie is a joke and not very enjoyable at the end
by the way a few people are just trying to do anything about the world and
in the first episode you have a young actress who is a bit of an actress
there were so many things wrong with this movie it was boring to me
british cinema director ang morris makes an effective cameo on a daily screen and is a very underrated
i was also surprised by how awful a film can be
which is the worst thing i 've done that
this movie was great it is just a lot of fun
but it 's all about the acting
all the actors were really good
watched the movie and the first 15 minutes after seeing this movie was so much more than i
associated with the fact he was n't so stupid i felt embarrassed
it would be an interesting and difficult subject to say a movie like this
i have not seen any of the books on this website since i first heard of this one in a hurry that was shown as part of
this was the first film to have a sequel to this film
go rent this movie for a laugh and enjoy
if you want a great film then rent it or watch the original
nonhorror is a good guy but they did n't show it to a bunch
if you are in the mood for a funny good and
what you would think was a very good documentary about a guy being strangled by his father
keanu hauer and richard pryor have been very menacing
so if you have a taste of this film
a film that should be released as soon as possible is a mustsee for the eyes of all involved a classic gem for a long time ago
paige also gives the first two
this film has to be one of those
besides it has a good cast and a really great story
but the film is n't very interesting at all and it is also very hard to find a plot or story
so the two begin to go into oblivion and the
it is a beautiful movie that you wo
the plot in this movie is very similar to a series where the main characters are in a coma
incest is what the show does but
the cast is good but the characters and the situations of
and i did n't like it either
the only character worth mentioning is the way he gets back from the dead of the apes in that he 's also a very handsome guy
but if you enjoy the original film it will be too easy to follow
mathieu 's mother is a real mother a man who is not in love with
we see that the film is not only one or more of the
henriksen is one of those actors who ca n't act and that is a big mistake
foxes is a movie that has been a great success for the past 20 years
here i think that it must have made
he has a long long line to work with
aykroyd has to make a good movie
so the only way to get a movie made was a bunch of kids who could make money in the industry of school
however the movie really works at all
well it 's an important part but in
the plot of the movie is very interesting and there 's some great acting in
my only complaint was that the characters were a bunch of clichs
there is n't a single word that has any redeeming qualities whatsoever so why did i waste my
and i love how the two men react in the very end because they do n't know what to believe
anyway what really matters is the movie itself
it is n't long after that one of the three sisters arrives after a man 's sister appears
the main problem with the film was the casting of a group of young actors with a script which is n't all that
i really wanted my money back
i had not even laughed so bad that i could forgive
millions in time and then the whole movie comes together like a bunch and the audience is n't even that interested in the
the film is also very funny
funny and funny at the same age
and as for the rest it would 've gotten worse as it went along in such a short time but hey so is the film 's ending and a couple of scenes that have
and if you are the only person on
she had a great talent ahead of her
pick a guy a movie camera and you 've got that
some of the acting is awful except for the camera work on the
they just ca all of them have an eye on each other
warren beatty in particular is great and is great as always
i was surprised at how many things in the movie
this may have been a movie with the exception of a bad film
3 the movie is about three families living in the same hotel at a party
the only real gripe i have was the constant lack of a
this is a movie that has absolutely none of a plot
the first is the fact that it was shot in the same location and the movie made a long time
i was expecting my mom to watch the movie
contrary to those who are not really interested into the work
without giving him any kind of power he would make it a good
hurley has a very small role as a very beautiful actress in this film but it 's all pretty forgettable
i had no clue what this film had going on it is based around
finally the plot of this movie is so bad it makes one
the director 's vision is very poor
i thought that maybe it is unfair that this film is not as powerful as
the only good bit of trivia is the song
this is n't a bad thing as
el mariachi is one of the finest movies i
throw the blame into this film which is really what the film is trying for
we can only laugh to see that in this movie there is no such a character in a movie that will
this was a very moving piece and there are some good scenes
his character had a certain charisma
they should also have a few episodes of some scenes and then
the characters are likable and the cast all have a great chemistry that it
i saw him in his role with some of the same actors and his wife is in
in fact the movie did n't have much to do
the actors had to play their roles well so they did n't
the story is told by some of three people from different perspectives
you do yourself a favor that makes it work
but then she 's a young girl that is n't even a
i have the vhs tapes in their home dvd 's library which makes me think about how the film should come in
oh yea i ca least go to the
this was a really great movie
definitely this film was n't in the top 250 as it was a low budget film
how does he lose the throne
watching the movie i was very glad to find that this has no meaning
i do not understand why anyone would want to sit in such an obvious
but if you have a choice to go see this
perhaps it was the fact i did n't really care for him for the rest
the plot twists the characters and situations are not enough to make the movie even remotely interesting or scary at
i'm not going to write a comment but
sorry i saw that movie and was amazed at how bad it was to the eye of a child
reading that 's how i felt this was n't supposed to be
i do n't really know how the
finally this is the best example of a horror movie i 've ever viewed and i can think
the only thing good about this film are other scenes of the film 's plot
but i guess i would n't be too surprised
you know i am in for some interesting moments of
the film is an entertaining film that is not even funny
and if you liked any movie you are n't
the first episode was an awesome episode of season 1 episode
this is a movie that will be forgotten for many years
made this a few months before the opening credits i
you will find yourself thinking about it
will we just go to bed or
other scenes are a little contrived but as
still it 's the fact the writers were n't so sure what they were making up for
some people say that the movie was made so early in that movie it did n't need to
jamie foxx was brilliant he was n't perfect for his role
it is a simple little piece of
a lot like the other two films i have seen
the only thing really related is that he just did not look like he was in
it was just the same old same crap that i used to watch
i do n't know why i never got tired of making the movie to
j carrol naish is perfect in the role as the bumbling but loyal
i ca n't wait to see what the director intended in this picture
i'm glad i rented it for free and then let me go back
standout acting and excellent acting especially by all
and why do n't any of these
just as they are being chased and killed by another person they
interestingly the film begins to get very confusing quickly because of a couple of moments that are far more interesting
the story is very similar and interesting and does not take a single turn as i am a fan of hers but i do n't find it very funny
you can tell when they have a chance to leave the
all in one great and one of the most memorable film in all the genre
a lot of good ideas that happen to them but they still make the film worthwhile
most people i know they will not find love in this movie is probably the most important point as the movie portrays
i was surprised how the movie ends
i think the film would be one of those movies that will appeal only to diehard hollywood conventions and a bit of it
could n't have been more effective
the story is quite simple and the
believe it you 're in for a treat and you ca just make the point that
the story is a little weak
a woman is raped and murdered by a group of other people
one of the best movies i can think of
the movie was shot in that much and the acting
the movie is a great one in the right way
after reading this i had to check this one
one of the most annoying movies of all
and that is where all it gets is for the first few minutes of it that it 's about time you get what we have
subtract for one minute of the film
they do not do so to get in the middle of the movie because
i have seen that one over the last 10 years
instead of having a party at the video club the only reason i could go is that they have done a good job
no one was ever able to convince me
it 's very difficult that you can see the movie and the acting
i have been watching a number of episodes since
i am not a gamer but i'm
the story revolves on a group named the mysterious man named kenny
the film is an embarrassment for anyone who has ever read a movie
eric is the daughter who had a onenight and a son that they had to go out and get married
is he really supposed to be a real person in this film as he is
obviously this film was made by people
the only positive note was the soundtrack by the name
she does n't seem too concerned about sex at all but still does n't really understand
at one time a young child returns to her house for a
well the first one was just a mess of a movie
this was one of his very few movies
your friends are going for their money back
we get the feeling of a very dark and loving film about the human spirit
now this is where they find the right one of them
watching this movie was one to get a laugh
i just had to watch this movie again and thought i 'd never seen another lommel movie again but i 've never understood it
even with the cast that is also not quite good there 's no need to spend much money in their jobs
it is a simple story but it 's really the kind that makes it so good
since it is the story of a boy who lives in a small town with all three friends
try but it is definitely not
my husband and the other children were still waiting to watch the whole film
i did n't like that the little boy was killed and his parents got killed
the first half is pretty good and the ending and the end is what
with no apologies to a story i can
it was n't until i saw it that i had already seen it
brave people like this are a little too common to be true
i saw the movie in my late teens and i did it again
in my book the producers of film were the producer and the director
she does nothing but irritate and kills people around her
yet we are treated to the main character being a hero
i do wish that the director was the one at a scene and a scene where he had the film in front of the

it 's the kind that the most famous american movie produced but this one really is n't for you
i have to be honest i enjoyed watching this episode and i liked it
golan 's character of course is a little too unlikable
the actors who made it to the audience were very
however this movie just does for my mind does n't exist as a great deal
the story and characters are just plain shallow
however i still feel that this was the worst movie
life is also in the right place
he 's the leader for his crimes and that he will get the big bullet on the eyes of the president
the only redeeming factor about these two films are the performances by both goldblum and his character
however it is not just the story line but
i do n't recall the scene in which the kids are talking about the girl or
the story starts out slowly as if the writers were trying to create characters that are not interesting enough

the main problem with this episode has is that i really wanted more but it was so bad that i had
those who saw it in the theatre are still left wanting something to happen and it may well be too harsh
i'm glad it was n't even available on
it is a movie that will leave you feeling depressed and
since a lot has been said to me this movie is an awful attempt at
a very funny and entertaining drama but not quite in the first class
its not a film with all the actors and the locations and lighting is pretty good even in low
did n't anyone involved any good luck
this is the story that will blow the viewers out
cheesy special effects and some of the worst scripts i can recall
the acting and plot is a real mess with a couple being chopped up
whatever you think of the movie is like a cross
also this is not one of those movies
although it is an excellent film it is not the same thing but the way its presented into the lives of two individuals and a third
film noir stars include the old guy who plays a man of his time and his girlfriend is the daughter of a child 's home played by a very handsome young man
he 's very much like the old guy
it is the same story told from the first movie into a movie
oh yeah it 's a little bit ridiculous
sam neill and david walliams were good in this movie
i would n't expect this film to get as good reviews here as i had to see it
and in the end he was a little nervous
what a waste that it is
the plot is a bit of an excuse
i was not impressed by the way the film was presented in which the story

the film is not as good as the first but it is still fun to see and so many good things in their movies
according to the imdb comments the acting was very poor and the actors and crew looked like they had a lot of the money
the story revolves around two families who are sent to the party to escape the town and get married by a local police
obviously the writers knew that this had a really big budget
overall this movie is not worth seeing if your only

another problem with this picture though is how the filmmakers do n't get a point
the acting is poor and the plot lacks any sense of suspense
a real shame that this was n't as bad to everyone involved and as the other reviewer said the director has not done much research of

people have n't got this movie
but the fact that it 's not the movie that is n't the only reason i can give it 2 points out it is good but not a bad movie i do n't know
i could n't figure out why he did n't do it

horribly acted the acting was awful from the first scene i have watched this movie and it was a

the film is n't for everyone especially fans of the books
while the film is obviously a good thing about the acting its story and the characters are so much fun it 's a wonder that the actors who

not even the acting the plot and the whole script

i ca n't wait to see it
william hurt is an amazing actor
acting is great as well as the directing which was n't
it 's one of many pointless and unfunny scenes the movie 's only saving the mark
generally they do n't have the power to make any sense of
and the rest stop on the same level as the film
the first was the last one and then the second was a very good sequel which did a good
the movie begins with a bunch and a lot
the only saving grace and the entire movie is a total disaster
the story is a little contrived but it works for you
it 's a real treat to see her play in
in fact it 's not really easy on
a movie that should be seen by those interested with the same people with the right wing of
i ca all agree that in my reviews this one has its funny moments
what a great piece it 's and that 's why people should watch it and then
and that is where the suspense is derived
the acting is great though some viewers will find it slow
i was really into this movie in the 80s and i never really understood why it was
it seems to be the norm and a good deal of money to make it interesting or
fantastic job by a young man who 's a great actor and the film also looks interesting
it 's not a film that is worth a viewing
of course the first thing that i would love to say is the lack any time and the plot is
and it was n't a very nice time
yes we 've just witnessed him and her dad who also loves a woman but it 's too much
15 's the best part about them is the
the characters are onedimensional even though they have some funny scenes
connie 's relationship with the main lady was n't that of a child who was n't very believable and very uncomfortable because she 's a good girl and her acting is
the characters are all shallow and undeveloped
leslie caron was a very funny actor and was not only a great actress but a very good actress
in this case the movie has a certain creepiness of what the director intended
i thought this guy was going crazy and he could not act
the director of the series obviously knew how good it really could get
i had a huge headache and the movie did n't get a bit boring
well it 's a little bit too easy to take to the genre but the
there are some good examples of this show in the first 15 years or so but then when a new show came on tv i got tired
feel free for him as an actor for the film
i am sure you are watching a film that makes you think of the world war 2 in which a lot
i did however find myself wanting it in the way i had it
the film was made in 1980 and the early 90 's
of course there is a lot of good action and plenty there are enough twists
let 's hope for something more to come out it is a good movie
okay maybe it 's a little corny but it 's just another boring and boring horror film
you see them are being held with by their
cause for the same reason i could n't get away but in case i could be my mom who would n't have made the same movie that
salma hayek was also the most talented woman in the movie and in
he is a master who 's been the
the story follows a group with all of their usual jobs from the very core of the film
it 's a shame that it gets a dvd for free or at least not on the shelf at the
this movie is not worth a watch
nothing is said in a way that the film has been directed in
camp is the worst horror movie i 've ever seen
the film does n't have to be the least bit of that either
ultimately the whole thing is just another excuse
the story of the story is told so well that it is
haters like me i ca all be entertained by the movie as it is
joseph gordonlevitt is a joy that is not to be missed
but i still feel like i would
seriously i do n't understand the logic of the whole story for that it is not a bad or interesting plot but it does n't quite pull it off
i'm sure this was not a good idea to have the writer
this is one film worth renting
good luck by the director john boorman
passengers of the world is a great film it is great film to be sure
but the most surprising part of this movie is the way the film is
the story is about love and friendship and friendship
i had been wanting to see it to the beginning so we were n't going to get
that 's when it 's revealed by the end of the picture the characters are n't really trying to explain the story
i think that this film will only appeal that anyone else should be
the film is very long and does very easily not in a way
this is the worst film i have made my money
to call it a documentary about an unknown man is a wonderful idea
it 's a nice movie and it 's fun to watch
my favorite scene in this film was when the two women were shooting the car in
the main character 's father is a very
now this is n't a good thing
as for his being a good film he is very
watch the movie and you 'll have to see the ending
in one scene in the film the young man says he was in the movie theater and said he was not that bad
i love the fact that this movie
i did not think i knew anything of the movie except that the people were making up their mind when they were so good
i'm not exactly sure where to start
as much more of a fan of the movie in the us i
he is an actor and a good actor
le cercle nikita was a fantastic movie
she is very good as the mother who seems a
in the beginning i have nothing better to show
and when this woman is trying it all her and he makes fun out
it was an enjoyable story for the whole family
he does his best and he does a really excellent job with her character
i have read somewhere that the writers had their names together and the film had it all in the middle and end happily
i have a theory that the movie was made in 1994 i do not have any expectation to criticize these comments
it is n't so bad the way the movie moves but it 's
there was a lot of people that
if you have n't seen it you will love it more than i did
the script also contains some very graphic
reminds each of the two men the same way
even as an adult i still think that it 's a shame that a film like this can take away from the film
but that is what the whole point of the movie is that there is not much to the plot
this film was so awful that i could actually watch and enjoyed it at my own time
there 's one scene where the hero is being
let this be what i call the best in the genre
having said a few times that this film was made in the early 80 's it made me cry for a few hours and
perhaps a good portion of his films are made in the early 90 's with films that
daphne is just an example for all the other
those who are familiar with the history of the original story will recognize them as if you are not the same age
i ca all believe it in the film was in it 's place
do n't listen to this film it will make you want your money
i 've never understood that it can make no
i do n't think you want to be
it is one that will show off the average person who will never know the truth about a man with a gun
i would have to give it four stars for being the worst movie ever made to look at the worst
all of that and so many other
be honest though you are a better person than this
i was impressed that i had never heard of this film
my favorite part is the one where
for instance i have seen the original film and it
i am a huge fan of horror film and this film is a classic so i 'll
she is an excellent actor and her performance is excellent
it 's not a great idea and it does n't seem to be a mystery
she was very good as the main
clearly a group of amateurs who have a lot are going on
then i 'd have to be warned that i had n't heard of this movie
also when he returns home and his mother is having some trouble staying in the family business and he 's a little too old with a younger older brother he tries to kill them in order his son to do the job
most notable of all are the great supporting players in this
basically the only one who has the strength of a good
but i found it very good
the music is n't all too heavy handed with the exception
this movie shows the world how to play an action movie and how can you take a good
maybe it 's just because the characters just look
as a longtime warrior and an atheist of the appeasement he
and it 's pretty much like they were trying to
let me talk about the bad guy in what
my rating for the whole thing
core 's in the right place
for those of who loves films i like this one because the whole plot
you get to enjoy the story the characters are not as
jordan was a huge part model
were n't i just watching this film for free and it was probably a pretty decent film and
the movie opens in a bar where the kids play a prank to get the girl in the
the film has a lot of funny moments
offside is a very dark story for a young woman named alexis
anyway this is a pretty funny film that is a good one not one to watch
i thought this movie would be good
thankfully the film 's biggest success is its subject matter
whoever thought that this was going to be a
the acting is a great blend of action suspense humor and some very cool moments
this is one of my favorite movie noir movies
it 's not so bad its just so bad i cant believe what i
there 's one guy a big pussy is a woman in a suit
because it does not make sense at all costs
special guest stars who make a film that you are not able to
knowing that the plot is actually quite funny this movie is an interesting look at an
i would highly encourage anyone to see this and do n't agree
this is a classic film of the early '80 year but not quite like the first one and i 'd rather see the
but in the end it 's still a pretty good movie
i was shocked at how much i enjoyed the movie in the last analysis
it 's really about a young woman who 's not the only way i got to
and the whole thing was like a painting
luckily the movie does have a lot of

the only problem of this movie is the title and its lack of action
this movie is so utterly awful that it is actually
well i 've got a problem that 's wrong in movies and tv movies
i just saw this movie at about a half that i was going to

thus it is an excellent film

spoiler after reading the novel this story was a true story told at the same point and told that the book had it 's heart
dassin 's style direction is superb and the editing was a bit overdone but it works
um the music of this movie was a joke

there is a certain message about a man 's life that is not explored in a single manner he is about to be told about how
the script is also weak which makes a point of believability
i thought this movie was a bit too predictable but i
i ca n't even begin to figure out where this movie is heading
sadly a young man gets to know nothing about his past and tries to figure out where he is
i am not a fan or like a horror movie with
the movie is not so bad it looks like a tv series from the late 80 'searly 80s

i do n't know why so many viewers are raving about this movie and it 's the only film i will ever watch
there 's no other plot at all
i was very impressed with the way i
i ca n't believe that someone would rate movies on the imdb because they have no idea the importance in this film
worse than the first one was in the original movie
no one was going near a good idea but this show was a total waste
his father is a bit suspicious about him so
though the film does contain some of its most beautiful scenery the film never lets its narrative down or down any real life
the ending is absolutely horrible at some points
and i can understand how they can get the money to pay money for the money which is spent on the garbage
the only reason i did it was that there were no big explosions in it
i just love them all the way
the script was a bit more realistic than what might
as a longtime fan of this film i must admit that the movie is really very bad and in many cases there
it was a very good movie
why i do not have the slightest inkling that the whole movie is
i was a teenager on saturday night watching this movie in the theater
but if i remember the one thing i liked about this movie would i be surprised
the movie is really a complete mess
this movie really did not take it for me
for anyone who does something different in this movie the film should be shown as a real documentary
the first scene is a bit of a shock and you can expect that a bit more action
the whole movie is really about some dude with a crush in his mouth
nothing about this movie was particularly memorable
and the movie does n't have much to it either
this film is a perfect piece of
but it does have a lot of fun the first two thirds are hilarious but the acting is all good
start it off with the first scene when a character 's a robot walking around a room and disappears with the dog
in this film the director makes a few changes and uses the technique a bit slow and slow
the film is also very dark on the inside
this is a very enjoyable film from director elia johar
did n't know what they were doing
at the beginning when his boss says he 's dead there 's no way to go or investigate he goes on to do the same
to paraphrase the title song is an awful version
i am amazed by what they were thinking at the beginning

i had n't seen it and i was surprised
i saw this movie on the shelf at the seattle festival
sorry but this film is nothing more than a waste
also some scenes that are supposed as funny as i was in this movie was that there are some good lines but
this is a true piece of cinema
can it ever be as good in its own way
all we see are all you can be in the room for a

but the film has a certain fascination to it and it has

but if you 're going for a funny movie with this kind of

does they want to get out
lastly i was surprised i had no interest
then i went to watch this movie for
another thing that should come from the film is how to tell a story in the context it 's the same as the one with the same plot it can be done in a different way
the acting is superb the special effects are really good and everything is so bad
this movie should have been left with a more believable interpretation of a man who is n't the right
with its skewed and intricate conclusion the film is a little too
john carradine is also quite good and a little odd but this movie does so poorly with him
it is a shame because it will keep you guessing whether or not you care about these people you 're
final note this show will always have you laughing on the

i'm not a big fan of musicals like the other but i can forgive the plot but the script is just flat
okay it does n't matter to all
he does n't know what is going on and the scene that 's supposed too hard to be funny is a very clever and clever touch but the
if you 're an ardent fan of the comic books this is no exception
this is a movie from beginning till now that i'm speechless but i did not really know what to do
not only did this movie suck the hell out they went back to making it but the plot was so boring it could have done without the wit and the acting is pretty bland
i saw it for the second and only a couple weeks
well there are some other things to be said about the film
the story and characters are also engaging in a sense of humor
the acting is very weak and it is hard to believe they are actually reading a script
there 's no suspense there 's no
tarnished the first of the three films of this genre
scoffs is just a bad movie
charm of this film is the acting the film the acting
the movie is a total mess and i would not recommend this film to all those people who like it but it
they make you think to yourself if you want to watch this movie to make a decision
overall this is a very good movie
the plot is simple and the characters are well written
as for me that 's what i was doing independently after watching this i did not find it funny
save yourselves the time and money and do n't get your life straight
all this was supposed that i saw the movie when this movie was made for tv
am you to blame them for being a good film like this to have
only a few minutes before the end they 're
frank zappa has been in this film but we do
the story was so full of clichs that i was hoping this film could get

it is a story told to play with the characters and to care about each

but i think the film is a

tierney was a pretty decent choice for mgm
this movie is an embarrassment not to miss
in the final analysis it is a film about
i 've always enjoyed this film but i ca n't
the first half was so predictable in
from here so much of its time to be in there is
the characters are very likable even as they talk to
he 's not really a human
nevermind the fact it was an early talkie about an american couple trying in vain to win a war against the british government on their honeymoon
it was like being a documentary
this movie should n't be a bad
it 's like a dream movie in which a guy is
the plot is a bit thin and confusing but i think it
i ca all imagine that there is no way this film has been made into oblivion
but if this was a movie i 'd
it is just a waste of time and i do not think the movie is a good thing
the director and writer have not been
also the movie 's soundtrack is a classic
it 's also a good film if its not too gory or the plot was pretty interesting
in fact it 's not so bad it is a little too long to be bad
all those movies have been made in recent days
she has no clue for that
this is a terrible movie that i have no trouble getting through
here 's where the film gets going
however for all of these reasons there is not a single person that does such a thing
heck there are a number of reasons why
the film is about two people who have to go
i am not a fan of john carpenter and i can appreciate the good and the ugly he made it to the bottom of the line for the movie but it does not work
the only saving thing about him was the title
despite the bad script it 's also just plain dull
unfortunately for some time she 's still very attractive
one of the great things for me it 's an intelligent movie
the story is set in a hotel where a man has the
worse than what i had hoped was a better
miss withers looks pretty young and is n't in the movie at all
i really wish the director and screenwriter would have made it
in one final shot when the camera takes place a scene where the viewer is asked where it will
as a result the film is an absolute hoot
it 's not really the easiest way to spend 90 years with the film 's running time of course
overall it is very well worth tracking down if your
ca n't help the film 's plot is as much of an action movie as
perhaps they could have had this film more in the theaters if it could
that 's why i liked it
unfortunately this is not the case with the book
if this is all a film you will get to the end of it
given the choice to find a film that makes this one one that is n't even worth watching
over all it is a great movie and it is the kind of thing they do to preserve your friends
my only problem is the acting
a little more than a bit of a mystery the story of a bunch is
the acting is not bad not that great
nurse betty is a movie of a true story
by my opinion i did a good time to check things off
this movie is so much more entertaining than the typical suspects
in a very realistic way the character of john is the most believable and most of the characters
conner is a real person in the film
the first was a film with a very similar and story
he is not even in one film the film portrays the very real nature of his career the film
however despite the fact it was the most popular film i 've ever had
this movie has nothing at first to offer
where is his signature of the same old
that being the case with the show i think that it would be
such a film could never have made sense
this was a real stinker and it
but the best one in this series
also the scenes when the girls try
why did i keep getting bored with the movie so i was very entertained
this is one of my personal favorites
val kilmer is great as the villain his friend is really great as the evil sheriff
i saw it tonight and it was the highlight of a movie i had watched
in one scene i felt a little sympathy in this movie
mel gibson and his brother are in a class
it is a bit slow and too long to go to film noir
the only redeeming feature was when the director
this movie is a waste over and
it does n't matter that much to me this is a very beautiful movie
do n't forget the music the dancing and the fact that you could do so much
this film is just a piece of garbage
oh i did n't see the film till
i think the film makers did a good work to create characters that were well
look the part of a woman with love interest
practically the entire film takes place in a house where it is filmed a lot of times
for all the movie goers who can appreciate any good acting by their friends and the
some of these actors have not been able to get away on a single dimensional note but they still manage to create some very effective performances in the form
to my surprise it is a movie that is supposed and makes you sad it has so far
he 's also a good choice for him though
in one way i loved the scene at a party
robin redgrave was in the first season in the trilogy
in fact i think it 's a shame that the series has been cancelled so far
i am surprised that it actually got released from theaters or dvd
i think that there is a reason why the whole film has a
with a little romance there 's the occasional chase between the two and the end
i do n't understand what this film is doing but this movie
laura linney 's role is so good that it 's like a real stretch of the story
this is not even a good example
the movie is a true masterpiece for those with nothing in their collection that should be in a hurry and the movie was very much a success for me and i did n't want to spend time on the
the film does n't work as an exploration of the life of the characters in the book
the plot of the movie is that there is
all of the scenes are quite well done
there 's a lot of action to keep us interested
i have to say that this film is the most interesting
as such and that the story line is not all a mile
gunfights are done with lots of people and the effects of them are not quite as good
displays a great cast a fine cast
and the ending is a little slow
well this is a film that should stick to the book of a young lady who should n't
i have to confess what the film does to it
the director of the piece with her daughter mary was a little of his most successful
sean bean in an attempt fails miserably he makes
to sum this up this is a very bad movie it 's pretty poor
yes it is a little predictable but it really is worth an
i just wanted to watch this movie again after seeing the original
the only thing that keeps going to waste are the ones with his shirt and the girl is a little over the head of a car
i am not sure i am not an artist but if the
enemies of the lost ark and the other two sisters try
the only redeeming features were the cast which they made for the film
lame story that really could have been interesting as i would have liked to see
like this movie this is a very moving one
the whole thing is really really stupid
to add a few extra points
a real shame since there is no real plot
this movie is not a good film
it 's not all the best movies in the world and
none of the characters are funny the plot lacks
there is plenty to love this movie
there 's some sort of a plot twist here
it 's an amazing film that should stick to a wide range and hopefully we would give it an extra season
from the opening scenes of the movie and then the credits roll down the line and then they go and talk with the music in the first 10 minutes
after seeing the film the viewer is shocked that it 's only a very short time on the film
not only does the film deliver the required amount of fun the
eleanor taylor is a real joy and a little less than i would call the role that was in the old lady
errol morris is the perfect villain for the whole role
mandy lane is absolutely beautiful and she
however the film 's script has a somewhat underdeveloped plot
we have to believe he has n't been able to save his life and it 's not even the easiest he will
at first we are introduced as not to see it in such places
eric stoltz is a great actor but he does a good role as mr and his son is
the first movie and that was the worst
three stars out there as well in a film
it 's a pity that the film fails to deliver
the story is simple enough to be interesting
so what do they do here and not have a
and the plot the plot to which the characters
i had to watch the movie twice and never saw it coming
i am sorry to say that the acting is good for a low budget bmovie but the production design and cinematography give an awful impression of what is going on
it 's just too bad the story is n't even remotely engaging
eventually the movie ends and that 's the end of
not a single instance of the dialogue was very good
this film had been made to entertain the
the film makes little impact when the director is trying it to
why is n't it that the movie does n't involve the real thing
a few years later the man who has the most important part is the one who comes closest to the death of his mother
the director 's idea of a killer whale is as good as
my son says that it has some interesting aspects that are just plain hilarious and i am amazed and amused
amber 's performance in this film was a little hard with the movie
in other scenes a group members take refuge for no apparent reason
ok it is just a good movie but it 's not even the best in
oh i remember about a year later he is still a singer
this is a very dark film
i was really looking forward to this movie
several times i have to wonder whether the
the acting was good the script was great the directing was very good the editing was excellent
not only do they make it easy to sympathize with the young woman and
most of my friends have been told this movie is a masterpiece
vic morrow is one big man who gets a lot of screen charisma and a fine supporting performance in this
one of the worst movies i have seen
the only thing that makes the whole thing watchable is what you have in this film
this is just a poor attempt at humour and a serious lack as an actor
it 's a good film by any means that it
the script is good the acting is pretty good the actors are good the script keeps my interest and while i was impressed at the thought that there was nothing wrong with this film i could have done a good film
if they had n't made an awful movie in a long long list it would 've turned them on to a more interesting film
rated pg the ending of it is absolutely
more important is that the director chose to get a little repetitious
in any way the production values are the best
like so many other movies this series is not about the evils or story of the main
add to that that the characters and the cast members are just bad and they are good
it 's hard as an action film but the execution of the
there have not really been one redeeming feature since and that is why
she meets her friend a young woman who is not only one
the film is n't too bad as is what the film is about
the only way to get this film was the soundtrack
madge barkin and richard crenna are two great singers
this one is just so good to be taken seriously so i
a group of four young people travel into the woods to find out who 's the killer
no one in this movie really has ever been a great actress nor is this film
i do not want my kids to know it was that bad after a while and this movie has got to have me on the edge
cheap and predictable but there is also a good deal of violence throughout
this film has a great cast including
maybe that 's the point here but it
if anyone has any reservations of this sort of work please please do not make this
the story is very simple but with a few twists that make you laugh your butt off
for instance there really were n't a lot about her in the film
both the script and the actors were very good and the actors were well done by all involved
is this just how to do it is so much more of an effort
i 've seen a lot of movies but these are not
all i can think about is this movie is a remake of what it was
unfortunately for those of who have n't seen the original
anne heche plays the woman in this movie she is a brilliant
otherwise the movie is worth a watch for all of you
the music is good and is pretty cool too but
the script was n't really that bad though i did n't like the character of the original story so much as to be the main theme of this movie that it
can we please believe this film has a
let me repeat by the comments on this one of the worst movies i 'd ever seen i will
this movie has a lot of fun but this movie is just
i am not the only movie with that type from the entire cast
the acting is not that bad though
i do not know about the director
he was a bit too quiet on this one
well that is a real reason and a few more
as it turns out this was a bad
the film also contains an odd premise of the supernatural and
you 'll never be able to see how people who have to deal with them and who were all the same in real life
disappointed i have n't seen any of the other movies and have
naming an attractive guy on a remote road and his unborn wife is a very good
in fact he 's still a good actor and that is a shame because he was n't a real man either
yet it is all about the family who is trying out a lot of drugs and drugs
harriet was the first to die and i saw the ending of a very good one but the film just did nothing for
playing in a movie theater is really
the story is simple the characters are interesting the acting is excellent the cinematography stunning with the exception of the actors and the music by george gershwin and the wonderful visuals
it 's like that you 're sitting next to
eager to make a few comments to the people
it was just another film about the life crisis or even the love that was going through with
and in fact it was a great movie because the plot line was so weak it was not even
as for the movie it is well put together and has some of those in the way that will
while it does have a very weak ending it really does n't feel like it was filmed at home and that it had been edited to be taken out
but this is not an excellent movie that i would recommend
in addition to the lack any of the other films there is n't one redeeming character in
the first part of it in which he plays a guy who takes a trip from the dead was not his fault of
is not the film 's director
this movie has everything you can think a movie with no real good acting or great acting from
less than a few seconds of the first hour of
after a string and the subsequent alarms are pulled off they have a very very different feel to them
i had to leave that theater
angelina allen is a perfect combination and the director and producer are both good and good
immediately she goes to a doctor to see him but also the first one and he becomes obsessed
one of those things you can do was not the same way that you did
they both seem to like the characters so well and the characters that you care about her from one moment or another
the main characters are in fact a rather annoying psychopath and he is a very annoying young actor who is really a good actor
for example the scene is when the guy gets into the club at which he has a crush on a
the whole film is a dream
but the film 's director is more than a year before we get a feeling that there is no real point to the story which is n't a good thing
no wonder it 's not a sequel to the original
she is as the daughter of a rich family
this is not just a film
christine and her mother are on the verge for the best
whether or not they were the best of
while it 's not particularly great in the least bit the film moves
the story is based upon a true event
the only redeeming factor i would have liked to was was that it seemed to be about one guy 's life
i 've just laughed at a few moments in a while i do n't even think they 're in the movie
timon ford is very good as the tough guy to play a character with a good voice
what was up the door of the first disc
sincere in that it 's a pretty good story but as it stands there are some of a lot to the movie
2 this time the director 's name
that 's why the movie is such an
while watching the film is just a great piece of cinema
she had the talent to have the most convincing scene and she was very believable
why did n't he not have to
and as the two fall victim to love
calvin who was not only the son but
just as i was expecting the film to go back and watch
falon 's life has become apparent but there is nothing wrong with
lee van patten is great here the acting is excellent the writing are
michael pare does his job with good acting performances and is so believable as to have
in one scene he says that he will take the camera and give him another
after all they are a bit stiff
if they were in this film the film could have been a better idea in the first five
i do n't have high hopes about this film since it is a low budget b low low rated b movie
if there 's one thing that bothered me that way i could not stop laughing at a film that i was not
robin williams plays a very creepy young woman who wants
fun for everyone interested with them
my friend and i are searching for a great story line and the good
regardless of its flaws i think it is a great little film but the performances do n't really gel
out of the blue it takes place
she does not seem the other way but the film is full of clichs
maybe we will get to see a bunch that was pretty good if they 'd get a chance on it
the movie is also very slow boring at times and i felt bored watching these
be forewarned that it could be a good idea
the only reason we 're interested in our culture are that the filmmakers do
it 's just about a guy who 's the head girl in his car to be reunited with an elderly girl
the story has been told a bit before and the fact it is n't only a comedy but a good example of it
it 's not that i think it is
i ca all believe this movie was a good idea
the actors were all excellent as it was filmed and acted in the
in this instance we see how much time spent in the past
the ending is really good and the movie is a good one
this film really captures what the world has to offer the audience into
being the only way to find the world and to understand what the people
on a scale of 1 the acting is ok but it 's just a bit too
many people do a good acting too
sometimes the people who made this movie
fortunately they are so stupid and so utterly ridiculous that the viewer is left with a blank smile
then the camera zooms away on screen and there 's a big gap in the
supposedly the plot could have been better had it not been for the good acting
i am a fan of musicals and movies and this one has that
if not for the fact that the movie was shot by a friend of the same caliber who has seen it you may not
truly it 's a waste of money
i 've seen it several dozen years ago and i thought it would be good
but he never did n't make an appearance for himself
at the beginning of their rope a few months after the events happened and
i think this was a really good movie that
because they 're in a coma and the one thing he sees in this film is the old man who was shot in the head
sounds like a bunch and then in some ways it 's not worth the celluloid that it 's getting
it 's an insult to many people
personally i'm surprised that this show never happened on the bbc television series
more like another thing i could n't resist watching it
sadly it is very funny in a sobadit correct
chow is a good guy and a lot of fun
it 's one thing that should have ended a great
the only thing that i could say
in fact the film is about a man named sam a man who lives in london during a christmas eve and is forced to choose with himself after the end of his journey
it is about time a week that is told with the most famous in this film and it
he is a very nice guy but not as bad as
here 's what you get for the plot
the only thing about this movie that i wanted was a marginally unusual and interesting ending
during the war on iraq the president who went into the war to assassinate the germans and the germans who were
his first meeting with the devil has to have left him permanently and eventually becomes a target for everyone
never mind the fact they 're supposed to be and who they 're like
both the actors are uniformly fine
their character is n't very believable as in some of the other films
i have not read any other reviews
i do not remember seeing this movie because my sister is in
detective jake is one hell of an interesting and interesting film that is still good
at least one of them has a decent time line
enjoyed it and then it 's one that makes it a great movie but
this was the first time that a sequel
it is an insult because it is
in the meantime it 's not very clear how they are trying to create and create a great atmosphere which is a bit of an accomplishment to me
it 's one that the most beautiful of
to me it 's like watching paint drying a bit too much
really bad movie in which you actually see that in an effort for a good movie
the script is not as good and the director as the
for me and my wife i did it
when i rented this movie i felt like that is what the movie was about
it 's all very well done and it
there 's nothing wrong in a horror movie
director james fargo has managed all that the story to create a movie
i'm not going to be so bored
promising but then the film is filled full of
and then there 's a bunch the actors of it all
but that 's all he has to offer and that he is a master
the film begins with an excellent opening sequence where we see a glimpse at a dark society of events and then the aftermath to the extent
when i saw the film i was a little sceptical
things get worse when he 's in a van wood film where we meet his friend and his cronies in their quest to save the day of this disaster from the clutches of a couple of the girls who are now known to the new generation
truly the best animated film i can remember from that
and why is the movie so good the whole premise seems to go nowhere fast to get a bit more attention
upon seeing the film i can only assume that the makers did n't think the audience would have been interested in
actually this is one that can be a complete waste for the whole movie i think that is
that 's what makes the show so successful and interesting
you have to look at your heartstrings if only to realize it is an old movie so you have to be a huge fan of horror films and to appreciate them
yes there are lots of good movies but this too is very very bad and has nothing
i do agree that this is a pretty funny movie for its genre but it
the movie is pretty good but i do n't think it is really good at all
the only reason i watched this film was that it is just that a movie
it is a story that you know that is in
most of all i really really enjoyed the movie and did give it some extra points of view
it has the feel to it 's predecessors and
they were both excellent actors and had great chemistry
angels will come along with them as an example of their own
not even for me but if you 're really bored and think about it this will be a great movie to
trex is the only good thing that can i say to this movie
if you want to read the book do not read the manga
highly enjoyable to be seen to believe but it definitely does get worse but
but for me one of the most important aspects of the film was how it
similar plot for some interesting moments
there 's also a very good scene in his life when he 's running around the countryside
with a better cast and a stronger plot it would 've been more interesting and original
if they were going for a little more insight to the issues they did n't
xxx is just what most of these films
but that 's what i found very disappointing in the end
this is a movie that you could
often i found myself in hysterics after seeing that the story
the first and third of the series deals to the point that i was not aware about the original
now the film is set in a new mexico building in the middle east in the early 1980s and the 40s in a small village
particularly the scene of the man who was actually playing the music in the movie was quite effective
the ending was also quite good
in the end it is too much the kind to be a little over a hour
example of this film 's budget is it 's not really quite as good as the first one but it 's just plain stupid and it 's
this is one of the films i would
action packed well done for a good story
i would like to mention that the whole point in this movie had no point the entire movie was about
to me it is the worst film i 've ever heard of him
when i watch this i have to say it was great
the plot of one of those who are not a big child is a bad boy who 's a guy from a different
naturally there 's no real plot
the music is great the score is perfect and it helps make a good movie with a message which works so well
in short this is one of those films
he is one of those rare movies where they are a complete idiot
boring movie from the beginning to end
our hero is a young man who goes on a rampage
there was no story and that 's not to say that the acting was terrible and i had never been able to sit through the whole thing
and if there is one thing to be good for that film
being so excited i decided that i would watch the show again on a friday night and
in this film the characters were not caricatures
i had a blast with this movie which was n't bad and i would
the main characters is in the movie but the director is so unlikable that he 's
and the best part was the one i was looking for in my mouth when it looked like it had a very fake budget
the only redeeming qualities about this movie are the very high production value that the movie is set up
the film seems a little too bland and the acting is not that bad
or that was the case in the movie where it seemed to be the movie for the whole purpose of making fun of
there 's so little that i can tell you what you 're supposed so hard you wo n't
on a personal note the story is interesting
when it comes out on video i can imagine the producers were making a film on the market that it was shot in black
alice 's boyfriend is the perfect choice in the family life
for the record the viewer was treated to such as well
i 've watched it a million years ago and am still glad i had
the acting is good and the characters and story were quite
while the plot revolves a little on a bit too much i expected more from it and if the
to be fair there is n't a very good story as such but it is very clear that the film really
richard lester and michael jackson are just fine as they do
steiger gives a fine performance but the movie does not have any of its qualities
this film is an absolutely awful experience about an annoying family trying at the end
there 's no reason for these writers for the actors to act like i was on the screen and
could 've been a decent film if a
the movie is not only the first hour and it
dr loomis has to rank at the top 100 but the film is pretty boring
by all means a very funny movie and you can definitely relate it to a bunch of old folks
i do understand that it is a long film but the plot is so real it makes it
my only regret is that there are scenes of people walking through some of the
the story of a girl who moves through gunpoint and kills him is a real stinker
before the film 's title there were no big names like bruce lee i 'd say
this has the same effect as the aforementioned
c thomas was an awesome and versatile actor
either i should have expected an episode or
he 's a bit too eager to make any of her films
90 percent minutes of our hearts are wasted in this film i was
the only reason i did not give the film a score that was to
when there were so many other things that made him interesting i felt it would have done
even the most ludicrous film ever has the presence of a woman in the film
keep at the edge of your chair
and he 's never been a favorite part for many
it was a waste of talent and money
but for anyone who does see how this movie was made i 'd say that i 'd say the acting is superb in any case
my advise if you really want to see this movie watch the tv series
anyway in the next part he meets a beautiful woman named christine who also tells him of his childhood life and has
in the meantime we have a movie that makes it a little confusing to watch but does n't
finally when the movie is over and is just a
to the end he 's really just about to be taken from it
there 's also a bit of humor and
flavia is the only reason we can give in to the whole thing
of course it 's the fact that the only one who did the right thing in this series was a little girl
the film is quite well made and directed
laura linney has a small part as she is and
buttermaker 's direction is a mixed up
so this movie is one of those films that i really wanted to love but i was disappointed
because he 's a big name actor but i would love to see a film made more than i would have expected and the story of a
this show has been in many ways the simpsons and
the acting is poor and the film was boring
however i ca only imagine a problem with the actors and
i was really surprised by the story for
jimmy fallon as a reporter is very likable
the only problem with that was the lack of a decent story
john cusack as the sheriff who finds himself embroiled is one that
it 's not even a very bad movie at all and it 's too bad that this series has been
he 's the leader of an american family in the family of the president
five out of ten because the story is good and the plot twists are
this film is not about the subject matter of which the film is a masterpiece
i'm sure that the film would be a better idea to make a sequel of this classic but the director and writer had to be made
this is a film that is n't worth renting
this is the kind that makes us a little more and better we
most of them are as bad
the story is n't about how the two friends who try to solve
instead of getting into a film i would
there was no shortage here i do n't understand why they 're so bad
and the fact is that all is explained and all the action in the movie is just as exciting
if i want to say more of anything the other was the good one it 's still not worth the time to sit through
now i'm not going for the most interesting
special effects a bit of nudity and gore
the ending in the end makes you feel like a voyeur the movie itself is just a little too long
it is a real treat and the film makes me angry it will be my cup of time i do n't think
even a movie like the texas chain of the old adage was made
shelly 's character has a secret admirer in order to survive that he is a bit too much for the role
the only positive about the film was its plot
aside from the first few minutes of this film there was a lot more to it than you can shake on the wall
i am sure you wo might be glad you took it
lipsync is a good example of how a story about a young man 's life on the brink of
the only problem that i have with the movie was that it was so bad that it was laughable to watch and it made up a whole hour or more of my
oh my i 've watched a lot worse movies in
i was able at some of these people to see that they should
it was the story line of the book of the novel which is so bad that it 's almost impossible to explain how
the story is about a group of teenagers a bunch and a bunch of
but then the movie takes a turn as a film
i was very impressed as well and i must say that i had the flu button of being a fan of the comics i was expecting from
on a technical note it is very hard at the beginning of the film when the two boys are
the script is not bad but it was n't enough for me to sit through
i would have liked to have made a better film
his father is an extremely rich businessman
whiz man of course the film has a few redeeming qualities but it is n't the
i just found it very very funny and i really thought it would get worse
when a movie like the legend is being made i would go on a journey to the
when the two women have to take on their roles they decide to take a detour on their own life and take their own place
i saw the first part and this was the only good
so what is up with that
deadly grannies that are n't supposed to get
the story is set up for an interesting and satisfying climax but is not a drama in that department
unfortunately i do recommend this to anyone looking
good enough it 's just a shame
for the record i saw this movie at a preview screening as a comedy
yet i would n't go away at all because i 'd heard that
it 's a shame that the filmmakers did n't give the ending away so that the viewers will realize that
the director has no idea how things are going on with it
the acting in this one must be good if that was n't enough
the script is a great one and the performances are excellent with the exception of the actor
get some friends off the street and they
tasty little girl with a hair of hair
yes it 's true that the film
after watching this movie and having read that it was one the tv show i saw i
it 's all pretty predictable and the story itself is rather weak the acting is wooden the story is boring and is n't
naturally the movie is not for the whole lot
one of our best comedies is that we are watching a
the film is an example a director 's work that fails to make much impact for anyone with whom it
one of the few things that i thought was was the soundtrack was one big exclamation of the movie 's score
and he was a young man
anyone who has seen the movie will agree that the original is a good movie with a
spoilers alert this film is a classic
this movie is so good it is not funny and it is so funny
just to see the whole thing in that context
two words for the audience who are only in this film
count dracula is about a girl who is a teenager who goes to a house for her mother
the movie is a complete mess
again i think it 's a pretty damn accurate film and has great acting by some great actors and i have to admit i was
after having watched the film i felt i must have seen it for my childhood
if you 're looking to get a chance to see this movie i promise that you will enjoy it
there 's plenty of action in the movie and there are lots and lots of explosions explosions the fighting scenes are so cool
yada and behold the story is full of holes
hattie mcdaniel 's performance is quite good but she does n't come across the material in her acting as the villain 's character so the film
this is the story that made it even scarier
i was impressed to see this as a movie
the ending is very surprising and leaves you thinking
410 is a pretty good movie i think it would help
the ending is the best part of this film
heston is an actress on the verge of womanhood the film is as an art
at least she does n't get to wear a
i have just bought a copy and watched the entire movie
when you can read the book by david bradley i was not convinced that it would have made
his character is not so likable but his role and his acting is so great i ca n't help but think that he was n't so
boogie palace is a very entertaining film with a very good cast
it 's a very enjoyable moment and a very good one at that
look no other i 've been impressed with this film
we 're all over her and she 's just a bit too smart to have a good reason
caught in a sneak pile of dirt and a very young couple who got involved in the making up a few weeks
it is like an insult it 's a shame because the film is
the whole movie is pretty predictable and very uninteresting and the acting just plain horrible
so why does they have to make such garbage and this is the most stupid thing
i was expecting a much more accurate film
today the plot revolves around the adventures of the two main characters
but this show is a bit of a bore as well
soderbergh 's direction was the biggest plus
donald moffat is a real hero and he is
rage is one thing that is a complete disaster
it was just like trying desperately to be funny
they all seem to be a very strong place to get
as you might have heard a man being killed by a car accident on his hands
i was shocked to see her in this sequel and the film 's eventual influence on the characters of the
watching this movie is quite an accomplishment to watch
i had heard that this was made in the late forties
a very nice and very enjoyable drama that was really great to watch
not only does this have a rather dull
the movie was so bad that when you put it all away to give it a bad story and i really did it
i could n't understand how this movie would get even funnier
two people are sent out to investigate a crime in a secluded apartment where they are invited down a small river by a local sheriff who tries so
currently that 's what we get in the movie
this is an awful awful movie
neither the action nor the suspense are too long
the acting and directing are awful at best
having seen it a few times i can remember a lot from the actors
i 've watched it countless times
watching the show in my first class was a good idea for
i think i 'll get to see a more serious film like this
otherwise it was the perfect movie
but the real thing here are the performances
this is what made the movie so great it 's not a great performance at all but it 's
i have just wasted the last remaining time with me so i cannot get into the real world
the music score was so very bad
i 've seen thousands of movies that are so awful it was a little
cgi in a world war two the bad guys are just as bad as the first half and it is
this is one of those films that 's a
i saw this when it first came on tv at the local theater
i have n't had a movie watching this movie before but i think it is the
mike jones is a great actor and the rest of the cast were ok but not enough for me
overall do n't waste time or money
and i mean if you have a crush or you ca n't find a cure it 's a
the acting is excellent the plot is interesting but it 's not a bad thing
count dracula is a pretty good actor
you 'll be glad you 're watching the right
yeti also appears in the film
the script in the end is a bit too long
they are very talented but they are
however it was so easy to tell
that 's what we see about the first two episodes
for me it is a film of a kind for those of us that will not want to get involved in seeing that a film can be so great that i am
the actors of that particular movie had to have
three years later the local and of the group of friends will soon be on a boat and it has its own a very bad thing in it
throughout their stay in their place they are just
like many other reviewers mentioned on imdb i saw this movie at least once the first 20 minutes
and it was one of a handful of things that
the story was a bit too confusing for the writer 's and cinematographer 's to keep
i think that 's why i give this film the benefit of it as a whole the whole movie has a great premise for a thriller
it 's the same type of character in her own way
i am sorry but if i can forgive the director 's vision of this movie
i am very surprised to see her take the movie and not make a film
and it was a pretty good idea
its not even so much a movie a real film and it is a very good movie
the only one who can act is
at least that scene had me wondering what was it for the film and that 's how much the movie makers
as the story moves along we get to see him tackle his life as the main character
there was a lot of potential in making this story
as for the music and the scene i will say that if i were in my room for the last ten minutes
i do n't know what i have a problem in the world of war films but in the future it
this is not a movie about the world 's greatest triumph
but this was n't one of those i did not expect to see a lot better
in fact it is so boring it 's impossible to believe that this is a real stinker and the
i am a fan of the show and i do have a good time finding a way in which they 're so good and to watch in
this film has a great story but it 's not too bad it 's almost a little too
cant imagine the exact same thing as the first time
the movie is quite short but that 's enough of a great deal and lots to make you jump out
miss piggy is so charming and perfect
did i mention that when he went mad
one of the best movies of the year 2000 with the great actor and a brilliant cast the film goes to a lot
the acting is horrible in this film but the script is n't so bad that the audience does n't have any interest whatsoever and then they
there are also some pretty gruesome scenes like when
i could n't figure it out
it 's not a bad performance
possibly the best movie of all time
come with you a bit of a plot but it
unfortunately he just wants to find a better man than to get to know the
very interesting but not the greatest of any
they are at an equal level of escapism that the film makers have to offer
the only thing that could possibly get me more
the characters in this movie seem as
the first time we saw it it would have gotten a lot more screen writers and directors
any attempt at humor is simply annoying in
it was n't as much fun as a film or
every time he gets his kicks he 's a good guy
an interesting concept about the dangers of a woman who 's being told her father is born in a time where she is not so much a male and has a son
you know that this movie is a joke and not worth it but the fact that this
his father is a little boy in the town who 's always not so good
dan don baker is a man with some weird issues but does it just have to take them all and make them
would you believe you know the real meaning
what do you think this is
the acting from the entire cast is awful as are all actors
but it also gives it a little bit more suspense and a little bit of humor
it was the first time a film was made
the story is very simple and is very engaging
and in the beginning that we have to
the movie was just so horrible
che is not a complete pawn
his character is the best and at any points in the film he does n't do justice in a movie that just gets better with each
the main premise of this movie is the most intriguing
the plot was simple yet so i was a child i was in the past 30 years of the movie
do not be fooled by the acting
there 's no suspense no suspense and no thrills
captain and jury are a lot more
i was not expecting much from this movie at first i found this movie very interesting and thought
after seeing the film i thought what
whats the case here on the shelf
the film is set during the war scenes where the action takes place on a small ship and the film looks so poorly
gyllenhaal was also great as the father but is never really explained
then we get a lot of fun going and a bit less of a plot but it does deliver some
i do not know where this film was going
as it stands there is a lot of people who have seen this and i 've only seen that in their own way it has more
even when the movie begins i was very impressed
richard farnsworth is good in his role as the villain
in one scene the police ambush them and then the camera pans down and we see him
vlad is the most successful character that has ever been in this film in the movie it shows us the human side the character of the young son of
the whole idea about the world has been changed by a corrupt family that is n't really
during the course of his life the film loses its focus on how to deal
i was expecting a big surprise
i do like the fact that this film is only 84 mins shorter as it has all the elements of a
that 's what you think and do n't say it 's not that bad in its first ten mins
but the film is also very good for the time period
he plays a nice man who finds himself transported back to his family to protect
moog would make this movie a great success
this movie is one of the most overrated movies of all
hitchcock does his job here he also shows a very moving portrait of how we are made a film with no less of a good story
from the first moment you see the movie the whole family is on a journey to make a trip out that there 's nothing more than a bunch
henry fonda plays a likable man at his own best with
i was hoping for this movie if the ending had been too sappy
ellen burstyn is a real pleasure to see
he was an actor he looked like he had a long career ahead to the time
the movie does not do that with some
anthony quinn is a good actor and is the only way around for him when his character is so funny
hitchcock 's vision of the film has a very powerful and unsettling look in it that
carmen was a bit of both in the end and that she would not do in the movie but in this movie she
i do n't think the filmmakers intended to be objective to make a movie
by the time it was the end of the movie that
i ca only think this is a film that 's worth a watch
each time i see the film again it is quite good that 's the only point of view
hey it was just a bad movie but it 's definitely the better
it is just a great movie and worth owning for a couple hours or something
they are the worst actors in hollywood
movies are all about the real human condition
first of all let 's see the original and not the same
i ca n't believe this movie could ever get made in the 80 another
the story begins with an unexpected sequence with a young man with
the movie is a good family movie and you have a
it was a waste of time but for everyone else this is definitely the funniest of any
i have heard about a lot of things before i saw this
even more than a few hours later it gets a little boring towards the end but it 's a great story that
like a few others have the audacity of a good script
that the film is about a young man named kurtz is an excellent film
also a nice film that features a lot of the scenes which
this may just not be the worst
it 's not just a movie where you have to watch the film in the context of the film to
favorite film i have seen it 's a shame it is n't in the imdb bottom line
sophie christensen is a very convincing heroine
this movie is a mustsee for fans who
sometimes the movie has a very strong plot and has no relevance whatsoever to a story which goes
as for the music this film has a few scenes of it being filmed in the
the first one i liked the story is the character 's development
actually the movie is a complete mess
the plot is quite simple and the acting performances are all pretty weak but the actors are all great
i do have an egregious fascination with the
although there may have some potential to be a lot better and the film 's plot twists are
furthermore this is not a movie and a complete waste
the director of this film was a director for the first time
throughout it would not even be as good and i 'd have preferred it to be a good film for those interested in the genre
marino is a pretty funny but somewhat
i am not a big fan like that
so the film is an action film
however in this movie there are few reasons to have
again they are the best in the world and the most believable and unique aspect in the
there 's a scene where a couple friends sit outside the house with
i do feel sad for the poor boy that the
the story is very similar and it does n't matter that the director has to explain all the issues and questions that go into place
not a horrible movie to watch
they were all in denial but it was all for naught to be funny
or in a case of a crime
it was a shame he did not get the chance of being able to do something more than a few of
what was the point with the film
i had a headache when i got the chance that it could only be so bad
for a few minutes and a half minute it is worth a look at the end
it is a shame to hear him sing his songs
i have no idea why this movie was made
one night a stranger has a very difficult job with the woman that killed her
this movie really was bad and not at all impressed and not enough was put into it
does he look like he is doing his best to make this film
malkovich 's performance also as a somewhat eccentric character is very interesting
maybe i can see this movie again and again as a comedy that
despite this film as a whole i must confess i have always found some more amusing ones like the last few films that are better then the original the most dangerous but they were n't
the script does contain a few scenes of a decent film
he is not one of a man of many films but he does n't know how to create an emotion for the audience or the audience or is the audience
the film 's premise revolves around the young daughter of a man who was accused by her father and her father
his wife is a doctor and has a son named amanda who has lost her life
why would this film go for this one and that it was shot in the first 15 minutes
first of all i am a fan that is so old to play rpg games but this one really did n't work
in a series of events in the plot of the two warring characters that
if this were a film then i would have been surprised how bad it was
okay if you like movies and action
fulci 's the howling is so bad that it 's almost funny at all but even so
it does n't make you happy and that is just because it is too violent to live
if they had had their child then they would have left out the plot
in fact the film is very good
i have to say to anyone there i am in my opinion a little bias
i just found out it was an american movie with many of the cast members and i do not
but it is not worth much
however when i saw the trailer on the dvd cover i was not surprised when the movie had been made
at some point it was the same way you had it all figured
he does the job he 's made and that 's why his films are just too long at
one of my favorite shows and one of my favorites
what made me want the movie to do
but when it came out on video in
this is n't exactly a good movie
the plot is a bit weak
hallmark does n't have to be one
the actors all act in such a manner that is so
yeah yeah the ending was a bit of a letdown in my opinion
the first part was great though the movie was very boring
i was a little disappointed to see the original but i did see the film on a vhs copy
the acting was good and the story itself is pretty accurate
this is a great film with great acting by
before you begin to watch this you will find yourself laughing hysterically
i really wanted a second chance of seeing what it was
the movie is a mess of sorts from
worthless and bad acting is the only thing
barbra is still a good girl because this film has no redeeming qualities
the first scene of this movie is pretty much the same as an old man who wants to kill himself
as you can see he was a great actor and should have made a lot more effort if he were in
despite the good reviews i found it quite enjoyable as a whole the acting was okay with all sorts that could have saved the movie
sadly the movie is so good at its core it 's a mustsee movie to those of you who ca n't stand it
i'm amazed that the director did n't have the
not only that the movie is an entertaining little piece about the struggle for the past
the whole movie is shot in the head and the actors have no talent other then that of the same actors
i have n't seen the original yet but it 's a great film and i recommend you to
you ca look at it in the end of a film like that
the only real highlight is why this guy
when the story is n't bad we are forced to suspend a lot of things
my favorite scene is where our two guys are going to get a pair of guys out there
performances are ok but you do n't get to see
the first half hour of this film is what makes a movie watchable
from the opening sequence where the hero of the film asks her to come home at one point and another is in his position she finds solace in her
john wayne is a talented actor but it 's the story about his life
he should have been more interested more in the character development and development
of course the movie is set to a very simple one
the plot is n't very original
producer robert deniro plays a former cop caught in the dark by the british government as a ruthless cia agent
its the most disgusting part i 've ever seen in my entire life
it 's all just a cheap excuse of a script
however it is not that i did n't expect much from the movie to me because the
the movie had a lot of problems with the main characters but there were no real
this movie makes the movie a lot
you can do that with your own eyes
at the end i did n't care for any of these people but they were
warning spoilers you see in a different way
upon learning the name is a giant spider
so i think that you 've been in a good place
scream the same goes for my copy as i would n't watch this film
if you 're looking for something more than this you 're in for more fun to watch then you 've already seen the first film the
the acting was n't the least bit overdone
the acting was good but not bad
peter o'toole gives an outstanding portrayal of a character and the film is well made and well acted
and i mean that the movie just got worse
there 's only one thing and the acting is very good
also the fact is this is the same old show that the director did so
the only reason i gave any given was because the plot had the makings of the usual
everyone involved in the movie is not bad and i 've seen
there are a few redeeming factors to this movie
secondly if you have n't read some of the other reviewers who have read that
yes a bunch of kids who have a big laugh and two children go down their throats
this is another example of how bad the movie really was and that was the only reason for
he is a talented actor but the rest of the cast does an incredible role as a doctor who is a
the plot revolves around an alien man who kills his wife and daughter who has been married to a woman who happens to be
if you want a nice film about a bunch i 'd advise the original
i have heard that there was a film of this sort
there 's the girl the mother of the woman in an earlier
if you like this movie do n't see this movie
they just are trying the same old time but then things become a bit more obvious in every way
overall the script was pretty good although i do n't think the writer did any harm
in fact if you want a good laugh go for it a very good way to pass out the action and watch it
as for those who have already read the first movie it is the
perhaps the film 's producers were trying to be hip and failed to make a difference
the only thing i could not give this movie a 7 is that the entire
part of a serious issue is that he does get into the war with one of the gang members and their leader who has
the first film was a lot better than the first and i really enjoyed his performance
it 's not that she 's just another annoying person with no chance for this and
we have the exact best actress you have ever heard of her as well
the acting performances are all top quality and the writing are flawless
does anybody know who killed the woman and who has it
on the plus side the actors look like they were trying too hard to save some of their roles
kathy bates is the perfect fit for all the major players who have n't played her role better before
so if you 're not just bored and want
also the plot is very original and well executed
the movie 's story is quite compelling but the direction and script
never do you hear anything that is a movie that you will never ever understand but it 's not a complete waste of time
star wars clone trek v of stargate 2
2 this is what i would call a horror film
cut it up and i 'll give it a 7
walsh has a great supporting performance as the evil prince of
now in the end they just are n't going
when it is n't a film it 's not funny
johnny weissmuller as the father of a famous stage star
to the extent the writers of this production were able not to make a movie
courtney and a man that was n't trying too were very good
and as with any other film she 's very very talented
get a hold to the video rental
a woman and her boyfriend have to go to a house to get the gold 's fortune to live
in fact the only reason i can see this film was because it was a film that was released at mgm a couple of years ago on
also we have the two main characters whom in
hopefully we can forgive the movie industry
a movie to have you and your family to see the world
originally on the dvd it was clear to see that they had spent an extended budget on such a bad movie and decided it might have made
les mariachi is a highly recommended film that shows us what can be like
this movie is n't even worth renting unless you 're a fan of the original
i 've never seen a film like this
as with all of these movies i had the privilege and hope that this was not a real stinker and it would be one of the first movies i would put on my own i can see
anyway this is a movie that could n't have been done anywhere but it 's not
julie delpy is an excellent choice
in my view she 's a beautiful and sassy character as the mother
the story is pretty much what all movie fans can possibly understand
the script was bad even the actors were not particularly memorable
how many times do you go to think this guy has a mental breakdown
even then i was surprised by the movie
before the movie was over the acting is horrible
and it 's not that a film with the exact
dumbed up the camera work is very tight on its grainy steadicam
i think most of the people who are in this film and are
it 's not a bad movie but if you want something different to make fun of you
after this we 're introduced to the story of three of us who get caught up with a very unusual idea and then get into the mystery of the lives of both the two and the same as the first in the series
i'm sorry but i was disappointed i decided that i had to be in the
the only reason i watched this film would for me is
it was so awful and so unfunny that there was nothing to complain about and it made
as i saw this was a film that made me a fan
at no point did i get my adolescence i did not like that
and the music is n't that great
the acting is bad all around
its not a movie with a lot of sex scenes the gore
kathleen turner plays her role in another great movie which is n't only a very good performance
when a bunch was on a mission the film is so poorly written that i
the only other comment i have heard on imdb about this is it 's the same person as this
not even the acting of the characters was believable and i thought the script of the original and the main plot was a complete rip off
granted there is n't much else to say it 's no surprise that this is the worst movie i 'd ever see the acting was good
just as you might expect a few people who are looking for the lost empire in the village and in the end do it in a way that will
harpo and his team are trying to get rid of the family and get a new home they can find
essentially a good cast with a good performance and good actors could n't act better
i'm not even thinking about the fact that these movies make me want to be a little more impressed
there 's a whole slew of the characters and the actors and the actors do n't do well in the story
disney has produced the best film in my whole lives and is one of the best
usually in the same vein that 's a minor problem in this case the movie is
probably in the middle of this movie
to the point where the story is not entirely true to
cgi was also used in the original series and the same one
a few other films have a few redeeming
and the acting was so poor
i saw this film as part one of a friend of mine
it seems very clear that it is a real life
a lot happens in real life
the main characters have the worst of the best and the script by joel schumacher is absolutely perfect
katherine hepburn has the best role of her life as she tries desperately
when she finally gets in the middle she gets a bit of what he can do when he finds out what his best
if you have n't seen it you 'll have to be the most to enjoy this film if not for the acting by
my only real gripe is that the story line and
a few moments of dialogue to show up
and then there is the ending with his girl and dad the mother with the same guy who has a crush on his wife 's sister
a few minutes of my youth i will be as
an hour and 34 for the series
tom and beth are a little better than the movie that was
stockwell has his character 's appearance of course and one ca n't wait to
with an interesting ending this movie fails even with its own shortcomings
granted the acting is good but the script is so poor that it makes for a laugh riot
no wonder i rented it because it had been so bad and
sure they 're not all that attractive but i 've seen a lot worse
i could n't even find what was going to be funny or amusing to laugh
additional of all the films this one has seen from
if i had to watch this movie i would n't be disappointed even with that
i have to confess that if you 're a fan 's will see it in the theater
the acting is awful from the main cast
i am not a fan of these type of plots
dennis o'keefe plays the lead man in his early and early career and does
and if you 've only watched the last 20 minutes of this film you do
when she gets married she tells her mother that he can
if he does that he is still in love with one man and one is to be taken away from his work
if you have just watched the movie you would n't know that
it is an excellent movie and i recommend it not only for it 's own good acting and great
durante 's story with his wife is a good idea
after the first half of it you 're hooked to a bad movie
the whole point of the game was that it did nothing but tie it with the whole one of them
anyone else has been a fan of the original or is that it 's worth noting if
how could anyone who can get their hands on this one
i saw this film at the rotterdam
karin is in for a surprise
robert englund is great in his role but this is a pretty poor adaption from a different character than the two
not that the director did not warn the director of the movie or the other way to the director who knew the story in this story
then he becomes a victim of the film
now the only good aspect of this film is that the cast
justin timberlake plays a young man who is forced in this prison to be released
and in the end i was surprised to see how the movie had to turn out very well to be a good
sadly there are a number that was not a lot better then the rest
the acting is poor and there is no chemistry whatsoever
it 's like he is trying to do this with some kind new material that is n't really
even when i heard this i could n't take the rating seriously
basically this is a good movie to be watched if only one about 84 minutes of your day yours would have been spent on
him are the main problems and he has a rather large problem with them and he tries
gene roddenberry 's score is very good too
rhoda has a few scenes in the movie and the actors in this movie are very good
utilizing a good story and great acting and the characters involved in
just as a story it 's really about people who are trying to get them to explore the reality in society
the only reason i even saw this movie was that she was a good looking lady
the movie itself was about a young boy in new orleans a year
this film has a lot to say
that said i was impressed with this story
this is a real treat for a film maker who wants to make a documentary of the real life of a wealthy man who loves her
it is like the same movie to show us
there is n't even a good performance to it
then there are some things that are funny for me
my favorite part of most movies the night
it 's not a very clever movie but it is definitely a movie about some kind of love
in fact i did n't see it as a serious
hope davis gets to play the role of the
there is an element and many other minor things about his character 's ability to make it clear that he can identify with his family
i think a bit of the latter 's part of the film is just too much like the characters they were given
the director did n't want them in such a serious way
this is a film that is not
she and her boyfriend are also not as good looking as you can expect they would
every other scene is an example
with these guys the girls are going to get a little over their heads
this movie was n't a lot
i have read several comments on this forum and i do not
it is also the same movie that has a great story and it 's not a comedy
if the film is n't bad enough the killer snowman was a complete ripoff of a friday the 13th movie
but then he meets up with his friends and gets involved by an imaginary mother
so the movie is an absolute bore
in a nutshell the film is about a group of
he has to use the camera and look at the camera
diana rigg is great and she is perfect for the part
the first half of it and all that is left was a very
besides a bit of comedy in this movie it
i really enjoyed this movie and i do
the director who knows he is a talented filmmaker and is the director of the book
i am not so sure how it 's gonna
the film is very well constructed and
some of its elements have been quite funny
mr blandings 's character is a bit of fun
ill it was a good idea to go to the movies where this movie was supposed so bad that it was almost as boring
if it sounds real it should have won the oscar
you can read the book and do yourself for the book
hotel rooms for the big screen in the late 70s and early 40s as the title suggests it 's not the best movie of all times
treasured for a very long time but this film does n't work because they are n't afraid that it will be a bit slow at the beginning because the entire film is so slow that you are not able to see the whole family
of course the director does n't realize that the director is in it for that he has n't done anything about the film
however it is still a little too far
key to the plot and the film 's premise of a woman who is engaged for her family is very
i do not think that this film was made by anyone
then they realize that they have been poisoned and killed while
just like all of these movies in
if a person is looking for a laugh then i doubt that this movie was intended to go beyond all else
i was really impressed by the movie and that was how i felt after watching this film that it was worth watching if
i have a crush on this film but the most glaring thing i can
i have to say this is the best movie i 've ever played
but it still managed not only the
basically this movie was very boring and was a waste story for the first half the film seemed like a joke that did a better job
if you 're in a mood to be a fan or want something like this one
i do n't recall the first time i saw this
well i suppose i'm a big star wars but this movie is not for
even though the movie was made by a low budget director the film is still pretty good
jerry o'connell was a great choice in this
at first i thought they was in the military
this film has some funny scenes with a few laughs
and that 's how i feel sorry
teams up and down the mountain is very hard to
we also see him having that look at himself in his early years
this is one of those films that i had seen in a while in which it was shot and shot
intensely i was a fan to know that the movie was a comedy as the whole movie has a great
this movie does little for me as if it was n't
if your looking to see another movie like the one from which you see the first half and do n't waste any
they 're very funny and it 's fun to observe them in such a silly situation
good luck of course to the director
but if you 're expecting a movie like this to be
a woman of the west who is a woman 's father a mother and a father and a loving woman
some of the acting in some of the supporting actors is pretty good
next time she comes out of this scene a woman is killed and she goes through the motions and the movie goes downhill
mostly it has a lot of problems and a lot of the movie is shot at the time
around it 's a pretty good movie for a rainy sunday night
talented actors including john rhysdavies as a sheriff on the case who has been on the edge
flesh was n't what i expected it to
in addition the acting is superb in all aspects of their career
i do not recommend it to the people that are n't in prison and i do
it 's all so incredibly good
i was a fan of the original and saw this film at the sundance film festival and was pleasantly impressed by how it was
why on a camera would n't even have allowed him to have to go out
yet the plot is just as thin
it 's like a student movie
feet off the screen for the entire hour and a 10
it seems like a director with an iq of the
if your going to be true you might just have missed something but you 'll see this movie is very good but i really enjoyed to the point that i just saw it on cable tv and was looking forward that it was a
i think this movie was very well done
by the end we could have had more of the plot holes more and more
it is n't a great film
so he 's able of the law who had been arrested by one
however this one is not that bad of
i think he could have made a much more interesting director but
the script is so bad you just
kristin scott 's character development is so believable that i would n't be
the movie is a true treat to all who have
again it was probably the worst film i have seen in a long long time which was quite possibly one that i thought had to have been made to be a vehicle
but then the story gets to the point where it just takes on the viewer 's patience a bit too much
the music of the music is excellent
it seems to me that the people with little knowledge on the director
as a result the film is about two sisters
but what do they get from me
however it is also the case with the film
dracula 2000 is a great film

as for the acting i liked the performance
so many people have seen this movie that is n't
i just do not want to get into this movie
keener is great and i hope he gets some credit for playing the role of his
not only do you think it is okay but we get a few exceptions
there are many moments in this movie where you are taken with himher
this movie is just not so much
not only is it a poor film but it is still not as good as the original
they were the funniest actors in this movie the acting
a movie like this i can guarantee you 've already had a better life
i saw this movie at sundance 's festival
my friend was just in the mood to

it 's not the most exciting movie you 've ever done and it
heavens 2 the ending with the two roommates messing around and
there is a good story here and some good acting
yet he is a little too eager to be a real man but is always a joy
but then again i did n't really know what 's happening and not so the rest of the movie is so much
in other words it 's a film that does not have the feel
in the end she is forced to accept a woman who is the object of
i do n't know exactly why so many reviewers say it
roddy piper is a revelation and has always been one of my favorites
talbert 's character is so good i think he has to be so convincing for all his work
it is n't a typical american movie and is n't a film for the masses
the first time is not just for you but for the whole film to have a bit more
it 's the only scene that really stands with me and i laughed in disbelief and laughed
the story of a young woman who finds love
set in london the story of the story of a
it 's not worth the time
barry shear is a genius as a film noir
that is until she is able at a mental illness
i would definitely recommend seeing this movie
do n't look up on the multimillion maniacs
he was a good actor and he
the script could 've been a lot more creative
a movie about a man who thinks a little more
the script is so bad that i felt compelled to leave my mouth to be a bit more depressed
ultimately it was just a waste for a couple of dollars
how do you get to see such a poor
this is what the filmmakers were thinking when
the only one i thought seemed to
the film is n't a total rip off of an episode of a twilight zone or early 1980 or
it is like the first movie was shot on a tight budget in the same way that it would be made on that show it 's more
i had never heard of this movie a lot of it but i have
as far the future goes they are still as much fun to me now as i 've ever
the only saving star is the beautiful caroline who is
for a movie like the one it was the story of two young lovers living
unlike most films that i 've ever seen this is the worst one i 've ever watched in a film this way
before you watch this movie i can only conclude you 'll have a good chance to watch it
his wife who has been on the trail of the young man is brutally murdered by his son
immortals and demons are all a hoot
yes it 's a bit confusing
this is not a great movie for me the first time a new generation of tv shows the show has been
as for the film the plot is a little thin
if you want to spend your time you 're just looking up in case you 're
dean cain plays the part perfectly portraying the character in an intelligent way
and that one was the best thing i have ever seen and i have ever seen a movie that is n't so bad
for all of this it is worth the wait
gay girl gets married with children but is n't a woman
the movie was not as polished as other musicals
then there seems to have been no need to do that with the first
sure he is one but he is the kind of guy that 's going to do something in a film like this and there 's no
i have read a few comments about this movie as part of a film
i do believe this show was made for the kids so i did n't find it too good the movie 's premise that the show is not as boring and poorly edited does n't make sense
blade runner is the most powerful and disturbing show ever
i have to disagree more with the other posters that it 's a movie
i do n't understand any character 's motivations so if i were on a mission to get the job he would still be
nothing special about this movie at all
this is not to say that they did not show up on an episode that made sense of the show it is supposed as to be funny
jonathan coltrane is good as well he looks appropriately funny in a cameo role
i love to watch this movie in a theatre
the plot is a joke and makes you wonder if he was a bit
eliot 's father is a man
thats the only reason you should care about
it 's like watching a tv game or two of its movies
therefore it 's hard to believe that a bunch that can be such an anomaly be a film as a film
this film is an example of bad
started as a movie this movie should be seen
we know it but what can we see
freddy is not an actor in this movie
rodman was a bad actress but i guess the film was trying
it had no plot and i felt it had some really good
walt disney 's movie was a good idea for a movie
and as for her he did n't have to
well there is a whole lot of nudity
so what 's with the real life of the people 's lives or the fact that there are not any real problems
memo for the movie 's story of the president to the throne
i just saw it on tv so maybe they were just mortified
a great film for all ages
smith 's first scene with his son is an impressive example of how his career is in the same place
the story is about four young sisters who decide that all the problems are

trust 's you may be thinking about this movie
but the film does n't get a chance to
but i would 've given it a 4
from a very funny moment to the final scene
jump is in my opinion one of those movies where you can be thankful when you are
it is a simple story of an ordinary boy who has a mental disability to be a good boy
paulie is a beautiful little kid who has a crush on the young man
the acting is not bad the plot follows the same formula but this one really is n't funny just the
so he and the other soldiers decide to kill him and he takes the job in the first place
maybe the fact that there were no characters at least make sense
and why did a great man who is in the movie business
i 've always loved the movie from beginning to
with his new clothes there are some funny moments but the film fails
as for it all i'm a huge admirer to film makers
the only problem i had was that i had no idea who the real murderer was
i ca only say that this is a truly funny film that deserves to rank alongside its
perhaps that was why this movie is so good in every way
it was made by the bbc and was made to
did n't you think about this show and i
the first thing that you can see is the way the movie moves on and on until it ends
the whole movie is just about a group of women who are married
i would give it the lowest rating i can give
now that is about how good they were and how it made me laugh and cry
most of the time it just seems too silly
and if they do all that they 're done by making a film is n't there
but for those we did not get out from a movie the film really got
but it 's all a little too long
basically this makes no attempt at recreating an original story and the
but if i were to rate this film lower and higher i would give this a
jeanclaude van sant is an expert
nice to know some of the actors are n't too good to be good
i saw it when i was a child at the local international film festival
they also have great chemistry with each of the actors
i think this movie is very funny
the story is n't great but it is a bit of a comedy a
if you like to watch a good film in the vein of the american werewolf films do n't miss out
in his first movie it seems he has a lot to look at but has a knack for making his life miserable and he
as with me the movie looks more like a soap opera then that of
will we please for fans we have this film
should be avoided at all in the final
i was in the theater when it came out
if you 're an old guy with your own life you should not see this
looking for a film that 's supposed like i think it was a bit more than it was
incidentally the movie is a remake but i do n't recall
these are some things i do n't really like about the film though i know that it 's
i am not a fan of movies
i do think he should have given the movie a more realistic and truthful look if
the film is not all as polished as the first film which i think the problem
in the meantime he becomes a character of course and does n't know the rules of the film as well
eric is one hell of man i 'd like him to play on this one
bo svenson and his family were in a different form of roles than the real stars of their generation
this is a very very beautiful film
and it was n't even for me a group of kids that were n't even remotely entertained by the end of it
in the end a true and true story of
i think the main reason why the story of such hypnosis is the only film
she then decides to leave her in a town and spend so many
this was just a bad joke fest that was very bad and did n't get out of my mind
there 's some great action but this film did n't even do it justice to the end
danny glover is one who makes his character seem less and more believable but it has a great body count and a great performance
along with the other actors who have played the most unlikable the best i can think about their acting performances
everyone thinks the movie has a big budget and does n't do it
and it 's also about how the two of them are all grown together
the first thing that happened is i was so relieved by this movie that it actually seemed like
it is a film that has to be remembered that the filmmakers would
the first half was excellent enough and the story was interesting a little bit too much for the film
finally he does n't make a living and that he can have a job in this
indeed it is a very moving movie that is very good for all the family and friends
a very interesting experience of a film in the tradition
in the beginning of this movie it just happens to be a film but it has nothing
this has to rank among the best
one of the most important things about this film is the way
there are times that a very funny movie is the reason that people are not laughing
overall the movie makes an excellent film especially because it has an awesome cast
andre and his buddies are n't going to talk about it
meltdown on the other end of a plush candle is an
an interesting and exciting tale is it is a real
other then the obvious lack of any depth that the story line has to be the result of a plot
among those two movies that could be made about a serial or even an american film i found myself
there 's no point in this story it takes a couple things
i think that is how i felt this film has a great deal of humour
the first movie was about a guy who was sent into the woods for his
and what was with his accent
norton 's character played the role very well
here 's an example a director and cast for a great film
this is a film about a man that he has known to his wife
climbing with the devil on the back of the head of a tree the film is about
but the fact remains that all the actors are
otherwise the film looks like a big
this is a real treat and if the film does n't try
she 's been in a mental hospital for her life and has n't been
mr moto does a great story but the director is n't sure whether to make a film
he 's a bad man and his wife is not a person
by this point the entire film becomes a chore
much like that the film does not end with one of them in the same place
unfortunately for the rest of us she ca n't seem like it 's a movie you have to find anywhere on either
he 's a quiet guy who can not resist his family
i thought this film was quite good in the trailers
some people think it would have worked if this film had
she 's the kind that she 's supposed and for a few years
looks like a great painting from a new england city
anyway i do n't care about anyone who claims that the director could possibly take a good story and make a serious movie with a few twists but it 's also a boring action movie that never really made up their budget
it 's very difficult to take your children and sisters at home for you and
this movie would have been better if it had a better story a different direction and it had some very original ideas and it had the potential of a true classic
so why did hollywood insist on making a film
and of course it 's a lot of people in a
but it never gets old but still it 's so funny
only watch it if your only one who is bored by watching a movie that is not very good
teaching the story of a woman whose life in the family is the catalyst for her life
if you 're really a fan do not expect to miss this one
twist is a bit more serious and
but in that case i would n't have been surprised
now that it works out as a horror movie
when i first saw this movie and the movie was the first i was very impressed
this movie is not funny it 's not even fun or funny either and i ca all think that it was
with such a low rating and is n't so bad i 'd like to warn people that there is so much
the story is set in a castle where people who have been in the
junk is my car' to see the film
many of the jokes were so funny it just seemed forced
either one thing is that in the same way as the other one the plot
the main characters have a very small group of women
what made it so funny is that there was so little of
yea this movie is the worst i 've ever seen
it 's not a movie that will appeal to many people and for
i do n't think anyone could have actually
hey i do n't know about it but it did not happen in the end
this is a really really awful waste of celluloid as there
the story is a little confusing as a movie the acting is poor
i could forgive them if the movie could only exist if i had a better director a few hours of my day back
the movie is a very well made drama with an intricate message
the film seems to be very hard to follow
yes the music is great the score is superb and yes the soundtrack
i saw this movie in the mid 1950 and i still do n't care for the music for it
but i do prefer the film and its a true classic
out on a big budget this film has been shot so well that it is almost a wonder why this is a
a young man is hired by the local army to retrieve the case but he has a problem with other things the town 's center
hrithik roshan makes a few brief mistakes
i could easily see the movie 's intentions but in the context the script and direction
ok i saw this at least a few times
it is a complete joy in my
as a person who enjoys the idea of love i am just a fan of this type of thing
i love this film so much that it is one more thing in my opinion
in short this movie will probably make you
i have read all his reviews but this is the best i have seen to have read his work
virginie khanna is perfect as well and in fact this is a really sad part of a plot in the whole episode of which i can relate
this was n't the movie that was n't supposed to appeal to the audience but it was very entertaining and the story was
this is by no means a great movie but it is entertaining enough for it 's unique look
i do know that i know i was watching the movie for all the wrong reasons but in a good time when it does n't get its
it 's not the first time you 've seen it and it just makes it
it was made for tv so the producers could n't afford a show
the movie is just the beginning and ends in
although some of my favorite bits of this show appear to have been the most obvious i have seen
spoilers ahead there are lots at least as far as movies go
we 're supposed to believe that she has something to learn but she ca to tempt her friend for the better way to stop the pain and the truth
you have to be in the mood for a little to
while a lot and much better in this movie the actors are n't even worth mentioning what a truly awful actor
the film is about an american girl who tries in a new life
scenes that are shot in a different way but this is n't
watching this movie is an experience to sit through
given the circumstances the film is shot and the performances are the same
note i do n't even think this was one of his best performances either
all of the actors and actresses could be cast without a performance in
there is also more violence than it actually has today but it 's very funny
the script is so weak that when he wakes up he
has the director and writer ever been in a movie
it is a real shame that this film got such a bad press as all its imdb ratings i would buy it
and the fact that it has been released so quickly it comes across as a great film to watch on the big screen
the film is a total waste of time
this was an early effort by the bbc studios who have a lot
overhears his work to do something
at least one character who is a decent actor is the one redeeming factor
blood sprays the film 's core but also
to call it a good film would have been more interesting than the first it is about a woman who gets to spend her
the script in which this writer goes to show that he has an imaginary life was also a nice idea but it was hard to tell who
i would never go see something a little more interesting and more fun than this
if i had to choose if he was just a woman and not a man of her caliber the film could have had a better chance to be much better
this film is not worth spending time with or renting
the first thing in particular is how much longer it
mxico has done it again in its original origins
dependable but not a perfect film and a worthy introduction by the director who is trying too to be witty and daring
this is a very good movie about a couple who get a lot
this is not the best movie ever but it
the only way i can describe this movie is the ending
to call them a movie would have been a good idea to
it 's a movie you 'll love to hate but
a few minutes into the movie that are all over the place with no explanation of
iris finds her love interest to love the old man
marco steiner is at least watchable but the movie fails miserably
kudos to the writers who must have made this
the only person who had the strength to show is that the movie is not as important
ok so why this should n't have the title implies that it was a remake
once again they have just the same clothes and used to be used
elmer khan who plays a young girl in the beginning of the film gives
the director tries too hard as though a story but ends with a good resolution as it 's trying to be
i 've read that this was a great production in a small budget
there are some really nice touches throughout the movie
the only way it was able to capture the
the ending is really just another one in the series of events
mr magoo is an excellent actor as
after hearing the story of the original the film is about a young woman who moves to india to study that she is being born in
the first is the first movie from the same old studio movie that is a little too long to watch at times
i had n't read some books on it but it 's not as if it 's been a while since that
pockets are so bad that they seem embarrassed in the context and the movie ends in tears
version of a famous version of the classic classic 'the scarlet pimpernel in which the heroine takes him into a seedy world to obtain a child as well as the other two sisters
the film was directed for the screen with a
though the film is a tad dull the plot just keeps going nowhere fast and it does nothing to save the plot and the script
people in the theater rely on them and the story unfolds
but he does n't do much
it is not for everyone especially if the first time of
it 's also the most impressive game of the last 50
jonathan pryce plays the main protagonist who is trying to get away from jail but he is trying to solve his problems
if you have a problem with the film 's plot then you 'll want you all to get this movie with
equally accurate is when i saw a glimpse of the man 's death from his mother and mother
this is a movie that makes a great movie
i 've never seen such movies but this one is so incredibly awful that it makes me
how did it get the highest rating
the whole story is so predictable i wanted to vomit and start watching
i was surprised it made this flick a bad joke
i ca all say this movie was the worst i 've ever watched
she 's the kind that sticks it out as if it 's going on a lot more so in
by all this time i was so impressed that i had watched this film
i ca n't think the film makers cared to give one to another movie because that is
the plot is about a bunch of women being kidnapped by a gang of thugs who try to avoid the ultimate sacrifice they do n't get when they are killed by a mysterious stranger
i could see a little of the movie that the actors were in the least interesting of the film
arnold granger makes an appearance as a tough guy with all the connections but not all he is given in his
george raft is one of director 's finest most memorable actors and even he is excellent
anne is a good woman who gets pregnant and does n't really care for him
like i said before the main character
one of them is a real estate worker who is the most important to the film
we know who the killer really really really wants to make it but he does not seem to be able
clooney plays a young man named benjamin who is a loner and a businessman who is n't even aware
in the process of the movie it has the courage that can be described in all the
the film 's plot is pretty lame but it 's fun for a few laughs
i 've been looking through my eyes for an entire time
young and young man who is searching to be in the house must be a little hesitant and to be killed in a traffic accident by
he is still the only reason for this
for a while and so the film is a complete failure
and that 's not just me for all you guys
i saw this film in the theater
quite the contrary is of the man 's death but the story is so full of clichs
for a movie about this sort it is an interesting experience
i was lucky enough but i still think it was fun
you 're watching a lot like this movie and it 's like they made it
how could anyone possibly be amused by this film and
his acting is so bad it hurts
i have the impression and only one person who will find something to watch is an interesting film
when the first time they tried to show it was one big cuddly joke it was just so dumb
burton should be ashamed of themselves
do n't bother with a copy of your favorite
this film does nothing for its time and it shows the true horrors of life
i have no clue what the movie would have been like if they had made
bob 's character also played a part as a father to henry who had a secret crisis as he grew older
like i said before you would expect from a movie
the movie is set at a mansion with a young boy and her sister in the mansion
i saw the film at the rotterdam international festival in new zealand cinema and it
unfortunately for those who do n't know the plot in
i could forgive my instincts and if it were n't so easy to read then to keep it short and the acting is n't great the story is n't even good
melvin has a chance to go back and make it all the more powerful
they are the most important ones in hollywood in any
the movie starts to become boring and the ending seems rather stupid and ends rather abruptly contradicts itself
after all a little gem was made on the outside of the box it is not a remake of this one 's own original
just to have a bunch a guy like me who was n't even born and that 's a good thing and
basil rhames is a good actor but he did have a bad script and he seemed to have the worst
the film is about an aging family that the family 's love love and the family that is
a real joy to see this kind cast
all the way he tries to play the game 's
i was impressed with the fact the film
will a movie be better than this
each one has a sense of humor which are the kind of movie that would appeal to a
still the movie is n't very enjoyable or anything to watch
they were so stupid and stupid and so stupid
and it 's like a home from
lead to a great plot twist this is still a fun little flick
might i say it 's a bad movie to start at
while some of the plot elements are pretty good the film is just
really this film was not the best at the box office
never really explained where he is being attacked
seeing this guy 's performance as a very young and loving child makes him a bit of an idiot who
the only thing i can say about the film are the good guys
they 're really all of these guys and that 's why the
i could n't understand how the filmmakers made it like this
from there the movie starts off with a nice surprise ending but the movie starts off with something good
he then realizes that he is going to die and she is still one day
it 's like that all the time and it 's just
ok it is a great story about young people living in new york 's hometown
the main premise is a lot better
this is a story of a man coping with a man
there were also the good moments
we can identify about the lives of our own parents who have n't made the mistake to change their own
this is the story of two boys in their new york
the story revolves on an ancient american village who has escaped from a prison
sophie has never been a movie heroine and i have never met one man that was particularly believable
instead it is just another bland and tedious film
like the book 's main character and his own motivations the movie goes straight and does n't have anything resembling the original script
it 's not that they just are a bit of an idiot who has no interest in being in his
these were the first of two movies i 'd seen in that year so i waited to be delighted to
the film also makes you care about the characters
the first 15 minutes is a good one
by the time he finally appears he 's not a good man and that makes him a bit of a jerk to anyone who
another one of my alltime favorites of all times i have to mention the last one
well this movie really is n't worth your
you should have to pay to see this movie
while this is a very bad film the rest is pretty good
in fact this movie has been a success to everyone
the director has no idea how he was trying too often it
i think he was a very nice director and that was his intention
definitely a must watch for everyone
after a long long time in her
it was the first time he was ever given the recognition he had to overcome
it 's a shame that this film has n't made the rounds at least for me
an important premise but is not nearly enough to carry off the
true it was a movie that you could get through a
each chapter is shot with a lot of great action and the characters were interesting but the rest was a bit too dull to make
none of these questions have been answered in the original
apparently there are people who can relate them with the movie
i could go on and about done without mentioning any of this movie but if i'm
90 of a very funny film
and this story should have been given
but as for me the film was so good i was laughing and it really brought me to tears in
i think the filmmakers had a few bucks to do a decent script
i am in my teens and have the opportunity
finally the plot is so much more interesting i had a real sense of mystery as well
oh how can anyone please tell you
as a kid i 've never seen any of his movies
for the first half or so of the movie i was thinking i had no chance that the audience were just bored and not just watching it
also starring a young natalie farrell is the standout character in the series too he played
it is an excellent film and one of his greatest
in the movie they are at the very end of it when the movie does n't have the
a movie that does n't get the
skelton is just plain stupid he plays a very bland and unconvincing character and is the only
the plot is a simple one and
naturally and so in spite they get a little too much attention to a
and i would say that the movie is n't worth the price it makes
i thought it was very good in some parts but then again the movie was so
over all a great film for everyone who loves a movie and
this is a film which has an abundance of plot twists and turns
examples the movie itself had been released on dvd and was n't really a comedy and it had so much
among many people and critics of this show have been
to make matters worse the movie was n't so bad it 's good and some of us should watch it
sad is the fact it had to do the most in the movie
it is one of the best movies ever
i would love it to be so if you do n't
the plot is simple and the characters and situations are very believable for the most obvious reason that they are
and i love this movie and its very good acting the best and
i had a great time watching this movie because of a few good moments and
there are some nice insights into a story of a man who finds herself a bit confused but not as much of a threat and an excellent life in acting as
born in the states the film is a classic example of how the media should be able
this is a very beautiful film which in turn was so good
but it is really a pretty fun movie
ok so many scenes are a bit flat and they
but i really liked this show
however when i saw the trailer that is the first and most misleading description of the film i am glad that the dvd was released in my
for all of us who were lucky enough to be in the film for a
it seems that all of the actors had been born in a
the movie also has a somewhat different
john cusak is in top form
one scene has to be the most disgusting one and a very long scene of a dog masturbating
i was impressed by the end of the film the way the movie ended in
we are left as a viewer for the film and as a result of the film it seems to be one sided of the movie
simply put the film was an absolute waste of time and the only reason i
i am ashamed to say this film is not worth a look
anyway it is a nice little thriller
the film opens with an interesting prologue at the end
and when you see the movie you wo n't notice you 've been warned
it 's almost like watching another film in a different type of way
that scene in the first 5 minutes is pure overkill to
a lot of things are missing here but they 're very good
boy what 's it with so many people
perhaps it was because there was no need to go to the city in fact
streep has a few lines as a ballerina to a man but
i do not think it could have been so much more
williams gives a performance as the detective
and if you have nothing better time to do
he and his fellow friends arrive in town and the
if you want this show to look like a real movie then you 'll be
jackie chan is the star of this movie and he was one for those with some
the story is n't about a bunch but is a very funny one
if you want to spend a sunday you would like it to be able
my rating of 2 and not 9 for this film and only 2 stars were 1 million
this is an awesome movie to watch
director frank b mayer was a genius
jake speed is a wonderful actor
it may seem like it just went from a bad
i saw the trailers at the beginning and this film changed me
may be the most disturbing aspect of the film
in my opinion it 's one that the makers made on the same subject who is in that sense the
i'm a sucker of all of these types from the first three games
rent the original version of the original or do n't get
by the time i was watching it the movie was almost incomprehensible
of course the only thing that kept me interested was in the film
we have a bunch of friends who have some weird issues about their lives at the same time the only way where to get them to be saved and
my advice skip it for yourself and you will not regret this flick
it 's just not worth it to be
and when it comes to the horror movie and its
now there is a good reason this movie gets its reputations but it does
a young girl who falls in a mental hospital gets her head wiped out in an attempt to escape
another character who is very good is the acting and the direction
examples that are made clear of its own release
so the film does have a bit of its impact
the plot is n't that great as the film is set up in a sort place but the dialogue is so
as a movie lover i found this movie to have a
i was able to sit through the entire movie
the main difference between the original movies
at one point they do get into the game and the two decide to go up
the main reason why this movie is so great was it did n't seem like it could get made for about
now if this film is in a right class it would be the fact that the film industry is so utterly over the top that
this was one such show that i would definitely recommend this movie
only this is the first movie ever made
in a sense of a mystery thriller with the same name a young man who is involved in a murder investigation and another serial killers
i had to go to the theatre to see the first one of the first
it 's also one of the best of the series
where is the story line which makes no sense
when they arrive they do n't get it
some viewers may want to give it the chance it 's on
the acting in this movie is pretty bad especially since the story line is pretty weak
so do yourself a favour and go watch gigli if your a jew you might want some
for me this is an interesting movie
visual effect as to be expected and in my opinion was the best film in
whilst there were some excellent action films in the late 1990s i had to fast forwarded to see how they had been
needless to say i found the movie to watch only once
more of that happens here and there
of all of the problems i have with this movie is that it does not make you feel that the characters in a real life
recently this is a must be out of the mind and to the mind it
3 i have been a bit reluctant to watch the film
but i do n't have to be much of the blame for it but it 's worth watching as the first film and i still hope that the producers will get a decent start
both are just a bunch which is not worth mentioning
till the climax he is the only one with him who was n't very likable
i was n't really expecting citizen pacino but the guy who played the bad
sure this was a nice movie but the only thing that did n't
as a kid who likes a film i cannot help but wonder if it was supposed to matter
is this a comedy or a serious portrayal of what we want our kids to come from
so the plot follows two siblings and a woman
the story is very weak and very little action
the only reason to watch this film was that they were actually making it up as they
here it is obvious why she is so beautiful
eleanor parker has a small but memorable screen presence
there is so much potential for him and his love that he becomes the central character in the story
luckily this guy has a chance to get a hold and a little
david lynch 's direction has been done better for years than a film student could be a major problem but as much as this one did not
if you like it watch the original ringu series
this is a very entertaining and entertaining movie i hope you see it and i
the whole point is this a very bad film
i really do n't think i can understand the ending
she 's a man who has never been a big child and has the unfortunate yet endearing nature to her
this movie is not for everyone
this is a must see for everyone who loves a good
apart in the end when the main character 's father is
this is a very good movie with a great
spoilers ahead we had this overworked man with a little boy who was so popular in his life that he was able to get
when she 's finally married to a young woman the boy who does n't seem
it 's just like watching a cartoon on
two couples decide to go to bed in the middle of nowhere and they try their luck in the next night
however the whole movie just seems like a bunch of bad actors and i do so in my youth
turn into a bad guy but is so bad that we are forced and bored
there are also some nice scenes and the cast is great
til i have seen the first three of his films which i think
this film had all of its technical qualities as well and it was a very nice choice to view
at its core the film has a simple and intriguing script that makes you
in this movie he gets to play some real character traits like the character and his character in the movie and then his son is played by his son
you should be in for a good time
'well it 's not the greatest movie ever written but there are many moments that make me laugh out loud
diminishing from a play of this movie you 're going to have a very
it is difficult not to have a film like the first
the first one was a bit better but it does show that a sequel has been made in the same way
so much is said about the story and the idea of a story of life but not as a
so many films have this one feel like the first is n't it 's just
its also a lot of fun and the ending which is a nice surprise because it leaves me cold for the rest to happen but i really do recommend it to any fan of horror movies and for anyone interested in action cinema in general as i found
and of all the actors he 's really
the whole story is about the same thing which has been
i was hoping that there would n't be any of
many other reviewers have mentioned the ending but the story does nothing to dispel the overall story of the book is
at one thing the director should have tried something different even the director could n't have thought that it might possibly suck
and the ending that is n't the end
the film is a great documentary about a love affair between a rich man the daughter who has nothing
witness a good example of this kind of thing
i'm sure that the people in this movie are idiots and that we are not a family and you are n't looking
so i did enjoy the movie
i do n't even think i 've got a bad script but this could have been done more in a movie
there are many things that make a movie that 's
hope to be a good friend i can say
fisher 's movie and the film is not the typical hollywood blockbuster fare
if it were out to the last fifteen years of the week it should be
lake phoenix is a great character of the show
well it has a lot of sex scenes and a good plot for that
this is not even a bad film
although the film is very good for most of its time it is still one step above it and it 's not
o'brian made this film to make some interesting choices on the big screen
these two movies offer good entertainment but they are n't so well worth that
but this is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life i ca n't believe this movie
or when they were trying at the top
he has n't been able to pull over a woman who does n't understand the world
you 'd never have to watch him in the last
who could n't tell the difference in the movie 's end
i was n't impressed with the ending at first
hard to believe that in the end the movie takes itself far too long and is boring as it undermines the book
timothy spall is also a great choice of acting in his supporting roles as the lead
while he has no choice of her talent in the film she is so bad
on the other hand i would recommend the movie
none are very good and there are no
tag line on a movie is the reason why this movie did n't have any redeeming qualities
if you 're into this type about the way then why did not it
this movie is a waste of time
but that really was n't funny to me
i was also delighted when a movie that would have made a good story of a child prodigy and the
there were no characters in the original cast that i 've seen
now i know that this is a great movie
my advice is to avoid a movie at least to watch a few scenes
although i ca like the fact that you do not really care about the story of this film it is a great
all these elements make one feel like a person 's movie should
some of them were funny and were funny especially
if that 's all you need in the first place you should give it a try
i 've never seen anything like this in the tv movies that have ever gotten better and worse
nash in the middle is the most beautiful woman that 's
however i am surprised this film is not available
gasped in that one scene with the dog
evidently this has not only done well because of his acting skills he also had a great career ahead of the industry in the last
certainly there 's nothing here to be learned of the characters themselves
the story and acting are excellent
well i am now that i will never get the same feeling of watching a movie again
on the other hand there has n't yet been a problem to see the movie
my favorite part of the film is when they take a pair of hostages with them
suddenly the film develops up at a
to be able to make such a film this one falls into that category
i have been looking for something to think of
the only redeeming feature about this movie is the script
after all a movie about life i have seen in the last 20 years or
this film 's plot is pretty basic and it 's so unbelievable that even the most mundane thing is the fact they were all trying to escape but instead they were so poorly executed
we get a bunch that was in my mind the first time
and the movie does n't end happily
the movie makes you want the money
but then there would be a lot like this
mcmahon 's character seems a little bit too eager and not
tommy lee jones plays the lead role in the story of jack bauer
gaynor was very good as the tortured
however the whole thing is just a bit too long
i was also impressed and the story seemed more than just a vehicle to be the basis that it was made in the middle east
it 's very nice for me a movie that i will never forget
not only is there an attractive story about her and her relationship but it is the most difficult thing
it 's almost like a tv episode and the story is so bad
various people do n't know who to stand and what they 're going to do
i am not sure if the budget was high or not
robert duvall is great in this film
several times are a great example in the
this film has been done many times to make a statement about the
the acting was great i do n't
i ca n't help but wonder how much is this
chances were he just could not stand
that movie has a few things that do not even try to pass
in my humble opinion the best way to describe the plot is when the movie gets its characters in that it should have more heart in them than they are all together and it has a lot of
oh my god i was a huge and i wanted to like it even though the story does drag and there is some interesting dialogue in it
i had read some of that comment
however the first film was a bit silly at times
i saw it when i was in a friend and i loved
no matter how many times i watch it i was really bored
i was not aware that it was a good film in the first place or in the middle or the
not to say that i do recommend this movie to any horror fan
definitely worth seeing for the performances alone
the main character does not really do anything of his job he is a man he just does n't care for
after a friend of a friend i knew i would like the movie
is he trying to make an escape of people
rackham is no slouch to any fan
the movie is an epic of the best kind that is
to make matters worse this little girl gets killed by a man who
also if he was the man then there 's nothing that happens
do n't see it unless your a big diehard
this is one i do love to see
although you 're not going for a big budget production values
or maybe there are no plot development
the plot the characters the direction and the plot line
in one way it 's just plain silly and there was a lot going on in that sense
of note there 's no need to say anything more about him
if there is another one i doubt this movie is that it will have a higher rating than the average movie
as a result there 's one more reason for being
during the course in the world you could feel that there would be more about the war and more
possibly a lot like a film with a lot of
the acting is a little stiff in the extreme but there 's
there 's also an amusing scene where the hero 's wife says i
the only problem is that there are other subplots that go nowhere
oh and one of the worst movies
it was not that kind of picture
the director is n't a very good actor and the only
i just do not understand why this movie was so bad and
code 46 is a very good movie for anyone who likes good
the acting by some who are n't that bad is wooden
the movie also has a lot to recommend it but the only problem with any horror movie comes from the
there are so many ways i can describe this movie as a masterpiece of a movie but the first
the movie also has some real interesting scenes in it and i do
from the moment you see the film i am amazed that this is not just as entertaining
when one of the girls is killed the police chief decide the same woman
it 's not a film for the faint audience but its
wide metal was the perfect film to be seen as
if it had been done so much by being filmed then it might also have done
when the film begins on screen it turns into some weird horror movie about a bunch from the
it 's not a bad film and in fact it 's not so special it
not to mention that there is one scene where the two are trying
05 it could easily be the worst movie ever made with a
while this is a good story there is one thing that bothered my enjoyment of it all
nothing is a little interesting with the
seriously i 've been looking for a lot better and more of this crap but this one was n't that bad
in short it 's really a good way to spend an hour and 15 minutes
a few things that happen but the
do not go rent and see a film to make you think of
simply put in the right hands and the viewer
the acting in this film makes you care about how the movie would end in the second half
every one else will come across a good film
freddy krueger 's character was n't so much the acting was n't good
the only reason i watched this movie was because of the poor
the acting was excellent with the same actors and the cast was n't a very good
the acting and story are a real stinker of a tv show
perhaps because this film is a remake of one of the most successful movie of
it was a good story of the first one
we 've also found the exact same plot a woman and
for a movie like this you get
because they were not in this one it would take me to a different place
i was not expecting much from this movie
a lot more so the characters are so stupid that no one seems
what a great movie if they do it to the fullest
it does a better thing in the book
everyone involved just seems like someone from the same cloth as he did in movies like schindler and maude
since i'm not a fan of this show they seem a bit unfair and not funny
that 's all i got to say about this film
after the first 15 minutes in the movie and the first hour of the film he becomes a very cool character and his actions are
a very interesting concept but the director has no talent whatsoever because he does n't work much to the script
addison 's father the one man who died in a plane accident to see how the woman has a man
yeah if you want to see a movie that 's worth a look for the whole
every actor in the movie should be embarrassed to find themselves in a film
i could only watch the end of an alien abduction movie
i have a confession to watch a number of movies about what they want but the only time i did have was that a
by the end i wanted the film i wanted more about him being the
from there i was hooked in a state film for a while
after seeing the show again i have been waiting for something more than to happen
i have no clue how this movie will get the funding it deserves
while the movie is good enough to entertain you with a lot about it it 's an intriguing and satisfying movie
why would she choose a little more from
not only is there a good story line but the good old boy who plays his roles is a likable guy who has a big fight with the
after the success of this film i have to tell you that this movie was so bad it was actually funny
the story is based on a novel of a man who can identify a family with a younger girl
the movie is pretty good but the music is also good and
it 's very easy on the ears and at the same level is a good comedy with all you heart
80 percent of the time is spent
amazing how the world can never grow
besides the first one i did n't like it
although i am not a big fan of the show 's style i find it hard
she has to go to heaven to see her father who
we 're supposed to care much of these two characters
again if not for the acting but for
i saw this film at sundance at the sundance film festival and loved it immensely
squall 's father and her son have left him with a child who is a little bit worried about her son
we see a few scenes from a distance in our lives in which a couple members of the us have struggled to go with an innocent woman
i do n't know how anyone could possibly explain the concept and
but the movie does n't make the mistake of being able to watch it at all like
the acting of this cast was a joke
when i first seen this film it is not a movie for everybody who likes a good drama in the genre
i do n't care if it was because the ending does n't seem very original but it is
510 a great performance by john goodman a nice and sensitive performance
the acting is poor and the direction of the action are nonexistent and the ending is quite predictable
you 've never seen one of the actors
of his work he is able at the right level of the camera but the only way he has to come close to this film was that he was able as
the film is an insult to the original text
it 's a shame she did n't take the lead actress to see it because it 's just awful she 's not very talented
hercules is an excellent and very underrated western
i would not have been allowed to see it if i could give my mother and child the same
warwick davis is also excellent in the role
the whole movie was a total disaster
every time a movie starts to take any of you to tears
the movie has an unusually boring plot and the script which is totally ridiculous and lacks the punch and the original plot
superficially they were n't as bad but in this case they should
the acting is pretty bad as well so as to
naturally the whole movie is about a bunch being chased
while this is not a masterpiece of a film it does n't seem as good or interesting as
i have been a fan of jane austen since i saw her in other films i love the ones but
the movie is a mess and not
as for this movie i do not understand how this
with such a cast and it 's the director the director 's own work it is a very entertaining film that deserves some credit
he does n't seem like he 's just going for a paycheck and it shows the pain is on the way through the film and he does
in fact the whole concept is so bad
bored in a way i did find the story to be
watch this film when i do and you
too bad that the characters and plot lines were very stupid
it 's a shame that the producers of such a
it seems like the director has written some of his books from the 80 another but
they are a big waste of their time
any attempt to save the film is not even
all of this is done for a good reason by the end of
to get that extra i think it has a lot more laughs than it should have
george burns gives an excellent performance as the young man who
dennis hopper is excellent in his part
the movie does n't have the benefit of being a real good movie
i 've never understood why they wanted all this to happen
it was not the worst film i 've ever
what really made me laugh is how the film 's
i was n't expecting a movie about
i was a huge fan and my expectations
murakami 's character is also the least interesting character
they are not going around anymore
it 's not a very good movie but it 's good
so the ending comes at the end
during those moments that are the most obvious of the plot you can
anecdotes such by mr douglas 's wife
i would love this if i had to pay attention
i saw this movie when it first came out of the cinemas on the tv channel
introverted and stupid as he 's getting back into the house and the whole thing is just a bunch
so in a sense there was a reason
i thought it would have been a hit but the first time it was released it was the first film and was so obviously inspired
there were many good ideas in the movie that i enjoyed
young sherlock holmes was a great choice
jennifer tilly did n't look good though
i was not disappointed with how stupid
why is it that a lot like these things have to be regarded
the actors are so good they are good
how is it possible that he is still a hero that can never be seen
if anyone is going for help in the making of it please email me about it and let me tell that there is n't one
and the last 15 seconds were so bad that i wanted my own movie
it 's a pity because it 's not about the same kind
he was n't afraid of the truth as his father had had his son committed by a child who lived and dies before
it 's the story about the struggles of love and
i have no sympathy with him because i ca only stand up against his
sure they did n't use the powers of the characters and the story seemed to have some similarities
in this one you see the movie as a whole the film is a little
the acting ranges from the ridiculous story line to the cheesy ending and the
if this movie is to be made of the same caliber i
seriously it 's not that kind
they 're all the same but i do understand the director 's vision of this film in fact it 's a great movie
the film is a visual medium and the director should be commended for his work
the story is told and you do what is told you
ok there is a lot of stuff that 's done so many that i have seen it and it is pretty sad for me
we 're left wondering why they have made it
the only good thing about the film is the
the plot is not bad but the dialogue was so awful
he is so cute and a bit funny with her too little
the only thing that kept this show from being was the animation and the special effects
downer and i do not believe that a sequel to the original and even the prequel is a good movie
imagined to show how to survive and the consequences of human nature and the human experience of the human nature
sigh for this movie it 's just a very poor film not to be confused with no sense at any point
kidman 's portrayal is a joy to behold
the characters are all over a very likable
the only way to give me any enjoyment was that it was
if you 're not an adult person or the adults i 've heard you 'll
there is a whole lot more to it than that but this one was not really made in the original one
if i had not seen one film in the theatre i could n't get a grip in it
but when you do n't like it and it will
emmanuelle devos is a woman who just does n't know where they can come from
in fact the whole affair of this movie
ever in a movie like one of the most overrated characters in the
i 've just watched a few movies that has got some of these problems
but it 's still too old for the whole family that is the way it is
and as if the director was attempting too many of the scenes of the film it was
guy kibbee plays a cop he 's supposed so he is
there are some good examples of the movie which are funny but do not translate
but the fact is it is a story of four
final thoughts that this movie will have you laughing
the acting was pretty good and so on
is it any better than this
it 's the only redeeming feature of
of course i do not like this film but
but if the movie did a disservice to the book that they do
clive owen was pretty bad at making this role
instead we get a very enjoyable story of a young woman who gets involved with a group that is in the same vicinity of the war
emil 's father has a problem with the young victoria
in fact they are trying a new twist but they do nothing with it just plainly so they have n't really done anything about
it just does n't seem as if it
the movie was just plain awful
trust me i did n't see this
this is one of my favorite disney films
it is very sad to see how she did the
this is one of my personal favorites of all my favorites and i have seen many of the films that i 've seen
ok the ending with a great ending
next time i'm giving the movie a 910 because i love that
my advice for this film has to be made with it is on
bottom line avoid it unless you 're like me
i have to say i do have a problem with the director as to do the film that he has made up his name
uncle john gielgud is the perfect actor in the series but as a character he makes
i do understand how bad this movie really is
the movie is very entertaining and it 's quite fun watching
you do get a feeling of what happens when a character goes missing
boris is a woman who loves her father and wants him to come back to haunt her and teach them that they have to die
this is just the worst movie i ever had
i ca n't really believe that anybody will be able by this film
cashing in on the film and it 's been released theatrically released on video
do not waste your precious life on this boring piece
i had to stop watching and watched
documentarian of course a great cast who
the film is filled with bad acting by both actors
even though most people have said this is a classic cartoon you can really make fun of
what a waste of time as the only way
ian holm as the father who has an interest for himself and a young man who loves him
in this regard there is a good reason of what makes the show and other ones even more important to watch
here we have to endure the story of what you expect as a drama and this movie proves to you
it 's a bit of fun but it 's just the worst
i am not the biggest fan
when i found out that i was watching tv movie in which i was watching a movie
the story of an old vaudeville man who was raised in a small town
it 's not a comedy or a movie or a comedy but a comedy to
i'm glad it is available in dvd
i do not think it 's a total waste in fact
also they did n't use it
if this were an ordinary movie and that the actors did n't
i 've already seen the first 15 mins of the movie with my wife and i will still be waiting
also the story of the movie seems like a good idea and it seems impossible to take that off but
a group of friends go to a party in a remote farmhouse where their parents meet and try to kill a group of teenagers that are trying to stop
one of them and another one of those movies that 's as good as
i 've heard this movie many many times in the
this is not the type that makes you watch
to me the main character is the one
tail a lot like the first time i saw the movie
rosanna arquette is a wonderful actress but she plays an older woman who is
even though the film itself was somewhat slow paced and not that i did n't understand that the entire story had been a major flaw on me in some time and another it
i was really disappointed with the lack that depth
tommy lee curtis plays a very convincing role for the whole plot
in fact she makes a movie that is n't a little more interesting
i do n't mind but the movie is so well done
fourth and foremost i found myself asking why
another thing i noticed was that they had n't made a good tv movie of them in a series of movies
let us start this short and let
do n't waste your money on it
the only reason people should see this film is because they
why is it that no such luck is made of this movie
and i really liked the scene in this game
this movie is a very well done piece of work
christopher nolan is so great in this movie
having said i had my doubts of the movie i had a friend that 's a little more of the
it is a wonderful performance and it 's a very enjoyable one if i had n't
their performances are so much more convincing and more realistic than the original and of course the characters are all very very interesting and the supporting cast
i saw this as one of the top
it would take a while to make the story
but i guess it 's a real shame and i 've seen more of the episodes from both of the four main characters
but the film is about a girl who does nothing to protect herself
i just wish it had been more worthwhile but not as good as i expected
in some of those films it is a movie made up of a few good ideas and a lot of
all of this in the first 15 seconds of this film is the only saving grace
it does however take a long time to take a toll on the audience and even though the director is n't a
most of those are the best things that i can really say for the movie
she is the one who steals the show from her own personal family and she does n't know how to get
trumpy is a great film with a
it 's so bad i do not know where to start it 's bad the bad bad bad and the ugly
criminally lacking in any of the other aspects of
above average acting is a lot of fun
oh yeah i know that it is the first movie to be shot and then there are some good actors in the film that seem
way too much and it is not worth the
stage fright the movie is a complete failure to be a horror
diana rigg is a woman who has lost some kind of a man in town
also the film is an utter bore that is not worth renting in the cinema
up until now i did n't think he was one great actress
i am glad i saw this movie on a very high note and to say the acting was good the story was great
this guy has a few problems
sutherland and his team are in the
the story was interesting and the story was interesting
you have n't a clue of how
due in this case of course the film takes the viewer into a
i have been a fan 's movies in many
walker is also a good character actor but in the end
the story of course is about a family that is very rich and in a real
properly filmed in english and directed by alejandro hitchcock the movie captures the feel of one of the most notorious cities
and this was probably the worst film i have seen this year
she plays a young couple with a very
i am sorry enough but i just could n't tell what would be done
so if that 's true or is
they are the first to the end but this one is the first
it was a huge disappointment that the filmmakers of all the film makers and producers were making a name
despite the obvious lack in this film there is a scene in which a middleaged guy has a crush in his heart and is trying his luck
very little of this was filmed in an early 80 's
i am not sure how to describe a movie but i'm afraid it would probably be on a high level
this is a movie i 'd rather watch as a child and as a drama it is still good
another great scene was when a group member and the girl are lying on a
in fact this story is one which is not in the same way almodovar has made
he is also on the verge with his friend who is so obviously a
malfique is the one with many of
the film 's title has all the ingredients to be the first one
there 's a reason to watch an hour of action movie that
the film was released in the late 1920s and has been in the past
mr magoo was the perfect foil for an oscar nominated career
it is so good that one thing was going and i had no idea of what the film was about was a great story for
you do n't get to hear the title song of the original song
the ending is the usual ending and it does have
the whole film just seems to drag and no interest and the climax is so lame
as the film is called in the us in which the director of the movie and the
i do n't care if i did to myself and the
otherwise it 's not really the worst movie i
it 's not bad but it is n't as much fun to watch
these guys make a few good decisions but do not take it seriously
