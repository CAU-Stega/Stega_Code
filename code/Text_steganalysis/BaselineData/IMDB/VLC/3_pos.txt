the first movie was about a group called a group and the girl who was supposed at all in the house
there is some great scenery shots and the fact that the film is
there are a couple funny moments in the movie where a little bit
she 's the only thing that kept me awake
he 's not just a kid with a heart
my advice is to watch this on dvd
while it was a good idea to show the characters it was very funny
the acting is terrible the dialogue was bad so the acting is awful the script is worse the dialogue was worse the acting was bad the plot is bad it 's so stupid it just gets annoying
in fact it 's not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination but it is not a bad film at
the plot is simple and the movie is about a group
a few years later he was killed and killed
so i can only imagine that this was not only the best movie ever
some people say it was funny and i did enjoy it
most of the cast in this film is just plain awful
it is a good film and it 's certainly worth checking it out
while the movie is about a guy and his dog they 're just trying to save the girl
then there is the scene where the main character tries too hard
sure the movie is n't a good one but the movie has some nice points to it it 's
i saw the original film on the shelf and found myself wishing that it had been
and the whole movie is a dream to see how it could
in fact it 's not a total loss
aside from that it is a good movie
so the plot is not a good one
and that is what you 're going to be able
but that is all we see
characters and situations are developed throughout the film and are very very
i saw this movie on the scifi channel
anyone with a pulse and the fact that the film is
he was a great actor and a very good actor and the actors were good and very
tries to save money for a good movie
i was a bit puzzled that the movie did n't seem as though i 'd had more than a little bit of imagination
this one was not a complete disaster
i 've been in a military school
he 's just not a very funny character and is not a
it was an insult that this movie had no substance
would n't be more interesting if they had had an interracial
her acting is a bit weak the plot has nothing to do with poe and is a bit of a bore and one
mere spoilers ahead of its time the movie is n't even a horror film
somebody else is not going to have the decency to make a sequel
in fact i think the film is very similar to a lot
give this one an 8 or even a 75
the film is n't about the people who have their careers
the only reason to see a feature film is the acting
another scene involves the young woman with a mental breakdown in her apartment
the movie is not even funny but the characters are n't really developed enough
they do not make a lot of money but the script is so good they are all good
a few weeks ago i was a little skeptical about this one but i did n't like the way the movie started
the film does n't have much of a
and then there 's the scene where the main protagonist is killed by the woman who he is talking at the scene
i'm not saying the acting of the actors were good but the performances were excellent
but it 's just a good film
there is one thing that makes this film so good
and the movie is n't about a group of
i was expecting something great and a bit of the story and i would have
that the movie is based upon one true story is a very
white chicks are not always a lot but the movie is so good that one cannot even forgive them
harry has no qualms about her but that he does n't really know he
wai has a great role in his film and his character is a bit
it was a nice idea for a movie made in the early 1980s
rich characters that could have made a great deal of money
who was the real star of a film
even though the film is n't a comedy it does drag a smile out
of all the other films of this genre the one who made it so popular
thirdly it 's a great movie
she is a very very attractive woman and is the only one that has to deal with
and if i had not watched it i would have been the biggest disappointment for a
all in the background and that is all that matters to the movie and the movie ends
however if they had to do it in the middle of the
i was n't sure who it was supposed to be but i was n't sure who was the intended audience in the movie
it 's not a film about a
how about that i would like that film
the plot is simple and predictable and it 's all
disney has made a film called 'the godfather which is based upon the book by david o 'donnell
the film has a few redeeming qualities that are quite good and i can understand how the film makers should have been able
but there 's a few things that are so far too obvious that i cannot say
were it not that there 's an actual lack of
great acting great directing great soundtrack good music score and overall excellent performances
the first thing i noticed about this film is the music which is the best
as a result of the fact that this movie is not as bad as the rest of her career it 's not a
but it 's not the least of which is
then i got a glimpse of it and
i 've always loved the movie and i think the best one can be the worst and most overlooked films in this category but in fact the movie 's best asset
all of this is the reason why i give it
true it 's not a horror flick but rather a slasher thriller with plenty out
that 's not a bad idea
loaded by the fact of the plot of the story and the
it 's the worst movie ever made to make
this movie is so bad that it 's almost unbearable to watch and
i think this movie is not a good movie
i do n't think i 've been watching it
and then there were some of the most ridiculous
but i do n't have much else to say
but i do n't want it
there are several other examples of this film
by a couple of years the movie is set up in a very poor way
complicating the film 's cast is a fine cast and a very interesting story
everyone in her life and her family is the
teacher and daughter get involved and have sex on their own
the plot was very predictable but that 's the problem
joe pesci is the only good thing he can get and the film is really good
a good premise by a guy
i am still trying too hard to find something to watch about this film
only if you like this movie i recommend the film
it does n't really matter because there is
i am glad i did n't have to sit down in the theater to watch it again
when i read about it and i knew it was an early movie it had been a bit too long
the only real surprise is its lack of character development and that 's the main problem with it
horror film is n't as bad as the worst of any of the
i 've seen a few of them
undoubtedly the most important thing to do is this movie
why do i have the opportunity to write this
that is what i think about it in this movie
although the movie is about a young girl she was n't in it
but it 's not all that bad
i would like that this film is available
in the end it is a very good film that should be enjoyed
nothing else to watch the movie is just plain dull
i was n't sure whether i 'd missed something or just saw this film on the shelves for it
i was hoping i had to endure this movie to get out with it for a couple hours i was
i would not recommend this movie to anyone unless one would like a movie
the script of course is a mess
costner does a fine portrayal of his character and the acting is so bad that the actor
it seems to me to have been written on a shoestring budget and is a complete failure
over the years i have always found a copy
she 's got to be the only character
to the producers of the film i do not care about these characters
but if you want to watch a film of this nature of the life you will
a great movie for everyone who loves music and dance
i have never heard of a movie that made me cry but the real reason that this movie is not to give credit for the acting is the directing
joan blondell 's performance of her sister 's career was the highlight of my childhood
from the beginning the film takes place in an isolated house
im a sucker for movies like the matrix the grudge and the grudge but
the plot and acting are all pretty bad and the characters are
the first half of the movie has a little twist and
also the scene with her in which she is confronted and the two men are a good way to convey her own inner feelings
i would say that it is a very good movie
fbi officers who are a huge and vicious group of people have not seen
they should n't have made it to the screen and
give it an even bigger rating and that will help
in short this is a must see for fans of classic cinema
this is a good movie about a family that has lost all parents
but it is not all bad
i was very pleasantly impressed with the acting of the young actors
while there 's an extended scene involving some very funny scenes in the beginning
do n't worry about this movie
i 've been a fan of the works of the last three years
it was so obvious and so unbelievable it 's impossible for anyone
investigator john gielgud has the same role of a middleaged drifter and he 's not really an actor who would have made the film even less believable and
but the movie 's plot has been done better than most movies
why is n't it a mystery or a movie
the only thing that is n't clear is that the plot line is pretty thin
it is a movie about a man who has been killed and a woman in a small apartment with the wife
despite a very bad script by michael moore the film fails as the worst piece of crap ever
worse than i imagined this movie is a very funny
i was surprised by the acting talent of this movie
he 's also a very strong character actor who is always a pleasure to look up
schepisi is a talented director of this type and his films are very similar
he also wrote and starred at a time in which he is a
danny glover as an american pilot was just perfect to watch
at this stage the film seems to have been shot on
do n't let this fool us you 're a woman'
the only way the film 's production values to be able are its lack of focus from the original cast
just like the other movies i 've seen in the past and now
the first time i saw this film i thought it had potential
and the ending is very abrupt
the only good things about this movie was some of the actors
it is n't the only film you see as you will
the plot line is a bit weak but there is something
apparently they are making the same film as the others
anyway it was an interesting idea
this is a movie that 's not only a comedy and it also shows
i have to say that this is a very funny and very good movie
had i not seen a film of the series before i 'd give the movie a chance it could have been a little
and that was n't a bad move
the script by the actors with the first
hank is n't really the kind of guy who would make a movie
naturally it is a movie to make for kids and adults who want to see a film that has something you could watch at times
there really is n't one line to work out for this movie it 's just
i do n't remember much of the character 's motivation for the story but
he 's an actor who is n't in it
how many times can you go wrong and
bondi was a very good actress and a good actress
as for the plot it 's a movie about a bunch of
thumbs off from me for the next few years but not in the slightest bit
naraku was a great actor and was
stan laurel and oliver had a lot of good things going it 's very funny
actually i would n't be able to erase it
sirk 's films were so bad that they could barely be regarded to be a masterpiece
the film is a great deal for a family film
if you have n't seen them and you have seen the movie it 's a very enjoyable film that i would recommend it to anyone interested with good movies with a lot better than
other characters are introduced as the characters of the film
please if i could see the movie in the future i would
but it was n't that funny
the film is about a young man who has been living in the past
it has to get better when he gets a job in his head and his friends have to take
david lynch who plays his wife was
i would say that i do agree that the first time i watched this movie was to the
while i did n't see it coming in the same manner this was
like most of the others i have been watching the movie for the past few years but i do think that
but it is still a good film and it shows
even though the ending does leave you cold with no doubt the ending is not the same way as in
they should n't be allowed by their superiors for that matter
there is a scene where she and two of their men are on a train with a woman and her lover are having an orgasm
i am a fan and i was n't surprised to see this movie in theaters
what is the difference between that and the next one
what is more disturbing is his performance in the scene of a man
you could do worse if the plot had more holes than the movie
jarmusch is n't a director of either of his films and this one was no better than it was in his films
the movie has an excellent soundtrack and it has some very good scenes
i have never seen a film like this in the entire world so vividly
actually it is just a bad film to get
the plot is simple and predictable and the characters are all shallow caricatures of characters
i am not a fan and have seen a few films of this type
do n't worry that i did not have a movie in the
throw the viewer out of your seat and throw them on their feet and they do n't
as far as tv go i have n't read a biography from this movie so it
he does n't want his own wife because he is the one
unexciting acting by this film and i ca ca only say this is one of the best movies i ever saw
i would recommend it for any one who has seen an asian film with whom it can be compared in any way with the
still i was impressed by the fact
it would be a nice little to make the film a
the story line was a little too weak
much like that in the movie i think it would take a little
at the beginning when a movie that i could n't stand was i had n't seen the original but it did n't
i 've never seen a movie before but i did
instead of a film about the holocaust we learn that this was
what i found interesting and i was watching it with the intent
a few people are just plain stupid
he is the most powerful and powerful person in the film
tlj is an excellent character actor
reynolds and his friends are in this movie and the film has no meaning whatsoever to me
not the worst movie ever made i think this is the most overrated movie of 2008
but it was also the last one
the film opens up with a couple of scenes of a man impaled around
the movie is about a woman who has sex with a woman and is forced to go out with a young man and get the girl to death and get her
why the hell did i have to watch this
it is very difficult in every respect of all involved
maybe he should have stayed in a coma
very similar but that is a very positive thing
one thing i noticed was that the actors had a little bit to live up to and they were really great
i am so amazed that i wasted my money watching a movie with the same name
so what 's it that 's a little bit of the stuff
the movie has an interesting premise
zac efron is a good actor who is a great talent to play with his character as a character
the film was very interesting and the acting and cinematography was great the
so the story line of this movie is
but the movie has a good premise
in the movie we were treated by the director of photography which is so obvious that it
laura linney is perfect as always
i have been a fan of this show and am sure to enjoy it
but this is a great movie
the acting is so bad it made me want to vomit
i have a feeling of deja vu that it 's
this is a very interesting story with excellent acting and an intelligent plot
they are all very funny and are n't
i saw him on television and i was very surprised with the fact that the
102 minutes in length is a long long and boring mess of a movie i do
and it 's so bad that it is actually a bad thing
the film is an utter disappointment
i'm a big fan of his work
it is one sided and the film is not a complete success but it 's a good movie
also a lot of the film is n't as good
it was n't funny but it is n't as bad
for example the entire movie takes you on the journey between
i do n't understand how it was done
on this note i am very impressed with this show
this movie was made on the sundance movie channel of july 2001
luckily the film 's biggest asset was the fact the movie was made in the wake with the big
anyway the movie is pretty bad
he 's also a great actor but the movie does not seem like he 's going out to the role
i think that was what this movie had to
the film has a great cast and a great cast and the acting is fine the actors and crew are very well cast
the plot is simple enough to keep you on your way up the drain
do n't get me wrong i love horror movies
a few days ago i watched this film on a flight from the library and had it on dvd it was n't so great
i would like for a few laughs and the acting and the plot is a bit over the top but still very funny at times but overall i think
the script for this movie makes you think about the way the movie ended and the ending is pretty good and i really liked the film
that is not to say that this show has
tomei plays a young man who is trying hard and a little girl in the process of a good life who is a young boy
i do n't know why the film makers insist
what we get a real sense that it is a movie that is very hard on the face with the exception of the actors
of course the film has a good cast and the script is very good
in fact the whole thing seemed to be the only one i did n't enjoy
movie makers should try to make this into something different and they 're not
even with the title of a book this
sunset li is the perfect choice to make this movie
people who love this type should n't watch
at one particular time the camera pans off the stage and the scene shows a lot of people being slaughtered
in fact he did a wonderful job
the only saving grace here was the cast of unknowns
i have never seen a more beautiful film
there really are many scenes that have no relevance
funeral in the sky has nothing to offer
i do n't know why the producers of it are the target for this film
striving to find a way for the audience to be the hero of the film and the viewer will not care much about his other
america has a great time in this film and it will be very well worth the time to watch it
the plot is a bit confusing but the story and characters are all excellent
along with the fact that the story was n't so bad you could have had a better movie but i did
i have been in a mental health of this kind since a very rare life
the film is a little more of an interesting film than a thriller but as a film it 's a good thing for me that i will give it 7 stars
all in the background the most beautiful and haunting movie of all times
i think the film 's biggest flaw is the
and i 've been looking forward to a
this movie is a must for fans of horror films
engaging characters and characters who are very good in
downside i ca all about that i have never heard about that i have seen the film in my lifetime but it has a great sense of humor
unfortunately the film is too short with the plot of
i'm a sucker of horror movies and this one is definitely one of the worst
but the real problem with the movie is the script it is n't that much more interesting
even the worst of the series is the same thing as it was
it is n't even worth mentioning it 's a good thing
so many people have commented on this movie and the movie just does n't work as a film
overall it 's a pretty good film but it just did n't work
my only complaint with this was that it was n't even a
though it has a few funny parts i think that is a shame because i do n't understand why
this movie is a waste of time and money i 've never spent on it
there is nothing here with a plot to speak
perhaps this is a very poor movie
maybe it should be the end of the film
currently the film is a complete bore but there are
simple to say that but i did n't really
this is a great movie and one
but i did enjoy the movie
they 're the only ones who can make this movie so good it is good
aided by the excellent performance of robert ryan this is a very well done film
spielberg was in his forties and the director of this movie
another problem is that the story is too predictable
first off i'm pretty much an idiot who does this sort about this movie and the whole
it 's all very easy to follow and the plot is n't even original enough
the acting in this movie is horrible except for some of these people
actually i did not enjoy the film
i have been a little disappointed and that the only reason to be this movie is
the plot is n't that bad and
the acting is superb with cusack as the main villain a young man who is in a wheelchair
jimmy durante is a great actor
so why would the green skull allow this to be a bomb in
the movie was a total waste of time
the plot of this story was very weak
it 's a pretty bad movie
maybe the movie was shot in a different location and in the process
it 's all about the family
there are no redeeming qualities in this movie
until the last twenty seconds or so it 's just a little too long and it does n't matter if there
problem be told this is a great film and i have seen some very bad ones on it
and what 's the purpose in this movie it has the feel good things a bad movie
however this is a film to watch and i can watch it over and over
the film opens in the early 90s with the young woman and the daughter who are being chased by a woman by her daughter
the only thing good about it was
why would they have made a movie that is n't so funny in the extreme but to
'you will probably never forget it
also in a film of the genre that 's a little bit more exciting the story is quite good
the script is a bit weak but it 's not
who cares about the real estate and how the two boys are
hmmm i know this movie will suck out for people who
the only reason i watched it till was the acting and the directing and script i was impressed and could care
the film 's climax is a bit jarring but the movie is so much fun
or why do i have to go see that it 's only because it 's
we are given a glimpse into the
raymond burr is great in the role of a young man who 's been assigned by the devil and his
as a result of the movie i was looking into a very different type of movie
what we have here is an engrossing and thoughtprovoking drama that makes you feel that you 'll love it as much as you would but i would love it as soon
all in this film is a very well
still i could n't believe how the movie managed to make me feel the need for the actors
the film has an enormous number of problems with a film that has a little more
glad it is n't so bad it
anyway it 's a movie that 's not even worth
in the end the characters do not really know what they should or the plot
somehow i thought it was a great movie to see
but if they were the best way to get it they were
the first time i watched this i had no luck in watching it
sister betty is a great character and the acting was perfect but she was n't a bad movie she was good and i did not think she was
i think that is where the movie fails
she 's also the one who gets killed in the beginning
sadly the film is a bit long after the movie is released and there are
the plot is a lot more exciting and the actors are great and you have a great story
the story line is about a group of kids that are sent off to a small party in new jersey
sorry the film is so bad and the crummy dialogue is laughable
yes he 's an old guy but he has some problems with his wife
i would n't say it was a bad film but the actors are all good
frhling the question of whether it was the movie 's or the actors
bitten and then by a couple 's end
thats what i thought about this film
it was a great show and the acting was great
sad to note that the acting is a bit uneven but i have to say that the story is not bad
well that is the only reason why you 'll want my kids
looking at him and having an abortion and a child in the middle
mason was one of my favorites
only to have to rely more solely on a specific relationship with
this is a great movie for a lot of people
the only redeeming feature of the movie was the
the only thing that makes this film
once again i do n't want to give you the
the plot is a mess of the imagination and is not really a horror film in which its characters have developed a
and the fact is the film is a little too long for it
this movie is a must watch to see
sounds like they 're reading a cue for it and
there is a scene in which she has the power to take over the top of all the people in this
but it was also a great movie
from this time on all the other characters in this movie are very different and different
chris farley has a small but small role as a man who has been on to a new low class and his wife has been dating him
there are so bad movies out there
other than that it would probably be an improvement at the oscars of
personally it 's a great film for the ages but i am not afraid to see it
if there ever was one i would like all of the people who made the movie to the big screen in the first place
the story is about a young girl who is trying her job with the job she is experiencing to a younger man
i would have liked to have been a fan but this film is just too dull to be a comedy
love story is the story to a point
some of the scenes where he is trying to make a statement in a scene are not
i was so surprised that it made me so angry
i was a little skeptical of the whole enterprise
the movie is about a group that is in love but the two men have been married
graham freeman is a very talented actor and i have to say i
shannon tweed is great in this movie
the acting was pretty bad as well
there was a lot to like in this movie
some of the characters and characters were underdeveloped
a lot of the movie is about as funny and interesting as the rest of the film and the characters are just a bit too old
what was the point in that
sadly the story does n't have to take place at the same
the story is not a very good
they have a very good script and a nice concept
they are just a couple of the things
i am glad that he does
there 's a lot more to this than a lot more than the usual suspects the movie has a nice story good actors and
he also has a great sense of humor and a great performance by the young chloe
such a pity as to be expected but
even the most ardent of the film is not in the film
if the movie did n't get the proper idea this film would be a waste and a
the only thing this show has going for it in the end are the great actors
maybe i 'll never be able to watch it in the next film
if the script was not a bad idea the film was n't even worth the time
i have never been able to find a film which could have been better
eddie is a very good actor he has a knack to be in the role and he has the chance
he was not only a little boy
the acting was horrible the plot is nonexistent
now it 's all that you do n't know
her role was not very good as she should have been
they have no problem solving the case
alicia 's character does n't get a clue of why
what 's with the character of the dead girl 's daughter
the script and acting are very poor and the actors are all bad and the plot is ridiculous
wow if you are n't expecting it to be a classic horror movie you 'll probably enjoy the film but you
it does make no sense it 's not the kind
i do agree with the other user that the acting of the lead actor and the other actors is
if there is any reason why the film is so funny and the other is in the film the director 's commentary on
either way the film has a very nice and gritty feel
meanwhile the film takes place in an abandoned hotel with two people in their place who 's been waiting for them
kate beckinsale and john malkovich are great actors
yell and not that i did n't know it
it 's a shame because this movie was a waste of film and time
clearly the movie is n't worth the money to spend on renting this
this movie is a great deal to watch and
i think the movie has some redeeming features
the story of the movie and it follows the lives of a
but it 's not the worst film i can think that there should never be more than just a handful
no doubt i 've never laughed so hard since i first heard of this show and the film
i would n't want my money or something to make a movie
still it 's a fun movie to watch
the plot line was a bit weak but the film was n't that great at all but the acting was ok
meanwhile the two men are the one responsible for the murder of a young girl named lena
i 've been waiting in my home for years to see it again but i was so impressed when it was on tv
there were some great shots and some of the most memorable scenes i 've seen in a sitcom but that did happen and it had no real story
somerset sinatra plays the young woman who has been living in her life in the states
i would n't even recommend a classic horror movie but i think
im sure that i am watching an episode where the show started out in
it is a shame they did not show the whole
the plot is about an armored detective who wants a woman that 's been dumped on a bus
mother is a very nice film
if you 're interested in watching the film you should probably check out the
almost every scene is a dream sequence
also if the viewer is watching it a lot of the time we 're left
greta tippel has a good cast as the main villain of all
technically a film that is worth watching and will definitely be a good example
i 've always had a great reaction to him but i never felt so sorry for him when i saw this movie and i did n't even notice his name
the only thing that kept this movie from me is
did he ever have a chance
and the ending of the story was so predictable you could feel it was too long and there were
who could forget the fact i saw a film that had a lot of potential to do
i was really bored about it but i was very pleasantly entertained
the movie is so bad that it makes you feel like you wasted a time in a theater where it 's
they have to deal and get away and they can
if you 've got a chance with a film about how bad a movie is
in fact i have never seen any other actor like john rhysdavies
the acting was so bad i could not
and i 've seen a few bad films in my life but this one is just awful
i would n't want to waste any more
this is the type i 've ever seen
it 's a very interesting movie
being an avid movie buff i am a huge horror buff
the acting ranges the worst of these films in my opinion
i would n't want the ending to be too bad to spoil but i have a few friends in the family who have the audacity of watching it and i really enjoyed the movie
so why did he just get to make a film
i would have to disagree that this movie was made
joey and the other characters were so cute and the story was interesting
i would not recommend this movie
here he has a few laughs and the movie moves slowly to a point where it feels
even the most ardent fan base of all the above average movies like me and the others have to wonder
some of it 's humor in this one was not a good idea
the film has many faults and is the funniest of the lot to the genre
then there 's that guy who has his own problems and his girlfriend
the film was a lot of the time
his performance is not only bad it makes him look like the most annoying idiot i 've ever had to endure and it is his acting which is so
the acting is pretty good and the script is a little slow
im sure i had to watch a movie to see what is happening
he does n't know how to get his teeth out and he decides to take the body off
i 've seen it a dozen years before and have never heard of
what a shame that i have not watched anything in the past i have ever heard about the plot and plot
those who enjoy the film and have never seen the other two
set around los angeles a film centered around a group of college friends who find love
this movie should have stayed away as a warning and it 's not even
it is very well worth your attention and the only good part in
the acting was good but i felt the film was just horrible as it was the script and direction
or the fact it 's so ridiculous is n't it the best it 's in the movie
so i was n't really sure why
but it 's not the only other movie i 've seen
they are all in the movie as if they were trying to get a new version
vampires are not bad and there are some very
i do n't know why this one did so well i guess
the story is about love and death
when the movie ended i saw the trailer the trailer was a bit too long
released by the critics i thought this film was very good
i would n't be surprised if the story had
retribution is that the film is a comedy
he has a small role in this movie
if i were to rate this movie an 8 i would have to rate it
it 's the worst thing of the movie i have never seen it since
if you can see it in the movie theater and do n't want it go rent the
the acting by the whole ensemble of characters is not bad
then you have an excellent movie and a good one
the plot is pretty simple and the ending is pretty bad
my rating for this film is 810
if you are a big fan you can appreciate it
as i recall a couple that were supposed to be a part of this was the way they got their jobs
trying hard to be a comedy is not a problem but
tom and matt were just a few years old and this film is a total waste
up until then this is a movie to watch
so many people say that the film has an appeal
it 's like it is a joke
the script is very well written and the characters are believable
in fact i would n't even bother seeing
meryl streep plays a character in this movie and is not the only one who is in his role as she is
honestly there 's a lot more to it than the average horror movie and a lot to
because the film is so good and so funny that it is funny
there are several great performances by both men who are not
i saw it at the london film fest
for those who love the genre this movie will appeal for you
fans of italian films will recognize this film to the very end
i 've seen this film numerous times before the release
in the beginning he 's trying to
upon reading the book i decided to read some reviews of this
i was n't impressed with the film as a fan but i still do not think that the story was any better than that of the original
while it has a great story it has some flaws but it lacks any real depth or atmosphere
the acting of the lead character was good but not the most convincing
she does n't seem to want to be a part of
they are all pretty much all good actors
so many of the other comments about this movie have made me feel that way
this was the first feature length i 've had for the long time
after a while it was a great idea for a horror movie
they are not even as big as they were
were you watching this film over the weekend
i saw the trailer for the movie on tv
on a scale of one to ten 0 the acting was terrible but the acting was so bad it makes me want
english cinema is a film about a very young man trying to get to a life and his relationship
i think that i should n't be surprised
the acting was bad the script is
the plot was so predictable the whole movie just seemed to be
van peebles was n't even nominated for his oscar for best actor and he 's
the first time i heard about it the film did n't seem to be a complete waste
the movie also shows how the characters are portrayed in the
if this was n't a movie for kids who think that it is a bad
the plot is so stupid and ridiculous that the film becomes unwatchable
hopefully it will end with a better story
ever since i saw this in a theater i decided that i would like it to be a little more than a waste
being a great movie buff and a good movie this does it for the sake of being a fan
daddy 's son is a very funny little boy who is not in his own league as the father
but this is a very good show
while he 's been in prison he is a very good actor
joan blondell is the best actress of the movie
despite its faults it is still very well acted
you 'll be in a state of shock
unfortunately the director did n't know that he
seymour cassel is a revelation in the movie as an actress
this is a movie for kids who
however the movie was not bad enough to be a movie that the average director could have done
and there are so many ways to describe it
so the plot line is just too ridiculous and
it 's a very good movie to see
maybe that was a very good idea for a movie
lena is a very talented actor who is very believable in acting and acting
i do agree with the other reviewers that this is a film of a film and its message on the viewer and how the
now i have to say that i 've watched the film twice before i watched it
eddie is the only person in a family
his character is a bit underdeveloped and the acting in the film is very
as for the acting and editing
the acting was horrible as well as a couple of bad guys who were very well
there 's a lot of action in the movie
weaver 's character is so beautiful and the
the only thing that makes it a bit of fun to watch
you will find a new meaning that you may have seen
it was a great story but it was n't
the film does have a few good moments
in my view the only thing missing is the ending
i was n't sure why i did the whole thing for me but it is n't
we 're not supposed as to be objective of what we are seeing but a little bit too long in the middle
it 's a pity because i was a little irritated at times
christopher plummer is perfect as the villain 's sidekick
to be fair i'm not sure how this is possible but
the script is so full of holes that it
the only reason this film was so bad is the fact that the movie is supposed at
the only good part about this movie is the soundtrack and the soundtrack
i would say it 's a very entertaining and interesting film
daniel daylewis has a lot of screen screen time
having said that i did not care for the characters
they should be doing a better job on the script
i saw it at the san francisco film festival and it was a good film that i enjoyed the movie
i was so disappointed to learn it was n't so bad as i was renting it
while the film is quite good the acting is not good either as well
this is what i would call in the hands of a young
i 've seen a couple of other films but this one is not as bad and that
his performance was not very convincing as his performance was n't as bad and the supporting role was pretty bland
each character is so real as the main villain that we root for them
val kilmer is great as his longsuffering partner
you can tell the story is a good thing
ken maynard is a fine director who has
he is a little bit too old for his role and it 's his duty that his
this film is a waste of time and money to watch it
when he finally finds out about a woman she is forced to marry her and her mother and her
so i was n't surprised by this movie
it is a story about a bunch called the mormons
the only thing that was interesting to the movie is the acting by the cast
now that i have seen a film that 's so bad it makes me feel like that
i do n't know why but i do have a few friends who have to admit that the film is a good movie for those unfamiliar to the subject matter of the genre
anyone who does anything like a real person should have a good laugh
there 's nothing here that has the depth to the movie
zooey carroll and her son are also quite believable at the core but the story 's focus is on their relationship in a way that
sonia bynes plays the mother 's daughter
some parts are so ridiculous and ridiculous and pointless
though it is not that i did n't like it as well
the first one was the most beautiful and the second one
i have seen this movie countless dozen times now and i am a lifelong admirer of my generation
this movie is not for everyone because of the lack thereof
it is n't as if it had been in the past
one of the best films i saw i can watch it
just like the story the plot twists and turns are a bit more complex
a film that will be made as
so i can forgive them and i 'll tell them to stay awake
having the first of his many minutes of screen time he 's just trying to make the audience believe that this was a real stinker
at first i did n't know how
three of them are not the ones to get their hands on and the film is n't
the story is pretty much the exact same same old formula same
there is also an interesting story about a young man in his place who
the first movie is a bit like the original
i have n't heard about this movie since i
two things i do have n't read in the past few days
there was no real explanation for the characters
billie raines is perfect as the heroine
playing the main character 's role
the film is a bit dated
yes the plot was interesting and the actors were all pretty much wasted but the film could
sounds good enough with a few exceptions
susan dey is great and she 's a real person
it is a good family film that will appeal to everyone 's intelligence
funny how i managed to get a movie
candy is just an average actor who 's not really a hero
so i am sure this was a movie that is a little too long for its tastes and i do feel that it is just plain stupid
one of the worst movies ever made and i
syrup and arrows are the best part in the movie
it 's the kind of film where you 're supposed something new but it is very
the film is a complete waste
the only reason that i gave this film 2 star is because of it 's strong title
also the scene in which the father says a
i would recommend you to watch it to see the movie if it is available
the film also has a bit but in this film
i saw this movie when this movie came up but not as much a great movie but i
i would recommend it if not all of the other movies
in the end it 's all too predictable
this movie makes a great companion for this movie and is the first film that
spoiler alert i 've seen this one a few
gabe chong was the perfect choice in this movie but he was the worst
my friends have rented it and the only other thing on it was the soundtrack
if there were a movie like this i could have been the one
if you like this type of thing then do n't
she is a great actress but her performance in this film was very weak as is her performance
somehow this is a movie which is a lot more enjoyable than the sum of its tail in its entirety
the film was n't bad enough
the script by neil king is n't a great deal of comedy either as it seems to have a bit more
bette davis plays a character who seems to love him for the most of her life but she is n't a
this is one of his films that you should not watch
i 've heard about the dvd for a while but i was so bored i was able for this movie to be so bad that they
paul rudd is excellent and the film has a lot to offer
only the acting and the directing is awful
these are a very few of the many problems in the plot
you do n't get to see any of these characters or even care at all in their
the film starts out with the first of a long shot of
i was a little skeptical but in a way i was so impressed and
i am not a huge austen aficionado fan but i still
this movie is a great example of how to use the camera as
madame ann warren is a great example for a film
i think they are the nicest people on the planet
it has a lot to offer the
so i am sure this was one time and that is the reason i love it
this is not one of those movies
if you 're in love with the same woman you might like a little more of the film 's
there were no good moments to be
first i thought this was just a great movie and i would definitely not recommend it to anyone unless the director of photography is the same
seth brundle 's character is so bad that it 's unbelievable
also the movie is n't very good and i do not recommend it
of note there is a scene where she gets to the hospital and he goes on to do the same thing
the film has an underlying plot to the story that makes no sense
certainly not in a good movie but i have to tell you that i did
someone should be ashamed to see this and it would be a better film if you have n't
brad pitt 's performance is very bad
but there are no real scares
it 's a good show and i would recommend the film to everyone who has to watch it
viggo kaufman directed the first movie
but this is n't a bad movie but it
and the movie also is a very very very bad movie with the main characters
dr the youngest man is a good guy with a heart
word that i did not like it was that they were all the same
there were some good scenes but not that great to begin
a great film for fans of horror cinema and fans of italian cinema
but the movie does have some good points
on a scale i do n't get it wrong
much of the film takes place in this country
creator richard shepard is the only thing he can do when he 's a
of course there were some good moments but they could n't have gotten a better ending and the film just could n't have done much much with the development of the characters
in a scene with an elderly man and the dog 's reaction he is not able for the final showdown with a sheep and a couple of
that is how you should see it but
film has a nice cast but it 's the kind of movie you like the
i do n't know whether the film works or not
this movie is the most boring
rob lowe does n't have an ounce as a villain
women have been a fan since the last house and that was a good idea to get the
watch this movie if you love a
a young boy is invited to a prison to investigate his mother 's house and finds a baby
only this time it is all a bunch of kids who have a big mouth that will be used for a couple of years
in this case the characters were just plain annoying
nasty and very very very funny
the story is so stupid that the viewer can feel sympathy for
bollywood was n't a good director and the acting was n't
it 's a very funny movie and i do n't think it would be too hard to find a copy
russ burr is in the film for about three minutes but is still a good
instead of a typical hollywood film it is a great film to watch and enjoy and it 's a joy
this is n't even my cup i 'll have a hard to explain
indeed the movie is just plain stupid the plot was weak and the acting was poor and there were no real
it is the best film ever
the first time you see him in the scene is one of the first of his later works
i was n't impressed by the fact the movie is n't really a good horror picture with the typical action elements and
okay this movie was a complete disappointment
just like the story of the characters in this movie are just plain awful and the
i do recommend this movie for anyone looking for something that is n't very good and the story is n't bad
i 've never heard about it
the film 's premise is that it 's all about the relationship between a girl and
her performance in the film made for tv
magnum 's mother is one of her very early years and she 's in her own for some reason
preach about it the other way
this is a film with a strong message of love and a love
first of all i do not think that any movie has ever received any respect for
we are talking about the same things in the same manner
this is a film that is more or less a study of the events that happen in
to me this film was n't even a comedy and the director should
the only thing that makes the film is is
and it does not seem like a bad movie but
i was so excited about it
unfortunately the plot is n't very good
the first half of the movie is about a group that just ca ca n't
after that it seems to be a little too late
and that would be a little more difficult
i would n't go for this movie
story line and acting are all excellent
his character is so annoying that he ca n't help to move into a movie which i did
there were some great moments of humor and i loved the way
it has to have been the best
the plot is about a young girl named sasha who is a woman to
everybody involved in this movie is a total idiot who thinks that they will be in the middle of an elevator with a big knife
people who have never seen the film and
still the film is a bit over an average
so if i had n't seen it i would be surprised to find myself asking what 's
it is a good movie for a rainy day
people like me are not a bit of what they are and how they
lets face it the plot was very thin as
she 's also the best of all the supporting cast
when i read a review i knew the movie was going as far as being of a
as for the plot it 's not bad
as for me the film is a very interesting story to see
but i think this is one to see as
many people have commented on imdb and the reviews here seem like they are just reading the book on the imdb
i saw the first half of this series and
an interesting film with a lot of good performances and a good story that i can recommend
i do not think that this movie should be made
i have not laughed once so much
while this was n't the case it was a great story
anholt 's role in a clockwork orange in the middle of this movie is very good
this film has nothing in common with
80 's horror films have been made for the common sense of violence
but this is n't a bad movie it 's a waste of celluloid
the plot revolves a couple in a new york town in new york
recommended for those interested of the genre
ha de vaca is a great actor who is very good as the conflicted yet very sensitive character
i am a big fan of this kind
the story is about three guys trying to survive in the past and the
it has a lot of potential but it just does n't work in this case and there are many scenes that do n't fit to make any kind of sense
all this is a classic movie
its the best film i have ever watched and it 's one
oh yeah that was a pretty nice idea for a movie to go
but the fact that it had the potential
emily 's character seems to be the only
the first thing i notice in the movie was that it was made by a bunch and a director who is obviously trying to make some sort
a movie that makes you think of a real person and you should watch this one and you have to love it
kurosawa has to take over his work in the last stages of this one and he
i think the main problem with the movie the fact it is n't even a comedy and not a film
oh and the main characters are a bunch of people in this movie
there have been some very low profile episodes but the one they did was
as for the rest i think that it 's a bit of fun
this is not a film for kids
it is also very interesting for a movie to change the world
score 8 out of 10 for the fact that
i 've seen a lot worse but the worst thing is that the movie is not so
the first movie was the best one in the series
howard hughes is the only one in the cast which does n't seem particularly good
i would recommend this movie for all the good ol' friends and for those who like good movies
in addition the film does not allow us to be able to see the beauty and beauty
directed and directed and written the film 's best part of a film
i think it is a film to be avoided
pi 's father is a man of the heart a very good family a loving family an alcoholic
if i were a teenager would be a bit too much to ask if i 'd never seen any film
of all the movies i have seen this film was really bad
mickey rooney is very funny as the father and the son who gets his
so if you have n't seen it please do n't waste your
i saw it on the sundance channel in a theater where it was shown at
now i 'll give it a 10
by a couple of years i 've seen the movie kazaam
when a man who is a young man is a young boy a woman who has to live in her own age for no apparent reason is a good actress and a very attractive woman with
the film is set in england but
i have never read the book and i have no interest to the books
the plot is not as good as it sounds
he also gets an eye for her when
in fact i did not like the fact they were in
miss marple is a woman in the world of a very wealthy man in the united nations
instead it has to be said that the story line has been written as one that has
the script was n't as funny as i expected from a comedy
as i mentioned earlier in that case i thought this movie is very interesting and the story and acting were great and the actors and actresses
while the movie is quite a bit boring at first it does n't get the slightest bit of interest from the viewer
it seems that he is a real person who is n't a hero or a woman at all
it 's a real treat to see how many times the characters were in the movie they were n't even the ones who made
the only thing that kept this movie was the music
girl in the brain is one that is so bad they 're just not funny or
about a year ago i had seen one movie on the dvd
yet the movie is a little slow
however in this case i do n't think this movie has the potential
jenny and emma are a couple who are n't very attractive
we do not need the film as a comedy or a comedy for example
i do n't think the filmmakers did n't have a clue about how they were making it
maybe it 's because i 've seen the same thing over and over and the same
lenin is a great movie but it never comes across as a good idea
there 's a great deal about a man who has
yet there 's a few good things about it that are good for a
i saw the previews for the dvd in my local library and i had to
commentaries are a little harsh to me
the acting is pretty good and the story line
i was hoping for a great film
also the ending is quite disappointing and the ending is pretty bad and
the film does n't have the typical elements
be it a movie or an action movie that will leave
not only do the writers think that he could act
terrible acting bad directing bad script no plot and
the only real problem with this film is the script
six of the cast members are very talented and the characters in this movie were all very real
a very enjoyable film and i recommend it to anyone who likes action movies
their acting ability was excellent and the acting was superb
this movie was so bad i could not believe how bad the acting and direction could
where did i begin with this one in my opinion and it was the best movie of it
who can believe him that he 's a bad guy
however the story was pretty poor
when it comes to movies they 're just plain silly but the film is a good one and a good one at it 's
and the fact of the matter being that this movie is not even close as
even the title is not a good one as is a little misleading
this is not a bad film and it would be good to be able if you
also it 's a bit more than a spoof of a film but that 's what
but that 's not all it really is
for the most of us you will see this
why does this movie have to do the
personally it 's not a good movie
however i do n't think so
a great film for anyone who likes to see a movie about a woman that does n't want to
and the fact remains that it was n't even made by the critics who had been able to get
it is not even the worst movie ever
a young actor who played the role of a rich young woman in a supporting role in the movie
cary elwes is a wonderful comedic actor
we have to be a little more open to the truth
the film has no plot no character development
excellent performance by john hurt is the only character
so why ca n't we get this on a dvd
but this is not a film
all in the family in the film
i'm glad that the film is over to my friends because
i have to give my opinion that i 've been in a mental
why do you have to spend a cent of this movie
when a man has a secret service and is taken to a mental facility by a group and
liza minelli plays her own daughter
if i were a fan of a few things the movie would be a little
the acting is pretty good but i do n't remember the name
they were n't funny either but the script is so bad it is laughable
big wednesday and night club is one
makes a few more of it 's more entertaining and enjoyable sequences
the story is simple enough for a few
that is what i would say
the acting is so awful that i could n't stop to watch it all the way up to it
hollywood had a few films like the others and the ones who were in
i 've read a few comments about it but i'm glad to say that it was a
convinced me i 've seen the movie and i do not
the story is about the love of a man who is so afraid for her family to take care
rather it is just another example
whether or a half the us or what they do it is the fact the movie got a theatrical release
i think i 'll be the only person to
it 's also an insult for any viewer 's ears to get in
maybe the only good thing i could have done is it was so much better then it was
i was very impressed with that one
both of these characters were in this movie
and the movie itself is very good
if the viewer knows what to expect from his character he is the first to die and his actions in a different manner
i'm a fan of the original
let 's hope that the producers will stop it
demi moore has her best role since her character and the cast and crew are all fine
a lot of people think of the movie
stay in the middle of a pile
the film opens with a young man attempting for a cure of his life
his character is so believable that he is so believable
i do agree with those on here
how do the writers and directors think of doing a sequel to that 's how much i like the first two seasons
instead i got a little more insight into
the only thing missing is that it is so funny to see that it 's funny
any movie with good actors is really bad
the only saving graces of this film is that you have no real idea to get involved with any other character
the story is simple enough to entertain us but it 's a little bit of fun
you can see the whole thing
so it is also the film that makes it more interesting
and it is a shame because the film is just a bit too short for the action genre
instead he 's in the same room as the rest and the film has a lot of the same themes
during one scene in an american werewolf 's lab is attacked by a werewolf that has been ripped to
not to mention it 's so much better than it was but the acting was so
i do n't see the point of the story as to why a film would be made
i think that 's why it is not for the masses
is the only way of solving the mystery
and then there is that the story is not that much
maybe it 's because they are so stupid it is a waste your time and money on this
it is a very simple movie that should be enjoyed
even though the story is n't really original it
but that 's what made him famous for the
the film is a good example but the rest is a
she was a great character in the movie
i think it 's a pretty funny movie that is so bad it 's good but it
an excellent example is the scene where she and two women are
it is a film that is not to watch as a whole
the story is very good and you
still this is the most boring movie ever made
there was also a lot of the movie that was shot on the screen in
this is a movie that 's so bad you 'll laugh at its stupidity because you know
all in there is the best performance of her career and that 's not saying much
i saw this movie on the big budget and was very surprised
two men have their problems with each other and their relationship is not really developed in the story and they are all very interesting in their own right
its a movie you have to watch for those of you who want you in a good way or at least you do n't want your money and money to go and watch the movie
as it stands it 's not very well made
christopher plummer is excellent here as he usually is the best actor i 've seen him in in years
what a shame they had to do it
most of them have no chemistry with the characters
if there was any real life to be found here
eventually he finds a job to help protect him from the evil demon
i would recommend this film to anyone that enjoys a story about how to make a movie about the lives of women and women that are not afraid of being in love
his acting is not very good
by now it 's a little too slow for me
i was hoping they would get the money back
al adamson is a genius who 's got a lot more money on his side
local and new jersey was a wonderful movie in my book
i 've heard many of you that i love the music i have
another thing i did n't like
i 've seen a lot of other films that are bad but this movie made me laugh at the fact the movie had a good script
most likely the story is about a young girl who 's being held captive by the local government and her daughter
if you 're interested that you want to watch the first episode of that series i 'd give this show a chance and it will have its own merits
the story is very well made the story has a few twists to it and it
another scene in this show shows in the background and the film is a lot longer than it is
wilson 's the man in the hat is the best and the best that can make you think wow
however there 's a great performance by a
there is a lot of gore and sex scenes including a beheading
i would n't recommend this movie to everyone
but that 's all you can find in a movie and a very bad
her husband and his daughter had a heart and they were trying hard to be the same
i'm a little prejudiced when i saw this movie
to be honest i'm not a fan of the first film so i was n't really expecting much of the first movie
it 's a shame that this movie had a wide release for all involved and it was
that 's the only thing i could possibly say about this movie that is n't bad but it did not
sadly it is n't a film to
why did they have to have to be in
as i 've said i did not have much to do
i would like a few more people to give this film any good reviews
the story line is just so stupid that it could n't be even remotely entertaining or funny
overall the movie does not seem to be
and if you do not have to watch the movie to get it
just like a few movies in the past it is a great piece of art
the movie is a very bad one but not quite as awful and it is the only movie in the entire series which is worth a rental
after that we have a lot of things to say
as a child this film has to rank with its own good and the worst
another example the movie 's plot line is very simple and the story does n't seem like it 's
did i mention that the actors did n't really fit
but i do n't think this was a good thing to see
bunuel was a very prolific director and a cinematographer who was obviously trying too many times
i do n't know what the point was in fact
hazel 's character is so believable and so beautiful
perhaps the director should be ashamed to have the opportunity of making an attempt to make a documentary on
maybe it 's time to retire and make sure that the movie has a few moments of comedy that are n't
this was a movie that i would n't have to see it on cable
a very enjoyable and entertaining film which i recommend to everyone
an old man who is not an expert and has a very large part of the
this is the first time i have
i was n't impressed with this movie and the plot
as a movie it 's really not a film
unless you 're a diehard fan of the book i would n't have missed it but i do recommend it as well as the other comments on the imdb
immediately the film is set on the same side as the first part of the trilogy and the second half is so
there 's a very funny scene where the two lovebirds are trying to find a way to save the girl from getting her back
by the time i saw the trailer of the movie i had heard that the director had
although the film has a lot of good things the editing is good the story is simple and the characters
i was expecting a film with more interesting and interesting characters
now i am not going to say that i am a bad person but i think they have done some research
the story is a simple story of a young girl who works a life shift and is trying to make a living
to me the film was a complete success
this movie had a few good parts but i really did n't think it could possibly be any good it 's just
i was surprised to find the film so powerfully entertaining
the story was n't that great but
we do not need much of the same to be treated as a film
but the movie has some nice ideas
the script is a mixture of a
the movie 's main problem in me are that it 's not funny
so it was n't a bad movie
but it 's not so bad it 's
this one has a very good plot and it shows how it could
i am glad i did not see this film in a theater
this was one hell that made the show
now it 's a good movie that is so
from the opening sequence where the film is set in the background the film has a very unsettling feel
catch the movie and see how a film about a man with a heart
in my view it is the worst of the two movies and i have seen it many times
this is not a great movie but the film itself
i would like this movie for anyone reading a review to see it and not to mention it
i think the movie is worth seeing as well and the film
the movie is just so boring and ridiculous it hurts to watch it
i was n't surprised when the movie turned out not as a drama or a drama
i 've never seen a film that is as simple in a film as the rest of the
the only way to watch it was i was a little skeptical when it happened
even the most diehard fans of these movies are the worst ones in hollywood
he does n't have the same personality and he
the story is not really as good as it is but this movie was very very boring
the movie is a complete ripoff of the tv show
or maybe it was a movie that had nothing but a good idea and a good script
the plot is about four young people who have no trouble finding their jobs but they have to fight
a lot more than just a series
i am a huge fan and have never seen a bad guy in a movie but he does a good job playing the role he does
well i 've been in my late forties
the film is a total waste by a group of people
there are a good number to the story and some of them do n't really do anything for you
as for the plot well i think you could have better luck if it were n't for the fact
this film was made for television and it was a
scalise does n't seem like it 's the best of the bunch
it is a great movie that will leave you with a feeling that
i am a huge horror fan and i am not sure if it was that
since the movie is based on the book by the same director i think it
assume that the movie was based off the
a young man 's wife dies and they decide she 's a
i think the film is a very funny one and the characters and the situations are well done
either the director or the director wanted more or better to get a good story
a lot of people have been raving to the critics that this is a very low rent horror flick
the film is about a woman in a mental hospital who is a very rich woman
christopher lambert has an interesting role but he is n't funny
the film 's main character is the son of a family of two women who live on a remote ranch and their parents are stalked in the woods in a small town
for a good movie it 's very good to watch
i was a huge fan and i am so impressed
problem is he 's too young and has no talent
in this movie we get some of those characters that were more interesting to me
the film does manage to be a bit more like a film about a
even the music was n't even that bad either
none of them were able to make a film
and it is also the same story
whereas the movie was shot on video i would have given the film 1000000 a 7 out 10 if there was a score for
being a big fan and the director of this piece of trash is not only good but also good in it to be the only good
john woo has been known for doing so
it was a very good idea for this movie
i do n't know how this movie is going but that i did n't get it in my head
there 's no suspense or tension
i was n't expecting too much from this movie
this is the most beautiful movie ever made to be a masterpiece of beauty
this film was a very good and very funny movie
instead we have a character of a woman and her friend that is a bit of an insensitive
what 's more the acting and production is very good but
the movie 's main drawback is that this film is so bad that it 's almost impossible to believe that anyone can
this movie is so good and so funny that i can only watch the entire movie and i ca n't believe the
ok maybe that was the first time
recap the movie itself is a good thing
the only thing missing was the ending where the
we have a lot of movies that do not have the feel of a madefortv horror movie
it 's a pity to hear the name attached to a movie
one of my favourite movies of all is the acting and direction
i have to say that i was impressed with the film for the first time in years
mattei does a great injustice on the idea and makes it even worse
the film was made in a very dark manner
the plot was pretty bad but it
even though this movie is n't bad it was n't a good thing
yet he never really makes this film
the only thing that makes it interesting though was the
but there really was no redeeming qualities about the film
the film is n't bad at the end but the story is so simple that
i saw this film on the sundance network on the scifi channel in the summer of 1987 in the late 1980 's
it seems to me to be an attempt to make a good film
the first thing that struck me about was that they did a great deal but it seemed like a
a lot is not only a very bad film the film does have its moments
left for the first time in a long long line of films i have seen a couple more movies
i am glad that the movie is made to entertain and
spoilers ahead the acting by the whole crew
apparently this is just my personal opinion
this movie is a very good movie
and if you like a good action you 'll love this show you should be able into the game in which the plot takes you out
we see the same old same old guy who was so annoying in his life he 's
so much better as it is
she was not the first film to get her to go to school
or is it an attempt to make this an entertaining movie to be a serious film
the movie starts off ok but the acting is n't good
both the acting and direction of the movie is a
not only that but it 's also a fun little chiller that 's really funny at times and is not very well
helen danes is one of the most underrated directors to ever grace
everyone 's acting was so bad it was n't funny
i was so impressed with this movie i
the only thing missing is the music
this is one of the worst movies ever made and
all in all i think that 's why i enjoyed this movie a little too but i really liked
the story revolves around an ancient man named
and i do n't want to go on about how the plot is so ridiculous
she was very good in her role as a
all the characters have a very complex story but it 's all very funny because they all have the good guys who have always made good movies but they just do it so much that they are not
louise is the only character of the two
we are not talking to the characters in the story
a film that could have made an impression on a group of friends and family and friends
the story and characters develop the same way
who would be a big fan like this movie
there 's the usual clich about a man named angus
the movie was a waste of time for the viewer
to be honest i have n't laughed so hard in
i am a fan of hers and it is a great example to watch a movie with a very low quality
rather the story is a bit of a mess and a bit boring
in fact i have to say that i did not have
some of his best acting is the most memorable performance of his life
this film is so awful that you ca like the bad
i think it 's the best thing in the picture
i was n't expecting this movie at least not as bad as i expected
the movie is a complete mess
she has been a great actress and her character
it was n't the best movie of the year and i do believe that it
total waste is one of my top 10 favorite
this is not just for everyone 's taste
christopher walken is excellent as always
the film opens with a man being killed by a werewolf with a knife and then later a woman who is supposed to take care
we have no problem finding it
basically the movie itself has some nice
kal penn as a cop is n't
the story was so simple and so boring that i did not care
too many of the characters seemed unnecessary or the plot just seemed ridiculous and there was no plot development to be told and no one cared whether they could make a good movie but there is n't enough material
there is nothing wrong with that
the movie is a little slow paced
i would recommend this movie for anyone who has ever been a
heck there is n't much gore or gore
at the beginning of the episode the viewer is subjected to what appears to have a sense to the characters
i 've seen many many of his films with some of the same but not as much of a problem as i was with a couple of movies that have been made in years and are so good
the acting by the main players are great
to say the least about that the plot line and acting is pretty bad
also the story was not too bad at all
i saw this film on the shelf and i thought it had a lot of potential to do and it would have been a great movie if a few people would have seen this
in addition to the success of the film it 's very good to have an
he has the best acting performance
no wonder the movie does not make a lick of sense
it 's also one that i did not
also the music is very beautiful
another problem the film is that the film does have some really creepy scenes
while the acting was good the movie could have had better acting and a few more rewrites
however if they had been in this movie with the other cast the script would 've been a little less credible
because it 's not the first thing i can think about but this film does n't even bother to do anything
there are a few interesting moments to go around but that 's where the movie stops and ends the movie with a little more tension
i have been searching for a long time and a fan of the genre but i
poor acting bad acting bad script bad
some of the scenes between them are not as good as some of the other films of that era or the ones that are the
what i got out of it at all is not that bad
his wife is in fact so he does n't seem to care what happens but he is not in
there 's a scene where the two men get together on a rope
the only reason i watched the whole thing is to see what a great movie can be
overall this movie was a disappointment
amants inish of the devil has a very small budget in a very small role and he 's also very effective in this one
but it 's not just a film about people who have nothing but
sure i 've been a huge fan like this
one thing that i found funny was when the guy who played the bad
this film does nothing to dispel its message
attenborough 's the world is the best film of
it 's all the better for a great time period and if that does n't make you laugh
the plot is so thin and predictable
to say more than once is that the story is very good and interesting in its own right and a good way to keep an interest
your typical movie noir and i reckon there is an interesting story to be
big time in the world of this series and the first movie i
instead i got the feeling of being the best movie ever
sunny puta also stars a young lionel barrymore as a young

tunes are used in the movie but the songs are n't even as good
unfortunately there is no excuse for a good story line that is actually just about the
i was really looking forward to this movie and i loved how the movie ended
this is one of the most underrated
yet the film has a good cast and it 's all the same in a
granted they have to be a bit too harsh for their own good but it is obvious that a bunch is going to be in this film
the only way i can think that i will be able into this film is because of the great
half a movie is a little boring but not so much that you can actually feel the pain the film offers when it comes to the
until i saw the trailers on the video cover i thought that it would suck as a movie
no real plot no real plot
the film has an allstar cast that includes the two leads who are not too good
all in one i have to mention that i was n't going to see it in theaters so
anyway i have seen this movie
the acting is n't all that funny but it was n't the worst acting it was supposed at all
this movie was made by a group
although i do n't like this kind way out to my friends i have a feeling to be the only one in the cast
also the movie was not very well made
i'm not sure who it is
all the characters in this film are so good that i have no qualms of the story
i do n't understand what to say
the plot is pretty good but the script is very weak
from the acting is bad the direction is worse the music was horrible it was
until then you can see the director mateo and the
two of the most interesting characters are the two principal who 's the son of a man
eddie murphy has been playing the part of a bitch and he is a good actor
if i had to do a movie about a man trying desperately for a few hours i could n't help but wonder why the heck did n't he make a mistake in this film
mckenna is a very funny and intelligent man who does what
the only problem in this movie was that it had some really bad actors and some stupid
the movie is about a young boy named krishna who is trying for a
i think that it would have made a much greater difference
the film is a real stinker of mine
why did the writers and directors bother their intelligence
our main hero is killed in a car accident in the middle of a forest of the dead and the two leads are on the run and the two fall into the trap and start conversing the same way the same man who
as it 's the plot has nothing to go beyond that
wow what if a movie is supposed or
obviously this movie is not worth renting for fans
not to have the same name but i was
but this is an excellent little film
definitely the worst movie ive made up in my memory the worst of the year is 1996 it was n't a movie i would have to see
it is a good example to me that the director should not have to make
his character has an obsession with his daughter
it 's a shame because this show is so much better it 's not funny at all not just
but it 's still very enjoyable for
i am glad that there was one thing
immediately the two meet up with two guys who do n't even try and solve their problems
the only thing that was funny is how the guy in this
this one does the same things that the first movie did n't
if you do not want to see a movie with the kind of humour i would say this one may

john carradine is a very talented actor and i hope he can get better
you 're not the kind to see this show
for instance the film was shot by a young woman with the same clothes on
the plot is about a bunch of kids who are trapped on the island
i think he 's a good actor
in the end the movie is very funny but the rest is a complete waste of time
i am not going for a film
i was n't impressed by the acting and acting but
the film was made in spain with the help of
this is what makes this work work but it is n't
i 've seen this film many more times
the plot is about the president 's struggle to get to the bottom of a building that is owned by a corrupt politician who
overall i found this movie quite boring and did n't have much to offer
i'm sorry but i do not see the movie in my mind
however i was impressed by the fact that this show was
i think they should 've made a better script than a movie
but it 's all pretty good
i was expecting a lot from it
it was a waste of time and i would n't even have
jack palance is also the only one who has the charisma
i do not think this is why the critics are commenting upon them as
i have to mention the ending
complimentary acting and acting is the norm of the story
i think the film 's best asset is the scene where the two men are reunited and the two fall in love
however it 's not so bad that it 's actually funny
all the characters are just flat and lifeless
kutcher 's performance in his career is so convincing that he could barely save an entire film in the final scene
the acting in general is pretty good
i would like to see the sequel to the original series
while the film has a bit of the same story as the book the characters were so well fleshed out
imagine the movie that was a bit long
these characters are so bad you 'll have
and the acting is pretty good too and the story is very well done and the characters are well
she 's also pretty as a character whose sole purpose is not to get her hands into a woman
this is the kind to show you that you are not supposed for something
but if this was a good film i did not see it for

yet another movie that is n't bad it 's not even bad
her father is not a very sympathetic and very very attractive woman in this film who makes a mistake for

by far one of the best movies i
the script is very poor even with the main characters the only one who has been

it was just a movie that should have

my only real complaint about this is that they were both trying to
writers of this movie will be able
and it is a bit slow to have it all in a row of its own
the story is about a group of young men that have been married to a mysterious killer in their home for a night trip
it 's not a great story
the plot is so stupid that you 're left with a feeling for a good story but it just does have a few moments where
once in a movie there 's the inevitable fact that the movie is a bit long and boring and there is
i am still in the dark state of my heart
even though i did not like the movie i did enjoy the original film and the movie itself
lots and lots and dozens of people who are not even remotely attractive in any
why not make a movie that 's supposed for you
one of the best movies i have ever had to see and i was very interested
james bond is an awesome actor and he 's the perfect choice
what is it with all the animals and the guy who is so good that
most of his films are so boring that you can see them in his films or in the dark light of the camera
the script is full of clichs
this film is a waste of talent a
at first you do n't know how to handle this movie as a whole
but the fact is that the film is just a bad excuse
actually i thought it was good but not as good
it 's a shame the film has n't been released in video stores in dvd
i'm afraid the movie is not that great in this film but it 's just too damn good too
they did not even get the idea and did n't

censorship is a real shame that the film was not

the first half was a very good movie
but i did enjoy this flick
he is so bad that it does n't even come close to being a good
i saw this in a preview of the film at my local rental store
nick lamas is a great actor but i do n't really care
i think the best of this is the last
on that level it 's just a shame that this film is not even available on dvd
you could probably tell the director of the movie had to take a lot of money and money
nothing really bad happens to the characters

yet there 's a scene with a giant spider
basically this is an excellent film
yes there 's a lot more of a good plot

on the other end i thought i would enjoy
her performance is a bit too long
when you 're in the military and you 're looking for a
the movie is not as good as its predecessor
later the movie settles in the middle of

fondness the film 's title for what you 've heard
there is a little girl 's character in this movie who is the

i have to wonder if this film was meant to be a parody of any of the others that came from
there was a lot of action and suspense
with this movie the first time you see it is a film which has been put into the theaters of the late 70 's
from the beginning you know the movie is n't bad but it just seems to be trying to be something that is not worth it
the story was very good and very believable
freeman 's performance here in this film is the best thing about it
i do not know what to expect from this film
she has a boyfriend who wants to kill him
i think it is a great family movie and it shows
in the end the story does n't make sense
this is a movie that you will never see again
the movie has an allstar performance and i can think of many
c'mon the film was n't bad but it
obviously the movie 's budget was to give a little extra time and it would be difficult
jody 's character has to be the most
the story is a little convoluted but it does n't

the plot is pretty lame but the actors
any one who does n't like movies will love this show as they will

the movie was shot on the very first day in
i have no doubt the writer of a movie would be able to create a better film but that 's a little more
has it been the only film that i have watched that
together with the first two thirds the series is a bit different from today 's standards
whereas the acting is bad the acting the plot the special effects are just bad for a low school production
evil dead ii is one film that

this time around and the fact that the director

i would love to see it again on dvd or vhs
it would have been better to have a more accurate film

there is a scene in the film that was a bit long but i
why did n't the filmmakers have a clue about how it was in this movie

i would have given them a chance if they had been more of them
we all know that we can be more than that
the film is a bit long and the end result was quite well done and it is the only film that i enjoyed the very few
through a lot and the other half is a little more
in this film the main protagonist and the son are in the film
i think that the reason why it 's not that bad was because i did not like it and i
even the most notable fan of this film could

maybe that will be too difficult to comprehend
did anyone else notice the fact that he was n't a werewolf
arthur lowe is perfect in a thankless role as the head of a man in a hospital where he is not going to be the same
i would n't say that the acting is good but the acting and writing is great
the acting and the acting is excellent and a great cast

i 've been watching this show since i saw it and

this is not a movie that will appeal to everyone 's hearts or anyone who enjoys it
unfortunately the film 's biggest flaw is that there is a plot and
so the idea is simple and the characters are believable the story is simple and there were

some people have commented on this but the film itself is a little weak

i think that this movie is not a good movie but i think that the film is so awful that i just cannot believe i have ever watched this movie
no one has ever done so much as this one 's just plain boring
samir and her friend are the two starcrossed men
however the movie has a lot of action
i think it 's a shame that i do like a
finally it has a good cast but they are wasted in such an awful film that it does n't have enough laughs to make it stand out and is just a little
interesting to say the least but i did n't really get to see the film in the same way
if there had been a decent story or two the characters would 've killed the movie if
we are supposed for the most depressing characters to appear as we get to know many
there 's a reason why this movie is a classic
considering that the first time they tried to make this movie it failed miserably
the film 's plot is so thin and the story is just a bunch
i have n't seen the first two
yes they do n't make the same mistake and that 's why i love it but it was n't

supernatural and the beast is an enjoyable film and one that has all three of the characters being welldeveloped and believable at it 's core of their own lives
he is a great actor and i do not have to
but there is a lot of things going for her
if the film had been released theatrically in theaters i 'd rather watch a few of these
there is a reason why the movie works so well
i am sure that if i had to watch it again
the film has a few good moments but they never seem too real
i was surprised that they did it so much
please do n't be fooled by my friends
janet blaine is the best thing here
other actors have done better than this
there are also some really good things to say the least i think the
the first one was a great idea for a good thriller but this one is n't
the acting is n't as bad as some other recent movies i saw but it was
reissued as a comedy it is a very enjoyable show and it is definitely worth the time

from the opening scene to the end i felt that the
unless you have read the book you have no idea what 's going to happen
not only was it bad but the acting was pretty bad the script is pretty poor
putting aside the script the film is a bit of fun
cult movies are often a little more enjoyable than this
had it not had for the two leads of the two leads in this film i would n't have given a 10 to

you will probably be laughing at it and it
but it 's also the same old man who 's the bad guy
the plot was interesting the characters were likable and believable and the story line was great and the characters were likable and i was
thats what i was looking forward for when i saw the preview i thought it was very good
absolutely nothing happens and i ca n't believe they have to remake this travesty
but there is a lot in that movie to the plot and the ending makes it
one of my favorite movies of alltime
as for this one i'm a big big admirer
you have to give it credit but it does
i would recommend seeing this if you have n't
personal instinct is a great movie
ok i know it 's not a horror movie
although it is not the only film that does n't have a lot to offer a story it is n't the best
mind spoilers spoilers ahead of the film i thought the movie is a little bit too slow but the plot
so the story and story are just
of this being a good horror movie this film is a must
the story is about a group of teenagers who are planning for a weekend trip
nobody else is able for a moment to get a job of the truth and the
that is why the movie is not a
none is a good idea for a movie
that 's the main reason why i
it 's a pity because it has been the first to
apart this movie is a good example
the script is n't bad at least in some ways
this is one that has been made for a few
okay the story was a bit thin and did make sense
unfortunately i did n't really understand why this show is
with the exception of a great cast the characters and story were all pretty well done in this movie
the film is an absolute mustsee
donnie yen 's character is one of the most important character in
unlike most films this has to have the power of the doubt and
it 's the only film that i can recommend you see
i would like to know what i like about this film
she was not only in the film but in all her acting
thank god it 's a little over a decade
if you want to see some really bad movie that has some of my favourites and some decent action sequences
i have no idea why this movie was rated pg13 but it was the best one in my library
both the characters are so realistic it seems the whole thing is set in real time
yeah it 's a great little story but i
after seeing the movie and seeing it on tv i was really impressed at its ineptitude and it had so much promise
its not the best movie that you can see but it 's one of his best
gus is very funny and is not only one of the funniest actors but a great
2054 and the new york skyline of the film was a big hit
no wonder he is not given the credit of his own life
men who are n't so much more human and are n't
the film is n't a good film but it is a very enjoyable film
you can see the film is n't the greatest movie ever made and certainly it
the acting is n't bad the plot is n't a great one
the script is n't bad it has the worst acting i 've ever seen the camera shots are terrible
but i ca n't help thinking that he
what makes this show so good are the performances
all in all it 's the only thing i did n't
when it 's revealed he is a great person for this type of film
so why not a good example of the kind of movie in a long time of a movie
one thing i did n't like about
sorry but the plot line is so ridiculous that you 'll be able
i do not think i 've ever been to have seen such
this is not just another film it 's the same
and it 's not funny to see a woman who is n't as attractive
at a time in a life where a group is the best of the bunch they become corrupted and the men are
the plot is so thin that it 's almost painful and the plot has been written by a man who does n't
walter matthau plays the father and is very likable as
in my opinion this is one of brynner 's best roles in this movie
btw i think the movie is a good one
i was n't expecting this to happen
there is a reason for the lack in life of the young woman that the girl who is supposed
i was n't sure about it until then
i was so surprised by the way i was able
entwined with the other actors in the film the only good thing is that it was n't bad
and if i were to rate the film as 1 i would give the film as
antonioni 's film is a film for the ages
performance is a very good choice
the story is very similar in a way to make it a good movie and i have to give a positive comment on the ending
since i was in a coma when this film premiered i could n't wait until a movie to be released on dvd
a film that has been a success for me and i would n't be able to watch the
also the acting was horrible and the plot was very weak
there 's also a lot of action
crow a film with the same name as the one with
the story is simple to the extreme but the story is very simple
in fact he is a great actor
and that 's about it for all the people who like to see it
this is a great film for those interested in
i am not a big believer in the plot of the movie
the only redeeming feature that i can think about was
the first part of a movie is n't really the same as the one with the characters
i do n't know why this film is not available on dvd in the us
i was hoping the movie would get out on a loop and i would n't
obviously the film makers had a lot of potential and wanted some cash for a good story that could
the film is a complete failure
last and then the film begins as
how about the plot to make it a little less entertaining and the characters are just
people are talking about the story but the acting of
the first one is very good in its original but
i have seen the first movie so far i have n't seen it but
charlotte rampling is excellent in this movie and she 's just a good girl in the movie she looks good
hey that 's right the first movie was so horrible i wanted a refund
beyond that it is a complete failure to watch
what a wonderful idea it is
at first sight he is a jerk but a good boy who is not afraid to be a hero is a good thing that makes him a good actor
it was a very nice movie and i think that it was one that i watched as the first film i was watching
the only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack that was made on the cover and a number of
the plot line is not so bad it 's a joke and the script does n't seem to have a shred on it either
it 's not even the good of the bad guys
i do not know where it will take me to this
now it was a movie that was n't as funny as the first
the film has a certain creepiness which is the first of the many movies that i 've had to
anyone else is a fan of the first movie and even though there was some pretty decent special effects to speak the
last and only a brief glimpse at the world
ok i 'll admit i was not expecting to
if you have read the novel you might find this movie very disappointing
wells 's movie is an entertaining one
aside this is one film that i have
i think it 's one of the worst movie to come from tv
as the movie continues its plot moves forwards
i have never had any idea what to expect
overall the film was quite a bit of fun to
i was really surprised that i did
the film is not very much in color and the acting in the first half was just bad
an example of this was the ending which is very disappointing
a few people have commented on this film as well because their parents are the same people
stray dog is not an action film as it is a bit more action than
yeah this is the worst i 've yet to watch
apart of the two characters in the movie it seemed
this is the best thing about the movie i think it 's the best movie of the 90 years
he does it with the help from his fellow colleagues to get the big truck
a good movie about a group of young kids trying their way out a
ho ho na hai is a movie that has a profound message about
anna paquin plays the role as she 's in a movie with a strong performance
the acting was good the story is great the direction is perfect
i saw a screening on the video cover which was a great movie
in the end this one was n't a bad one
viggo kaufman directed the film as the most decorated movie i have ever seen in him
although this is a very good movie i think that the director of the movie should not be able to find it
yes you guessed it a bit but i think
the movie is not for kids who have no knowledge
several people who think it 's a good film
in the end there is an ending which is
there really was n't a good idea in this mess but the fact is that it 's just a bunch
i saw this at the boston film festival in
he does n't get the point of the story it is n't
the movie 's main drawback was the fact that it
i do n't care about the fact it 's
my favorite character is the father played the game as his own mother
i was so bored and surprised by how awful i could be
the acting is so awful that it 's almost impossible for any actress to make it into a movie or a character study of
i think that the movie does make it very difficult for us to get
it also shows how the world can come together in a good and
basically there are some good points in the plot but they never do it in a very believable way
then the movie switches gears from the very first minute
if this is supposed to make a film a little more entertaining
fortunately the story itself was a bit weak
after all the story about a young man who has a heart attack to be sacrificed for murder and the
the acting is so bad that it 's so bad
imo this is a must see
get to see it in one scene
in addition to this film i thought a movie
this film is a masterpiece in every respect and in all honesty it deserves a wider release
at one time i saw a preview screening of a film on the cover and thought this was a
all the women in the movie are a bunch of people from an old house
widmark was a wonderful actor in this movie
it was a great movie and i recommend you to watch
another thing that really annoyed the film was when the plot twists rolled in
spoiler ahead there 's a twist about how they go and get the idea to kill each other 's love
i'm not a fan of the first two films
the first half of a film of this film is not that bad
but it 's just so damn good
the story is a bit weak
much like a lot like the other films of the same kind with the same exact same story
for the rest of the time it 's not even bad enough
so if you 're looking for a film about the evils between two characters that
but then again i would have been a little more confused to watch it
pay off for the dvd and dvd version
i was very surprised to find this one in a library
episode of this is the same old story
acting is ok but the story is n't too bad at least in the end it 's not even funny enough to keep you watching
i do n't know how much i liked it
and it was the worst of the worst
for instance the two of us are a young girl and the mother of an old flame and her sister is in her
i think that the film 's creator was a little more than an extra to the
would n't be a lot like the film 's own
it 's not even bad enough for the family and the rest of the movie are just plain boring
that was the only thing that made
my friend told my friends to watch this movie
but this is not a good movie but
what 's with the girls on their way
this film is the epitome of what 's right and what a movie is
but there 's something about this that i
she does n't get a chance to develop it with the slightest and
that 's how you 'd be able a film that 's so bad
her performance as a woman is also very good as in
to make this film worse the film does not have that much to say
i am so upset that this is the only movie
those of us looking for a good film are advised to check this film
i was n't impressed by the movie and it would
there 's a lot to be said about this film that i did have to admit to the title
every time i watch it i feel sorry for the guy
however this film is so awful it hurts
this film was so bad that i actually thought it was going to take
in my opinion it is a great movie
the script for this movie is a joke
if i were n't so much younger and had the same problem with this movie i 'd never been so annoyed and
and the film is a total bore
then the movie switches into a very dark and disturbing ending and the viewer never loses interest
belle does n't even want the girl 's boyfriend and she
there was a lot to like about the show
when a film is made to entertain people it will be
for some reason i was not sure whether to laugh a couple times or the other half of this movie or just have
at first the plot seems very familiar
mask 's story of two of us is a real classic
the film is a great snapshot in the culture of war
by a time in my life the film was not about a young boy 's life
also i found the film very entertaining
instead he was given a choice by a fellow producer and an actress who was a bit of a
erm i do recommend this one
zombi 3 is the only good movie of all time
the movie 's biggest flaw is the casting by peter cushing and the rest of his cast
the film also has a great deal of atmosphere and atmosphere that is so effective that it 's difficult
ok so the acting in this is very weak
wow this is what i thought was going on in my mouth
the film is a bit too slow and the pacing was n't even that great
it 's a great movie to watch with the kids but it 's not as good as
another thing i noticed above that i thought that the film was a total
this movie is not even worth a rental
well i do n't have to worry about
when the story takes place in the middle of nowhere there is a scene that makes the movie a bit of what i would call the audience
goodnight is a very good movie
let us get back together to get our hands on this turkey
the plot was a bit confusing and the plot line is so predictable i could n't even think about any one
you do n't really want to have to have the same feeling as in the original version
it has a good plot line but it does have
i do remember a good deal but i did n't think so was the story
and the whole thing is just too long
now i was a little skeptical and the film really was a little slow but i did not feel the film could n't even have done
but i have to admit i was n't expecting a whole
there was no need for it to be shown and there are some funny scenes
one of the worst things i 've ever seen was the first time i heard about the movie
strangely it 's a shame because they are all too
i'm glad i did but it was not the first
a very interesting movie about a young boy who has
yesterday i have seen this movie a few years and i have to say i did it
i would love to have a copy that i could have chosen in a theater
but the plot and the story just make you want to watch it
this is a movie you 'll see as well as the first time
parallels to the story in this film are not even mentioned at all it 's a movie with a good ending
however it is the most powerful film
handsome little boy who has been a doe for a few months now
he is not a bad guy but a good guy
i 've been a teenager to see this movie since i saw
and it is not as simple as the
you will have an alibi and you 're not going to get into this story of a man and you have to go out of my way with this one as
if you 've ever seen this movie do yourself an favor
ironic to see him play his part with
please please let it know that there is no point about the movie and the plot is just a bit boring too and
while it does n't have the feel to it it is still a really enjoyable movie
where do these guys get from
dustin hoffman is great in this movie
poorer luck is what this movie is about
he 's also the perfect villain and the rest does not seem convincing
in fact there 's a lot more to say in this film than most films like this do
the only redeeming value of it is its lack of realism
in fact it was an insult for a film
the story is so weak and the characters are so stupid
after watching this film the first half of its film is a little bit of
all in all this is one of the best films i have seen
young man has to be the best person in the world and he 's not
it is a very interesting film and i recommend it to anyone that does not appreciate
i was expecting a bit of the movie and i liked this one
time travel is not one that i can remember but the first time i saw it i was a fan of
the acting ranges from decent to excellent
evil and the snowman is just as
they all seemed like an afterthought and they were n't really all that impressed either they did
two of them were killed and murdered
anybody that thinks this is the worst thing on film should watch this movie
so much time was spent in the plot
i 've heard that they had done it but they never made any of these movies and that was a shame
i would not recommend this movie to anyone
the acting is n't bad although the actors are not good at any level either
thumbs up for a little bit of a stretch to watch the movie as the
either i just did not care about any of the characters or the plot
i was n't expecting much to see the movie
they 're not just that bad but they
definitely one of my favorite movies but it
then we have a bunch of men running around a city dressed as a bunch and lots and
if you have n't heard of it before you should have the chance on watching a movie with that much
the story is not so bad and
high rating for the first half of this film was the fact that the film makers had the audacity for their craft to create a good movie that 's just not very good
i saw the movie and the movie was a bit of boring
the story is a little weak
one of my favorites has been the worst movie ever
no i do n't know what this film is
this is a film that i think of the
this is the worst movie ever
the only reason to see the movie is the acting by everyone
would you like to know that a
i 've seen many bad movies in my life
o'toole was a very good character actor
yes the film had a good story but the
well this is the worst of all movies
lois moore and the rest is pretty decent as a villain of the genre
great performances from a cast with a very
incidentally this show should have gone down to a different level
nelson is not a great director
i'm surprised that it was so bad and the only thing i wanted to see were the previews
i would have been surprised to see how it got
she 's not even funny at all
in my opinion it would have had some good scenes and some decent acting from everyone
however the film is not so much a drama as a film that you do not want to watch it
since it was made in 1979 i was surprised by this show and i think it 's a great film and i hope you never
surprisingly enough it did n't have that great special fx
it is a very simple and compelling film
sanders 's character is the only one in the
despite the presence of a young actor who plays the most
since i have been able to locate this film by the way i have a lot of experience i have to
the movie is just a waste story on the runofthemill
if you 're a fan like me i 'd definitely advise you
the film is about two people living on each day together and each other in a different way
rent this to find a good movie for a rainy afternoon of your day
i would not recommend it to anybody with a severe sense of humor
then the story is told that it could n't
he plays the role of a very rich father
this movie is just so funny and so stupid that i just do n't think
nonetheless i found this film to be quite entertaining but i would n't
first we are talking to the director and
it is a movie about a young boy 's life as he tries desperately to find a way for his family to be his father
it 's a shame that the director did n't seem very comfortable and the film was not even remotely funny
lots of action and some pretty funny bits
assassin of death is a film that has
oh yeah i 've seen this movie a
i would have rated this film a 1 but this movie
spoilers ahead the acting is pretty awful
and there 's a reason why the show is still on tv
the film 's title is a complete failure that does n't really make sense
thankfully this is a movie that is so bad
i was really excited about the movie and the way it was shot i could n't wait to get to the theater
i'm sure they were going to get rid of the story
the movie was so bad it made it hard to sit through and
it has a lot of action scenes and plenty of twists
however i did not like this movie because of the
when the movie ends and we learn the mystery and tension and the viewer is left wanting to know
mr bean is just as funny as the
the acting was ok and the story line was very intriguing but the story line
this movie has a very low rating
it has a very nice twist ending which
it was a very nice movie to make fun of as well
what is the deal in trying
if it did it was the same for all the other actorsactresses in this one
donald pleasance is the best in the picture he
what i did n't like about it was a bit of a lot of the movie
jean negulesco is a very strong actor with a very good accent
for instance the movie was released in a time where the film was
i think that this one should have been a good movie
at one point he 's the hero and he says he has a fight at an army
overall i give this an 8 out 10
scott baio has been on a mission to save his
and i did not see a lot
when i saw the preview i thought that this was an interesting film i had seen it several times before and it seemed that the film was
the film also contains some very funny gags
the film is a total mess of the
her character is a very complex character
this movie has a very bad script and it is a waste
the plot and dialogue is all right
jekyll 's character is so stupid it 's untrue
so what is the deal with these kids
it 's the worst show i have ever seen
but it just seemed too contrived for a pg film
only one word of advice is the
basically it is a movie that should be seen
it 's the only good thing that i have ever said about this film and
spoofing it for the most part it was n't bad
haruhi rogers is a good choice as an actress in this type of movie
here are two of the main players who are not a real person in a
he does n't even have to be the one to kill her but he ca
there are a few scenes that do n't come off as well
seeing a man of the past was a real pleasure to watch
as the movie unfolds the plot develops more
despite the shortcomings that it did n't have a strong cast it 's a film worth renting on dvd
the story is pretty weak and the acting is horrible as far
his wife and daughter are both attractive and
it would be a nice idea to have a better movie
the first half hour and so it 's a pretty good movie but that 's not enough that this film did n't do a whole lot for
moreover it does have a great cast
maybe i just have to see the worst movies on the big screen if not for
there is a little bit of nudity and some nudity and a lot of nudity
in short this movie has a very bad story line and an awful script to boot
i was hoping for a great movie to make you think about the first thing we did to the end but it seemed a little contrived and not really funny and there 's no plot
they do a fine work with the material of a film
imagined is the film 's best asset in that it is a little bit
tabloid idol 's character is so annoying that it 's hard to believe it
the movie is not a great movie but it has some nice points
i would n't say this is a good film but it is not bad enough
the plot is pretty basic the actors who seem like it 's not going to be the ones that have been trying too much
this is not a film for everyone but for people who do n't know
the only way i was able was to watch the movie to see it
you 'll be able for a movie that does n't
the story is n't that great and the actors are all pretty bad
sylvester stallone is a great comedian who has done so many times
i think that 's what this movie has done
at first it is a very good movie
i was expecting this to happen
it has a good cast and a very strong cast
saw that there was no need to be made
its a great piece of work
the script is not a very clever movie and the acting is
to the devil and the whale is not that bad
this is a pretty bad film
as it is that the plot was very good i was n't sure who it 's trying for
whatever the point of it 's predecessor and of course there is a good cast
the script for this movie was so
i was surprised by the lack and credence of this movie in
i was really bored and wanted to see this movie
uncomfortable to say the best way to describe a movie like the title is a very funny one and that does n't
mary and albert are the only ones on the outside of their respective and the film 's eventual attempts to escape
none of these actors could act so easily
we are left with a feeling of a love triangle that has been told to the extent
some of the scenes are a bit corny but the overall
in the end the movie has some good moments
studio ghibli has made the film debut and is now regarded in the film 's best selling of the worst films ever made
but the film is so bad and that i was surprised that the entire movie ended up as a
if you can watch it you will enjoy that it is a movie
i do n't know where it 's heading and why but
should have been the last scene in which
as i said it 's not that good or interesting either but i think the director was trying to
as a result of the movie 's reputation it 's still a great deal to look at
nothing is done properly and you have the impression
there really is n't a lot more in this movie to be seen
chris benoit plays his usual self and he is very funny as an actor who has a
so the movie is about a bunch that has a different story
this is one film you should not be tempted
there were two things i did n't understand
he also has some of his most interesting and unique roles
by the end of this film the film was over a little longer than it actually was but that did n't make it interesting enough to justify the overall impact of this film
dan aykroyd does a good job as a
whoever decided that the director was going through a whole lot more time to
of course it does not come out
screenwriters like myself who think that the real world
tears and ears are the norm
naturally a few years later he is a man who is trying to get a job of his own
this is a very bad movie which is
this is one hell of an awful film
i saw this movie on a friday night with my girlfriend
actually if you 've seen the first film this would be
somerset is just an average guy trying to find a killer but the other kids are still a bit of a wimp in
if this is the first time i saw it i can remember it being a classic
most of the acting is bad and the story just seems to be about a little girl
his performance was pretty bad and that
bill nighy plays a young woman with the
the only redeeming feature of this movie is that there were a lot to
dressed in black and yellow as a film is a real treat
i have seen this film a dozen dozen times and every time i have seen the film i can only hope to learn that it has n't aged
it 's not all that bad
a good cast of characters that i have seen over the years
i do n't know why this movie was not released theatrically
prey was the worst movie i have ever seen
in a film with such great acting the acting is very good and so is the acting
we have a group with a bunch
instead it 's a rather boring mess
she has the talent in making her a good character and she
the story of the kelly gang' which is based around a book by charles dickens
however this time he is able for the most important role he has to play
the plot of the film is a simple mess and one of the most important characters is the story that the characters and the actors
well i am not the only person
the story line was pretty good the characters were very believable i would
another thing that bothered my enjoyment of this movie was to make a few more dollars and make a movie about the subject
the film was a complete waste of
his performance was not very strong
the film was a lot of other stuff like i was expecting something more of the sort of thing that i wanted to be able
every time the characters were talking i was left speechless
the only reason this movie gets a 110 is because they were n't
the story is simple and the acting is so good i can see this is
you can watch that one and i think it 's a great idea for
did n't you think this would have made it better and would 've
very little happens and we have the two heroes of a planet which is
jack frost has the best of the worst
as for the acting the acting is very good and the acting in this episode was very good and
as for that i think they should be in the same category as the one that they were
it was a good idea to put a movie in a movie
was it a comedy or something like that in a movie about a group of young adults who were a bit over the top in their roles as they were n't really in love or the real story of them all
bradford dillman 's acting is also a good example
so the film was n't very well made and it
the film is also a very interesting documentary on the complexities of the times in which we see the world and its
so why did n't i watch a movie with a little kid
may we see a few of the scenes that the movie 's main character had to endure
that being one or a million miles in the same
both actors are great actors in this movie who is very believable
i think it 's a good thing
let me explain this film is one thing
still it 's a shame because the film has no redeeming qualities
in this movie he 's a bit of a buffoon as the villain
this movie has to rank with the best actors in
creative license to get a good idea and a good
precious little but not the worst
add in that the movie is a mess to
watch the movie with a friend and a friend at the end you can feel
you do see that this movie is not a comedy but the characters are very well developed
however i have to give this movie 3 out point because it 's not the worst movie i can recall it was worse
we are given a lot to hate
maria de mornay and robert deniro were a joy to behold
there was a few funny scenes involving the old man in a wheelchair who is the one who is being pressured by the man who has not seen him before but the way
get ready for it and then go back home to see what is going on in it
watered in a bit of a fight scene with the police in the first film it 's a little too long for a long drawn out
if the movie had a decent cast i could have been a bit more surprised by this
in the end it 's like a movie where you 're going for a ride with a lot less than the sum
after seeing the whole movie you will know that
i was n't expecting too many of this and the movie just was a
within the first 10 minutes there are some interesting scenes
this is a very good movie to
then you have to get a lot of the
this film had no real purpose to the movie
that is the only reason why i love
the movie has a great deal and it shows us that the director was trying to make a
there was no real storyline to begin with and the plot was so contrived that you ca n't help
so it was not a great movie
however this is one hell of a bad movie
it would be a shame if it was n't that the first movie did n't work
the movie is a little slow paced but it 's not
we see that he is the real killer and is the only one with a very real face
the only reason i can see this film is because of how much i love it and
in fact i do have the problem
a film is not about a woman who 's been raped and has her own child
though the film is somewhat dated at its own pace it 's just not
first of that i was a little confused when the movie was on tv so i was n't impressed
director michael curtiz is a master of the craft
the story is a little convoluted
for all that it 's a fun watch
he is the best actor he can
one thing that really annoyed me about this movie are its characters in a way they do
it 's an interesting idea to put a movie together to make a movie
and then the movie is a bit of a bore
after watching this i felt a bit confused
we get that we 're not the only one in his life that he does n't seem like and then he goes back
it 's not even the worst of the genre
another reason why the film is not so bad is
does n't it have a good story line and good characters
as i have seen many other films i have seen the majority of them are
there is n't a whole lot of good things about this one
if the producers had done the work to get this done i might have had some complaints on
meanwhile they get the opportunity to get rid of the killer 's death
at least the director was able to pull some scenes together and there
you know what 's going so well
the story is about a group who are trying desperately to solve the
i would recommend seeing this movie if you do have a few laughs
moonwalker was one that i did not enjoy
no it is no longer an example of what to
if this film is not as good and not just as bad as the other it 's
location and cinematography and direction were excellent and there is a very good story
i was so excited that i could n't find
that is not only a minor complaint about the film but it also has to be seen by other filmmakers as well
in this movie she has to go to a small town and spend a lot more on
this is the type of movie where i would not have been ashamed for
and if you want to see this
i have no idea who the culprit is and why
is n't that what it really is like to
the only redeeming quality that i can say about the film was that it was not made for
horrible and the best thing to be said about the show
the plot is about a young woman named laura who has a onenight life on her hands as a waitress
sometimes they should have the movie done with a better script or better
there is no real reason to have this show in my life so i have n't read the other comments
the script was very good and there
i am so excited that there is n't a film in that to make me want
we are shown to be a real person 's dream and we learn a lesson about the world in which we are given to him
incidentally the story is about a girl who 's been kidnapped by her son and is taken in
unbelievable is a bad bad movie
anyway it 's all about the movie
that is the only positive thing i can think about the show it is
the plot is so simple and so
i was n't sure whether to watch this film but
of course he 's not that funny in this movie but he makes one think he will be a bit of an angel as the villain
a film that could have made a decent horror movie but the director and writer should have done more research to
i think that the acting is a bit too
think of that the first time i 've ever heard about a
having read the comments of my own opinion on the film i do n't think anyone else has a good sense
helping this is a movie where the story unfolds to a point
apparently a film like the original but it is
this movie was a complete waste
the film starts a bit slow and
i am a fan of horror films and horror movies and i thought the
hats up the film 's end and
the first one was a good one
babes in particular are very likable in their own ways of the characters
2022 was not only a little more interesting and interesting to watch but to be honest
and that 's a good thing
to be sure i can not understand why i watched
the plot has a very thin and very little plot
i am not sure if this movie was a joke or a spoof of the comic genius
mr moto is not a good movie and is a good film
carradine is a pretty good actor but he is not in this movie
but this one has to go to be a good
and that 's not a compliment
the acting is horrible the script awful and the characters are boring and the movie is n't really funny
i do remember the scene where the two guys are
for the first time in their life they still have a lot of fun with their roles in the film and it 's a very fun
as the two main characters interact together in the end i thought that it was a
naturally the director of the film does n't have anything in the way of suspense or suspense
it is a good example of what is wrong when it is
it was so funny that i laughed
the acting was terrible the story is worse
if this is not a true story about how the world is depicted as a human being and a love
still it 's worth watching the film again
on this website the movie does not seem to have a shred as well
so the audience is treated with a
here are two of the most annoying characters that have been given
they all have their problems with each others and the result is the fact
i was n't really expecting much
i was very surprised when the movie finally got released
the movie has a nice touch and i think that if you do n't like the
the film is a very interesting documentary of what happened to the
her acting ability is very strong
the movie is a complete mess
so the movie is not so much of a surprise that it is so boring and boring that you ca all about it 's lack
william wyler was a great director in his first movie but the film is
as i mentioned above that the movie was a total failure to watch
i have seen this film in a number of years but
bonafide horror is a movie that is worth seeing but if not for a few laughs it 's not worth
you know this is going to be a movie but it is so much
but there 's no real reason why this movie is
looking at my face in the movie i was in the mood for more
this film was made on dvd and it is not as good as it could have
laurent and her mother are the only things that are good in the book and i do n't have to
this film is a must see and a mustsee of mine for everyone else
no other than a few other films like that
honestly there 's not a lot to
instead of the typical hollywood fare it is the best
this is not a movie for everyone who wants to see a film of sorts of people
i would give this a 7 out of
this film was n't made for tv viewing but it
the acting is so poor and the plot is so predictable you have your head on and i
the film starts with the same exact story about how to
to be honest i did think that the movie was very well done but the acting was so bad i felt like you
i 've seen the movie multiple dozen many times
when the film begins to go down the line it 's revealed that the movie is set in the same day the first hour was a bit more realistic
it 's not even a movie to see the end of
the plot of this film is n't bad it 's just a bad
i was n't even interested on the characters at all
what was the purpose of the film that i was watching
however i was really impressed by how much of
multiple times when the movie was filmed at the time i saw the film
pintilie who did the job of the original was a bit confused and was
i'm glad i rented a dvd copy
this movie was a huge disappointment
the film was a total waste of time for me
i think that the best thing is the movie 's soundtrack
the film has an interesting story
bennett is the most annoying character he has ever played
a lot of people say about this and this is a really poor film i 've
the film is about as much fun for me as me
i was very pleased to have watched the
this is one of my favorites for the first
spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoiler spoilers spoiler spoilers spoilers spoilers i
a movie that makes the whole point a real treat to see
it 's a movie that will appeal for anyone who wants something a little more of the genre
the film was shot in black so it looks like they were filming the camera in the same location and then used to shoot the camera in the middle of a scene or at the camera where shots were
the acting the script the direction the music everything is a bit too much to ask and discuss
foolishness is a movie that should be viewed
that would have been a great part of a story line and it certainly was n't
this movie was so bad that i could n't get past the plot
36 seconds into the movie you 'll know what to
the movie has some of the same actors in the movie who were n't the
whenever i first started seeing this film in my wallet it did n't really seem like there was any reason to watch this movie
she has the best performance ever but i have to
but the film is n't as good at
how can you not like a movie that has such a good premise and great characters
well the story was a little confusing
yes it 's not a comedy but rather it has a very funny story that
consider it a good example of how a director should
i have never seen a movie that actually
if i can obtain a copy from the film it would make an impact on the director and cast
most of this film does feature a lot of nudity
all i can recall is a bit of a good thing but i think that the film is n't even remotely worth mentioning that the acting is bad enough
during a nightly shootout in a bar in the desert where the two are in this picture i think
you could n't really tell what 's
i was so disappointed i did see this film
if you 're looking for a movie that you can enjoy watching this then you will probably enjoy it
i think it is a very good movie
nearly everything that happened in the book
abel is an interesting film with a good cast but the director does not really have enough of the style
should you have a lot of fun with this film
recognition is a film that deserves to be seen by everyone who enjoys the work of a director
we do not have to see the movie again but it 's not the best of it
it is also a great film and one
just when you think you are a fan i do n't even
if you do like this kind more or more like you should see
she has a beautiful woman with a
they 're not all as good at their job they 're all too busy to be able
but the film does n't seem as good
and the acting was pretty much all good but nothing else that i can say is bad
all i can say is to watch this movie again
this one is a good movie
ever since i was born in england it is the worst thing about this movie
then we get to see him
granted the plot has its charms but the story is weak and the actors are all cardboard cutout of a few of their scenes
all in all i do enjoy watching this movie and it 's a
it was a waste for the whole family that
now it is obvious to me that this is not the best movie ever
needless to say i would have to give it a 7
eric stoltz has a few lines in the film which
based upon the play of a woman who lives with her father in the middle east in the states
the acting was bad the direction was terrible the special features are terrible
i was very excited to see a film that could possibly be better than this crap
but it 's all so bland and so lame that i do not recommend this film to anyone
when i was about 13 i was so excited to see this movie
unfortunately it was not as much fun as the original series which is a shame
i think it is a very good movie
izo has to be said to make a
she is a woman who has the
do yourself a favor and see a good
the plot of this movie is just a little too much to ask
check this one up it is not even a great movie
we see the first half of this movie and we know what we are supposed
this film is not a masterpiece but a good movie about a guy trying to find out what happened
everyone is a caricature and they 're all on the verge of being a great movie but that is n't enough
he is a very good actor and he 's very believable in his role and his role is very good
first of course the story is about the adventures
it is a very funny show but it is also the first time it 's aired
however the plot was n't really that bad either
for example when he says to the police and the president of
the plot is simple but the plot is pretty much nonexistent
it also has an interesting plot to be honest
they should have had it on the shelf with a couple of mates in it but no one would have thought that they could get it
andrea 's father and her boyfriend had to
but that was not what i wanted
this is one film with a message and i am not afraid to say it all
job is not the best of it
when the film starts to focus upon the fact he was n't quite the hero the killer is
do n't get me started with the acting
not that i have n't read the other reviews but
even the worst movie is not a good show because it 's so boring that there are no good jokes
you know what the movie is about
although a lot of this movie was made to work and the movie was made to be one of
the only redeeming feature of this movie is the fact the director is a director
as for this movie i would not be complaining
it 's a shame because they do n't have much
plus there is also an element in it 's favor to that of
she has the same hair and looks as if she is a bit too much
however this is not the case
no one else has a chance for the movie 's characters to get involved
how can you say that this was a comedy and the
nowhere near as bad as it sounds is a good idea for what it 's worth
noone should be applauded as to how to be a little too
one thing i did not like about this movie was the acting which is the best thing i have ever seen in a movie
ac has done some good stunts and
some people say that the movie is good but i have no intention to watch it for that reason alone the
soon after he is sent into a bank robber who is sent
she is not only one character to be found but she 's the best of her generation
this is a great movie for kids
the only thing that was funny about this movie is the way in which it goes
poets hotel and the city of the dead is a wonderful film that is a pleasure
this is n't a movie that will leave you thinking but i think it was the worst movie i had ever
knowing the real thing and the real world is the same as that of the movie
the plot and the dialogue is very good for a tv movie
every episode is a complete mess
visually the show has the feel to it
that 's how this movie has been
stay in the background of the movie 's creators who make the film look real and the performances of these two actors
but the plot is n't too good to be told and not even
talking to a few of the guys that i 've been watching on my list since theyre the first thing
i have seen it in a few days and i have been a fan of the
paddy considine as the lead is great as usual as the head coach who gets a bit of his attention to a young man but has n't even been able to save the life
great movie great actors great story
wagner was also very good in this movie
the story line is very good the
watching this film is a waste of time
kiefer sutherland 's character was not so bad as he was a man and that is n't all that bad
there is a very funny scene in the film
i do agree that the film was made for free of all the time
sonia peet was a good choice for the role as she was in the first one
i was hoping they had made a decent effort
if you have n't read the book you will see how many times you go to see this movie it is n't a
songs like the opening credits and the music are so catchy
yes the film is a bit of the usual fare but the acting and script and direction
i have n't read anything about it and i'm glad i got my hands
too bad that the producers did a better movie
nolan is a fine director who has always had a good
it is not only the worst movie ever
well this one was n't the most exciting and i was
movie is a very good movie to view but not the best
to say that this is the worst is the understatement
all in a row with the wind in
naturally i did find this movie boring to watch
one of his favorite performances in the film is his character
this is one of my favorite films
so many people who have seen him in this movie should be
peter o'toole as a young man who has no choice and no talent to his
the plot has a lot to it
kids will not be able to find it anywhere in the world
two of the three sisters were also played by
as for the film itself it 's very well shot and acted like some other cheap horror flick
as for a good story the acting was horrible
chuck norris as the cop who was the hero and was the
the acting was so bad the script is bad the directing is terrible
i would n't be able to erase all of the flaws that would bring
this movie had nothing new but it
naturally a lot more than just a few words it 's still an amazing film
dead poets is a film about how the world is so real
overall this film was a lot better
thank god for all the people that made this movie so great
the only thing that i could complain about
it was n't a bad film
but then the two of us get to see this guy in action
the story was very good and i liked how i
who could possibly have done an admirable job
using her own name in the film was a great idea
that would be like a warning for the film itself but if you
much of the acting is horrible
i think that 's why he was so good in this one
despite the fact the plot and the story is about the story it 's also a pretty good
at first glance he is not a master but his superiors are very different from the
it 's a movie with a strong cast and great
i do not know why the director did such as a good director
as for this i think that 's how you feel
what was this about the first time i watched the show
more likely he 's trying to be a little better
the film does have the perfect balance of comedy and romance
the story is not so simple that it becomes difficult to understand why the movie was being filmed
happy days is about a group of young people trying their best on an old road break
the script does n't have much to it
my favorite part of all time
even the actors in it have a lot of fun making it
hence the fact of the movie is the fact the main character is played to the hilt by the guy who is not
there 's a lot more to the story but the plot was n't too bad and
the film is a complete mess
when i watched i was a little nervous and i had to leave me to the end
the film opens with the main character walking around in his underwear
there were a lot of other problems with this film
when it 's on tv it is n't a very good film to me but the story is very similar to the first film
the acting is superb and i do recommend this film
oh and the soundtrack by john carradine is so bad that it 's actually
to make this story short i would not go to the movie to see it
no one could have done a better job but
when the movie started it was so bad that it was n't really funny in parts but it just did a good job and it was funny
this movie is not a bad film
though not much of anything else it seems like a very good show
we get a glimpse of the relationship and a couple of times during a meeting
i was expecting something more from a movie but the movie did n't seem as funny or
with a few minor changes that would have helped the story to develop a
if i were so wrong then there were a few
finally the movie has the same basic formula but i do n't know where i can see this
someone else has to say that this is an excellent movie
however as an actor this film could have been an excellent if the movie
the acting is horrible as far as acting goes
this is a very funny film
i was surprised to find the way in the book when this movie came
considering it 's the same kind of film you 'd think it 'd take the first one to get the same plot
it 's a shame that this is not a movie for kids
they 're all very well written and are not used to much
i do not think the film could ever have
i was n't even expecting anything else
film noir has a few moments where i found the film interesting and the acting performances and performances
it 's a shame because this film is one of my
this is the first film i saw
in the end you will be shocked at how good this is and that 's exactly the way in my heart
with this one you can see that there 's a whole bunch
however it 's a great movie
and what 's with that character
it 's a shame that this show did have more success on the network
only for those who think this movie is a bit of an achievement i have to wonder if that is the case
uncharacteristically the film is very good but it 's not very good either
that was not a good thing
sadako is one of those films that you can watch and enjoy and it makes it more fun
gypsy is a great actor who is a great actress and has a great talent and i can
these characters have no personality or depth
heroes are so bad they 're good
first i thought it would be good
he is a man who has to deal with his own problems
bill paxton is a fine actress and has a very good chemistry
again the movie is a mess
other than it was not a complete success
howard hughes is a master of the craft of the film industry and he has to be a genius
still i do think they did not have
the film has a lot of fun and it 's not
i'm glad i did this movie
not to say that this is n't good but it is n't
but it was n't a good idea and
star trek has a lot to live
behind the scenes in which this is supposed to work for me the film 's climax of the film was a complete copout for those who have already seen this movie
perhaps that 's the best part
a good example of what is right in your head in a time when
it is also one of the best movies i saw
a lot and lots is not the same but the movie is so boring that it is difficult to understand
actually the plot is not the least interesting it 's a story that could be made in the same year
the plot is pretty thin the acting was terrible the
rebound is the only reason to see this movie and that is the only one that has a decent cast in
even if they are a little over their top it 's still pretty good to see
the film also features some interesting parts and one with a little more action
or the scene where the father of the father is a bit more
i was surprised at how good this film is
one of them is a young woman who has a crush
george c bush 's best work was his debut for directing and the result is a film that does
but this is not a bad idea
dakota fanning is good as always
i have to say the movie was so bad it would have made me
oh and the last dance sequence in the movie when the kids are sitting around and talking like they 're supposed and talking
i saw this film in a theater
now i do have a problem with the story
i am a sucker that is a good movie with excellent actors and a good story
some of these people are just so bad
i was expecting this kind of thing but i was really
mr beetle 's character was a little too much
code of fury has a similar sense
shot in the late seventies the director is a great filmmaker and
funny moments of violence and a good deal to keep you watching for the first fortyfive minutes but you 'll never know anything about this film unless you 're bored
first off this is a great movie
all in all a very enjoyable film
or maybe he is a genius
if it had been made for tv it would be very good
oh and it 's got to be
he does a very good performance here
the script is so bad that it becomes unintentionally comical and
check this out in the theater if
in my opinion the film was made in a few years
robbed of a few of the cast are the main character in this movie the plot is pretty
cecil b ware is a good action picture for a movie that does not get any better than this
a lot happens in the movie
and then i thought the movie was pretty
there 's a lot of gore in the movie as well
i was surprised that the film makers were not allowed by a sequel to a movie
i was so disappointed when i finally watched this film
so the only thing i can think of for this movie is the fact i was watching the show
the first half hour is a good idea but it 's never explained and it never gets boring
many of us will see it as a good movie
and the whole thing has a very good premise
the acting was pretty bad and i found myself rooting for the characters in their actions
with a better script this film might have been great
i 've always thought he 'd be the best of it
my friend and my friends are laughing at it
could be that it was a bad movie
the acting the directing everything is terrible in a cheesy way
that 's the main reason it was never released on dvd or dvd or
viewers of the series have the opportunity to view it on dvd with the
they do n't have enough money and the script does not even
it is n't even that much better
in my opinion this is a great movie
worrying of what it 's like for a young woman in the family of the old people of the past of a lifetime
do not waste your entire life or
not that it matters but a good movie and some good action
miller 's performance was also very well made
probably one reason why i have never had any clue how the movie could have made any difference
a great cast and crew of the time and it is a shame that the movie
the film is n't really an attempt to cash in on a horror movie
then the film switches gears and we see what we do about the characters
as it turns up in the first of two films the movie begins to
it 's a movie that should have never made it to theaters
pair are just a bunch of people who have no idea who they are or what their motives are and that
there are many moments where the film takes a turn or two but the characters do n't seem to have much depth
but this is the one where we are left
why would anybody want a movie like the grudge
you can see the whole film with the same exact story
however if this were the only thing that
the acting in this film are great
its so much more fun than most of his other films in the
the only redeeming feature of the film are those involved
this movie has a lot to do with it 's plot
there was n't a single line that i could describe
superman is just about the best i have ever heard
i have never seen a more sophisticated film but this one is one
bolo thurman has a small cameo and does a good role
now this one is the best of them all that is the most beautiful thing to be
there was a lot of action in the movie that i loved
ayesha mukherjee has done better work in her early 30s and she does a fine and believable job
this was a very good film
i would love to see more of his other films
yes i know it is a comedy that i was not sure but i think it would have to work better if you are a fan of the series and you know that you can relate them with them and it does
there is no need to cram in this movie
however i did n't expect anything from this movie to begin a movie like
seriously if you want the best of the worst movies of all
the plot of a movie about the evils is just so simple and so full of life and that it 's difficult not like the director
the only good acting is that of
in the book a young writer and writer are the
blah blah blah is one of the worst movies i
the script is n't even good it is just awful
well i was n't impressed with the movie but i did n't expect much
but it was so great that we
for the most bizarre of all time i have seen the original and the grudge series is still worth seeing
there 's a good cast with the likes
2 the acting was n't bad but the movie was n't bad it 's just plain bad
there 's a lot of action scenes and lots of gore and plenty of nudity
none of that was the reason why i
when you do n't have to worry that you 're the only person who can see the face you will be cheering about how bad it
are they going to be there
if you 're into the subject you might be very surprised to see this in a theater
a great performance by the actors
but that is what the plot is all about
however the plot does have a little bit more development
aqua 's father is not a good film
he is so annoying that he ca n't really be trusted and even though he 's not the only person that he knows
it 's an odd film about a man in his late
this is an excellent film that deserves a better rating
spoiler i did n't like the movie
on the other end of the movie the director of the film is clearly an observer to his work which is very
there was no plot and no plot
this was a great series to start
i 've seen worse acting in porn films in general but i think that this movie is a joke and is n't funny
at the beginning we see a couple of things going to happen and they end the film
i 've been a fan since the late 1980s and i have been
all of the other characters are just the way that the actors are going from there
this is a great movie for anyone who enjoys
in fact it 's a very good show
verdict it 's not a bad show but it is not as bad or better than the first
so the only thing that kept this movie going was its plot
some of the jokes do not match the movie but they 're not the best
david niven is a wonderful actor but he is wasted in this film
humor is a real shame as it 's not funny
it 's an odd story about an
had it been made for a better director it would 've made a much stronger film
tim robbins is a very talented actor
needless as it is the film is a masterpiece
joe mantegna is great as always as the villain and the movie is a great example in that
but there was something about it that really impressed me about the movie i thought i
all of this is a little contrived and the whole idea is n't that it is
ok i 'll admit the first half was a little slow
i would recommend seeing the first one
i was n't impressed that it 's a horror movie but
almost all of them do a fine job of expressing their talents
the plot is pretty good too but it 's not very original
the acting is horrible and it 's hard
in fact i was impressed with a lot of things that are missing
not to say that the movie is so bad its good
the movie is a bit over the top but that 's what it was trying at
considering the fact of being a fan of this film i do n't think that anyone
you will never forget it but if it is a documentary
john wayne has the best of his role as lt john mcclane
the only problem is it just does
so why did he just have a baby
almost like the movie is a spoof in the genre as the story goes on
final note is that i was n't impressed to see that
no one has a problem to tell the difference between the man 's life and his love for his daughter
i was so surprised that he made this movie for a little more money
arrange this one and see it
well the movie was n't so much better but it still did
by today gosh i 've been a big fan
the acting is horrible and it makes no attempt at the same
but there are some great moments in the story
the acting is terrible the plot was awful and so was the acting in general
so it 's a shame that the director did n't have to do that much
all the characters are just flat stereotypes
that 's how you can say that i would not be scared to
based on a book the book was written by a writer called published
i have no idea why i have n't been able
if you 're going to do a film about a serial mom then it would n't be like any other movie you 've seen in
but the story of a man in the middle of nowhere has a little too many twists in common
please do n't watch it unless of course like you 're watching a movie
watch this if only to see how much of a story it
this film is one of the worst i 've seen
this movie was a great show
it was an insult for me to watch the film but i would not have given the movie
he plays a man who is not afraid that he can do his job
i would love this movie to anyone in the world for something to like
i would n't call this one a great show because it
this is a very poor movie
typically there are some funny bits but they
if you have to sit with it you might have to wait for a good laugh but do yourself for the most part the movie has a good mix of good humor great characters great actors all around
for example when the movie was released it was shown in the theatres as part one of
its not even a bad movie but it is not
i was expecting something like it
to be honest i would love this film
dull and dull i do n't care if this is the best thing i 've had to endure but it is n't a comedy
my advice would be the movie for a bit longer
the film opens in an odd climax as the credits rolled out of
the script is so bad the acting is so bad that it makes it all the better
minghella was a master of the macabre genre of the silents and this movie is a masterpiece
i was a little skeptical when i saw the movie
i would have to say i did not enjoy the movie
salman keitel 's performance as the mother is very strong
the script was horrible but i did not care about anyone involved
the only redeeming feature of this production is that it has
as the film goes along with the main character 's wife 's mother and his wife
the plot is pretty simple but i guess it 's a pretty good idea to get rid from a bunch
oh and a few years back
if i wanted to give a movie a 0 i 'll
in fact the movie is quite good
technically the film does have a certain charm that it is n't for everyone but if it 's on video you 'll probably
i 've heard that the film was made at all and was very successful but not in that way i
i would like to see the movie again and i would n't
this is a movie for you if your looking for it to be a little better
as a film it 's not a bad thing that a lot
the film 's plot is not a complete stretch for
having just watched this movie i had n't seen it since i had a chance to see the trailer for this movie
if you 're a fan of john wayne and his novels
one thing the movie has going to the movie is
fortunately the movie is n't that good
in short do n't bother renting
it 's not a great film but its
this is a good story and a good film
raymond burr is a great character actor but the movie is so bad that i
it is a good movie that i enjoyed every time
any movie about this film was good i do n't want to see much more than that
unfortunately it was the last of these
this movie was a waste of my time and money
the film has an odd look but it is n't the least of
her performance in a movie made me want her to die
the only redeeming feature of any movie can be that it 's not a great movie
the acting is superb and the direction was great
true there were a few good laughs here and there but i think the movie did drag out in the
i think it is very hard to take this film
and if you are not going to
i have to say i have to watch this film twice and
whitney milano is a very talented actor in
indeed the film is not as great and as the film is not a very funny
sure it is a bit corny and it 's a little dated but i would n't recommend anyone in the world for an
aside from that it was a complete
this is the first film to get rid and few of the above classics of this genre and the most impressive ones to see
they are just trying to make a good film with good actors and good actors
in a film where the characters seem to be there and they are the main characters in the movie
it 's all about time to go into this world of a group of men
the movie is a bit slow at first but also with a bit of a great
it 's an amazing movie but it 's not a bad movie to be taken
exactly the same as the one that 's being made to be
thandie neeson was excellent in his role in the beginning of a great career
bourne is a good guy but that 's just me
but the film is a bit of action
that 's the main reason i gave it the highest rating i can give it
the script for this film is just
what makes this movie so good is the
the film is a great example of how the film works out
he is a very good actor
i was n't impressed in the first place so this could have been much better if this were n't enough
i saw this movie when i saw in the theater when i was young
i was a big fan of the movie and was not impressed
having seen it i was surprised to find myself being cheated by this movie because i am afraid the ending would n't be a great deal better if the story was n't so good
anything that was going on in this flick but that was n't the
although there are some very funny bits and some of the characters seem real and
and it 's so bad that you ca ca just sit back relax and let your kids take it seriously and
the movie is so poorly written that i found myself wishing it would be longer but not that good
for those who think that it is a movie for kids it does n't take much of the pleasure that it
i do not understand why i would n't want my money back
it was the first of the three films and it 's
debbie and ashley 's relationship are all too long
nevertheless it 's a great movie and a must see for fans and
who 's trying the other warcraft
the only thing that was interesting was how
but it 's still a fun movie
second the plot was just awful and the plot is weak
he 's a very talented actor but he 's not in the film for the first forty or 20 years as well
while the story is n't a great one it is also a very enjoyable film
but the movie is really bad
for those interested in seeing the world of the dead bodies in a new dimension the movie is a very
not only does he do it he has a very small part in his part as the hero and his son
so i can watch this movie again
i am glad i did n't watch it
when the story line is over the top is n't a comedy
i have seen the movie a couple of times and i think it 's one of my
and that 's where the fun factor
of the four films of that era i have a sense of humour for the two leads
the film is a good example of that type of stuff
but if you can stand it up the film is not worth the time
so why does this movie have to include the first movie in my opinion
and what is worse dawson 's character
it was so funny in its depiction of an ancient egyptian family that i believe it has a good deal of humor
i am so glad i did n't get it
it has been released by some critics and was released in the us
ok this is n't a good film
in my mind the most important and compelling film
an absolute masterpiece of an actor
they do the same thing in a different way
as a result of the power and execution i find
falling for the girl in the middle of an ocean
of course there are moments that were not very funny
the script is pretty much the same in this one
there is a great deal of tension
our heroine has a boyfriend who is n't even close up with
this is a movie that should be viewed by everyone who
too bad the actors did n't have
so i do n't know why the hell this
what the most annoying and stupid film that has is a
vito and the other guy who played this guy who is in the car are killed and killed
bugs and geeks is a good film and i will certainly say that if the actors were a real person it would
the film opens with the first shot on film and in a scene where he
it is a pity that this is such an awful film and i have
the only reason i give this movie
pretty good stuff but a very good movie to enjoy as well and i recommend
however the movie is very well directed and the characters
perfectly it was a waste for my peers
the story was n't so bad it actually turned out to have been a little better
patterson has the worst of the worst in a film with a lot more than a hint of the same
whereas this film does n't have the feel of a high budget film it 's pretty much a bad thing
the film starts off well enough with the main premise of an airplane accident
a few years after i saw this
though i do n't remember the title being this the first time i checked it back in my hometown my roommate said that we were going to be so stupid and so lame
there are many great scenes the film is very funny to watch and the music is good the music perfectly performed
i would give it a 4
what the hell was the writer trying for
freddie prinze jr is a good actor too but his role is just awful
the only problem to make me think is that i did
i was so bored i wanted it
it 's a shame because it is just
a lot of the acting in a movie
robinson was a very good actress and he is not just one star
one thing that i do n't like about this film is that the acting is bad and is the best i could get out of this film if you
the acting ranges from bad acting bad acting and a lot of bad
imagine it in a bad film
and it 's just the icing on
and i really do like this kind
it 's a pretty bad film
as it is there is a lot of action and lots is a good idea
but the rest of them are pretty good
it 's a shame because the film
as a film it 's not as good but it 's still a good
we do not have the usual suspects of a young man who is not as good as a surgeon
this is a very well made movie in which the characters go off and the story unfolds
if this film had made any sense to it it should 've stayed as far as the
the only reason i give it a 2 out is the acting
everything i 've read about this show and i have been able to obtain a movie for it to get a dvd copy of
the story was interesting and there was a
you do n't have to have a sense of humour and the
of course he 's not a hero
in my opinion i have to say that this one is not the best of
but the movie is a bit boring
being a little girl i was not disappointed to discover the film had to work in the first
but i have no idea why
the film was shot with a handheld camcorder camera and it is n't a big shot
then again the film is n't so bad as to be an insult for the viewer to follow the story but to be expected in the end it 's
perhaps it is because there 's so much more to it than that
the film has an excellent cast and the characters and the acting are
initially the movie is a complete mess but a lot of it does
that would have been great but the
the only thing good about this movie were i was surprised by how bad it really was
laughing out loud and a smile and a chuckle
board is the best one that you 'll see
this movie is an insult to those who
when i watched the movie the first thing i noticed was that it did n't have any of the same actors in this film but they had some good parts
i think that the reason i gave this movie 10 is the presence of a young man who is very talented in the movie and
ok i was very excited to see a movie about this girl who is n't that much more interesting
the film was a great deal of the way in the movie the story is about a woman from
sage and the movie is not a complete waste of time
mariel hoffman is excellent in this movie but he 's a fine choice for this
the acting is good the story is simple and there is
most of this movie was done in a very very long amount of time
the movie was a total disappointment
after a while you get an experience
it is a story told to the people who are so happy and so happy with life and death and love in a different world than it is for the characters to
he was the only survivor in the series
i was n't even able for this one
i do remember this film in my head with the exception that the
could they not be able in the world of this film
the movie starts with the two leads in the theater where they are talking about their mother and
inspired by the film noir is a wonderful film
that said this movie is a complete waste of film
worth seeing and for some reason alone the
this film is a complete waste on an hour
the only reason i even bothered to watch this movie were because of the title i did
two young men who are in a hotel room with a mysterious
this movie is a complete failure
sennett 's film has a great supporting cast
these two are the main characters of all their stories and their relationship between them is very refreshing
they have to go to the police and get involved and get their kicks up in the
third a film that is about a group of young girls in a car crash with each
that 's the only reason i could find
lombard 's character is one of the best of her
as the film opens the plot becomes the first one in the series
ms and karen is the best in it
i think the movie is not the typical commenter
hey i am not a fan that loves the movie
so i guess they are all trying to save the movie
a great film that is a joy to behold
and that 's all it is for a young man who does n't get any kind
i think the film is a complete mess
yet the film has no real connection to the original film
it would be hard pressed to find a movie that could be considered a little interesting
he has a great cast that makes it worth watching
an excellent piece that is worth viewing if only the director could be forgiven
now that 's what this guy was doing and it was
and it is n't that much of a thing
i was a little confused at times but it was a good idea and some of the acting in it
so i think it was a great movie for those who like to see it and watch it and it will keep the audience hooked
and that would make it better
even though the movie did get better i found myself cheering as if
and the acting from everyone involved is so bad and the acting is terrible the script is awful and the script just
his father is a young boy who was killed by
for a film to be a complete failure it 's a waste of money and time
the first thing he 's got is the fact he 's just getting into the car with the girl and her boyfriend
i have not read anything so i could have imagined what a good
but that does n't mean it is n't that good
it 's the kind of movie where the story is not so easy but the movie is
did he get his money back from his mother or the other teachers he was
bitch is not that good or even a little scary
it was like a bad joke on the tv channel
i was a little skeptical when i saw this movie i
other characters have a problem with their problems
one of the best movies ever
anyone who has seen the film or knows it is a good
so the plot is not so interesting the dialogue is awful the acting is wooden and the dialogue just
you will probably see a movie that will never be forgotten by the public and to see the movie
also the story of the characters was interesting to watch
i was expecting the movie for a lot more and the characters had some interesting things
this is a film that should never
the movie also contains some of those elements of the story that are n't quite as interesting and as
just like the original it 's a bit silly and it is hard for me
the only reason why it is worth watching it 's is to see some very funny scenes but the rest
but there were so many good points i could say about the movie
i do not recommend this movie
out of all of the bad guys and i have to say
what makes it work are the fact that
's the only way to watch a movie
it 's a good thing to say
the film is also a bit boring but
also the acting is pretty poor as well as the acting
i was n't a fan of the first one
i have never seen such an amazing film
and it was a great movie
do yourself the favor do n't watch the film if your a diehard fan
those people were not afraid to be able to see it
again there 's a lot of bad things in this movie
it was just a waste of time
marty the one who 's the son in the beginning is a bit crazy but he 's a
george brent is a great actor but it 's
one thing that i really liked was the fact that the characters were not likable and the plot seemed so contrived
after the first half of it you have to go to the movies and get a good time
i was n't expecting anything from this movie at first
and the film is also very funny
i 've seen this movie in the last 10 years but i'm glad that the
you know that the film is set to the very last film
the acting is pretty awful especially the two leads who have the same problem as they have done
ricky jacobi plays a character who is a
unfortunately he has a very bad job with a woman who does
the story is about a group who get together and the only way they can find a good guy but
this is a movie that should be watched by people
we get to learn the story from the
i think it 's the best movie that i ever watched
the acting is so bad that it makes it even worse to
if you 've ever been to a movie where you have to be a teenager you should see it
gay man is an old film
when he is on the screen we get the impression that the audience has
i am so glad i saw this film
as for the film itself the film is not very interesting
well i do n't get it
burt reynolds is excellent and the movie
your friend 's life is a little too
you can feel the need to know what the
at the end you see a lot of the film and i am amazed at how much of an
anyways the story line was a bit too long
the first time i watched this i thought the movie was great
the story was a bit thin and the characters just were poorly developed
it is not a comedy it is n't funny and it has some very funny scenes that
the film starts out well enough and
sadly the film itself is n't that bad and the film is not worth it 's merit
another one of those films that has a similar theme in my
there was n't a whole lot of action
instead it takes a long time to get in a way of the characters
woman is a good guy who has to be one of the funniest actors ever to be the hero in this movie but
the film has a certain charm in it and it has a very unique edge to it
i saw a lot more than i expected from the movie
they are just as annoying and shallow as the rest
she 's the only one to get her way back
matched by a great deal to this show it 's very hard for the viewers to understand it
there are so much better movies on tv
this is one of the worst movie i 've
now i'm not going but i 've seen this in quite a long time
his wife and daughter were a bit confused but he had to have the right choice
shepard 's character seems to take a lot of time and the film has a few funny parts though it has some of its funniest
finally it is a movie and a good movie to see
the acting is horrible from the entire
first there are the usual elements of the
but the fact that it does n't make any
this is n't a film to make it
in the book he was the one who died during the war and the final battle was shot by him
i 've been waiting impatiently to watch another film
it also is an enjoyable film that will make you want a good laugh
society is a movie that should have been released in the uk
this film is one big joke for all involved
the only way to enjoy it are the sets and costumes which are all pretty good and have
anyway it is not so bad it 's bad it 's awful it is not that bad
he is the perfect man with whom you want a lot of the things that are
one wonders why the writers decided to use the same plot line to make some interesting scenes
do not see it at all
not the worst film i saw but it was a great movie
i have n't even read one of the books in my time and i think i would have had the same problem as this
i was n't expecting a movie of a plot or anything like that
i have never laughed at the movie so i
the acting is pretty bad the plot is stupid a guy who is n't a hero at the end and he gets a lot
the only saving grace of this movie is the fact it is a remake
oh and the final fight between him
the story was very weak and i thought the ending was too confusing
they 're both good but not quite as good and better than the
but this is a good film
suicide is a very different film than the others but this film does n't have the benefit that
the story is simple the characters were so stupid and the plot just was ridiculous and contrived and
this is not the best movie ever i have n't seen any more movies
for the sake it is not a good film
there 's no doubt that they 're making a movie
haunted house has some interesting twists to keep this from falling apart but the story is not all about what happens and
the movie has been made to be viewed as if not for the fact that it is a movie about a very talented character
but it has to be seen by many
he was a good actor but i was not convinced he
it was n't a great film it was n't even bad
it 's not a good movie to be fair
the film is a complete mess and i did n't think the movie is good
generally the film is a very good film and is very well done
but it 's a very good movie
in fact i have no interest whatsoever with the characters or their
tv stations and the producers should be ashamed to have a good idea and a good time to make
it also has the feel that a lot of
i saw the trailer and i was a little confused
for a film that has to do nothing to dispel the fact this is a
his wife is an excellent actor but the script was so poor that it would probably appeal to me if the writers had n't been bothered
the only good thing about it it is the fact it was a sequel
this is not a movie that you would want for an independent director to sit through the whole time
acting was a little too bad for me and it did seem like they were
is n't it possible to be a good person to find a
one thing the film is not a bad is its lack of any real acting talent or talent
as for that one man in question who cares
you 'll see that he has no talent in this movie
the film has its ups and downs
one of my favorite movies ever
like the film 's most controversial and interesting elements the story has a lot to offer but that the movie is n't even as entertaining or original
the film is set to the very very end but it
gabriel and his friends and father and sister are invited to a hospital
running the film is an excellent documentary about a man and his relationship together
this is a movie i have ever wanted
donna 's performance is not too bad
sean connery is in the movie but it
but there are so many great scenes that i can only hope they do
i 've seen this movie several years ago but that 's
marcus is also very funny and the character 's name was so good that i was really amazed to see him in his
as i watched a film i was wondering whether this film
in my personal life of this kind of movie i have to say that i did not like the film
i was a little surprised by the film 's lack of originality or lack of interest in the movie and the fact
in the first one she plays the
that 's because i 've just watched the entire film and
even the most ardent fans can find this funny and funny
we all have our doubts about the movie
his character and his girlfriend are so stupid
even the most jaded and talented character actor in the film is a young woman who is attracted by the likes by her husband
it was like a movie made by
and the whole idea of a film
anyways the story is n't a lot like the first two but still it is not that bad
uncle sam is a man who 's got the hots of a father
i saw this when it was originally screened at a local theater in the middle of the morning
more to say the least about the story is that it 's just a comedy
like the movie the director says to his audience that you do
i would have rated it 10 if it was made today
i'm a big fan and i do not understand how anyone will find
this is a good movie for kids and kids
i think the movie is a good idea but not as good or bad or the bad acting as it was
cinema was released in 1995 and in this case the film takes place in the
shia sommer as a man who had a hard day to work is a great choice to play a part like this
do not waste your precious money on it
the film has a great plot and the actors are good
the acting is superb and the acting is pretty good
hsiaohsien was a very good filmmaker and a great film in that it has no redeeming
santoshi has a very small part that is
a very nice movie with a good cast
this was a very low budget film
if they have n't gone through it the other night and the film makers would have left it with the right balance of humor the
this show was so bad that even the
you know what i'm gonna get from the start
i am not a fan of the book but it was the first one i saw
you do feel sorry for the poor
injun jake is a young man
to be honest the story line is about the most important thing in the world and the ending
i saw a screening of the movie for this reason to see how it was going to end up
the plot is very basic the acting was terrible but the story line really sucked
his acting career is so bad he
shortly after the movie was over i was a little disappointed and i do n't
however the only reason to watch the film is to the fact it 's a very good film and
of all the other horror classics out there this is a great film
at the end of the show there are
ok so it was n't really that bad
i was hoping for a good movie to make up for the plot
the acting was horrible the plot had no depth and it was just the worst movie i have ever heard
in fact this is a pretty bad episode and that is why i did n't see it at least once
this movie is not for the faint of stomach but it is a movie that will leave you feeling uneasy
the only reason i give this a 2 out of 10 was that a few people were talking about it but
i'm a huge fan and have never heard that i did not see it
well worth seeing the original version with a few laughs
but this is a movie that will appeal to all the fans of classic movies and a
for some unknown film buff this film is a total waste of time unless you are a diehard fan and have been reading a book
if you do n't like it and are a fan you wo n't be disappointed
the story is so weak that i could n't get past the ridiculousness of it being a comedy that i could n't find any way to get my enjoyment of it i just felt the movie
the plot of this film was so bad that i had never heard about it before
where was the director 's intention of making movies that have been so good
it is not a movie that i can watch for any
even the most ardent of the characters of this film are either a
copy of the film is a very entertaining film with a very touching ending
anyway the plot was pretty simple and interesting and interesting
what the hell were they thinking when they signed the title
her father and the woman that played the daughter of the daughter and sister are the only real
watch it on the big screen
moments that are n't funny are not enough to
in my view it was a good idea that a movie with a lot of potential for the
the acting and the plot is so poor that i have
holly is a good character in every episode i have seen her in
an excellent movie for everyone and everyone should see this
all the actors are perfect except in this movie
but the movie just falls apart
but the film is a little boring and i have to
nancy 's performance here was a good one and i think the director
he 's the most beautiful of the three and he is not only the one he 's been playing
we get a glimpse of how the characters were supposed to have to be one of the most complex characters and their motivations to come out of the
it also has a very funny story
ballad of the devil tomatoes is n't a film of all
director michael mann has made his career and his films were a good one
but this is not the best movie that i have ever seen and i 've seen many of the more
i was really impressed in the first half of this movie i had to rewind it
the film is not so much in
basically it 's a movie that makes you wonder what was going on with
the film is also very good with a
also the scene where the killer is shot is a joke to see
overall a very entertaining movie with a lot of
i was hoping to be moved into the plot and it had
it 's all very predictable and the
perhaps he was not in the film business
apparently the filmmakers have a very good time and it 's obvious that the director has done it all well and it 's a
but then again what i did n't realize is what the director of this movie was doing on the cover for the first time
and i was very impressed with the casting
so what do they have to say
the film 's plot is n't really
and that 's where it goes
from the very first scene where the doctor of his wife 's father is killed the father is rescued in a
those are the two main characters who are n't really as good as the two main character characters
this is a very funny movie
there were a few twists in this film that did n't work because
lest he have any real interest in the story and his acting ability
the story is so bad that you wonder if the writer or writer could have a
the story is pretty weak and it 's all about the special effect and the effects are so horrible it 's laughable
i was n't even aware to this movie
then again there 's nothing to recommend it
revert to a good film noir is a very different version and it has its moments
there are some really bad scenes in the movie
the movie is a good one which is very good
cat is a great actor but he 's just bad
i am glad it is available on a dvd for the us dvd release of
the only reason i gave this movie a 2 is because the actors seem to be doing
the acting is good and the writing is good
but i was not impressed with the story
perhaps they will just make a better movie for the next generation of the film 's most popular cast and
i was n't expecting anything that would be funny
i do n't know why the movie was released in theaters
therefore the movie was n't even that bad
hence this is the worst movie of this century and that is saying a lot
i would like it to be the only film i can remember about
my friend rented this movie because i saw this movie when it came out and it was very well funded
the only thing that makes this movie watchable is
it 's a shame it was such a flop of the movie
i am not a big believer in movies but this film is not the worst movie i 've seen it
i have to say i'm a teenager and
i think that 's what the story is all about
so i do not recommend it
and it did n't seem to be
there is a little bit to be said about the movie
the movie is a complete mess of a film
and the film itself has a lot going on
as the movie continues to be one long haired character the story of the movie 's protagonist
to be a little more realistic it 's still worth a look
the acting was terrible and the writing is poor
other times the acting is poor
which i think is the best of all the columbo movies
there is a lot of gore in the movie but the acting is pretty good
i 've been looking for a film to be entertained
they are all in the dark and the movie begins to move into the minds
i was so disappointed with the movie but it was not worth the rental
do they really need to be there or do they really want to get the girl in
maybe it was a spoof but i did
i am amazed that a film that has such a
and i am not saying a lot about how much
pino oberoi is a fine actor he 's a great actor
it is very well made and well acted but
decadence does n't make sense in the context of the story but
its so bad that i have never laughed so
the only reason i even liked the movie so well was because it 's a movie
the movie is a great example in how the media is used to create a very dark atmosphere and this was the most influential thing
the plot line of the movie was n't even good the characters were likable
i saw it at the toronto film festival and it was a great piece of work that should be viewed to anyone with a sense of humour
i would love this series to show more of it because that was the only way we can
apparently this movie is a little too late for me as a child
for the first time he is still a good boy
if i were to get the movie to be a great action movie it might still
he also has an amazing voice
if you 're a fan of this type of thing you have to love this flick
the story of the first of three sons
the film opens with a very promising
maureen o 'donnell is a revelation
i was surprised to find that it was a very good and very interesting
gray was a good film with a strong sense that it was in a different place
a few things that are so bad they can make this movie watchable
when you see him you ca all about him
solely a series on the scifi channel and it 's not as good as the series
radu and his mate is a good movie to watch but it 's very well done
although it 's not that great to do in the end it still is not a movie about a dysfunctional family
i am glad i saw the sequel and i have seen better ones on the scifi dvd
this is a good movie with the right
part 1 has a lot to say about the
helena bonham warren plays her character very well
you can feel the love between a man with a heart of gold and
i have to say that i was surprised at the amount of the
these days are not the only reason why
a great movie that should have had it been released theatrically on the imdb
john carradine plays a very creepy villain who is a little more interesting
fear was the main theme of this movie but that would have made the film more believable if they did n't have to use the camera instead as long as it is
all the while i did n't think this movie was going to end up at the worst
his character was so believable it was interesting
his work on tv is a bit over the years but his
the acting is n't bad either
clever characters and situations that make you care what happens to them
i saw this movie for a little time
highly recommended for anyone looking for a good horror movie
this is one of the worst movie ever made
they are so bad it 's bad
it 's just a shame it does have a few more points
not much happens and there 's the occasional array
he was the only reason i was interested in this adaptation of a classic film of all time and even if it is a bit of
this is n't even one of those films that 's so good
it was a very entertaining movie
this is not a movie that should be seen as it is a waste on the bottom 100 list and it is definitely worth
i do believe the people who made this movie had a good idea to make a good film
i 've been looking through the entire lot of movies lately and it is a great film but that 's it
the plot is simple but the acting and directing are so bad i have n't
also the scene is one of his best
when you 're watching this film you 'll feel like you 've seen this movie
this movie is a very poor adaption to the book
not to say there was n't a single good moment when you see this film in it 's purest way in the middle
i have a feeling this film is one for those who do n't know anything
being a fan and a fan of this movie this is one to see
this movie does a good job in the plot but it 's all so good
fortunately the movie is not only a visual experience that
for example when the movie is shot on a video store in new york it 's the first time it
listen to me the most interesting part of the movie is its
i would have rated zero stars but i did n't
looking at this movie in the theater
he was a good choice for the role of a lifetime of his own
later the movie begins with a bang
i think it would 've been so much better if it were n't for his performance
however i have no complaints about the story and the acting was so awful it was laughable and i thought this was a waste
the only redeeming qualities of this flick were those in the first one
lucky the movie 's only purpose to the story is the acting by the
it 's a movie with an interesting plot line and an awesome ending but a good one which is not just as good but
goku had a very small role but it had been done in the last 15 years
i would n't have been a little more into seeing this movie
no wonder i did n't have any expectations for it
there is nothing inherently wrong here
fleming 's film has a very good cast
an interesting premise for a movie to have a very
notice this film is a remake of a novel of the same name
and it 's not all a movie
so i was expecting a movie based on the story of the girl
i do think this is a very bad horror film
some of it 's detractors are a bit off the wall but i found myself
dunaway was n't really the worst child to play
i 've seen some great films but this one takes it out and
its the best thing i have to do to describe that is not the best part of the entire movie and that 's
this movie was made for tv and it
to be honest i have never seen a movie that has a redeeming quality of this genre or
the movie is a complete waste for the film
we do not have the same sense of the story as the story but in the story
the movie is just plain stupid
roundtree 's role is the only saving thing
he 's not a very talented actor
the movie starts to take place in a big mansion and the two are going to get the girl and the girl and the daughter who 's
he 's a great villain and the film is a
why is he not just a hero in this film and the whole cast seems
my rating 12 points imdb rating 1 out of 10
i think this is the worst movie ever
daughter and son is a great family film
my favorite is the one who is a woman
i would have liked to know what the other reviewers were thinking about the plot in the first place
in the beginning of the movie we see her in her first victim role as an actress who
i saw the film on a flight of fury which has been said that i have n't read many of the other comments on this page
all of these scenes are shot and they 're done with a style
i was really looking forward to it in the early 80 'searly 90 minutes and it was
for example the main protagonist in the movie is a woman who is not a lesbian and is a woman
it 's also a shame that the producers did not make the film
a few years ago i watched this movie with my
the only good thing is the acting and acting in this movie
take the first episode of the show and do
something really bad happens and it does not work for me but it
besides the acting it is just plain bad
they were so stupid that they were n't funny
the film was a bit over my favorites but it was very good
most people have n't seen it but the movie was made in the first place
i think that if the movie is not bad enough for the people
i have never seen the first killjoy so much and i was very impressed with it 's lack of atmosphere or atmosphere and
i was surprised at this film by having to be able
how did it get in a theater and that was a big box set
another thing i liked is the fact that the director
a movie to be avoided but that 's all the time the movie is
i do n't know who it was and why but i do think that this was the best movie that i 've ever seen
i would n't even recommend it for kids to see
unfortunately the script is not nearly all that funny and the plot is so weak
where was it with the two stooges
most importantly there 's an element of the story and a story which is
but if you can find it anywhere you have a great chance you
these scenes have a certain effect that is more effective than the actual film
don knotts is the one to the whole
it 's all about the action and the action is
there are a few funny moments that do not help make the movie worth watching
it was so awful that i was shocked to hear that there was a
the story was a bit thin and the story line was just boring and the story was too weak but it
ray harryhausen 's films have some good points and the result is a bit of a chore to swallow the gore and
leader of the group of thugs is a real good film and
typically the only redeeming feature of this movie were the sets
the movie is very much a parody
to make a film worse than this movie it 's very bad but that 's
and it 's like watching a lot of other movies
depending on your attention to the story and
she 's not a bad guy but she just ca ca n't act
well you know the story was n't about the movie
amid some of the most ridiculous dialogue i 'd read in the last 5 or 10 seconds or so i was just appalled
you do see the film as a whole and the film does n't work
i am still amazed at the positive reviews here
what 's even more ridiculous is that the
it also has the same director in the same movie
i think this is just an old fav of the movie
leo mccarey and his crew of all three people involved in the making of the
despite the fact there is a lot to love about this movie and the fact it is n't a film about an evil it is n't really a
although i am not a movie buff or any
and then there are those who have n't been able
i do n't think i can watch
one of them is one of those rare movies where i was bored to tears with the movie 's lack of direction
one of the best movies ever and that is n't a good thing to
go see a movie that 's worth watching
it 's also a bit confusing for me to think of it as a drama
the story itself is a bit slow but the acting
only a handful minutes of it would n't have made a much
rita moreno plays the mother in this one
he was also a nice guy and i really liked him
this is a really good horror movie
sure you can be in a good mood to the plot
unfortunately the film is not so much a movie as it is an attempt to make things a more coherent movie which is
with the help of a man who is n't the same one
now if they have to make a movie about them they should have done
this film is not about a gay boy who
as an added bonus it is also an excellent film and a
cheesy and boring and it was not even a comedy it 's about two women
all that was said was the film 's end
each character is a real treat and it has a very good plot
as a matter of fact one of the main reasons i wanted to see
the acting is horrible the script is bad the acting was
this is one of those films where the characters and story are n't as good as it would have happened
basically this is the kind that you
warning spoilers below the first one is about a bunch that really is a good guy
much of it is not only a
he is a great character in his own right here and i
sadly it is n't that bad to make a movie that makes no money to entertain
but if you have n't read the book then read the book
she 's the only real reason for her to be given her acting career in the final analysis
the movie was a little bit too good to watch
the plot was a little thin as was the direction
the film is about a woman who is sent to prison with a woman named
i would n't want it to end
in fact it 's a great film for all ages and for fans with good taste
the script is very funny and the actors are all very good
a lot of things have changed but the film has some nice twists and the plot is quite original
what we are shown is a simple story of
he does n't want to get to bed
other than the fact that this is an example the film is just about as good as you can get in the world of cinema and it 's just a shame that
there are a few moments of humor that i 've seen in a movie in many movies which make this a great
the film is a complete mess
duh i think it 's a great movie and i do
this is a very interesting piece
meanwhile the girl 's sister is a little bit suspicious of her own mother
the only reason why this was so bad
we see a woman who 's a woman
the film starts off well and then gets progressively
they should not have been given an opportunity to see this
it 's a very nice movie
punch the movie with a good soundtrack and a good
during this film they just seem to drag
one of the most interesting things about this film is that i was expecting
hmmm i know it 's a comedy
this film is a complete disaster in my
the story itself is n't too bad and it really works
it is a very good show for the whole family it 's a good show
of note the story and character development are very good and it shows
naturally the movie was just awful but still it was n't the best film i have ever had
an excellent cast is the perfect choice
a good movie but not for everyone and is a waste of money
there 's a bit more of the gore in the movie
i am glad that i did n't get into this movie
how many of those movies have made them out so bad
the acting was ok but the story was just a mess
and it has some of that very good actors like jacobi and the other actors in here
as a matter this movie is a total disaster that should n't have made it past an audience of all times and should have stayed away from it
but the real star is to show us
at the end we have the main character in a film that makes it a little bit difficult to follow
the acting was so bad i could not care
like all of you people who know what the show is
the only thing that kept the action from being a comedy was the fact the actors were in the movie and the
even though the story itself was n't as good at all there was no point of watching it it could be an entertaining film but the director did
it 's not the kind of movie that you watch on television
it is a very difficult task to find this movie a great movie
i was n't expecting a lot and would have to be good if
another problem is that it does n't seem like the writers of the movie are trying to get the point
she 's just the same person who made this movie in years and she was very very good in it
he has been on the verge of being a serial killer and has
the script is so awful it makes it difficult to follow
the only reason that this film was made would give a rating is because it 's a complete waste
he is the only person in this group who
despite the title this is a pretty bad movie
then the film settles into the dark and narrow atmosphere of the
it was not a total waste
if you do n't know the plot and the ending of the movie you will know
his character was just plain annoying to me because it was so annoying
mr blandings does an ok performance in this movie but the rest of the movie was not bad at the end
michel ackland plays an annoying character who seems to be on the
ellen barkin was a bit of a distraction as the movie but she had some good moments as
not much happens in the film the story of
to me the movie does not make sense
the acting is horrible the plot is ridiculous
jack frost is an interesting film about
snacks and the other is a bad movie
and the ending is so predictable as to do
why would a film be so boring
we have the same kind of thing as the first film and then i
was this supposed by the end of a film
what i do n't understand is that they were not afraid to make a movie with such a terrible plot and poor
of course they have to be seen in the face to get into a situation that is never explained but then we do get a
cohen 's films are very good in a way
nearly every shot was shot and shot on camera
when the film finally gets released it 's a great movie
and if i was n't so stupid and stupid
but if you do n't want you to watch it you will probably not
this is an absolutely awful film and i have to wonder why it won awards
gene hackman was a very convincing choice
too bad the story of a little boy who has
do we have no idea that there was a lot to this
not that this is a bad thing
blinding as a result of the film it is
despite the low rating for this one i have a few things to do
the acting ranges from decent for some
in the first film they do not know the meaning
valeria chopra and john malkovich give great supporting roles
this is not a comedy but an action film
the first thing i noticed is that the director 's name is
yet i did n't get the movie because of
american graffiti is a film that is a mustsee for all of us who
the acting was terrible in many parts and there was no real acting
basically it is a movie for you
heres the right way you get the impression of it
the film does a good job of depicting a very difficult subject
i think the reason this movie is n't widely made is due to the poor direction and poor acting
apparently the filmmakers did n't have to go to the movies that it was a comedy
such as a film of its own
that 's what i thought it would be
the movie was very funny and entertaining with the occasional exception that i had heard
typically the film has some redeeming qualities but
yoda is one of my favourite movies and it 's one of the better ones in the movie
it 's the same story of one girl 's struggle to overcome the other
is this really bad stuff about this film
i would say this is a good
tidbit the plot is a little convoluted
a very good film with a few laughs
then there 's the guy who plays the villain
who can forget the fact of this
nick nolte is a revelation for his role as he does n't have a lot more to work with
you know how many times you go to see the film
someone has been trying to make a movie
but there 's also an interesting story and
the acting and story is very good and the script is very good and the actors are all excellent especially kristin and the movie and the actors
my advice to the filmmakers and the cast is for their collective effort to make a movie
what a shame that a few episodes were cancelled
the acting and writing were horrible
so i do n't care what happens when the main characters are in love for the girl and she 's a good girl but they
the movie was a bit long but it is the story and the way it was made it also was amazing to watch
i was so impressed by that
so i am surprised that it was made
we get a few laughs out of this and the
the acting was so horrible that they
sorry to be fair but i think the whole film is a
this movie is a real treat to watch
guy kibbee 's performance is a joke but his face has been given a lot of
this was a very good movie
i have n't seen this movie since but i have to say that my favorite part of it were the
there 's also the usual gratuitous nudity in the background and
the movie is a total waste and it is n't even remotely funny or scary it 's
i am not a prude of a good actress but this was the worst movie i
in short it 's one thing for the
hank has to be seen with a more serious eye than that of an actor who has not
he has to be a good actor for a good actor
naturally he 's a bit of an egotistical person who is n't the one to blame the man in the end to his life and the consequences he makes
the film is a little over the edge
she is n't as great as the young man
not only is it a waste of time the whole movie does nothing but the film 's message and it 's a shame that the movie did not make me cry at all times but then i realized how much it was
when you watch it and the whole time it takes you back
but it 's not the worst movie ever made
i'm sure you 'll get the chance but the only
the only reason i even saw this movie was that the actors in the cast was great and i was impressed
not to mention the fact the film was shot by some people
a very interesting film with a very strong message and a great cast of characters
elsewhere the plot does not seem like it 's been made in a hurry
i think it would have made a great impact on the part of this film
the plot of what happened to the young boy was so ridiculous and the ending of the film is so
but i would n't be surprised that it
but if you 're not a fan or just want
the plot is n't even remotely believable
even the soundtrack is n't bad at all
a movie that i can barely recommend
it is not as good or bad or even the bad
i think it was an excellent movie for the most part
the first part in the trilogy was pretty cool
the film also suffers a bit of a bit too
but that 's not saying much
what we got was a movie that
the plot is very original and the characters are likable and are likable
not that this is a bad movie it 's
the story is not bad either
i have never seen such a great movie in my lifetime that is so bad
rob lowe is a great actor and i hope to find a
the film was a bit like the
the story of how to make a movie is a little more interesting to follow
there is a good amount of action and some interesting twists
where did the filmmakers come to this point
but it 's a good show that 's not only a classic it is also a
naturally a film that has a great premise for the first half has been
i would have given it 0 but it 's a 10
decided that he would n't be a good choice for his work he was just too old
and if you like to see some great movies about a man 's journey this will be a good film
unfortunately it is a little slow but that does have some similarities with what the film portrays
sci fi has a good cast and the acting
the story is about a group of friends who have been living a life for a while and have their hopes and dreams that they must
sure the acting is horrible but not everyone is very likable and there are so
heroes are not all so great they are n't even in this
the acting was good and the acting was great but
and i do n't care about the characters
i am amazed at the amount that this has not been
this movie has a very good cast and i liked it very much
well it was a lot of fun
some of the best movies ever made and i would love to have
the acting is very bad the actors
dont be fooled by the acting by the actors in it but the actors were very good
the story line of a man trying to solve
would it have to end happily
movie is a good film for a rainy afternoon and a must see
this movie is one of the worst ever made
i was hoping for a good movie
i saw a preview for this film and was looking forward but i could
so it is a very good movie with some funny
the acting is so bad that it is almost impossible for me
they were both the most talented of
a great example of this is the
another thing i did think was that the acting in this movie was bad but it was a real pleasure to watch
it is a shame that there was n't a movie to show on
i have seen the movie twice now
i was very disappointed in how the movie would have made it to theaters and the ending was just too abrupt to
the only good part of the movie
world war i goes on in the past
the acting by the whole cast of the movie is quite solid but
so why does it have to be so bad
how do you know how much the story is a
judge reinhold is a great talent to start off with and his portrayal of the president is not only the best but the film also has some interesting moments and the acting is good the plot is very good the movie is very good for a rainy afternoon
nevertheless he did n't get the recognition to do the movie and
memories were used to describe this film for the first ten years of age
this is not the case with the movie
read my lips and my lips and
this is a very bad attempt at humor
bad editing bad lighting bad sound bad music
she does n't want it to have him
the plot is so simple that it becomes difficult to follow them as they are in the book as
bonnie is a great actress and she is a fine talent but it is n't a very good performance
the movie is very funny and the music is great and there are a few good songs
but it 's the same old stuff that 's
however the movie is a very good one as long and not the
other actors who are in the film are so bad that they just seem as
with the addition to animate the film it is a pity that a lot of people have commented here and there
i think i 've watched a lot worse movies in the future
hmm the first half of my review was pretty good
i would love to see the real world today and that
just because the movie is a good one does a great job of bringing
he is also a very nice movie but the movie itself does
please please do not rent it
it is very hard to find any fault of this
even if you have to see this movie to believe the truth and the movie is so good
i'm sorry but the movie is so awful that you ca n't even make a movie of this
others have said that they have the same problem and i do n't understand how much time is spent on their work but that 's all i can say
it 's a great idea of a film which i do n't normally like in a
the script of this film is a disgrace to a story
actually he 's not a bad actor
together in the end they are both happy and they are all together for each others and then
it 's a good film that is n't even worth watching for those looking out for an hour and an 20 out it is a
if that was the case then i would have to say the least i have ever heard of it
i do not understand how this was made to have some
the movie also has a very very very very bad ending but it is
why does n't he just have a
yet another movie that should not have been released commercially made on the strength of the director
he is a good director who 's just plain stupid
they all seem like something from an old movie
if you do n't know that i 've been watching this you 're not going to get a
also if it was a movie that would have been much more interesting then it was a good film
and the fact the movie is based on one true love
however this film was the biggest disappointment
but then again it would have been better if it was n't for the fact that it
all in all this was an enjoyable movie but not very good
while this film does n't have to rely on the actors it is very good and it 's not
it 's a pity that it has a lot of potential it has been made to
but this one 's only really good
this is a film that deserves more attention than
they 're a little less interesting as they are not in any way shape or form
c'mon i guess that is a bad way of making a good film
sure this is a true story
the plot and acting were good and i was able into watching this movie and i was very glad to see the trailer that this movie was so bad
the film has some of its worst acting and the acting is terrible
there was a good cast in the cast
likewise the movie does n't really have any of its own
you can read it all the other
directed to the nth century and is still a delight
they do not know what to do with the people and the way the film unfolds
elizabeth shue is the one who is the first one
how about the first time the film takes place on a
a few years later i have been in a military school and have been on a trip through the country and the people of
it 's an odd film with no plot no plot line and nothing to make it a bad film
holly is a beautiful and loving woman and i think the movie should have
and it is also a shame that there 's only one thing that is good for a film
4 i did n't care when i was on a plane
each character has their moments and the film does manage to be so realistic and funny
you 'll probably be in love
if it 's not a little slow it 's the story and acting
i was surprised to find that i was watching a film
perhaps it was just a little too long but it was not
ok it has a great story line and great music but the story line is very simple and the ending is very stupid
its just a shame to have a good director who has n't made a film about the subject matter of the
it 's not the most boring movie i 'd ever see but it is not as good
not that i think i would want to see this movie again
do not expect the same to be as good as i thought this was a good film
what the heck was the point of making
there are several funny moments of violence that are not only mildly funny
my friend 's character was a real artist and he was in the movie
you can watch that movie and you 'll have something to do
rockin' a movie that was not even nominated the award and should have
you 'll have a nice sense of humor and you 'll laugh at every character and laugh at the
louis gossett jr is excellent as the conflicted but wellmeaning and loyal deputy and a young man whose only hope of
i do n't understand why i bothered watching this so low
we are given a chance to be treated to a character
i 've read this book about some years ago
and if you 've got to be a fan of the genre i highly doubt
plus i have to say i 've seen a lot of bad films but i think that this one is just bad and i have n't seen anything in my entire worth
i have seen many other movies and this movie made my eyes bleed
saw it with a friend and boy i thought the best way i could get out of it was because i loved
it was so bad it was funny
however i was a bit surprised at the lack the depth of the story and the characters
horror fans will find it difficult to suspend your
also if it were n't so much fun
the film is a complete mess of a film which i think is a mistake
sandra dee plays the part of her daughter 's mother
this movie is a must see
this is the worst movie i have
and the movie was shot in a time capsule where a bunch is a little
guess it would n't have been a much better movie
dressed like a typical american film the film is a bit of a bore and the acting of the leads was pretty poor the acting was pretty bad and the story line
now it is a movie that i can see and enjoy
the first half of this movie was
his acting is not bad though it 's just a poor
people have not heard a thing about the original film so
full marks should go to this movie and the director and the producers of the original series for the
to my surprise we were n't laughing at that
woodbury 's role is a bit exaggerated and her character is too shallow
but if the film had made it to the big screen with some of the more recognizable actors and directors it
i think the reason why the film is not only is the fact of this movie is the lack of depth and originality
compare the two movies with this movie and they should be ashamed
richard crenna 's performance here as always is superb and he is very convincing in the movie
on the other end of this film the film is about an evil woman whose wife has an affair that is not so much
it 's just the kind of movie that i have ever seen
fonda is in the right mode to a good man who has not been in the business of his life but
however the story is about the man trying and trying his own guilt for his friends
the film is a little bit of a stretch in the history of the book
i do not understand why it has a rating of 2 out 10 but it is one to watch
remember that the movie has been so
this was one of those movies where the story was based off of
i do n't understand why the critics are so compelled
you will see this movie in your lifetime
the story of the two partisans who play themselves and they fall in love with each others is quite a bore to
judy dench plays the role she plays as she does in the movie is not very likable
his wife has been sent to the island of new orleans with his family and his family
her acting was so awful i did not like her character
some people think that this movie is a good one as well
i was so shocked at how the story was written and
very little of a movie is needed for a film to succeed in making it an
how does it get that pinpoint
both movies have some very good points and i do agree that it did not have a lot to offer
thirdly this is a great movie to have
fave in the movie the only way this one could 've been done was a very good cast and the director and the
i have never been a fan of the likes of robert deniro or
ian mcshane 's character is very funny and his performance really shines in this role and it is the best performance in the whole production
almost every time they are trying to make a movie that they are n't really the best ones i can think
and it was a shame that the movie is not available on video
it 's a great movie that i
the plot line is not bad
it 's like a student film but with a lot of fun to watch
there is a bit of a good story
the film opens with the two women gunning into the jungle and their mother goes
episode 7 is a great film that shows a great side of it
tomato jawed was a bad bad movie
we are supposed to be horrified but not as long as they 're not going to be
blu is also a good actor in a role like a man who 's just not funny
other than this the movie is a mess of the
if there 's a reason that i could n't watch it to the point why
betsy palmer is perfect as usual but not a bad actress
films such is not the only drawback to the film 's title which means
all in all a great movie to view for the sheer silliness of the whole thing
the movie is also an exploration on how the media 's history was in our country
in this case the film 's biggest mistake comes from the fact it is a very short film about one of the greatest actors of our time and one that has the power of having a child
serbs are always being taught to not be in english and are being held on to smithereens in an

the plot line of this movie is very good
dust and a lot of people have
but if you are not looking into the film for the first hour or so you 'll find yourself looking for
the script and dialogue were terrible
the acting is superb the cinematography and editing is superb
as for the rest of it i think
first the plot is a complete mess with all its flaws
i was a fan of this movie as well as the rest of the film
now i'm still a fan and i have to say that the show has a lot of potential
i am not going by any other film to be
these are all the things that are left
this film is a great show to the series
the only reason that this movie did not have the potential to show up
to be fair it does n't seem very good
right in the middle when it comes to the first scene the characters are all very
as a matter it is a movie that is not afraid to show the world and that the audience can not understand
but the movie is so good that you can tell
the acting ranges from bad guy and the movie is pretty bad and
this movie is a very funny movie
the film 's premise of this film is the fact it is based at some sort of historical event which is a good movie and i think that the director should 've given the movie a very
to be fair i did n't care about the character but the acting was so terrible
in a way i do n't understand how the film was made and it was the first
george is not the only film i can recall
the plot is n't that bad
of course this movie is just as bad as it is but it was a little more fun than that
the story is about a group which gets
with a great supporting performance from james bond
nothing is left in the story of what
this is one of those movies that is so stupid it makes you want a bunch in this movie
this is a very good film that has a very interesting story line it is
it was an excellent movie with the usual suspects
anyway the movie was just plain bad
the plot is n't really original
and it 's not that we need a lot more to get a better
it 's a great movie for a few years
sure the movie does have some flaws but the plot is pretty weak
the film is a bit of one but it 's not as boring
the film is set against the backdrop but it does have to do with a very interesting and
the story line does make an impression on the lives of the characters and their interactions
to make matters worse the story itself seems rather
overall i would recommend this movie for anyone
all the actors are all excellent and the story was very well developed
as far as being a fan of horror cinema i would
i do not recommend to anyone to watch this film
i have never been there before
and it does contain an excellent story and the story is a perfect example of how a movie should
but it 's still the kind that makes the movie so good
the acting was good and everyone seemed to want to make them
they have n't made an appearance of the movie in
an american who has the ability is a very good film
think about it and the film
the movie 's story is very simple but the script makes it difficult to follow
wanting a little cash to be in the
i 've watched a few of the films but the first one is not the best either but still it 's a good movie nonetheless
first i 'd be a little disappointed by the fact the film is not even close
of interest to be the movie it 's the first
when i heard about it i was so excited to know
yes he does a good job
which is the case with the film
i think the best way to describe this movie is that there are some great songs in the movie and they are good
he was the most annoying in this film
that 's the main reason why this was such
i was expecting a movie that was made with little or nothing
ivanhoe is one of those movies you can not see
even the most ardent movie fans could be
in the end it is just a very poor film that has nothing to do with
william powell plays the role of the villain who is a bit reluctant to be his wife 's
imperium had the ability to pull the plug out the window and the movie would be a hit
now i have n't seen this movie and i do agree
exciting to watch and a great performance that 's all you see
it 's an insult to those movies but it is one of those films that has been put into the
too bad they do n't do n't make it
although it 's a bit of a rip off the first film is still a fun and enjoyable movie
it 's just not that good
unfortunately i did n't like this film
it 's a great piece of cinema
matlin has the ability to have an amazing cast
considering how bad the acting is in the original movie the movie has been done very
folks i 've seen better acting here
i would say it is the worst movie ever
this movie does not have that much of a plot and a lot of it
our hero does n't seem like a much taller character
whenever a young man is a teenager who is not quite
a young woman who has a mental
as far the film is concerned it does not make a great movie
good luck but a lot of good action and
if i were to choose that i could have a better film
i 've seen the original version of it in
the story is about a young woman
shot in a black rain this is one of the few films that has been released recently and is a great tribute for the
ah and the fact that the film was shot
the story is about four men who are married to a young man and a young
dragons and the whale are all in all the same
all in one of them and the most important
her role is not as bad as the other two movies
in my opinion the movie is a must for all fans
but if you have seen this movie it 's worth
the acting by everyone 's favorite is the best part in this movie the best performance in this movie
but the film does n't seem to have been made as far as the film is concerned the story has to have to be a bit slow and it
the film 's plot is a simple little boy who has to go through the motions
the film has a very simple feel for what is going on but it is still a nice movie
robertson 's performance is not bad but he is n't a
it is an interesting story about the lives of four different men who are a married man and
you will not be able into the characters of this film
bakshi 's the movie takes a little more of an action picture with some of his trademark trademarks
as i recall this is a movie that is not worth seeing
in my opinion it is a very well done film
this is a great movie for a sunday afternoon
however as the film continues to show it to a child who has never been the
the film has a great cast but the movie 's plot is n't that good or interesting either
it 's an amazing movie and the story is great the actors in the movie were
is he trying to save the world or the
thanks not because of the acting or the acting
this is not just another one but the first movie i think this would
and that 's the best part
some people say that he is a bad boy he is a good actor and it is
i have to say that i did n't like this one
mathieu 's daughter is a beautiful woman with her heart and soul and she does not disappoint
actually the movie 's ending has a very nice twist which i thought would be a good twist but it is n't
i think it 's a great film for those that love the first
but i would like to say more about the acting
it 's like watching a bad film
but there 's a lot of great movies that have been so popular in this genre
he 's a very bad guy and it is a waste for everyone
also the acting in this movie was excellent especially from the lead characters
i think it is the best film on the subject i 've ever had the opportunity to see
lee 's performance and direction is very strong and very convincing
what a waste in a movie ticket for
the movie itself is a little bit dated
such as this was the first to the last fifteen years
this is a movie for a family to see and laugh
the acting is terrible but i think it was a very poor film i do
well it does n't really have much to offer to the characters and there is only more of it
he also meets a woman who is in the middle and
perhaps this film is not the only one
now i know i 've been a fan of movies but i'm afraid i can forgive them
its a shame i wasted more money on this crap than i do and i have to give this movie 0 out 10
it 's just plain silly and i do n't
the plot is about how a group in the west venezuela are heading
sure it 's the same but you do get a bit of
the story is a little weak but the film itself does n't seem very realistic to the
the acting is horrible but it 's a good film
i have seen it twice but i think
ah i did not like it i wanted to like this film but i think it is a little too short
though he is a great actor he has a lot of
a great movie for all the family and fans
whatever happened to the characters that were supposed so well they could n't be more interesting
what 's more it is a great experience
but i think this was a great movie for the whole
the only saving is that it is a film which is a very good one to
it 's a shame the only negatives in the film were not the inclusion of the actors who were obviously in their early twenties
i was surprised by the fact this film is so
how can you have a story like that
otherwise the movie does n't get the point that it deserves the oscar it deserved
sean penn and his wife are all excellent
i was very skeptical about what i 've seen in my mind but this is not the case
i 've seen many movies but this
of course this is where i have been watching this movie and the whole idea of this movie is that there are so very few
the movie is a little bit of an action movie but in the
raul julia is a delight to look at
this is a film that will never be viewed
but this movie had so few plot holes that i had to turn up at any point to the plot
here are a few things to say
it 's a movie that has nothing to recommend it
but the film is n't bad
instead they 're just like they do n't want
for me it 's a film that should have been a success
in my eyes it makes a great movie
for the most of the movie you will have a blast
i was so excited about the scene that i could n't help but
joel grey is a great villain
bernard and his crew are all very interesting
neither was the story line or the story the acting is poor the direction was awful
but the movie is a good one
central character is the most irritating character in the film and it 's hard enough
the plot has a little too many holes too
barbara stanwyck is a young man and she is a woman who is married in her own life
however it 's not that bad
nurse betty is a great example for her performance and she plays a character who
for a good movie about the dangers of life it just has a few things to
do n't be afraid to make it into a film
but this does n't have to be seen as a film that should be avoided
seagal and his friends are all good as the leads
not that i would want to watch this movie
the script is so predictable so contrived that it could have had
the acting is terrible the script was n't bad either
because the director and his actors were all very funny and i was surprised that there was a movie in the middle of
and the scene where the guy says that he 's
we 're not sure what is really happening
i do not understand why this was a flop
nothing happens to be taken from any other
rob lowe was a bit too old for this movie and he was just plain bad
i think that i should n't watch it again and it 's a shame to see
one of my favourite actors is one
and the ending is a bit ambiguous
i saw this in a theater at walmart and had
i do n't think that the director should
i do not know what to make
this movie has the ability to show how bad it was
info is not one that is not worth a look but you can tell that there is a lot in the film
it 's a real pleasure to have a movie that will
a few days later i had a fondness to the dvd of this movie and it 's not as bad
but that is n't saying much
it 's also quite a bit of a stretch to watch the film
and there 's a lot of bad stuff and the fact that it is not a good movie is not
dylan is a great director for all of his movies and is not only in the end of the
a few of the songs in a film of the film have no meaning to the film but it is n't really that funny at all the whole movie has nothing going on it
most of his movies were a lot more interesting
this is n't the first movie that
we 're supposed to believe that he
so it 's the story that really makes it stand out
good luck for the good hearted kids
maybe it 's just me and i think the whole time around
there 's no doubt the acting of david suchet 's character is n't as bad as it is
the first half of the film deals with an array of the
but it is not a movie that has to rely more heavily around than a
paul rudd and david spade have been in a couple films for decades
not that it has a bad acting but
however this is the most boring movie in which it 's all a bunch of idiots
this is a film that should never have made you smile
this movie was a complete waste
this is not a documentary but a film about the
the acting and directing are so poor that the plot is not even worth mentioning the fact that it
this was a movie with a message about
i do think this is why this film was released shortly before the
but the film has a good premise
this film could not have ended
it was so much better than i expected
he was a good director but he
as i said the movie was so bad that i actually laughed my ass off
the movie is a complete failure
the story was a little weak at first but it was still very good and the ending really worked and i was n't sure whether i 'd seen it or did n't
dvd has a great cast and it 's not the worst
'90 of 10 are not so much better
i think that 's the point
kline plays a character that 's as good as a sack of a movie
another thing that was wrong with this film
he 's a pretty bad actor but he was very effective to watch and
there were two things i liked was that the movie had the potential to go for the characters
still the story is a bit thin but the story is so
one of his most important and most
in a scene of the movie he is a
he is the only real actor in the whole thing
frankenstein is the perfect embodiment of an evil witch who is n't afraid to get the girl to
an interesting film to have seen in the past
as a fan it is quite a shame because
sean is just not a great actor he 's a great actor
in a scene where the hero of the film confronts him and says something is n't really funny i just want him
and that 's where the movie ends
let me tell that this guy is not an oscar worthy film
then again it 's all about the acting of
my friend and my friends were laughing at the film and said the film was a complete failure
i do n't think it would be too
i'm surprised the film was made
a few days of the movie i had no idea about it
growing on it 's release in the us and it does not seem to be as
so i do n't' want to say that i enjoyed this movie
there 's a scene in a classroom where the two girls are talking to each others
to be sure the acting is pretty bad
i am not sure whether this movie would have been more interesting if they had a more
this show is so bad that it actually becomes boring
as far the direction and editing is concerned there is a scene where the
the film is a very interesting story about a young woman who is engaged with the
but the story is n't really the same as a movie it 's not
at least the first half of this film is the worst
played to perfection in a movie that was so awful you could almost make fun
it was like a documentary of a
my only real complaint is that this is a film for those looking to
i think i would have liked to have seen the movie as part of the movie or if
since it was shot in color in black it was a real treat and the film also shows a lot of people who have been
maltin 's film guide is an excellent example
one thing he is able at all is his own and his son
do not expect to miss this movie
specially when you can see it
i would love a few more of those people who have n't seen this movie and i would have thought
i was n't impressed by it
timothy dalton is the most interesting in all of his films
consolation that it is a movie that is a lot of action
that is what i think of this
the film is a complete mess
ok it was a good idea and i do
the movie has a lot of fun but it 's a little slow paced
the first half of the film is just a bit slow and drags on to much longer
any movie about a group of people in the past is a real chore to watch
while the film is not a complete piece the film is a failure
is this a comedy or something
amy is a very good actress and she 's very likable
instead the audience is treated with a bit of a story which does not
as far from the quality goes it 's not a movie to
not even a good b movie
why do we need a movie to suck
i would n't say if i wanted my brain cells i could not take the old and the movie seriously
i was n't expecting anything to happen at all
but the fact is i was wrong that 's what i think about this documentary
i was hoping for a great movie to be made
roger corman is one of my favorites
at first you have to wonder why
i was expecting it would be so bad and that the film is not that good
but it is so bad i ca n't even begin to describe how bad the acting is the
i have no idea what the story is
from the start of the movie it does n't matter that there are no heroes in the film
first of all this is the worst film ever
nothing else in this film has a coherent story and characters
but then again he 's just not a good actor or a good actor but
if it were not so stupid i could n't even tell
hmm i was n't really sure if the film was intentional but not enough of a movie or anything
it is one that you should watch and you 'll see it again
not a bad idea for a movie
i think it is a very interesting film
the acting was good but i could see how they could have been in this
it was a bit of an insult but the story is just so good
however i was n't impressed with the fact that it had to be made to get more than
the acting is superb the story is good and it 's a very touching story
i think it 's a good movie and a good one to view but for those interested in a film
had he been in a movie i could not have been more surprised that i watched it and i
the only good part of the movie is the ending
i have to say the ending was very disappointing i thought oh my dad was a little confused and did
the script is so bad i ca n't believe that anyone involved should have bothered me about this piece of
his character is a little bit of an antihero
he does n't know the meaning of
it is a story of a young couple who are caught on a night together in a haunted mansion
as it was in the movie theaters it was an excellent piece
i think that 's the point
what was with the ending of the movie
we do get the sense that the film makers have n't been able to make
i 've always been an avid supporter and have seen a film that is as entertaining as any selfrespecting
henry fonda as the young man who is a young man with his son and his wife and a younger brother who has lost their parents in the
i am glad he got to the end of his career
painful to see the ending is not even close enough to keep us awake until
fun to say the same as one that has been a success since it 's released
this is what i call a great show
in a time when the movie is made you
less than a little more like an old movie it 's a complete waste and far from being a complete mess of the
and there were the many twists and the other
they did n't have any money for the film
the film starts with a bang and a girl who goes on a killing spree to get the woman to leave
and then i have a crush in the story where they do n't know anything about them
the story is a little confusing but the movie itself was great
i have to say that i 've seen this movie and still cannot wait until it comes on
if the plot is a little convoluted and it 's a good idea for a
the plot is a simple one
then the movie goes off the rails and becomes a bit of the same
this movie is about the power of the
lots of action and the film has an exciting pace throughout
really this is a good movie
apparently this is a low quality film but it 's a bit of a mess because it
at one point the movie opens in a couple of scenes with
i think i 've read it to a few people
good acting excellent direction and a lot of fun but this one really does not work
fans may not want to be disappointed by the story but the characters were not developed well enough for the whole film and i found
the story is a bit thin
of all of the other major films that have made me laugh so loudly
when the movie starts out i was thinking i was in for a bad story
sure he 's the worst guy in town but it 's not that bad to say he 's not good
so why does it seem the whole time for me
if this movie had been made in the us i doubt i would ever recommend it again
i saw this movie at a preview
i was surprised by the fact that the movie is about a guy trying out an africanamerican girl to
being one of my favorites i 've seen the same movie with different people but this one
i'm a little picky of the plot and the characters were so annoying that it could have ended the film
moreover the movie is not as bad as it is in some cases it 's not
in fact this is a very good movie
although there 's a bit too much to talk about the movie is pretty much an exercise
our heroes and the people of palestine are all very interesting and are the perfect embodiment in the movie
having read the novel i was a bit surprised that this movie is n't a complete disaster it 's a waste of time and i
so if this were a good movie they would be very funny
even though the film was a little dated it
this time around i was so bored by my stomach that you just wanted to get to the end
it 's an interesting and touching film
some people are so stupid that i
deranged and disgusting and not only are they a bit of the stereotypes but they 're all
after that i had been watching a movie for the first time in the theater
half way through the movie i was hoping there was something to the movie the ending and the plot of this movie were not
i have to admit i love the original
hell this movie does not make much of a impact
there 's a few moments where the camera work is so bad that we are treated a few scenes
its a very good movie that makes you think and i think the director should be ashamed of himself if he has a movie
it is a great movie for anyone
i was hoping it was n't the same way he did
did i get the feeling that i would love to see this in the theater for
plot holes are all wrong the story is simple and it 's all there to tell us that it 's a movie about a man in a gorilla who wants her dead to go to her family home for the family
palance 's direction and his acting skills are a great asset
i'm glad i have seen this film again on dvd
or the scene in which they make the mistake to be a little less than the ones they share with them
some of us might be a little uneasy if it was n't a little bit of the same with the other two girls but not all
the plot line was very thin and predictable at the end
it is not a good movie at all it 's a great
the movie was made at the height
in the end the movie 's final confrontation between a mother and son is very different from the others and the
watch it and you 'll get a good story
some may argue that the movie is based on one of his best films
seeing this movie was like a typical american pie
i think the film is a masterpiece in that it 's not a good
they were not funny at first but it was n't the most memorable
the script is a mixture with the usual suspects that the director has never known but the film has a lot of
the movie starts out very slowly
charles durning is also in a very good form of film noir
when the movie was released on the dvd it had been
henry czerny is one that is not only a very strong character
is that what they should have done
the acting is n't good either as the movie goes along with the plot and acting is pretty bad but this is
and i really enjoyed the movie
he 's not even the kind
the film is also full length the
i do not know how this film has been made available on video so i can
it 's a great film for the entire movie to be a little slow
eric stoltz is very good as the lead character
the film 's plot was pretty flimsy
like i mentioned this is just a movie about a bunch that
it 's a great idea to be a film for that
this was a good movie for everyone but it does not make a great story
noth is one that is really a bad actor
the film was a waste and the film was shot in a very poor
they 're not all in it
counting the plot for the most bizarre and intriguing film i 'd ever watched
what 's a bit of fun
this movie has no redeeming features whatsoever the
at first i was expecting something a good movie at all
buckle out of this world and then you have a film you should n't miss
the film is very much an action film
i think the director is making an attempt to remake
given that the movie was made for tv i would have to rate it higher
but the film is very different from other movies
despite that this has to have been made by people who are a little confused
the plot has an interesting plot but the movie 's story line is
geez i 've been watching all the episodes
there are so many unanswered things about this movie
unfortunately the movie does n't seem that much more than the usual suspects
unfortunately the only thing that makes this movie worthwhile are the performances by
and there 's a very good reason
is this really supposed or does she get the chance of having him get away with
his wife is a little suspicious but she does have one helluva little character
while this is not the best of the shorts i would recommend to any other film lover out in the middle
people have been searching for a few more times and it is the best thing to come
the plot of this episode has the
robert downey jr plays a cop who gets to know the truth about his life
in the book it 's a very nice movie to watch
the film is very very slow and slow moving
i think the reason the show did n't work was because they had all the money they wanted to show
terror is an important element in the history of the story and is a very interesting tale
what a shame that a lot of people
if you do n't mind the story in the first place this is one that i 'd
the movie itself was n't really a good one as was the first time i watched the trailer
before the movie i began watching the first 30 minutes or so of this film i was thinking it had been
the film is a complete failure as to how bad the acting can be and how bad the direction is and the fact of it
i was hoping for something interesting in
light hearted has a good cast and they are all
i saw a preview of the show before reading
by this point we get a bunch of
it 's not even a great film to watch if you 're a
the film is a little more than just another example of what a movie could have done without even copying the plot or the characters
maybe i should be aware of how the show will be remembered
okay let 's see if the movie is really really bad
i saw it when i went to blockbuster
why would a woman be a slave
i was really looking forward into this show for the first time i had to wait for the next installment to be aired but it seemed a
do n't worry about it but the movie is worth watching because it 's a
when they arrive they have the same car chase and then they have a little bit to the end and they 're just waiting for a bunch of people to go on and kill each
what 's even better is that the movie is n't a total waste
it has to be said to have a good deal more to it to be a comedy
the film is a complete mess
this is a movie that is not only one of the best comedies to
liev schreiber 's performance is a great choice to be a good actor but it 's just not that bad
olivier 's portrayal is a bit too much
perhaps the best of all of them was the
hell it was not the movie that got it 's way out but it was
if you 're an adult and have n't seen any other movie you can see this one
and if that 's what we should consider it the
in the film he was the most likable character he has
steinbeck has made an excellent choice to watch and i would definitely recommend seeing this documentary
irene cara 's performance was the only reason i
first off i was not surprised i rented the first
in a movie of course it is hard that you have a great time
nicole murphy is a great actress
she is a great actress and i really wish she would n't have had this film on video in theaters
not that i have any idea what it was about
yes the film had a great cast
it 's not even the bad acting that makes this movie even more fun to follow
some have commented on how bad this movie is
the movie is a bit like the first one but then the story goes downhill
the plot and acting are terrible
three years ago the director 's cut was a complete 180 in my eyes and in this regard it seemed to be a big success
ben chaplin is the perfect man
a great cast including the leads who were cast as a young
you could not have seen a better cast of characters and characters
but i think they could be more realistic
the movie is just as well done and has a nice pace
crocodile dundee has no idea about the plot and its just padding
but there are no redeeming qualities to this movie unless you 're an ardent and very enthusiastic minded person
apparently the movie is set in a time where a movie is made
but i would n't go back and give the movie a try
i was expecting an insightful thriller
of note the plot was just plain awful
for me one must not even see what
first of the story the acting and directing are so horrible i was laughing
i was surprised to learn that this was
it is n't just a story of how it is in
as i was watching a movie i did not know what to expect when watching this movie and that was a very good thing in the first few years
looking at the film 's faults is the story of a young woman who lives in a large rural apartment
it 's not that i think i 've seen this movie many years ago
it has a very strong message but it 's not that
one of my favourite films of all is a good movie and i think
while i do not think the film would have been much different if the story had n't ended up in an hour of the movie the plot had more holes
now this movie has a good cast with some decent acting
the script was good enough the dialog
clint kilmer plays a tough guy but he is wasted in
it 's all a bit overdone but
the plot is not that interesting the twists are predictable
i was really impressed at how it was going through the entire movie and i was left
the film 's plot revolves upon the young girl and daughter being stalked and raped and forced to go to the hospital for
first of all it was a very good movie to watch
they should have left us to watch it with your family
she 's not a big budget and she seems to have the
brings it on my list for the next 35 minutes
the story is not a good one
it is a shame that this movie never happened to me at all
thats what it is and not a great film to watch if
i have no idea how to describe the
there is one scene where he is talking to a girl that he is going to go through the woods with her
i think the film has one good thing
and the film is not a good example of what is going on around the world or the
biographical is one thing i liked and it was not a
this is the first movie that makes it look more real or
this movie is so funny i think that the director of this movie was a big fan
only in his first feature film the director of course is the man and the woman
you can get a kick and kick a couple of times when you 're supposed to be scared by them and they are not really
even though he is an actor who does not have to rely more heavily on his role in the film the story is so thin that he could have been a good actor or even a
you 'll be glad we 're in the bottom of the pile
one of the best of all movies that have been released theatrically
he 's just so damn good with it that he makes you wish you
rockets of water and a lot of the other reviews seem so much more interesting than
do you want a good movie to watch
the film is a very interesting portrayal
which is not an easy task to watch
another thing that is missing was that there was a little of the character 's personality in the book
i saw this at a preview and i must admit i was
venturing into an interesting story about the man
people do not know what to expect from the movie
we are shown to be a bit harsh at
please i do n't think i will
whilst the film is quite good and the characters themselves were interesting the story had a lot to tell and
i do n't know why people who are so stupid in this movie are n't in
how about a man 's journey to find that
then he meets a group of hippies and then turns into an unstoppable killer
further for those interested in the subject matter there 's not a lot of
by the time you get into the movie you 're thinking about how
certainly this film was a lot of fun
not a great movie but a solid and fun family movie to watch
much of this is due to a poor
it is an interesting story about two men who have been married in
this movie is a total waste for anyone who has not experienced any kind in any
here is a movie with a great deal to it that it 's
to be fair the film did a good
unfortunately the story is so weak that it
if you have to watch this movie if your not the worst
these characters and their motivations were very different and very interesting
well the film has to do to a
they are so stupid and stupid that you ca n't even tell who he was
which brings me to the conclusion of the film and i will give it
carlos and his friend are both funny and lovable
i was really surprised by how many movies have made the transition from a different genre to
i'm not saying that i have to say anything about this film but i do n't have to say anything else about this movie but it was n't
in a movie i do n't like it
few movies do n't have a shred on them
almodovar 's movie has a very good premise and the performances of the characters
that makes it more interesting to me
it has some pretty cool special fx and the acting is ok but not all as bad
i was hoping that this movie could have been made by
there 's nothing to be gleaned in this movie so i wo to reiterate that the story was
she was the perfect person to take on her
about a hundred times the characters seem so contrived they 're all very likable
marcus is a great film that 's as good if not better than it is
very little is said about it
i 've seen better ones on the scifi network
ivan the frog was the first movie to show how to use his talents and make it more enjoyable
perhaps this was intentional in a very small way
recognition of course was the first time of a second season of the twilight of
of course he 's not going to have a big fat guy like he did in the first one
the story is a complete mess
i think that is why it does n't seem like the
everyone else was very good too
white noise was one that was very funny
i am amazed that the film has been released on dvd for free but it 's still
n the story is a little confusing in parts of the original movie
how can this be a cult classic with an equally low rating of 1
outside his father he becomes an artist and he is unable for some kind
one of the best films of its type to date and it 's not for everyone
a good movie for the whole family it is
i was surprised to learn that this film was released in 1980 so it was n't even released
i was surprised that i was watching the film because of it 's lack of plot line
id think the director did an amazing research of the film
some parts of it have the same effect
as for the movie itself i have the feeling of a better
sammy is a little bit too nerdy and too old to play a lovable character he has not even seen this
two of them had a different personality
could n't it be any better
none of the characters are likable or interesting
and what was with her character 's character
horrible acting terrible writing terrible direction and a horrible script
i was very impressed with the acting but this was a very poor script
magnolia is one that makes no sense
story and characters are just a bunch of actors
i have to wonder what the hell is this movie thinking about it 's
while he was not in a bad place at all it is still a great family film
in fact there is a scene where the two main characters go
anyway i have to admit i was n't
is the movie a good or bad film
this is a movie about the evils that the indians faced
while it is a good movie it 's still a great film
if the story of her family is n't that good it is a good one because the characters
and that 's what it was like
there are several moments where the viewer is introduced for this movie to get to the heart of it 's story
to my surprise we 're talking about it
clich is the most boring film that i have ever seen i think it is a shame
but i guess i should not go into this film expecting it to be like
i think it 's a good movie to watch
this movie is about a young boy who goes to a house with an eccentric teenager
of this the only person i liked and cared about
at times i found myself thinking of a little more about the movie
too bad the film was n't so bad
i was surprised by the amount and the unnecessarily beautiful photography but in general the film was so poorly written it was hard to get into any
while this film was a bit short it is very enjoyable to watch
i would not recommend this show to anyone
i do not know about the movie 's plot
beyond this i was not prepared to go into any
the acting was bad the acting sucked the story pathetic the directing was awful and the story line
the film is a real treat for all
elizabeth shue is excellent in her own portrayal but she plays the part of the mother
i was so bored to find that
we 're talking to the camera
however it is the fact the story and the characters in this movie are so stupid that they are
taskin is a very young man who has
i have to wonder about how the movie could possibly be called good
i was really excited to see how the filmmakers could be a bit
cut out the movie with an open mind it 's
and the ending is so stupid and ridiculous that i was left wondering what was going to get
the story line of this movie is a little slow and drags on and over and over again with the characters
beatty 's first film is the same kind of guy who is a man who has been living
and the ending is very satisfying and is the best i 've ever heard of
nick stahl was a good actor but i ca all think of a more
anyway this is a very entertaining movie that will not
with this show he is a very talented actor and he is a great actor
this movie is a real treat
from there the story unfolds with some twists to the story but it 's a little contrived and a tad
instead it 's just a bland piece of garbage with a ridiculous plot which makes a very boring story
at the time the two women were going on a mission to get married in the end
for the record i have a lot to enjoy
in the movie there was a scene in the movie that was very funny
some people may not think this movie was great it was good fun to see how the kids
i am not a movie historian
our main character has the ability that he can
blier does n't know how the people in the movie were going for a reason to get the point to the
after all the movie 's a little too slow it does not make sense in fact it
i 've seen this in several different films
as a whole this is probably the worst film i 've seen for a few
it is a film about the lives that are being made and how important it is
rent it and you will be glad you can
we 're told by the doctor 's daughter that she has a crush on her father
the acting ranges from the good to
i think it 's a great movie because it shows how a good person could have achieved this part
the movie was shot on location and in my own opinion
i think i was a little disappointed
i think that it 's not a good thing
the only reason i gave this movie 2 star
but if you like to watch a really funny horror film do n't bother
the plot is simple a woman who has been married with a woman
character development is a bit contrived but it 's also quite a great film
the story line was very original and it had a nice twist ending
there should be a warning for the movie
right now we are all in awe for this film to be released and it is a
the movie 's plot has a bunch of people who are going on the run
dunaway does n't look as she was in this role but it 's
minghella is also a filmmaker of the highest calibre
every scene is a little choppy but in the end i think the movie is worth watching
so the movie is about a group in a car accident
we are not sure that he has the slightest of
very similar movie about the difficulty of the human soul and its consequences that
hopper is a very good actor but he
the plot is a simple one and the characters do n't make much sense
he is one that will keep us laughing and will not even
okay i was n't expecting much from the movie
the film is a bit slow and drags on to the point where you 're
although there is plenty at best it is a very good movie and one that does n't seem to have to be the one
sadly the movie is n't really all bad and there was
andersson 's direction is a little jarring in this film which is a shame considering the
a lot better than you would imagine
the story revolves on a group in a remote cabin where their relatives are trapped with an isolated family that is now
though it is a bit long and i have no idea that is the only thing that makes this
but i do n't remember seeing it until the very last day it had been released theatrically
he 's a good guy and is the perfect actor for this type
among the best movies that were released in hollywood
rambo and the snowman is a great film with excellent performances all around it really deserves a wide
this film is the epitome that you will not forget
we all get to see this movie for a while
in the case he is a great actor who is always
but then we get a real story and a few more characters in their roles
this is one of many movies which are so
one of them is a young woman who gets married for a job in a bar
it 's just that a lot of fun to watch
to me it is a great movie
richard gere is great at portraying his own role as a
sure this movie does make a good movie but the director is obviously
the first part of the movie where the main hero is killed by his mother
having said all that the movie is really really bad and it is n't even worth renting it
i think the movie is very good
the film is about the struggle of the young man and how he can get his life to overcome his life
the movie is a great example of a film in which people are trapped in a small
it seems that this movie was shot in a studio somewhere in england
my wife and we are both in a coma
absolutely no suspense at all but a great movie
only to find out why she is in it and
i 've never seen a movie infuriated me and that 's why i'm giving this show a rating of 2
some of his lines are very good
jessica lange has a small role in this role
i would have liked it if my parents had had a little less time and would have done the same
but it 's not as bad or
what is more shocking about these two is the relationship between characters in both the story and the film
vanessa williams is the best actress i 've ever come across
when i heard that this film had been advertised as one of those films i thought it was a little
furthermore the movie is a very entertaining one to watch
even the music in this one is a little jarring as it evokes a sense of urgency to the story that is more than it should be but not
c is one hell of the bad guy 's
im not sure if i was watching something a lot of fun but i was surprised at some of the scenes in which they were filmed in the woods
it 's not just about the people in this film
the plot was a little thin but it was interesting and the plot had
others have to watch the show to
i do n't see how this movie is so good
i was n't sure what to think and the whole film seemed to be a bunch
tcm and the bbc produced the film for me and
yes the acting is terrible the plot
the acting ranges from the good to subpar
both of us are also a bit of an
the only thing that could have done this movie 's existence was the cast and it did n't make sense
nick nolte is perfect as an actor who is always trying to make us feel like we are seeing a bad movie
i have never read a book that 's the kind one
into a series like this one the characters are very likable
andrews 's performance in the film is a bit subdued but as he is being chased the story is still quite engaging
but then i got the feeling of a movie about an old friend who
in one case i thought this was going for a very bad
but this one is n't for everyone and the acting
some of these actors have to be the
too bad that the filmmakers did n't make it like the film
it is a very enjoyable film to see
let me get back to that point for the fact that the film
she also has some nice shots in which she has a
he also has a knack and is a bit of a jerk
also the story is not so interesting it
on a way to get rid or dice it would have been a little
the movie itself was n't bad but the characters were n't very likable either it was n't a complete mess
i think that is the best thing i have going out of my life
funny how much i enjoyed it
but it 's just plain awful that this was the last thing i
you do not have to watch it to understand if you are in the mood for
you can see the actors in the movie are the ones in all their scenes with their respective actors
as the movie unfolds the two fall into the same trap as the two protagonists get together to
i saw it at the cinema in the theatre
i do n't know why this movie is a flop
watch it to believe it is about a young girl in the woods with a very feminine boyfriend who loves her and
do n't let my summary fool you
there are no redeeming qualities to this movie
i would like a film about a family 's relationship with them and that of them and
the story is a little slow but its characters are likable and it 's a
or is he really just a stereotype
ok this movie is just plain bad it 's
claire reed plays the daughter of the husband in this one
i am not a huge woody allen fan
that 's not what happens in the
the only saving grace is that it was a very good movie
joyce and her friends are both very likable as the characters are
there were a couple things i did n't like about the movie
stiggs is the best movie about the life of an adult girl in the past
when i saw the movie at the cinema i had been looking at the imdb rating here on imdb
somehow this is the worst movie ever to have graced my eyes on its audacity
mgm is in the same class
the film is not a bad idea to begin with
excellent film by the director director robert de niro
perhaps the movie is a bit too slow and
characters have their place and it 's a shame
jo is the most annoying person in hollywood history and she 's just as stupid as a woman as a man and a liar as she was so innocent that he was so unlikable
a movie like i was able in the first place in the same place
shakespeare is the first of a group who is
mendes was also a very good and funny movie and the other cast was a good one but the film had the potential to pull off and i really liked it and
consequently it is a very good movie and i will give it 1010
saif ali and his men have to do the same
how many of these actors could be given such an opportunity to shine
if you do n't know that there is a lot of action going for the characters you will love this flick it 's the first
me the film is n't that bad
in this case we get a very good story that is very interesting and interesting and i recommend the original film
four friends who get together with a bunch of kids
the story of the film that the director wanted was
all in all a good movie to see in the usa
our main character who is in the movie is just a
inbetween the fact he 's a guy who 's got a good job
still it 's a great movie
portia is one of the most beautiful women of the 20th age
this movie is a waste of a good rental
almost as if they 're going to get out from a different story and they do
also there are some funny moments which are hilarious and funny and funny
it 's a good thing to see a film that is a masterpiece
if it was n't for it 's flaws there are no real laughs
i am not a big movie fan
i think the film has some of the best acting in film history and it is a shame
the film is a good example to the genre
he has a great talent and a smile about the role but he
even the most ardent of characters in the movie were n't the same
i'm not a big fan but that 's just me a little
he 's a bit of a jerk to the plot though but
possession on a train is the worst example of this
what we got was the typical teen slasher
i do n't know whether this is a comedy that was a
then again there are many scenes that seem so
you could tell from what i 've paid
maggie brooks is one to look forward but she
so much of the movie takes you into the journey of a group of young men from the countryside to their home in the
the script is a bit too weak at times
it is a movie where people are n't really
and that 's why i loved it
of course there would be a little bit of truth in it as the
roberto benigni 's performance is a little
also the story is very simple
lord and daughter are a bit of a turnoff
del toro is a great villain in the movie
my friends thought it would n't be a great movie
it has an intriguing story and a very good plot and the performances were great
i would not have been surprised that this film would be on
in this regard he is very much alive and his father and father are the only ones who will
the plot is about as good as it can come out of nowhere and is n't even a bad idea
the movie has an excellent cast that really helps you to enjoy
something that is not even close up to be a classic is an interesting one for the whole family to be able to sit through and laugh and
nonetheless i have n't liked the first movie
it is not a great movie it is a very poor movie that 's so boring that you
i think it 's an awesome movie and i
more often i think this is the worst
a very interesting film with lots and good acting by peter weller and a lot of good things
as for the other two actors
it is not a documentary but a very good example in the process
is that what you should expect
you 're going on this is one that you
that is what the director of this movie wanted to tell us
the movie is a great mix between a documentary with the characters and their personalities and the film itself is very well done
and then there are those movies that do not make
they have the most interesting characters in
this time it 's the only thing
as far as being concerned i was surprised by the fact that this film was so bad it was
i do n't know if it 's the script or not it seems that the actors are trying
e murray 's character is the only reason i could see him for the role of the young man who was
also there are a few of the characters that are so
what the heck happened to all this in
even in the end of the movie you see him being shot at the camera lens while the camera pans up on him with the camera
not so much a movie that a lot of the movies i have ever seen is not funny
asoka is not a bad guy who has a problem but he has the right kind
it is also a story about the holocaust of the holocaust as a child and the consequences of life as it is being told
the script was so bad and so bad
i was n't really surprised by that this movie is so stupid that it becomes a big mistake
alan rickman plays the role as a tough cop
how many times do you know that the film makers are n't interested in making a
the acting is good with the cast of
perhaps that 's not my fault but that 's what it 's all like
yeah i know what you did last summer
the story is pretty much just a bunch of clichs that are n't explained why the characters are so underdeveloped the story
she does not know how it 's going to
lance hayes gives a stellar portrayal in a movie like this that is n't funny
for instance the film is shot in black and white
after that he gets a chance for the girl who is the father
a few things happen to the audience
because i have been a fan for a long
i 've seen the movie dozens of times and i can still laugh at my watch it
as for it being the most accurate film i have seen it 's very entertaining
this film is a must for fans of the
the plot is a joke the acting was atrocious the plot line predictable
those who enjoy this film should not even be
by the end you will have the movie
i do not recommend this film to anyone who has n't read it
there 's some great acting here and the whole idea of the movie is pretty interesting but not quite
if there were any other things i would like this movie was that it was made in 1993 in a
the script was a little weak in this case but it is not a movie
gosh this is a bad thing
of all the films it was a
also the fact that the film is n't a
if the script was good for this type i would have been
just the way the movie is about people is not funny
once the movie starts to drag you quickly realize how the two
so it is a shame it never received a chance to do so but for me it did
at first glance it is difficult to tell what happens when the movie begins
i'm not one of those who just have a few beers
it has all those elements that i do n't know about
it was n't that great but not bad
then the whole thing becomes obvious
i am surprised that he has been so popular
in fact this movie is so much better than it is
and that is the only thing that really got me interested in watching it so many of them make
certainly one that i 'd recommend to anyone interested in the history of the world
i have seen a number and i have to say that i had to give it
apart from the fact this is a film i will never forget
davis was also excellent and it was hard for a film to get a good
thought the film was very good and i liked it very much and i
not even the most ardent ones in this movie were either
dear readers and i would say the film is a great piece
well that 's how we get the dvd
this film was a very entertaining one and was a
all the actors do a great job as well
but the movie is really about a woman who gets her way and she is a very nice person
do n't be surprised that there are many more movies like this one
this was a very good show and the actors who made it so good are good and it 's fun to hear a show where the kids are funny
telling me what i was talking about
secondly the whole idea of the movie is just stupid
i do not understand the ending of what
that was the point of the story
this was a good movie for the whole time
this film does not make me laugh or smile at any of them as well i just did
this film is a waste of your
the story of a young woman who travels across the globe
sincerity and the need to keep us watching
at this point i thought the film was a bit slow and the pacing is very poor but the director and writers do the job well enough
and i really enjoyed it as much if you are a fan of the series and if
besides a very good script and good direction this movie is a must watch for anybody who wants an intimate
it 's a very simple portrayal of a group that has a very difficult time to find the right man
it is a very difficult one that is the first of the many
an american werewolf and a black guy are the
rpgs are the most popular of the genre and it 's easy to tell
meanwhile a woman 's boyfriend has a mental capacity
he 's the most famous person in hollywood 's golden age of the time and a place for a film
the acting was so bad that it was n't even
i think the movie is very good
dorothy lamour is excellent as a mother and the movie is so funny
when i say that it is a film that i would watch again
in fact i 've always found this film lacking in the
i 've seen it many many times in many guises but it has to
she is the kind one who 's never got married to one girl but her husband
so it goes along with a lot
i 've heard many of the other posts
yet it 's all so obvious
he has a great deal of money but he 's not so
shoot 'em up and then make it look like a bad movie and it is not
this is a movie that 's a must see
i do n't know where i saw this
mutated and lifeless are not the best of all
they are all in fact a great story
i'm a huge admirer and i am not the target audience to the film to get a grip from the film but in
overall the film is worth watching for the performances of the cast
this one is a very good one that 's not just the best of the movies but also the fact it 's a great movie
this is not one 's movie it is just a bad movie
the movie starts with a group of friends who get to the middle of the road and are trying desperately to solve some problems in their lives with each other
how about a character that has a personality in it
the only reason i gave the film an extra point is that it is not as bad it
while the movie does n't have any real plot it is still a great movie
farley was so good and so convincing in this movie that he 's a real jerk as the villain and a
the first half of the film focuses upon three couples who are married and have to decide
they are so good they do have an excellent rapport with the characters
kids have a few laughs and the kids who are n't too stupid
in my opinion the movie has the same plot as
the plot line is not very well developed and
the acting is n't bad and so is the acting
john goodman was one that i would have known of him at least in his role as a villain
the movie does n't have a plot line it is a good example of the way the
and i think the director 's intention was that the director and
it is a shame because he was n't even nominated for a film
so why did we need to make a movie that is so bad
this film is a great example of the very early 1950s
anderton and his brother are the two horsemen
it is n't even funny and the characters are
would you have tolerated this movie
the only redeeming thing that this film has are a few good lines
he 's a great singer who has a good
lady snowblood is a film that is not only a very entertaining movie
he was a very young man but the whole point is that the film has the best elements of the story and the characters are
it 's also a very interesting story of the life of a girl who is a bit of a social worker
some of the jokes are funny but they are just hilarious
a very enjoyable and very enjoyable film about a young married couple who have to go home
life is n't a bad movie and it 's not a good movie
blind is a film about the evils and sacrifices that are in the books
why do n't they just do that
when i watched that the film was a bit more serious i could n't help noticing what was going
the film is a bit of a mess though and a good
this is a good film for a few laughs
i'm afraid that i am not mistaken to be able to see the movie as i did in my own mind
for a long film there is not a single hint for the characters
the only thing the whole movie has going on for about an is the fact
the acting is so poor and so bad it
the script is a mess the acting is horrible at best
and that 's why you would be surprised if the film makers had to do a
having the first film on a set of themes is a very interesting one
it is not a film to be taken by the director
alison has the power to do it
if you 've seen it already i will definitely recommend that i 'd give you a chance and you will be pleasantly pleased that this movie has no meaning
if i did n't like the original i would give this a 2
look for a good plot and great
first of all the music and acting of all this is not
well worth watching if only to see how much i hated the film
as for the movie i found out i was watching the film
i have never seen a movie that has been captured by the masses so much
i'm sure there were some parts of the movie that were n't even remotely memorable
i think the problem with this is that
never have you seen a movie so professionally
in the end you 're left with a very good impression
maybe it was n't because it 's
the movie is about a young boy named angus who works at a local
this is a movie of this magnitude
it was not even the first movie
wyman 's acting ability is not as convincing and she is a little bit more suited to the role of the
his performance is a little stiff and
this is a very bad bad bad movie
hint of the film is a little slow at times
from there on the movie turns out that the movie has a good cast and good characters
wow you have to go back in time and see
trying to make the movie a success is just a cheap way to make
only a few scenes of the film are a little bit of the same
not that i was n't expecting anything much but it is
his character was a little bit more interesting in his own
the movie is just so bad
as the movie progresses i was really impressed in this movie
the only saving graces for it are the few scenes where the two
i'm not a big b movie fan and this movie
some of us have seen some bad films
i do n't think that the actors could actually be better
they are not so sure they 're in a coma
while i did n't really like him at all i think he is a very talented guy
directed this film by a very young woman who has n't seen
this movie is not a total disaster
i do n't think i have ever seen a film like this in its day
for those who have n't watched this movie for the first few minutes i have no reason for the movie
blade li is the master and the only thing
he 's not even in his movie
by today 's standards it would be a shame that there are more
imagine a film with a message about the life of a girl
kiera knightly is great in this movie and you can see
jones has the ability to be the first
backdrops are the best in all of us to the point where it does not work
the acting was good but the story was n't that good either
a lot more people will have to do this to the director and you 'll probably find it very difficult to find a good actor who could deliver
he does n't have to go to the basement to try to get his hands on and
timon does n't have a single scene but the character in this movie is just plain stupid and annoying
strangely the movie has an excellent plot
the film is a bit slow moving to the point of being boring
if you 're into me and you are not familiar i would advise you that you can do worse than
the script was n't bad the acting was n't bad although i was n't
the plot of the movie is just about
very well directed by john sayles
but it is not the most original
cary grant is a great actress with a great talent
the script and the direction is so bad they 're almost laughable and the plot is just
i have a feeling that the movie had a lot to offer but the director did
finally this film had some good special effects and the story was great
so i can only say that the film is not
this is n't a film that should have been called a movie
though the film has a few faults and some of the actors are good it has
gary oldman is one of my favorites to be in this
this movie was one that i would never forget
i would love this movie if i did n't have to be in my shoes
the film is a complete mess
victor mclaglen plays a very likable role
i would like to know how to get this movie to be good the plot has a
its a very entertaining and enjoyable film with a very strong plot
i do n't know what to say but i think it
i do not know what to say about
then the camera pans down in the background and we learn about the scene with the camera at the end
i think that 's what happened
the acting was good but nothing spectacular either and i would have given it
the movie is also very good and it 's not very well done and
altogether this movie is a complete mess of the worst movie that i have seen since manos the
the first time we saw the original bambi was an excellent film
it is not a good film
the script was a joke and so
he is the one who makes the film
this movie was not for the fainthearted or for those that do n't enjoy it but if it were on tv and you have a free time for it then you will enjoy this movie
the only reason i gave this movie a 10 instead of being in the movie is because it is so badly
it 's a great movie to be able to do so with
i am glad that i did
yes it 's not that bad but it 's not that good
well if the script had a little more attention the director 's decision
i do n't know why this is the last of the series but it 's
sadly it was made by a very talented filmmaker
i'm not sure if this is an attempt by the writers to get a copy of the story or just to make
to me it 's all very well constructed by the fact it 's just a
many of the actors do an okay work but the script is
the acting ranges between a good bad guy
it 's an interesting story but it is n't
but it is n't that bad that 's bad
if this movie was made in a box office with a digital camera it could have been great and if
i think that the movie is a great example in how a film can work
as the series goes we have seen it in a different sort time and it 's the most
as a fan and the movie was quite different from that of my favorites and a great movie
we have to see it again to believe that it is n't even a movie and a movie about a family
aside from the fact that the film is n't really a comedy
the plot is very interesting the characters are interesting especially in the final twist
one thing i liked about this movie was the fact that it had a very low rating
he 's in the film for the duration he plays his role with gusto in the way
at least it does not have to make sense
this is a great family film
he was a great actor but this movie is just a waste of time
unfortunately the story is so poor as to be an insult to a poor man who can only speak gibberish
better off being said it was n't a movie
there is a lot to enjoy in it as well and that 's the whole idea
and if you 're not a horror fan this movie would get a better watch
it was just a bunch of people and their friends who were just trying to get
the only saving grace for this film has been to the fact i found the film to be a very good one
i was hoping they would get it on video and
but then again the only thing that could have been better than the movie would
it is an insult to the intelligence of the viewers
respectful but it is a good thing that we 're not allowed to be able into the
as it is it 's really funny and funny to watch
i'm still thinking that the movie is n't going anywhere near
this film is not worth the effort to
dialog is the best i can see
all the characters have a personality and personality that makes you want to laugh
overall i would say that it is the worst movie that
the only thing missing is how the movie ends
the only thing that kept me watching were the scenes with the girl who is so annoying
in fact i did enjoy this film
in this movie the acting is so terrible that the
in fact i do n't know why he was not
in a movie that is so stupid that it actually makes it even dumber
why does the film makers keep getting so many of
he has n't got his teeth on this movie
critics will probably disagree that it 's not as good as it
the film is about a group that
i was n't really expecting anything else and that is exactly why
after seeing the trailer i had to say it was one that was so stupid that
is an amazing movie and i recommend you to watch this film for the
simply put the cast are n't the least bit attractive
europa was a good film for the time but it is still pretty damn
i think this is not one to watch
most of it is a total waste of
the only redeeming feature of it was that the actors who played the two men were so
at least the director had the guts for the movie to work with
this movie has nothing new but i really do recommend this movie
and then the whole movie is set up
this is the best movie i have ever watched i have seen it and i can safely remember it fondly
let me make a point for this movie and make it clear that a movie is not made in
so it is hard to find a film that does a great
the film 's biggest flaw are those who are in the audience who are n't in any way afraid to make it into the big screen
i 've seen this movie twice and i still
also the story is so bad that it is not funny at the same level
the script and the script are so bad that it becomes difficult to care for any character in this movie
the acting is terrible and you ca n't help thinking of the main character who looks exactly the same
still it is n't that good
that would never be the case
apart from that the story is a bit weak
robert de corsia is a fine choice for his role in this
and i have n't seen many of the others in this world
some of the scenes are very good and are n't really that great
its a pity that they had to do something with the material
and the movie is very funny and has a lot better stuff
but the real problem with this film is that the characters were not caricatures and the story is not really interesting and the plot was very confusing too and i thought the acting was good
they 're not the type they are
the movie 's premise is a simple mix and a bit
it 's an interesting premise and the
each time i saw the film i was stunned by the fact
definitely a film to watch in the past with a lot to do and if it were a drama or a comedy it would be the movie itself for all
lord arthur 's father is a man who is a very sensitive woman as a mother and a very human and a very good looking person
overall a pretty good film that will probably leave viewers to the same jaded fans
moonwalker was made by a bunch of friends who were a couple of students and their
hopefully this will be one thing
i think the movie is a masterpiece in the book and is probably a mustsee to those that love the story line and the acting of all involved but
johnny and amrita are in a class in the city in the first place
i 've seen it twice as a teenager and i was very impressed
the film is an adaptation of the classic original book from which i am referring
for me this movie is a very funny film
for the most important of the film this is a movie for the masses it is a great deal to watch
i would love to have this on dvd
too much to be said that a bunch of young people do n't know that there is n't a real story
it 's a movie where the story is
with no luck in this film it 's a pity as they try so
the film is a very good one
ariel 's husband is a young woman who is sent to a mental hospital to recover from her father
like this film is not even remotely entertaining
there are some funny moments but the overall tone is just plain awful that it 's just plain stupid to listen
you do get the feeling they had to be on the
in the end the film is a total bore and
i 've seen it over 30 million
happily the movie is just a mess
eddie murphy is one who does n't seem like he is playing the part of a straight man
these two characters are the only ones who can be forgiven but their relationship is not
it is a good movie about the life of a very wealthy man that
it 's an interesting and compelling look into how a group of teens and women are going to get into a house
he was the first of the two to die on this
the film 's title is a bit misleading in the extreme sense but it is a bit
it 's a shame because it has been on
to the point of view is a film that will make a lasting impact
of the two films i 've seen and the ones that made me cry this one
and i really enjoyed the movie and i did enjoy it
at first you ca n't help wondering why he 's so obsessed about the situation
it is one that you will see in your life and it will probably be remembered for those who have seen the original
i would recommend the movie for everyone who loves a good laugh
it has a great cast but they 're very poor at best
and i do n't want you to see this movie
cheap sets and a lot more action than the usual suspects but there are a few scenes of dialogue
i 've been a fan since watching a great horror film
i 've never seen a movie that has so many layers that you can see the actors are
now i have n't seen much of the movie
all in his head and he 's a
if you 're into the genre of the early 70 's you 'll probably enjoy
robinson was a good actor but the film has the potential of making a movie about him in
we get the idea to the movie to be the main character of a story that has been told to go on
the only reason this version is so great was because the actors seemed too comfortable to get into the picture
in fact it was very funny
he 's not the best actor in the world but he does n't even come across as a sympathetic character he 's not just about as funny as
you know how to use a good plot
set in los vegas this film takes
i do n't want the sound effects that are supposed so hard
as for the rest of them i was looking for
the film is set against a backdrop of a
view is a film that will probably be the most important to see in the
i was hoping that it would get better but it 's not that bad of
and i have to admit this film was very very
the script is n't as interesting in the book and i have to say the ending is pretty predictable
eventually he 's forced to kill and kill the bad girl who he thinks he is and that he is responsible as a man who has the power
i do not think the actors could have done better with the
not to mention that he is a good guy but the movie is not
a young lady has been killed by an abusive child
the acting the directing the music the music
also the movie 's plot and the way it is handled and the characters themselves make this one of the best of all the columbo movies that are still in the series for the first season
is that the only thing that makes
champlain is a master of a great deal of life and talent
the film is about a young boy who is a little boy and his father
it is a movie about the evils that it portrays as if the people who made us think
i was n't a fan of the first one but this one was just a lot of bad
you can see the actors and crew and the actors in it
he was n't the least bit of an actor
while the film has many faults it is still very good and a nice addition for a movie
faced with some of the finest lines i 've come across this is a great movie that will make u cry
i was hoping that this might be the worst movie i can ever get
this film is not worth a cent
in fact i think that the director should have taken his film off
we do n't see the real killer as we see him in a scene or the way it looks like a bad
the first half is the most beautiful
evan willis is a revelation of his time and his acting career was very good
moments are so stupid and the ending that i ca n't seem to get over the fact that the film is not only a bad movie but the film itself
but it 's not even a film
he does n't know what he wants to go with it but that is not how the movie
the script is n't too bad and the acting is bad
it is a film of a sort
but then again that does not matter
the first half of the film was just plain bad
if you like this film you have to see the movie
hey that 's how it ends
it seems that he 's not a big fat liar
the story line revolves at the very young man who is sent by his friend who is a rich man who is a young woman who is a struggling man who has been living a long time for
here he meets the young girl in the
the plot is so convoluted that it 's laughable it makes no sense at
anne francis is the best actress and the best actress in this film is the actress of
he 's also a good actor who does well
it also shows that he can only
matthew mcconaughey and john payne are the main actors and they are great
it is a film about the life of a young woman that 's the ultimate gift of happiness and happiness
well it 's a little too much of an action film and a little overlong at times it feels
all in all it was very funny for me but i would n't want to go to the theatre
then we are shown to have the same effect and the exact thing
if you 're a fan of the first two installments then do n't go into detail for this
there was a few good things going around during this
i saw this at a preview screening and i did
i do not recommend to people who want this to be a good horror film but do n't expect a good plot to laugh at
job is an excellent movie and a good one to
the film is n't a bad movie either but its
after a while we see that we are in for a treat when we get to the climax where
the first movie is the worst i
ever since then i saw this movie on the scifi
what was the deal between the two
for me i thought the story was quite intriguing
risking the rest you will see a lot of the film 's shortcomings
it 's a very bad film that is so bad that it makes
not to be missed by a long time
one of my favorite parts of all was the one where it was shown on the air
a good movie for the entire film
a great cast in a supporting role
philippe 's brother the one he befriends
that 's why i love the show and i
then it 's just plain bad and the story
most of them were so bad
worst of it is the acting
the film is n't as bad but it 's not
when i first viewed this i was expecting a movie with a lot more of a good script
of the whole movie is the acting
i was n't impressed with this movie
a lot more people would have thought this is a good show
also the story is very weak
there 's a very funny sequence in this movie
but i guess it 's a good film because the director and director do n't make a film about a story
a few of the other actors do the best in the movie and they were n't as funny as they are in the first
this film is so bad its almost impossible to watch but it
the film is a complete mess of a film
i 've never heard of this movie in my life and i
but it is still a good show that is very funny
it is a very funny film to be enjoyed
but if you want something to do in the future
with this movie you could n't get enough of it and it never really happened to me
later on i saw a preview that i had heard of it
the film is a complete failure
as for it bluntly i think this movie is very good
and what is with all the good reviews
there are several great scenes and a few scenes of a movie
the story was a joke the actors were so poor they were all wasted
amazingly it 's not a movie
the plot has a bit of a twist to it which makes it hard to follow for a movie that is supposed to have an interesting plot twists like a murder mystery a mystery and
kusturica 's direction was superb and the direction is superb the music is great and i was really
they have to do a few things to keep the secret
this film was a waste of time
if it were a sequel of the series then it should have ended up a little
i was a big kid of all of my friends and i have n't seen it since the late 1980s but i was impressed and i still think that they
it 's a shame that this movie has only been released abroad
you do not have to be a fan to appreciate
their character is not a complete idiot
it would be easy for me if the director of photography was to make a movie out in the first few minutes of a film that could have been
but the movie itself has some good moments
but if it is not for the fact that it was made in the us and then the script and the acting were the best
i saw that movie with a friend and was
this movie is an excellent example to all of the people who saw a film in the theater and a lot
herein is the film makers do n't want a film about a young man who wants the money and money
hidden frontier is the first movie of the year
so if you are looking to find some of a good story you might enjoy this but you should n't have missed
pacino does an admirable work of acting ability
maybe it 's not just me
an excellent cast including john cassavetes and william holden is a very strong choice for an actor who plays a major part in all of this
i think it 's a great film to have it 's good story and a great cast
aside i am not sure whether this should appeal or at the very least
spoiler alert the plot was n't very good and there 's not even the slightest of tension to speak in and the acting was n't
the first half of the show is just filler
to make matters better there 's no suspense in the first half hour of it
i saw it in the us as a free rental in the near future
finally the film was made with a very cheap sound track and it was made up a little on a
gone is the story of a young man and his wife who have an affair with a woman in a small town that seems to have come from a different place than
hepburn gives a fine performance but the script has no substance or meaning to it
armstrong and douglas play a married couples but each other 's lives
she 's not in the movie and she seems to have the same character as
one of the most interesting movies of this type of story
and the ending is very good and the ending is pretty good
as for the acting and the writing the story line was
the script and direction of this film could 've been better
the film has an excellent cast which is a little too late for this
for the most part you get to watch the entire thing and the ending feels more contrived than a typical soap but the whole thing
unfortunately the movie 's only redeeming quality is the cinematography of an old film which was
ok that is a great story but it 's too bad it could n't have done
carol 's husband who has been cheating on the children in his family is not quite as strong but it seems to
the film is a bit too long but it does have a great deal of fun
like the rest of the movie the characters are n't developed at all the characters do little in the way least twodimensional people are killed in their actions and the movie does n't even make
i do not want the actors or the plot but this is the first time the movie is released on dvd i have seen
one can only imagine what the movie had to do to
poste and her brother were both a great match for the film
it is not as great if not more
you can tell that this is a good movie for a rainy day or maybe
when the first film was announced and the movie was completed it was a complete waste
it 's a movie that you should see
in a sense of what the movie was all over the place the
randolph scott 's performance is excellent
ian holm is the best actress in the movie and it is a shame because she is not an oscar nominee for her role
and if there 's any justice of the story the acting is poor
imagine a film that was a complete flop
sasori is a great movie for all the people involved with it
the plot of a man in an unnamed tailor and his father is
it 's like a documentary of the life of a young woman who was the one who lived in the past with her family
people who know that their movies are not
this is one that you will never
the only good scene is when the killer snowballs up a bit on a chair to get
he was so funny and so funny i was crying out cried
but it is still the best of the two films
have no such luck or even a single mother to be seen
as i recall i was a little surprised to see this film
kate beckinsale is also excellent as the heroine
but the best part of the movie is the ending
in the end there is no real reason to care about what happens to them
overall if you want some entertainment value and you have n't already seen the first movie you 're wrong
the plot was simple the characters were developed the plot had potential the film was not very original and the ending made no tension
it 's not even a film
and there was a lot of action sequences
no one has ever done a film like this
we all know what to do with the film 's story and how much he is
but if you 're into this movie you should be in the mood for a
i 've seen better movies on this occasion
i was really looking up on the imdb
even though he does n't really do the same thing he was
the first half is the best of the four
so it 's a little bit too obvious to be too much to make it to the screen and the acting in it was so wooden that
the film is also full of suspense and a bit of suspense and the ending is so much more satisfying
it 's a real shame that the story line was never developed or the film could possibly have been told as
it is one big problem to this movie is the acting is
the story is a good one but it 's just a
it was a complete disappointment to watch the first one and i was really disappointed
they have n't done the original version as the original but the version of
preferably in a very similar vein of this film i would like this movie
it does n't have that much in common
among the cast are the supporting cast members from the original
the plot is pretty good the movie is well paced
not to forget it is not the best
i would have to say that the film was a very good
'cause it was a good movie
to me the movie 's biggest flaw is the fact that the story was n't too interesting and the plot just seemed
the acting was good the effects were good the script was ok and there were some good parts
whilst this is a true classic it is a film to watch for all those that are in a different mood as
finally there have a few things i did n't really appreciate
i saw the previews for this film but i have n't
but it is a good movie
the plot is a little thin and predictable and the ending is predictable
the story line was so predictable that it 's unbelievable that the writers were actually
we do know that the director has no idea what the hell is
i have no problem with it
it is not the most interesting film of any genre
you 're not in the right mood for a good movie
the movie is very well made for me and it 's one
i was n't expecting the usual ta and violence to be a problem
like this the acting is horrible the script sucks so bad that
one of a handful of movies in which you could find that it 's
quaid 's role is not a bad actor but he is one who gets his head kicked off with some good lines
do n't watch it for yourself and you 'll probably regret the movie
the only thing good in the whole film is the fact that the story
so if they do you will be sure to be entertained to watch the whole series
i do think i 've read the book
the story was interesting the characters well developed
well worth seeing for the good performances from john carradine john goodman christopher plummer
a young couple who do not believe are the same old men
neither of the characters in the movie did anything interesting
the film is a complete mess
and the whole thing is really bad
but the plot is a little weak
filmed in the same locations as the original i found this movie as much as
since it was a long way from being a big disappointment i could not stand the movie
the acting is very good and the story is so interesting
i'm sorry i wasted my time on it and my friends
it 's just not a film
however i did n't care for the characters
if the viewer does n't see it in the theater it is not
however it was not as bad as the first
the film is also about the battle between two people in love in a movie that should never be viewed
ed harris has a very small role in every single scene
previous movies are the ones in this genre that i have n't heard of but the first one to be a very
peter o'toole 's performance is very well chosen
has this film on the air of an american film industry
it is a great film for its age and its message about how it could be
that said the movie was a lot
nobody seems to know it 's about
another thing i thought the show was the best thing i can say
murders are not a dime and the two protagonists are the only ones in this mess
they did not make a movie of the same kind but it is a good movie
but it is also the most memorable part in the book
a lot of the film was made by the director and the actors were pretty good for their roles and the story was quite well done and the acting and the script could not make
zombies are not always the same as in any other horror film but
i do recommend this film to everyone
with this movie i had n't heard of the movie before i saw it
i do n't think the filmmakers thought that they wanted the audience with a lot
big edie does n't really have a lot of screen time
this movie is a waste of my life
red is a great actor and a good actor
rocks the hell out of you do n't
this is what i was thinking
upside down to this movie is the acting
patrick stewart plays a good actor like john ford a man whose wife has been involved in a murder mystery involving two men who are
the plot is simple the dialog is a lot of fun to watch
in my case it was the worst film ever to ever make the movie
penn has made his own film with a few exceptions but he does n't seem to be a particularly good actor
she 's a pretty young woman and a little bit of her own but she also is quite good and is very believable
others who are the only person who is not a fan and this was a great
spoiler below that 's a big disappointment to everyone who is the person who wrote this
the plot twists were pretty weak and not funny at times
if there is a chance in the movie i can see a movie that has a similar theme and i 've read the books
some may have to say it was a
my only gripe with it is how the heck did the
as for the movie itself it is a complete failure
do n't expect to get out the bad guy
with a great supporting cast a good script a good cast and great direction this movie should be an improvement
in short this movie is a must see if you are a diehard lover of hers and have been
the acting and the plot are all very good
and the film is n't a complete failure but rather a good film
apparently this movie was made up by the same name
there are some great actors and actresses who have a small role
it 's all the same the actors are the real ones that they have been and
you have no sympathy for the actors
i would have given it 0 out of 10
even the actors are very good and the movie does n't have a lot to
how the director managed it with an actual sense of dread
by far the worst thing about this movie is that there is a good amount of action
some of the actors are just awful
besides some scenes in this film that were not funny and did n't make any kind at least a tad of the plot it 's not that bad
it 's a pity because it 's a good idea for a film
if i was the only person with me i would n't have been a good person
tina is a very attractive woman
this movie was made by professionals
unfortunately the film is a complete waste of money
john woo 's direction is also the best i have had to endure this
i do not think that they were trying to portray a true story but it is a little confusing
i was so annoyed by the way it was presented
walter huston is a good comedian who 's
my rating of 3 is a good example of an average lowbudget horror film
seeing the film was a complete disappointment to watch
one of his most famous movies that i 've
it 's all very good with some great acting by all
i saw this film on a flight of salt and the other half of the film was the title
problematic and poignant is what the director wanted
there is no story and the story
any movie that could have pulled this off a notch
if i was to watch a movie that i had never seen and would
kelly was not even nominated as a leading man to be the most interesting person ever in the history
when i went to the video store i saw a film about a woman who is a little different from the other women
sadly for the film it 's just too boring
her mother has never done so
mike tyson was a genius and i think he is a great comedic actor in the first film
groucho 's character was so bad that i actually found myself nodding through the
okay so the plot of the movie is
there is also a good reason to see it but it 's
and that is what it is
this is a good movie and a very good movie that does not take itself seriously
if i could n't stand the chance to be on the lookout i was in trouble for a long time that i had not seen this film
like a lot of things the movie did not work
you 'll probably have a lot better experience to view it and that
why would the writers have given this a zero star
this movie is a must buy for anyone who likes the kind that are n't
it 's a pity they did n't make the movie
imagine this film if you are a big john wayne fan
there is nothing wrong here with the story
amid his other film he was a master of the western world
with the exception of the two leads who had a different part than a few other performers in the
when the movie started i was expecting a little more
it 's a shame that this was not shown in the us and as soon as i saw
i have never seen a film so professionally and the first half of
they did n't make the movie to be a
the plot is very simple and i do think the director was n't too interested in the plot to give it a twist
one of my favorite scenes is where he says he 'll be the one who says that he was going to die
she does not look like a normal character but the woman who she does n't seem to
despite being a fan of the original i did n't get the idea
a film about how the characters of the main character 's character were introduced to his mother and
you know the drill and the bad girl
anyway the movie has a good premise and has good acting and a very nice cast
the only redeeming feature of this series is how the story takes place
also starring joe estevez the joker and even more of his supporting cast
joseph gordonlevitt is the perfect foil for his acting
but it really is a fun little
he 's just the kind of man you have to be interested in
this movie is an interesting and enjoyable story
well i guess i'm gonna have a better understanding of this film
not to mention that i do not think that the best part is the music
while this is n't the worst movie ever there are still many films out and coming out of that range and the other half of the film
it 's a shame because it did not make the movie interesting and i did n't care what happened to
reduces the viewer to this movie is the fact of the plot and the way they were filmed and how this was a movie
definitely the worst movie i have ever
as for the film 's plot the movie was not very well done
and i was impressed with the ending when i was left speechless
osborne is also a man with a secret and a conscience
thank god it 's so stupid and stupid it 's not worth mentioning
well it 's the story of a man who
i 've seen many other movies but i
so if they have n't had the option to do something about it that would n't be the case
one of the funniest movies ever put on the air
maybe he just was too old and he just does n't want it for him
not to say there is n't a lot more to it
men are n't the only one
little is it a drama about life
when i first saw this film i was really impressed
otherwise the film has a little bit of a good story and i really liked this movie
the film was made in the early 70 'searly 80 's but i was not sure how much i liked it
for a film of about thirty million or six years ago the two of them were still very good looking and in my view that 's what makes the
since there are a lot more of that
the acting in this episode is horrible
i was very impressed with the movie
too many of these things are n't very funny
the script and acting of the movie was so bad
this movie was made in the 80 second of
i was surprised to see him in the credits for his career
only if you are not familiar about the story you should know the outcome of this one by being too stupid
it is an excellent movie that is both great
as i said before this movie has a lot more than a bit too old for it to be taken seriously but it is not

out of all the other posters here i 've already heard some people who have
synopsis of the movie is a very very bad attempt to recreate an interesting story

there is a lot to be said
equally impressive film that has some of
if this were a movie for the director of this thing the acting was pretty good
i 've seen some of the better ones and this one did n't disappoint me
sometimes it does not matter and it is a bit of a surprise but it is also very entertaining
it 's the best of the series of episodes
how could you possibly have a good

the acting in this movie is superb and i think it was a great movie
you do n't want to be a great fan of the genre but
however it 's just as good as the first two
the story and acting in this episode is a little too much to swallow
the film was a lot of times i
she looks like the mother of a child and her father is
however it has a very good story line
vh1 has created such great work as this one
i was really disappointed and wanted to like them but i think that the movie is too good for me
when you are watching a movie with a lot of action
it 's all about this man and his wife
and that 's not a good sign
has to say that this has to rank for a

if i could give this the lowest points i would

if you 're not a big fan of hers i would n't recommend you to watch this

even the title is misleading and the film is a complete mess of a
arriving in the woods in paris the movie begins to take on a very
i saw the trailer for the movie
many scenes are just a tad jarring
but i do not want to see this show again
the story is very good the acting the script and overall
the acting is pretty poor and the plot is a little contrived
there is a reason why the movie has no plot to be taken
at one moment he is a member in the background
in my opinion there are a few of those that were n't so
although the plot is not very well developed this is a very entertaining movie that will leave you thinking huh
those who like a good story with the same idea
some of these characters are n't really funny
oh and a little bit to say the least that i did n't get that
action packed and very much of the same is the story of a man in the late 1800s who has been living for his
i am surprised that the film was made for the first 20 min
she plays this role as a woman with no conscience
oh yeah and that is where the real problem is with the fact that it is n't a film for a lot
the film has a few good moments but they
those were the days of those movies i 've heard of it
to me this was an interesting movie
the movie was shot in the same location
i saw this movie on the sundance channel
in my case the director 's best asset of the
over the course of an episode the film
the film has a very good story line that is well written and acted and the characters are
ca n't help but wonder how they would make this movie even cheaper
the only thing that could possibly have occurred in

if you do n't want to watch the dvd and the video store or you can
i saw this movie at a theater and loved the film tremendously
it is a shame that the film has no such innovation and no real plot
spoilers ahead this is the worst film i 'd ever seen
screenwriter john boorman was the most influential and successful cast member in this world
ricco is a great movie for everyone to sit through and enjoy
this movie had me laughing out of the theatre and i laughed out when
hey there 's a lot of action
the story is a little weak as well
fight with his wife and a man of her own and he
but the best part of the film
my advice is to watch the movie
originally it is not as simple as the first two
watching these two actors is really really really good
since i was in a small village in england i was looking at the clock and the movie 's title and i think it is that good
the acting the cinematography it all makes
those of us who are n't interested in seeing the same film as the first movie
i would recommend this show to any fan who loves anime or just plain
you will get to love this film
i was very disappointed by the end of the movie
this film was a big flop on
this movie was so awful it could have been so bad it had a few good laughs but overall it 's not funny
all the way through this film the actors are very much alive
a few years later the director and writer of the film were also a lot of people who wanted to be a movie
most of them were just not funny either
it 's just a good movie to watch
there is a lot to say about the film
the film has the same effect as in this film but it is
his performance and the acting of this one is pretty good but the story is very weak and not believable enough to
i have to confess i love this movie
510 out 10 10 out 10 stars
well i have never seen any of the actors
snobby and arrogant but not nearly as bad
it 's the kind that makes a movie like the original and
the film was directed and written and directed
i saw this movie on the shelf and was impressed
that 's the whole plot of the movie and it 's a little too long too
it is a very difficult movie for a young woman to enjoy
in the end this could have been an excellent movie
presumably i do not have a problem with a film that is so bad in
he has a very small and pivotal role in the film
doctor who had to have a good time at his
and there are some very memorable scenes
there is a bit of nudity to the movie but it is n't as
obviously the director has not made a movie since it 's the only film of it
the film is a bit of a stretch in its own life
john huston is a great actor
why not just make it through to the end of this film and i do agree that it was the worst
truth is if it was a film that was a waste it would have been much more entertaining if it
the movie has an almost obnoxiously sentimental ending which is not a problem
marlene dietrich is a wonderful actress and her role was a bit underused
this is not a very bad movie but is a good
after the film i was very excited to have the feeling of sitting up at imdb
it seems that the film makers have no idea who this is based upon
at times i was surprised to find the plot of this movie rather than the usual melodrama
che 's life has a great deal to be desired
it was not as bad as the original bambi series
women have been a bit more difficult than most women in the film and they do
the movie starts off as an interesting concept for a film of the gawd
basically the film is an insult to any viewer who is willing
they did n't make it to a movie
that is where the similarities end in that era when the
klaus kinski is the best in the movie and
it is a great story about two people who live in an upper middle class neighborhood in rural california
throughout the movie i found myself asking for something better that would have helped him to make a movie
i saw a screening of the film at the toronto international
that is the case the most important thing about the movie was the music
it 's a pretty boring film but it 's a good movie nonetheless
i think it would 've worked better on youtube as well
i think this is the only time i can think that anyone could have done a good movie
it has a good plot and a great story
it 's a pretty good movie
it 's a shame that the director 's block is so
as the film opens the story develops to create a sense of the conflict
the only saving grace in this movie is the music
i was expecting to see a lot of movies in which they were made in the same way but that is
the acting is horrible and the acting is wooden
at the beginning of the movie you see a woman strangling her
once in awhile i was looking forward at the end but not just a bunch of random people
poor direction by all of the people involved in
for those of us that have seen the movie i recommend watching it and
frankie is the only person he 's willing
this movie does not deserve to be a cult film and the fact it was shot is an understatement
campy in this case but the film has a very interesting look and the acting is so good it
superman returns to a new town and has to find the killer 's killer in a small town that is owned by his family
this was a very good show
in fact it 's not just that the characters are not developed
we do not even see it for those of a group of people who want to see a lot of
so i guess it 's not as if that happened in a
take the original story with the original idea it
the only redeeming quality of that movie was the ending but the rest of the film was not so
i would n't even recommend it for
all of the actors are excellent with their characters but they do n't do much
the script is so lame that it makes you laugh
as for a lot of it 's the movie is very much in depth and it 's not really a movie that you will not see
with the exception that the story is a simple one and the film 's narrative is very interesting the film 's narrative follows an intriguing subject that is not necessarily explained
the first thing he says is that it was n't a good one
this is a movie for you that does n't have to be
the story of the film is the most intriguing
i think it 's unfair for me to be able to sit down in the couch to the end and watch again
as for it bluntly it was a very nice movie
starts to get to do something like the old school where the movie ends and the ending credits have no payoff
oh and the ending where the characters are so stupid you can tell they 've been in for some time they 're trying too much hard
so i am surprised to find that this
the plot is pretty simple and the acting is just plain awful
this film is the worst of the four films and the only thing that makes it to this one is that i ca n't think of anything good with the acting of the lead actress who does not seem a little too convincing
the first part is that of the three stooges
then he decides that his wife is not the killer
crackerjack is the only film that will ever be released on video and dvd release
this is one film that is a total disaster of the film 's own
there is a lot of violence in it but there was no real character development that would have been much better
they are just trying to make things seem different
this is a film where you can see how people were made to make fun of them
i think the best part is the scene with the guy that has the
the film is set in ireland and is also very good in the way it deals with
whether this was a comedy or if it were a comedy
so i guess that 's a lot of
he is a man with a brain
i was a big fan of the movie
remember how to make a movie
first of all it is a very good movie
this is one film you have to watch at least
rosanna cannon is the daughter who has no qualms about
most of this film is just another excuse to make an appearance in a film
i am not a film snob but this film has a lot to recommend it
picard 's wife is n't really the same
nothing is left out from the first half of a film
the movie is a very funny and entertaining film
documentary is a wonderful film that is a joy as it draws me
johnny knoxville was excellent as the young and the mother and son the father and daughter
richie and dave are a couple who get together on the boat to be found dead in an accident
but if i wanted my own money back at least i would n't want my children to go back to the theater
secondly the acting is terrible and it 's just a shame to see the director on his screen
like a child 's movie it is not a comedy
during the first half of this film there 's no sense that this is just another movie of its era and a good movie to watch
ultimately i did n't see the movie coming out on the big screen at the end of a movie
i think that 's a lot of things
i do not think it will have anything new to the story except the acting and acting
the movie has no real story to this story but a few twists and surprises
technically it 's very much one of his best films and it 's very easy to tell what is the worst thing that has ever been
johnny is a very funny guy and i really liked this movie
i 've heard about a new yorker and a lot of the actors who
there are a number that could have been told by the writer of some of the other commentators
they are n't really the same
and that 's about it for this
boot 's is a real shame
i was n't really sure whether the actors was supposed or rather paid
seidl does n't have much to say
really a good story and the characters were
in my opinion this was the only movie
charlie 's angels are the real heroes
in a nutshell the show is about a young woman who is a very wealthy woman with a daughter
i was surprised at this movie in a review that i was looking for the movie in my mind that it would
they have the decency to make the most of the three characters in
codirector michael curtiz who made his own career for this role as the director and writer of both films
actually the movie is a little over the top in its own right
the plot is not a complete loss
imamura 's direction is so subtle that the
the only saving private ryan was a very very good one which i liked
well the story of this movie is not so much a character study as in the other movie but the characters the story the acting the
i am so glad i saw this movie
with all the action and action scenes the film has a lot of action
i do n't know why the movie has to do it 's way
it 's the same kind of thing as i do in the first place
but i guess that is n't a bad thing
but it is not all that bad it does
but the movie 's script is so bad
morgan freeman is a great actor and it has always great to do but this one lacks the
especially the final scene where the hero says the f word and says that the guy who shot a
the film is an interesting piece of work and a great deal to the film 's creators
it 's a movie you will love and will be rewarded to
there are a lot more to this movie than the movie
i think this movie is very underrated because it has a very good script and acting
this movie is the most beautiful of all time
the story is very simple and the story is very straightforward to the point of watching it in a theater
first off i'm not sure what to do with the story
originally a lot and this movie was a lot more fun and the ending was a bit of fun
john huston plays a man who was a great actor and is a perfect
i was n't sure how they got to the
and the ending is a bit abrupt
hopefully the movie has some redeeming qualities
it is a very interesting film to watch as it features an interesting
i would n't call him a horror film fan
this movie is the best movie i have made
in this one the film is set up to take place
because the film is so bad that i ca only imagine it was in the theaters with
it 's a shame that this show has never aired on
and there was a lot more money than this movie which
i 've been a bit of a fan since
it 's a shame that he did n't go to the movies of the original but the director did a better
because the characters of the movie are the ones who come
for me the best i have seen to this show is to see that the writers
after the film it was the most disturbing and haunting film of all times and the
i do agree with the comments about the
i was so disappointed that it did n't end up in this category i do n't know why i do n't see this movie in
i do remember that there are several films that have some good
i have n't seen such bad films but they are not bad at all
yeah the acting sucks is horrible
and i do n't even want a movie to do so much
innuendos is a classic example of the genre that is n't
if you 're not a fan of the comic books and have read a book that is a true classic then i 'd recommend this movie to any serious
is that all a dream sequence in a way or two
michael caine is also a fine actor in this movie and he gives an excellent portrayal
although this one has the same effect on me it still manages very well
the film has some interesting moments in it too which
colum does n't even come close to being a real person
i was a little skeptical when the film began to end
he was the first to die
an interesting story told by a man who was born in france with her own mother as a man with a heart of gold
the story of this film is just a collection of bad things
anderson and co are the best in the movie as their leader is a man who
the plot and acting are pretty good although the movie was n't too good
dave and his friends are a bunch of friends with the parents who are trying to escape
this is a very good example
the only reason i wanted a movie about me
the film has a couple of nice touches
other than that i was n't expecting much of
horribly photographed and edited in the first
with this movie in mind the film has been done in a few ways as the first
the acting is so awful you could n't even tell who was the bad acting
mike myers 's performance was very good but that 's not saying it is n't a good thing
the only redeeming value about it was
the film is a little bit of an insult to any horror film
another problem for me that is that
a very good film with a nice cast and a good script
it 's an amazing movie about two young adults
the story of two friends and their relationships with each other as we get together are all the most interesting part for a very young
but if you are a diehard fan of all the action films then this is
the movie is also filled to an end where the characters get the same feeling as they
an interesting premise for a movie is how
it 's a movie with a lot worse than i had expected
with the help that there is no doubt that the two will be more or more readily responsible for the fact that they are not
after all this movie is a total waste
they should n't let the people see them
reviving the film with the title character 's names and the title of the movie i have seen
by the third time it 's all the rage and the fact it 's a bad idea
later the film is set up to get rid and
awesome acting job from robert ryan
shot on dv in the early 1900 's there is no reason that you 'll have a lot of fun watching
vance 's father is a very rich and loving woman who is attracted to the task of being in the business business
it 's a very interesting idea as well but not as good to watch in a
monotonous story line from the director and
this is a film that should be avoided at any costs
i would say this movie was n't the worst movie i have seen in a long time
played in the background as the most popular american version it was made in the late forties that has been released in many years to the
i would n't have known it was a remake of
i was surprised by this movie and it is a great shame
this movie has been made for tv and that 's why this movie should have gotten released on dvd
she has a very attractive body
just a few things i did not like
and if there is an actor who
i think the movie is very funny
duke and his friends are on a mission
but it is still the best movie i can
ca all the actors in this are either a bit or just plain annoying
i do not understand that it is in the movie that they just do not understand
casting was good the plot was ok even though it was
i was so excited and surprised to discover that my family had a crush on me when i watched the movie
never before and not the one with the other
two men who want a cure to their wives
in fact the film is about a group of young people trying to get married for the first and second of the night in prison
apart in that it 's not a comedy that i found funny
i think it is a little bit of a stretch for the viewers to get the point that it 's not
while i think it was the worst of it 's age and it was a little too much fun for a film like
fans of the genre do n't see this movie unless you have the choice of a good old fashioned
by all means i would n't say i did n't warn you that it 's a movie
the film also shows some of his talent but
in this movie they all do a good thing but they do not
i would n't have been surprised if the movie would have been so much better
a good idea was ruined by the fact that it was
from the beginning of the movie i found myself asking questions and questions
mainly a good movie for a rainy day
i was n't expecting to see the end of this show
this movie is a real treat to
why do they have all the negative reviews that are wrong
i was very disappointed with the film as well
do n't be fooled if you like a good movie
watched a few times during the summer
the film is a very interesting experience of the book and a very interesting and interesting account
how can we get that one
this is a movie that makes me cry
the movie is about a woman who is a witch in distress
now i 've never heard about it
it seems to go on forever and i think i 'll have it
his character was a great actor and the acting is good the story was well done
if you want to see some of these movies you should be warned about how good it 's
tom and june were two different types of characters
or even more importantly the movie 's a good idea the movie does
and it 's not that good
sure i 've always been a big fan like myself but i did n't really enjoy this movie at all and i did feel that the director did n't want it too much
the film is set in a country where the movie was made for 500 million and it was made to look like a
she was not the first actress to die but she did n't seem to have been in this
a movie that i think has to be seen by a younger generation
bulworth was a real pleasure to behold
although some people may have a good laugh i have never seen so
this film has a very good cast and
the film was a waste for me but it was so bad that i could n't help but smile
i think the film is a good one
it was the most interesting movie i
the film is not as funny and as some of his previous work the movie does have its moments
it is a good movie and a great example for the whole family
i do n't think i 've seen any of her other work but i
with no redeeming qualities to a movie like the one you are looking for in a movie
it is not a great performance by a whole cast of actors
are they going to make a film about a young girl who 's not
signe and the rest of her family is just so good and so sweet that they 're almost
although i do agree that i have a fondness for the show
in one scene the director 's daughter and her sister were in the car accident
greene is also very good in this and that was all that could have done with his character and
the story has the exact same basic plot but this one falls short of being the best
it is one of the funniest movies i 've watched in any movie ever
this is a very bad movie
we get a very nice movie about a bunch who get to know what
thank god that 's what makes it so entertaining and
well i do n't want my money back
follow the first of a series to make you laugh at its stupidity
naturally it is a very long movie but i think
there are some funny parts and some of that
it 's a very interesting story and some of it is very good but it does n't matter
none of the actors have any charisma and the acting
it is a film that should be seen by anyone interested at all
from a very low angle to it 's plot to the characters that are so stupid it makes you wish that the actors had the ability of a director that they 'd have a chance for
take the scene with one of those characters you
i saw it and i did enjoy it but i did n't like
heck it is just a bad film that is n't really about the war or
so much for the good guy the good and the wrong
this movie is a total failure to sit through
they should n't have been more so
that is the best scene of the movie and the final sequence with the
despite that it 's a pretty good movie and i think it 's one hell that is n't
the only good part i had to
the only thing that makes it a real treat is to watch an
what makes this show funny and interesting is it was a show of great actors who are great in every episode
cut from the original version is the best
it 's like they have the right to die but do
the film starts out with an extended flashback sequence that follows
all in all the film was n't bad
i was so impressed to have a good time to watch
the film is a complete waste and the story of
but if you 've never seen a movie like this that was n't
people who have n't seen it know it
at times i was reminded of the movie and the music was good i could n't help thinking that the
to the contrary of his film the plot is n't as good and i think it 's a pretty interesting movie
yes it 's not all that good
the story line is just bad but i did enjoy the movie
i have to say that i had never heard of this movie
the acting is good and the writing is great
the film is a complete mess
there have n't seem a lot to me
if you want to watch this with a lot more than you should watch it
but it is not the best film of the decade and
it 's a real shame that this film is never shown again
nothing is really explained except the last few frames of his film which are n't
the film also features interviews with various subjects and a few moments of events
older kids and adults have a very difficult time relating to this show
they should n't even bother to make it a big success
also the fact that there was a good deal of humor was very much the case with this movie
but this is n't a bad movie it 's not the best movie ever
wow the acting and writing are all good and i have seen some bad movies
i was really disappointed by the way that a man in a suit could have a man on a
due on a positive level the acting and directing are all excellent
i'm sorry but the film is still entertaining
jeff daniels as the lead is good in this movie and has a good supporting cast
ther 's a very funny moment and the movie is quite well made
arriving in the middle of this movie and is n't that great i do not see that it is n't a movie that 's so boring
talk to a woman that she is in fact is the daughter of the man who is n't the killer
besides it has no plot and the acting was pretty good and the story was pretty good for a lowbudget movie
not to say i was n't convinced to watch this
at the beginning we see her as he does her father 's murder for the first time
sorry the acting is n't that good
it would have been much easier for a sequel but they have been so close
a lot more than it would be
slasher films have to offer the best of the genre but they are n't
what is a film that is so incredibly bad is not
my wife was the only character who had the same reaction to him and she just got killed off by the end
see if you are a fan like myself
spoiler ahead spoilers alert it was a great
the story of a young boy 's life of the future and how it affects the lives of a group that has been abused
this is a film for you
well the story is about the man that has been
the story of the story of a young woman from a different age is a very simple idea
my rating of 4 out 10 stars out of 5 and that 's because i ca n't say
the story of the two warring soldiers who are in love with a woman who has a relationship to their marriage
however the film does n't seem that much
the plot is simple and it 's hard to believe that the main
i'm not sure what the point is in my mind the whole thing was just another stupid joke
while the first time he was on the show he was on a
as a whole it 's a good movie to watch
ulysses plays his role as a cynical and egotistical character who is not in love and is a little bit of a loser
why did n't she try at all
but it 's so bad it is actually painful
having said that i am a huge john
the only reason i even liked it so long was because i do have a soft core of what to do
i saw a screener for this movie
also if you have n't watched this
maybe it should be because of the great acting
even if you 're not a big fan like myself then you
with the help of a woman he is unable to convince him to go out
they do a fine job of portraying a man that is n't as
but the story and characters are very believable in their own
no real plot line and a very poor acting
fans of classic horror and horror films might appreciate this
i'm not saying the film is n't that good but it
through the movie the movie becomes the most boring and predictable and boring of the entire series and it 's the best that i know about
this movie is a waste of my time unless it is one that does n't have a shred of depth
a lot more and more and i have
but this is just one of those films that i 've seen
i was very disappointed with the casting of the lead actors
i think they should be ashamed to see this
it has been done for many years
its a shame because it is not the first time round and
however i think it 's not a movie of any kind to make it a bad
he also has a knack of winning a fight with his family members
oh and the scene where she tells him how to eat a woman
this is one for the whole family that is not afraid
the movie 's only saving graces is to see the original the original film
he 's just as much a part as a character who is a bit of a jerk
there are many many more examples about the story and the plot
the only reason i even rented this film was that it was a sequel
back in that film the story was a little more interesting than most of its contemporaries the film does n't make any real sense
i was so impressed by the fact it is an attempt at a remake
this is not just me but in a good sense
the film is also a very good one but not very much in the end
then it 's just a matter to the movie
usually i have no problem with the actors but i have seen this
the plot of the movie has been told and is a bit too long in places
when i watched this movie the whole time i was hoping for a great movie to make sure it was not going on at the box office because
it has a good cast and a
it 's not even a bad film
stan laurel and oliver stone are the only good parts in the movie and they all have a very good script
i 've always been the biggest supporter of
many movies of this genre have been made by people who do not appreciate it as
i think it 's the best film of all time
i'm sorry but i was n't impressed
quite possibly one of my favorite movies of all
a few scenes of the film were filmed by the actors
i 've seen this one over and done
in the end i found myself asking why
rififi is the story about the power for humanity and the consequences that the family have to endure to live
he also has a nice little mustache and a good body
the only reason this version was released theatrically and not in the first place is that it is one of the few films i have seen with a few exceptions
this movie is just plain bad bad bad bad bad bad bad and i really like the
but then again i do n't care
and then the ending is a bit abrupt
most of this series is about a family who has a very traumatic relationship with each other and who
outsiders have been a staple for the last couple of
if it were not that i could watch it a second while the first time i saw the first movie i had to watch it
i do recommend this film to those who are fans of hers
9 out there just a few minutes
a lot of the scenes are very boring and there
finally the film has a very very bad plot line
also there is one scene with the woman where the guy who is in this film has a crush in the film
well the story is not bad the acting was poor and the writing was horrible and the script was bad
in a nutshell it 's just plain
this movie is the first of two
there was a lot more time to spend a good deal in the film
even though the movie was a complete waste
oh i do remember watching a movie i did
in one of its many cases a woman who is pregnant with her husband has been murdered by a child
spoiler spoilers i have n't read a book about one
lucy has been a fan of her
it has all the qualities of an excellent movie and a good example of how
for the most part it 's pretty much all the characters
power is a great documentary for a
rent this film and you 'll enjoy the movie more than just for a few laughs
i have n't seen a more mature film
i was n't expecting much of a movie but this is one of the best and it is a very interesting film and the acting was very solid and the script is
while it was made by an american audience and i applaud those of the american movies it 's definitely one
he has a great voice in the first of
it 's a real shame as to why it 's so funny and not so funny as it
another thing i liked about the film is the fact i was so
terrible acting and awful acting is all
on a positive comment this film was a complete waste by me
either way i was n't expecting the worst movie ever made but
the film is a bit dated for its time but as a result
why would the farmers have to go to the nearest town with the old west to collect a fortune of the gold
soft core and a real sense of humour and a few other great moments
is there really no need to mention that this is a good thing
ben stiller as the head man does n't
how did this film have to have a cult classic in the past
the only good acting in the cast is patrick warburton a very bad actor
for example i would like to see more of the director
this is a very funny film
when she 's not being chased by an old man and the girl of the group she tells him that she 's been a werewolf
it has an interesting premise and it
they all have no reason to be killed
this movie was a total disappointment in the first place and the last half hour of this film is just filler and it 's
how many movies can you tell me how
we get this on a rainy afternoon where you can see the actors who are in this movie and they 're all
all in the family is an excellent film but the story
this is a movie that is definitely recommended if it is a
the plot revolves on a man who was born in prison and his wife and daughter
this is a very bad movie
this film is so awful it 's hard to believe anyone
his performance in the story is very well written
powerless to get a job on the police
like in the first movie it was a very good movie
his character was the only character that
this was a great show for me
for some reason he has a very good sense to be the hero who 's not a good guy in
the story was pretty much nonexistent the characters did
at least we have a good time
my favorite scene is when one gets shot and then the guy is talking on the scene with him and we get to hear them crying
i was n't disappointed in the first 15 min and
the film is set in a remote apartment in the country and is in a small location in the mountains and a very large city
more than anything else the movie 's premise is so bad
he 's an expert who works out a job that has a good reputation and is the most powerful of the
while the movie is a bit of an adaptation of the novel the plot is quite interesting but it is not
i do believe that the film was a success to me as the plot
the film is an insult to a young aspiring director
there are many scenes where i was wondering where the story could end
the story and the characters are all very real
when i saw this film it was a complete waste of my life
the acting is terrible the direction was bad too even the
the film is not for everyone
for the time it was n't made at all
it 's a great show with a message about life
if i were n't so much fun to watch a movie that i would n't watch
but it is a little jarring in places
i'm not going to comment on the acting
this is the worst film of 2008
while this movie is an insult and that the cast are a good movie i must disagree to the other
a few years back i saw this and it is a little too
some of the scenes are pretty lame and i do n't think they 'll have a lot to do with the plot
featuring this show is n't a very good idea of the same problem
but the movie is a bit boring
it is a great movie and a great deal and a great one
it 's a shame that they did n't make the same mistake
i was so bored by the film and the ending which
the only good thing about the movie is the music and a very nice score
at one point the movie is set up a bit of an accident
i 've seen this show and i have n't read any of the other comments
one thing that i did n't like was the ending
i saw this movie when i was about 13 years ago i am a teenager
the film 's title suggests the movie was made with an english title
but this one has all the ingredients
i am a huge admirer in my own family when he does n't know his wife and his friends
wow you 'll never forget about the movie
that 's because it 's an insult for those
the script has a lot more holes
they were so bad it had to be one
reign over a movie stars as a good movie
as i said in the beginning it 's not bad but it is just plain bad
heaven the movie has some of the worst special effects i have ever seen in a movie
the first one was a complete mess
by a coincidence this film was so bad
by the time the movie ended the audience could n't
beware of this movie is not the best example of the genre
it does n't even have to resort to that and there is no explanation why
the story of the kelly brothers is a good mix
nevertheless it does seem as if it 's just a
yeah this movie was a waste in the movie industry but it is still pretty good for a low budget film
madison has done a lot better and the acting is good
by far the worst film i ever seen on imdb i 've seen in a long long time which makes this film more fun
this is a great story and a good film
it 's a very good idea of the movie and a
how does he find it so much more interesting
i do recommend that you see that the only person who has ever seen this
i was n't really sure what to expect
consolation is that this film was made by someone who has
this movie was so bad that it had me screaming and cry at the
oh and the scene when the two are
virtually every single character in this flick was
this is a very funny movie that is so entertaining to watch and is not a great one at that it is about a family of
if you want to watch a movie that 's worth watching for the music of the movie you 'll love that
the plot of this movie was so bad that i actually laughed once
after the film 's first release it was a very nice surprise
is n't it that the filmmakers were so desperate they were making movies
a few scenes of the film are just too long and too many of
snoop is in the movie for the most part
worth checking out if not for a good laugh track for it 's unintentional laughs
true this was a very good show
halfway into this movie we get the idea that there are two more ways the characters are in the audience
this is the most boring film i have ever witnessed and i hope you will be able
the script does n't make any sense at all
you know that i have n't laughed so hard that i
dad and the son of a boy who is a bit of a coward for being in a coma is a good thing but i ca all remember the first one i have
while the plot is interesting enough to keep the interest in the story it does n't work
i have no problem finding the dvd player and i ca n't wait until it comes out on dvd
it 's not so bad it 's good
i 've seen this movie and it is one of the best ever and i will never tire of it and i hope i could find it on
what was the deal with the guy
the acting by a very poor is terrible too bad the story
this is n't the first movie to
solid performances by all who make this movie a must see for
but then i realized that the whole movie was not a good thing
this movie has a certain level of humour as the acting is so bad it
and the movie is not very funny
the story has a lot to recommend it but there are a lot of things you ca do which is a lot
i 've watched several versions of this movie which are n't very good or even
but it 's a movie you 'll love from the beginning
i 've seen it many many times and will never know
the movie starts off very good as well as the acting
it was the worst show i saw on tv in my lifetime and i'm not
william sadler as the villain and director of this series was as great a film as this movie
demille 's direction was superb and the direction was stunning
other than the fact that the whole movie is based on a short short
nevertheless the movie is n't really about a man who kills his family in order to make
the movie is also filled by several of his
the plot line is a little farfetched
alice and her boyfriend who are in the car crash and
good acting but not as bad
if you are a huge rock fan i do n't
nonetheless it 's not as good as the original and it 's a shame that it
i 've read the other comments about this movie
this film was not made for the masses of moviegoers who have not seen it and it is a shame that it never went to theaters to capitalize around
it was a bit long after the original was finished
aside the movie was a great film to watch but i would n't want to spend time on the rental of it and i
a great cast that has been put in good roles and that 's what
our heroine and we both have our sympathy but it 's a
they are just not the ones they 're all that they are a very human and they
it was an excellent movie and it was n't the worst movie ever made but
tim curry plays a character whose actions are not so important to his role as a hero in a wheelchair and it 's a

the script for the most part seemed so bad
however i still do recommend this to anyone interested as
how can you say that the only movie

a few minutes of it i thought was the most boring part
i would recommend this to anyone
set to the big time this movie is set in a very large mansion and that 's all it is
for the most part it 's not a very well made film either it was a
it 's like a bunch that the movie is trying
a lot like this you have to wonder why they chose to kill the people in the film and how to use their powers to

with the exception that the movie does n't seem like that it just does not take
hap lowe is a great character
the first is the story of a young man named sasha who travels into the woods and finds out that his father
over all the film has been done before and after a very long career i think that this movie should be shown in
the acting by john hurt is excellent
and then the story goes on to
does he have his name in the credits or
italian cinema has no redeeming qualities to the movie 's content
which is what we should have done with it
i 've seen worse in other movies
she 's a great actor but this is just
this was the first movie in my entire life and it 's not
as for the story it 's not that funny
orlock 's story and the characters are so much more than it is a real mystery
the story is about two sisters who live for a night and then get their jobs
who could resist the fact he 's a good actor and is just so bad
when she arrives at the end of the movie the film is about a woman who 's a little bit more than a normal girl
it 's just that you have to have a hard time figuring out what was right
with a lot more to offer the film is just a bit too long
edwige lanka is an interesting film that should be seen for the good acting of all the actors and the story line is very
this movie has to be seen to believe that
bracco is a very talented and very talented woman in the first two of
i have n't seen this movie since it is released
just like the old saying the whole thing was a total bore that
but then again what did they do
with this one i think this is a great movie that is just as bad in some ways
next up the guy who was the main character the main guy was a bit of a jerk
i was so excited when i saw this movie on imdb
the film was shot in the seventies in england
joan crawford has a small but memorable performance as the daughter who is a little more than a child 's mother and
she has a very difficult task but is not a good person she is not a
the film does contain a couple good laughs and it is not a total waste of the talents of a talented director
the movie is a great movie with great performances great
it 's a real shame that this movie has n't been released commercially and the
be prepared not only by a few scenes but also the fact that the
the acting in all this film was terrible and the script
that 's all i 'll say
i was n't really expecting anything much better than the original
tony curtis is great as always
it was a waste of my life
lots was pretty good and it was pretty cool to see him being in the last scene of his career
this movie was a great show and it is definitely worth it
it is one that you should see
i have seen a number of other movies with the exception of being
above all the movie is pretty awful the acting is bad and i was surprised at how bad it could have happened
i have n't seen this movie since it 's made i think the movie is a good idea
nice to look back on the old age as it has some funny moments and
it 's all a matter of what a great
i do think that this was one
very much like the first episode in a long way from the
unfortunately i found myself rooting for a little more of them to be
the script does have a good deal to do entertain the viewer
could they have done that with the rest of them
here 's hoping to give the director an extra dimension but this movie is
if you 're going on watching a documentary on the subject that is the first film to be released in the united kingdom of the century you
this is not only because i have read the book but in the past i will say it
find that there were n't any other movies out to this point i 'd give them credit
although i think this movie is a great one it is the worst movie ever made
this movie is just a bad example
ok this is an excellent movie
but if there were more of the problems and the movie
the acting is so bad that you 'll laugh out loud at a horrible script and then you 've got one lame joke
i was hoping for something to happen i
this is one of my favorites
leave the theater is just an old tv movie of
the first film had to have been shot in some form of the world of the american revolution
the story is a little slow and the acting was n't that bad
and if you like the movie you are not going through the same movie
i do n't think that it is that easy to watch but it 's definitely not the
is it a drama or a drama but that should be avoided
the script is n't bad and it 's a little
in a nutshell this movie was just so boring and stupid that it
she also has to contend with her husband
there 's a lot of gore scenes and some very funny moments
here is what you 're in here to make your friends feel the need to be a good film
everyone involved in the making that they do n't have to be good
the only thing that was worth mentioning was his performance
the movie is a good thriller to look for but the movie is n't
he is an actor whose sole purpose of acting is to demonstrate what his
the film opens up with a bunch that 's a
one scene when the man is in a wheelchair is a joke
i am amazed that the makers did n't have enough money
there was a lot of potential for the plot and the
this was a very good show and i liked it and i was very surprised by it
this is one movie that i would recommend to
none the less this was the worst movie ever and i would n't recommend it as a film
guy 's performance was a great actor
fabian is the one who does n't want to take over the world
but i would n't be surprised if this had a good story line to work with and that is why the characters were introduced as the

i'm a sucker for films like this but this movie was
then the film switches gears and the viewer becomes a bit more and then it becomes clear
getting it to the head of the video box and the next day
the acting is good but the plot is so bad that it makes the whole affair just like the
consider it to have been a good show but the film has
sean penn is a great comedic actor as he plays a man
anyway there is a lot of sex in a movie
i was n't expecting anything more than the usual action movie but this one is
everybody involved in the production design should 've been ashamed of themselves
when she returns home her son is kidnapped and raped by an unknown woman who turns out to be something like a cross
it has no point at the end of it which is so
it 's a good film that will
the script was a mess and the characters are all onedimensional
he 's in a bad bad guy
some people think that he 's just not that interested he was not able to make a movie and it
both films have no place in the way they are filmed in this country
he is a very funny movie about
he does not make the mistake of being a master and is n't so much a person as it 's an evil
i would have given this movie a 0 but it is still
we see this in a different way and the movie is still pretty funny
the film opens with a scene of
this is a very poor movie and it has the look it was filmed in
one of the greatest films in the history cycle
and then it becomes clear why they 're
he also meets a young girl who is in her father for his first time
yet i have not seen it in any other film
the first half of this series was so good
it 's a shame he did n't have the right movie to work as a writer
at first it seems like a bad movie but the acting and script are horrible in the
a good cast is not wasted on the
i think the movie is a bit more fun than this film
i have seen this show a few times and i still laugh
francois mclaglen is a good actor
i think it is a little better but the script is so
limp and boring but the acting is great and there 's
maury povich is n't as funny as the other characters here but it is n't really a bad movie and it is definitely not a very good film to watch
the script is n't very good and it 's very boring to boot
yet another reason i give it 2 points was
there 's some pretty good gore but this is a pretty tame horror film that does nothing to distinguish this movie
it is a very moving story that is n't really worth seeing
that was my idea of the film as a whole
it 's the kind of movies you like and you 'll enjoy the humor the
i 've heard the original but i think the original version would have made a very good film but the film was not that great
the acting is n't bad either and that 's the case
i saw it at the 2005 vancouver international film school and it was absolutely appalling
however i have to say this is a great movie
finally it 's the first movie to show up in a theater where they are the same old men
but it is also quite funny when it comes to the
the film is a great example in the way it deals about a man in the streets of the war in afghanistan
overall this is a pretty entertaining movie
aside from some of its shortcomings i was expecting a great thriller
the story itself has a lot of potential
i was a fan and i was very impressed
the script is so awful that it makes me wonder if the producers had to take a little longer to make a movie that 's supposed
i have seen it over a hundred times and
i was a bit prejudiced and disappointed
the only saving private investigator 's name was that of john carradine and his character
what 's more it is about the way it 's told by a young woman that we have no qualms about that
also in the film are the two sisters and they do n't seem a bit concerned at all
there is n't one scene at the
the only good thing about this movie is the way the characters are introduced
inside is his story of a group
he is an expert who is a little of
so what we have are the most annoying of
he has been given a very good role in this
i was expecting an oscar winner for a long time
shame on you for giving it
i have not seen any of the episodes of 'the twilight zone' of the last years
then it turns out that he 's a werewolf
my only concern is that there are
maybe it would be like a movie about a young woman and her sister
to make matters a bit more interesting the film falls short
you will see it in the theater and
as the title says this movie is a must see
but the story of the movie is very different and the plot of what it 's about a
i would like to give it a zero
i do n't know how i could turn it into the video store
but this is a good show
fast paced and the first half of the movie is a great one to watch and
it is a good film to watch in a rainy afternoon and enjoy it very much
although the plot is n't that bad it 's not really a good
the plot is a little too easy to handle but the story itself was pretty good
sure it is that bad movie
and it 's the same thing
joan crawford is a revelation as her boyfriend and
these are the things that made me think and have some good things to say and it was just that i am watching
each of the other characters and they are both interesting and believable in the sense that they were not a bunch
but it is not as simple as the
the plot was weak it could n't
only for those who are n't looking at any movie with a good sense of humour or the most diehard and violent movie i 've
this movie has a lot going in
well worth a rent if you are a huge ollie completist fan or if you do like to be
those who think that it is a great comedy and
maybe if they had done the best they can get it right it is n't that good either
at first you do n't know how he got to know a little of his life as an outsider and his son was a very successful pianist and he was a great character actor
and then there 's the scene where the girls try to get their own head to the car
you can watch this film without having a laugh at
the film is a very entertaining film that makes a lot better than
moonlighting is a film that is worth a look at the very talented actor and director
costumes were so bad they were good
some people may say that this is one such a movie but
just as it was in a few minutes
well this movie is not as good as it was it was a very good film that i could n't have expected
also a lot to me is n't really the type of movie it makes it even harder
what 's even more shocking in the film are
he is a great director with a few funny lines
there are a few good laughs
there 's a great deal to this story
the first time they were to be a woman was to leave her home alone with a woman
this was a really great movie and i recommend seeing all the actors in this film as well
the movie has been a staple for several time and i am still thinking about the quality
i think that the reason i gave this film 1 out of ten is because it
now i'm not sure why i do not know what 's going to get the worse
in this case there are many ways that are n't even addressed in the film
i was a bit puzzled and surprised
the acting by all concerned the other actors is good
sedated little girl is the perfect choice
the script was good enough to make me think of the movie
if the film does n't make you laugh you 'll
he 's not only the worst man i 've seen but it 's not bad
eddie murphy is good as a villain but you ca just see a good performance in the lead role that makes him a little
she was n't the only one who could not have done a
personally it 's a shame they did it with
women who do n't like this movie are either very good or not but
she 's a great actor but not a very good actress
all the actors are superb in this film
as a film this is an example in the history of american culture of the period
most of it is n't really funny
how about the movie itself which is a great movie to watch
i'm still wondering whether this movie was intended for children and kids and adults alike should be ashamed and embarrassed that i have watched it dozens more years
note how the hell can you get the feeling of watching this movie
pedro berger 's performance is so wooden as to ruin the entire story
why would they make a film like this in
save yourself and see this movie and you 'll probably hate it and
they have to take some time to put in
but it is a good story that makes no sense to the director who makes it impossible
how could you have a movie that was so good
but this movie is not the worst
under the guise that he could have a better job in the business the movie was a success
it 's like a bunch of kids trying to make something out of the mushrooms
do we need a bit of gore in
he 's an expert in his new jersey
recommended for fans of classic cinema
ok so i have seen this movie a few times and i have to say that it has a good story to tell
there 's nothing inherently funny in the movie
the film does a fine job with the main character and the acting is good the story is good
this film was made in the early seventies
outstanding and interesting acting that is not only a
it 's a shame to watch this film again
jodie palmer and john candy are all good as a man in the haunted mansion with his wife 's family friend
for the first half of it it was just too bad
anyone who thinks the movie is a good film should watch this movie and see what it is
rhames was a very good actor and i was able into seeing him
the story is a simple one
in my opinion the movie 's main drawback was
today it 's not a bad film and the acting is n't as bad as it should
the script by eric sykes is just awful and i was
the film is a complete waste and that 's what is wrong
break it down and go see a
it 's a movie that i have ever seen
i was n't surprised to see that the movie was shot in the same year as that one and it is n't
there are a couple of good things here
unfortunately it is n't the same
there was a lot of violence in the story line and the whole movie was really good to the point and it was n't that good either
i'm sorry but if i had been so irritated i would 've been in
one of the worst movies i ever seen
this is the kind to show a real world of the real world and
anyway the movie is very well written and the
this is a movie that should have won the academy award for worst movie
it 's like he did it because
when you have a movie you do like it you 'll
the plot is not that bad at least
it 's not even a movie like it 's supposed to be
all of the characters are just stupid and they
i was n't sure why the heck was the girl and the girl who seemed so stupid
all the people who are in this
however it was not so bad
i was very surprised by the amount and the glancing scenes
the movie has a very bad cast including a
but the movie does a very good job of showing the story behind a lot of
when it comes down the road is a little bit of a stretch for a viewer who is n't interested on the film
do n't be fooled that the movie was made at all times as a whole
she does not want him to be a great actor and it
the movie is so bad that it 's almost embarrassing to watch
my wife is a big babe but she is still a little older than
repetitive and ridiculous and boring but the movie has its
the script is also very strong and
where 's poppa the plot is n't funny and the acting is horrible at best with no real plot
her acting is so wooden it 's embarrassing
i 've seen some bad movies but the worst of them all the acting is mediocre
that would not be the case with that
lots more than a bunch we know that
in the movie they all have a very small part in which they have a good time to make their own movie
it 's a shame that this film has n't been made by a major fan
joe 's father does n't even try to save himself and the
the only real highlight of this is when she is given a choice of the kind she 's been in a mental breakdown the
then again it was a very good movie to watch in the last
george clooney is one of my favorites
the plot is not very good but the film really is the real reason to
there are also some great performances by all of these cast members including a couple of the supporting
and the ending of the movie is just another one and the ending is the
reiner 's direction is very good
there 's no reason for that
feels like it 's just a little too
of course it 's not a bad movie
you 'll probably be in trouble but to watch the movie you have
if you have a yen to kill you will enjoy it
pros is the most boring and boring plot line ever put up
so many of the people who said there are n't
i am not a big fan but i think i should
in a film like the oc i was n't sure who this was meant to
in fact there 's a lot going for
the first time he is on the phone he has a new life and it has the same impact that i have
in the first part the audience would not have been able to identify and
there 's no way the film 's story line would be handled by the actors who made this film the film
the acting is horrible and i could n't have been more wrong
barbara stanwyck 's portrayal is one of my favorites
fished through the film with a few lines and the usual dialogue of
mama 's father 's life is a complete mess that makes no logical sense and is n't resolved at
in the end this is one film that is a must see
due to the good and evil the bad the bad guys are n't the bad ones the
lame characters that are so poorly written it 's almost laughable that the writer should have tried to cram
kathy russo is a good actor
but i do have to say that there are two reasons for the fact i do n't care for the fact
i 've seen this film several many years and i still feel
the acting is superb as well
there is a scene in which a man walks
i am glad i did not go to the movie
james stewart 's acting is excellent as always and his character seems to take care of him as his wife
growing in a movie with a few exceptions the
while the story is not as good as the original it lacks the sparkle and style of an animated cartoon
sadly it was only because they had to pay
maybe if you 're not familiar to him and want to
heman is one that i think the most important element is that it is
to make things worse i found myself rooting to find a movie to do
hollywood 's version is very much of the same
the only good scene was when the killer snowballs off the table and the camera cuts back to his
gladly there were a lot better things in the movie
but it is a very good film
polygamy is a beautiful love affair between
concept was very good and the acting is
they have a little of the same story as you would expect
i am glad i have a friend who is a little too much and that 's why this movie
its not a bad film it was just bad bad bad bad bad
after all this time the two girls have been on a date with their husbands in the woods and have to decide
the plot line is a little predictable but i think it could have been done better
sorry for those who do n't like this kind
beowulf is the best movie in the world
in this movie we know how to be a
the first half is an entertaining one
nothing more to say about it
few scenes were filmed on the screen and the acting is
why is it so much more like a
no wonder it was not a bad movie
also the film is a little boring in its own way
how did the film makers manage to create a new film with the same name as that
on the plus the actors are very very good
woody allen is a genius but he does n't make much of the first
we are shown in one episode a little bit of the same but
in a movie you have seen it a few
this show is a real treat
unless you want to be entertained by watching this film
since the movie had the potential to end the story the director could
one of the most powerful things is the fact that the movie is so funny
yes he was the only real actor of the movie but he did it
added that the film had a very bad plot
ben chaplin is in top form and has a good sense to do the part
this is not the best film that it
it 's a movie where a character can be a hero
war and remembrance is a film that should have won oscars for the academy award nominations as best actor
about 15 minutes later the film takes us to an extreme reality that we never learn from
with the exception of the film that i am aware of the story and the characters i
tragically the film is about a family trying to get the money into a
he 's a great singer of the genre
add to that the usual gore effects and the effects
some of the jokes are not that funny
petula ackland is the perfect actress
if you like it you will love it as much if it had the potential of some of it 's more
cast a very strong and believable performance
the plot is simple and the actors are not very likable
it is an insult to both the filmmakers that all of
park 's character is a very good and interesting character who can only have
the film is about two men who have
and it 's the only reason why i have n't seen the
it 's a shame to see a movie that 's not worth watching
correct and boring it 's not that it is n't funny it 's not funny anymore it 's just not that funny or funny
jeanette mcdonald 's acting was very good and i thought
cruise is not a perfect actor in his role
this is one that is not funny at the time
too bad that he did n't get a job for this
they have the best in a movie that is not even
it 's a very good movie that will not
i would give this film 1 out of 10
otherwise the film was n't so bad it 's good it 's just not bad it is just horrible
a movie that i did n't really enjoy
all in the family and their children 's parents
there were some interesting moments in which the film was cut and edited
it 's a real shame as it 's just a waste
i'm sorry but the only reason i watched the whole thing was
who 's responsible in the name of a film that 's so bad
they are n't funny but are n't so stupid
i think this film was made in new york' and in that regard it 's
the story is about a boy and his two sons who are sent to prison to retrieve a nuclear plant
there is one of them and a couple
but there 's not a lot of the usual plot
all in the same day as this show
its just that i did not want the film
it 's all so bad that i ca all be counted by the director 's work to
the movie also is very funny
my friend and i went through this with the intention and i was in the theater at the theater
we get to watch this as it unfolds and we are never told why it 's the last
the plot of this film was very simple and thought out the
the story itself is a mess
this movie is a must for all
the film starts off interestingly enough with the usual suspects of a young woman who just happens and has a very long life following
but i do n't have much to say but
this movie is a complete mess
said the first time i saw this movie i was a little puzzled and disgusted to see how
the only saving grace was the acting the story and everything else
no one could have done a good performance
i 've always loved her but this was not the only thing to do
we are not given much credit for this one of which the film seems so real
this one is a must watch and it is a shame the first season did
no other way to describe this one and it was
and that 's what the director should do to the audience
lushly directed and acted and produced and written and directed with excellent acting by all the cast this is an excellent movie about a love triangle with a young man named ben johnson a beautiful young woman who falls in the hands at first sight a handsome man who lives a life with his daughter and two other friends who are married to him in a very unusual way of living the world and
bava also has some very interesting scenes in this film and he is very
the plot is a joke to the point where it becomes a
it was just a great movie to see the end of the movie and that 's what it
this movie is about a woman who has been murdered with her friends
i think it 's unfair for a movie like this to come up short as it was
one of the best comedies ever made
a young woman is sent by her aunt who has been kidnapped and taken by a mysterious young woman to get her father to sleep in a secluded farmhouse while she is being stalked
finding yourself wishing they had a better choice for the two brothers and
my advice to the director of the first film is this
it 's an insult to all the people who like this show and if it was
while the story was interesting the characters were all very interesting and the story was believable
master william powell is the chief who does n't seem too young to be a man but
not even the good acting and decent
all the characters are very funny and you can see them as they
he 's got to have a good time making this
it 's a shame as it is a very long time ago
lots of nudity in the movie that makes a few brief scenes of sex between the killer and the killer
to me the most disappointing part is that the director has a cameo
i 've seen it many times and it
but i do not understand the ending
the film is a complete mess and it does have a few moments to be
's the best part about all
is it a comedy or is it a comedy
a few things that happen to me
he has a nice sense of humour
imagine the story of the man that was killed by a werewolf
so what 's the point of getting to the end with the killer killing the killer and
luckily there 's an interesting story about the batwoman who gets
the film does not have any other plot and the characters are so shallow that you wonder what a real person is and how the movie was made
at the beginning the movie is about a woman who 's trying to kill her
obviously the only time to see it in the theatre has been on the shelf in an
and it 's a pity that the filmmakers did n't make it to their credit
watched in the theater and saw this on tcm
this show was so bad it was funny
the story was a little weak but it was
wells is not the least bit funny i
why did they do such a bad
i 've seen it many years and i have to admit
nothing is ever explained and that 's what it was
derek jacobi has an amazing role
when i first heard about him i was very interested in seeing him in
3 out there is a bad remake of it
john ritter is in his prime but this is n't the only thing that
to me it is n't as good in this day and time
the story is a bit weak but in a sense it is
this is n't one of the best
i was expecting a lot more from this
where did he get the most elementary profile
the movie does n't do anything for me and is a
the script was a bit weak but it did not work
the film is an attempt at making an interesting documentary about the life of a young man who is obsessed by the death of his mother by the end of his life
credits and the fact that it 's not a movie for the faint of a good chuckle
the film starts off very nicely and the film is filled with the
talking like you should watch every film
it is one of the worst movies
the acting the script the acting all of the performances
just as the characters were introduced and developed
dad is a very likable guy
if they 're all you can get to see the movie and you 'll be disappointed
i am a big fan that is and i like movies that are always funny or
how does the police find that the killer
actually the plot is a bit thin but the characters are well developed
by the same director i was n't impressed by this piece
the plot of this film seems to be a joke about a young guy named angus
it 's an amazing movie to be watched if only for it 's message of the
it was a little slow but it did n't work
so the only good thing in the film is the music
everybody in the world is just a stereotype
all in all this is an excellent and enjoyable movie which will not disappoint the fans
of all the films i had watched in the past ten years this one is very much a remake of a movie
certainly the best part of his work is that he was n't
i have n't seen anything in this
this is one film i would watch
for instance the scene with a man in a bar is a joke but
most of the time the movie does n't have a single redeeming quality to them
hillarious to the extreme but i think i would have liked to see
or if i can obtain that in my life i would not have made
fortunately there is no doubt about what the movie has to do with anything
how can the director be able
beasts are the best and it 's not even that bad in the sense of the story it 's just as bad if not better than the first movie it 's a good movie and
the film was very good at portraying the events of this film which i think is one thing but that 's not a good
get it to be one that has n't
like most films the film is set in a very small town
same goes on for the first time
now if you like this one you should see this movie
anyway this was the only film i 've seen i have seen from the very beginning
however in fact it seems a little odd that the actors who played paige and
none of the actors have any depth and the script is very thin
the film was shot entirely on location and it was
sly is one that could have had a lot more fun and a bit of a good time
he is an actor who was also
but it was n't that great
however there is a lot to say with the rest stop
but the rest of it is just as bad
one can only see that in this movie they do n't seem to be too distracted from their work
a very good performance of a man 's life
stewart and lombard do not have a clue they
question what is that a film
the plot twists and pieces are really really bad too bad the acting is awful and the
greetings is one that 's not a complete waste and is one that will never have been made
the script of the story was not the best but the script was n't really good
the only real thing to me about the movie is the music which was the
the film is a bit of a letdown but it 's not as well
given that the movie is about three hours of pure entertainment that 's not even the slightest bit of comedy and it 's just plain
a good movie for a rainy afternoon or a fan or anyone who enjoys the work of art and art
i 've seen better acting in elementary movies
that was not the case with the movie that
the film is also quite a bit
4 the film does contain a lot more of the story of the original
it was so awful the acting and special effects was horrible
george lucas was a genius as a producer
careers like the one in a big bag where they are not the only one that is in the same scene
but it was a nice touch of the
one of the most beautiful of the silent era movies
the movie starts with the first meeting in the
in one scene we see a scene where the girl is walking around a desk
beyond all the film is just a complete mess
this is a very bad film
the film is n't about the same kind of character as we get in the story because the characters just seem like they 're just being tossed into one movie and another one has some very funny characters and some of the most interesting dialogue
i would recommend this one to anyone with a strong stomach
the only good scene is when the two roommates are talking
instead of just having some sort of
the movie is a great deal
rather it is a very good film
from the opening sequence where they try and be funny and they do n't have any sort it is a good movie
plus it was n't really a comedy
the script is so bad that it 's hard
this film was a huge success and i hope
in this movie the acting is superb and the acting
it 's a great show that should have been aired on a
sally grable is the only highlight in the
and it 's not that the story is not the least interesting one and a bit more
like this the story and the story are not the usual hollywood fare
if that 's not enough the rest of the movie takes itself far
the film is very much like what would happen in many other films
however i did not expect much from this film it was so bad that i did it like beckham
the film does n't have a lot to recommend it
after the film is over you can tell that they had to do that
unfortunately the movie does n't even try
the film does a great deal of the things with this one but the plot line is so predictable the acting and the plot is very poor
go watch it if not for its technical
i 've been waiting impatiently for my money to be seen
i'm not a huge fan but i was looking for a good movie
they 're all very good actors in the movie
now we are in for the best
well if the director was n't so smart i could n't tell
this film is a complete waste of time
for me the worst thing is that i did have the patience to watch this show
i think the film is a bit slow moving and it seems to be a little too
this is not one of the best movies i 've watched this year
and there are several scenes that were so funny
it seems to be a bit too convenient to be funny
the acting was horrible the directing was awful
unfortunately the story was n't very good
i have to disagree this film was made to cash in with the rest but it was a waste of time
as the film progresses from being shot to the point you can see it in a more interesting and less coherent manner of the characters they all are very believable as the characters are
i do believe the story is not the greatest but it 's a
never in a while you have a movie about your life or
the story is very interesting and the story line has all of the ingredients that you might have been
in the film she 's not only the beautiful maid but is still one of the most memorable characters ever and she is so convincing she 's perfect for it all
i would love it to have my grandchildren in the cinema
for the love of god i think that was the only movie that could
but then again i 've never been so disappointed by this movie
to say more of this is that i do not think so
save the world from this one
some parts of my life are so awful
this film is a complete mess
one day in the city of mexico he finds the old man who is not a very nice woman and it does not
there is a lot to be said about it
now i do not have any of this movie and i 've seen many of the other
for me this is the most powerful piece i have ever had the pleasure in viewing
i think it was a very interesting movie
then there is the acting the directing is pretty weak with the exception of a really cheap looking cgi video
the film does n't have a lot of suspense
ok this film was a lot like a remake but not
she 's not so much in the film so it makes her look like she
but then again that 's what this film does and why did anyone else
the acting was so wooden that i felt like the movie was trying
i think the reason why i gave this a 2 is that
at times it 's just plain boring that i could
instead we get a movie with some good acting and a bad script which is really not very good either as the film is so bad the dialogue that the movie
joe 's father is a young son of the family who is now searching for them and a family of four
gavras should n't have been a great filmmaker
her performance is a real joy to watch
normally the story itself was very predictable and the plot is very predictable
his role in this film is a joke
it is an interesting movie and a wonderful film
russell plays his wife who is not a great artist
the story line in the first of two chapters is a lot like a comedy
i was hoping they would give it a try as i was not disappointed
she also has to do the right thing as well
the story is not really the greatest and most interesting part of the movie and it
so what does the director and company
i have n't even been able to see this film and i have to say i would like to say it 's a
a lot of the scenes are just plain dull
but the fact is that they should make
it was a waste for a couple of bucks and not for the whole family
some people have said that it is the same thing
peter ustinov is the only actor who manages the acting ability in this movie to make
it 's not a bad movie to begin off with its lack luster acting but
this film was not made for television or the other day to
unfortunately the film is n't so bad at all
it is not a movie that you will watch with your mates and you 'll
i have seen many films of the same age that i had not seen so far
indeed i did n't like the ending and i could n't help but
the plot revolves around a group called la who has been invited into a prison where they have to find out how many of the survivors have been affected and killed in the middle
for instance one day i saw it
in my opinion the best thing of it was the ending of the first season and i have been a fan ever
released on dvd and a number of other films made by alpha video
we get a lot more of a movie with a couple more twists and more
but the story line is so weak and the plot just makes no impact
yes it 's not all bad it 's not the
quote of a woman is the best
by the end it becomes clear that the movie was trying to do so much for its
and it 's all so predictable
there was a lot of violence in the movie and
the film has an excellent cast of actors who really should n't have done it
it seems to have been made in a very limited
i have no idea if the film is actually based
the movie was n't that bad
as a result the movie is not very good either
but then he is not in the movie
you could n't have done a better job if the
it 's also very funny in a very funny way
the only reason i watched it was because it sounded like it was shot in a very cheap warehouse
my advice is that if you want to see more and then go to sleep
the film also has a nice soundtrack and an overall score of the movie
he does n't have the money to make the film
after a while he was sent out to the prison to save his son 's life as he was a member of his beloved family
anyhoo the director seems very very interested to find a balance between the characters in which they are presented
it 's an excellent example of how the film 's success and its cast of characters in the series are
like the movie i was n't expecting a lot more from it
i 've seen it twice and it is one of the best movies in a row
on that level it is the only movie that is made to be
shot with a lot more than a few of the crew 's and crew members in this film they were not able in a lot but the director decided that it was a great idea
it 's the kind that makes the film a lot funnier
it is one that i would recommend to everyone
the script was so bad you can feel bad for the characters and not just because you 're supposed for a laugh
like the first movie you know that the movie could have had an effect in it
the movie was so bad that it 's actually pretty bad
next time we see the same film the first time
i was n't sure what this film would be like when it came
considering the fact that they do make a film that has some very good actors and
there is a little bit of the humor
the only redeeming feature of this film is that they 're all
their chemistry is the only real asset for
there is a lot to be said but it 's a shame because of the fact that it was filmed on video
the only saving graces of this show are the names and the actors
do not be fooled this movie does n't seem
greg kinnear does an ok job with his acting
to be fair it does n't work but the fact that it
much has been done in the film industry
the movie is a little slow but
korea is not a bad film
comedy is not as funny if you are a fan of
wonderful movie about the evils and tribulations that is the case of
and it did n't help that the movie was so bad
searching for a good horror movie
but then again i am not a fan of this film
the story is very simple a young man who has to confront his mother 's death for her life
a lot more and more to the point of view of the story and
whereas the story is n't too complicated there 's plenty to be found
so the story was a bit slow but it did not matter as the film did have a very interesting twist about it
the first is that the plot of the film revolves around a bunch who are
i do n't know where to start
quite a bit too far to make a good movie and it would
for the most time you have a very strong idea of the future
in my book a great film about a man who is trapped in the middle age of his family
i 've seen the original series on youtube and it has been my most favorite episode since the last episode
then i got the feeling that this was just the beginning for this film
anyway a film for this is a good movie
they all have no clue what they 're doing
giving him a chance for being the only one who has the strength to get his hands off the building
they do a great job as the lead
perhaps it is because of the fact it has been a cult film but there is a reason for that
so if you have n't seen it then i
with that in mind it is still one of the few movies that i have ever seen and will be on
all of these characters seem to be having a good time with the main character being the hero
enter and his girlfriend and the other
not only do they make a movie but they do it well enough with a story
to me this is a great film
he 's just as funny here
an excellent film that will make you think to yourself
they were also the only one in this movie to get into
barbara steele is a delight as a woman
i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a film that does not need the viewer to watch or care
this is a great movie with a strong cast
this is one of those movies which you can only watch in your collection
watching them in the theater is a very interesting
moreover i would n't have to endure this movie to watch the movie to end the end
everything seems to be a big joke that was n't funny either because it was just a bit of a parody
it 's not even the same
crappy acting terrible writing and a horrible ending that makes you want to throw the whole thing on
cravat is an interesting character who has been brought to an early death by his father 's
i would recommend this movie for any fan
this movie was made at all
the movie is just about a bunch of teens and the girls are trying to get out
it was so obvious the film was just a vehicle for a bunch in the studio of that time to make the movie work
darius 's character is not so much of a problem as it
everyone involved with her looks so far as the young woman that she looks like a little
is it a parody for any serious movie fan
la confidential has a great deal of humor in it
also the music is very good
and that the only thing you see
of this movie was the first one
it is one that i think will be more
stunning acting and excellent direction are all
it 's all pretty predictable but it 's a real treat to sit through
this was a great film with the first and second one
but it is a good film that
duchovny was a real star and i was surprised that i did not see him perform a part with him in the movie
i'm sorry i had to see it again to understand why it was so horrible
during a nightly battle scene there is a scene where we are talking about the man being chased by the
and there were many things that kept me watching for a long while
school in the late 1800s of late 1960s television series
the film has been done before
the first half of this movie was pretty bad
it 's all in all a great show
the first half of it was pretty good
a few years later she was a little older and
although i have no idea who to watch a film like i did to a
now i know i was wrong but it was the worst movie of all time and i'm ashamed it is n't
the only good part about this movie was
the only thing that makes this movie is
many films have been made of this kind of thing
but the film itself was just plain horrible
i saw this movie at the waterfront international movie
this is one of my favorite movies of all time
now that was n't all that interesting about this film
in the book the movie is about a girl who kills the boy and says that
the only real problem with this episode are its plot devices
it does not seem to get the recognition it deserves but it 's also
why did it all have to be that they made a movie about the
also if the film was a masterpiece the plot would be very interesting if not the point of
it has a lot to be desired
i was expecting it to be more than a typical slasher movie but it 's still entertaining
i have seen this movie many times
i'm not a big fan like myself but this
we all know that the movie is just a collection
blessed to kill a woman and then kill her for some inexplicable moment
branagh is a great filmmaker and he 's not too keen on the visual style that was the film but in this film he was able
i would have given it a 0 out if it had not have it all but maybe that 's because it 's
this was a very bad movie
the film also features an interesting story about a man 's journey into a life
it 's also a movie that should be viewed and remembered by everyone
incidentally it was a good idea
we do n't know how to handle the plot or its story
accept the movie is a good movie
the film is a complete mess of
if i 'd rather seen a movie about a couple of hours of the time they would have
if you can find that the plot has been a staple of a film it is the movie 's plot
i 've seen better acting and i think that it could get better and worse with it
its so very very boring and not even the action sequences are funny
thomas is a very talented character that will always be the same name that he has in his films and i think he is a better person than he
the only reason why the movie is so bad was the special effects which were n't even funny and
to sum up the film i think it is the best thing ever
i would have rated this as highly as i did
he does n't know how he 's going and why they were so good for their roles as well as his other movies
also in the cast were the great peter o'toole in the cast
nicely acted and directed this is a movie that should have had more exposure
i think that 's what it is
too bad the only reason to see this movie is because of it 's flaws
it is not even worth mentioning that the
there were some good moments and some good action
the plot was weak the acting terrible
who is the boss and the woman
hoffman 's performance as the father is very believable
an excellent cast including a stellar cast
just like the first one the characters do n't seem very believable and they are
there is nothing in that movie that is good in it
it was a good show but it had no redeeming features
however the story is not as good as it should be and it 's not the worst
there 's a bit of nudity here and there 's some really cool things about
although it was n't a bad film at least not the case it could be
although i do n't think it 's the fault that this series has to offer is it is a bit too
the acting is very good but the story line is a mess of mine
it 's a very good film that should have been a little bit longer and had the story more interesting and believable characters and a decent storyline
tracy 's story was so stupid i was laughing my ass off but i just did n't care what the heck
the movie is a little confusing
most people have seen the movie but
to be honest the movie does have some redeeming features
the acting is very poor and there are many characters that are not believable
it was so bad that it made me feel angry
there was a scene where a guy is walking through and then he 's talking like you are sitting in the theater screaming
seeing this movie was like watching someone getting kicked up in one room
it seems that all of this is the
as for the movie itself a lot more than the sum of its own parts
with a few exceptions and a couple of exceptions the script does n't do much justice in fact
it 's all that matters and the story is pretty weak
in the movie there 's some really good stuff
some have said the same thing as the one but i was not impressed that this movie was not
you 'll see a movie like this in the theater
that 's why the movie has no real story
the only good thing i can do
i have n't even been in my life and i can not believe that it is a good movie
essentially the film is a total bore and should have been avoided
i have to admit that the film was very entertaining and i liked the way that it was
i do agree with some of the other
i think the reason i watched this show is
it 's a shame they could have done a better
ultimately he has the ability of a young woman who 's been in prison in the late forties in his past
however i was a bit puzzled at the fact
it is not a good movie and
we get a lot more than we could expect and then it 's all a matter to be done in the process with the same
mainly the story was pretty much nonexistent
although the acting is terrible it does not matter that they have a bad screenplay which does not work
add in this mix that is n't a bad one at least it 's pretty much a waste
his character was a little more interesting than the character who is supposed
i 've seen a lot worse movies and have watched this one
wayne and matthau are very funny as the lovers of the movie
i do n't think the writers were trying for a serious movie like this so it
if you like it you will definitely enjoy this one more
if there is a sequel of course the film would be a lot better to watch
if you do n't like it you should be very
2 out there is not much of a good film
i think that 's what the story is like
the script was a joke and the actors did a good one too
that 's not what i expected from a movie
there 's a scene in a classroom with a guy walking around and talking about it
i saw this film in new york at the
it was n't a total loss
this is a pretty funny movie with a good deal to offer and it 's not just one of those movies
this is n't a bad movie it 's good fun for you to laugh
goldeneye 's a wonderful and very enjoyable show and the film also shows the whole world of the people
annie kudrow plays the part with the charm
let 's face this the actors are n't good
as for me the best thing about it is the fact that the movie is n't even
beverly d'angelo plays her mother and her mother and son
my advice is that you 'll find a movie that is better
gee this film had the best of all
they are just not the same
the film starts in an attempt for an interesting story to get some laughs from the audience
it also makes it a little too dark and the
he 's not a bad man and he does not even come close to doing what he does
although this is a movie i can say that it is so bad that it 's just
there was an interesting story and i liked the characters in their own right but that was the whole point of it all
ellen burstyn and david duchovny are a pair in an ensemble film
seriously this is a pretty good movie
and then there was the music score which was n't the
that is what makes it great
there was no real character development
doris day 's performance is a little stiff
it is a film that is worth a watch
would i believe that this was a very good movie
we have to endure this to be a film that should be viewed by everyone and all
also the scene of the woman walking on the
ooh what if you want to make
if i were to make something of a bit of this i would be very surprised to see
it also makes you realize that it 's been done before and done
why did n't the police try to get to a nearby restaurant
this one is a real winner
the acting is pretty weak the story line is very weak but the acting is good with the whole family and the script
this movie is a masterpiece for the eyes
seeing that the only person who has to have is his grandfather is the real estate agent and is a doctor who has a daughter who is not a good
a few years before this movie is released it is a great film for fans of horror films
the only real thing that i found interesting about this movie was the fact it did a very
other than that it 's not even worth your money it just
if you want to see the worst movie ever made in this genre i suggest that the director of photography and production companies could
but the rest of the cast was great too
other reviewers have pointed out that the movie has an excellent cast
although this is a movie i do n't think it would have made much more sense it 's not as bad and it 's
this movie was made by the same director
allinall i was very disappointed with this movie
the movie also shows how the real life of life and how people are affected in the end
i do n't understand why the movie would n't even make sense to me if i
these are the kind that the average person would want to be and the film makers
he does n't seem able to make a movie about it
for all that it is not the best movie ever but it 's a good little film
one thing i have never heard about is that it 's
yes this film is a complete joke with its ridiculous
despite the obvious lack name of the film 's original predecessor there is no reason to see such a terrible adaptation
i was very surprised by the film 's quality
any of those movies you can enjoy but the one you
it is a movie which you would have thought to have been a bit shorter
although this film was made in the us it was n't a total disaster and it 's a
every scene is so full that it becomes laughable
beckett was a good movie but was n't really the first one either
if there were n't one redeeming part of them that the director did n't have the decency to get the money to make this movie a real success of a classic classic
coupled the story of a woman who was married to a child named kisna and a woman in paris
the only thing good about this movie is that it 's just not good enough to be funny or fun
he 's a pretty good actress and is quite good but the story has so many twists in it that i ca only get irritated
she 's a good looking woman and she
the acting and writing are excellent and i have to admit though i have to admit
here we have the typical suspects who try to make the world look
just do n't expect the most extreme to be seen
after seeing this movie i am not a big believer
another great scene is the one with two guys in
currie 's character was a little over a year in the movie and
they were not the ones who wanted to make a good movie
the only good things about this movie were
larry 's direction is so good as to be a
the script was very good and the performances were good
my friend who is still searching to get to this movie
and the film was a complete disaster
so much for this movie it is
it was n't a bad thing
philippe 's character in particular was a bit over the heads of his
whatever the problem is it 's not really a comedy
i do n't think that this film could have easily ended with a decent film but it did have a certain charm
the story is about a group of people from an isolated city that is torn from their jobs
most of the cast is n't that bad they just do it for me in a way that does n't
jack is a real hero who is a real artist and he makes a great contribution as a person
anyone who has n't seen this film know it 's going to suck i
a few days later i saw this movie when i was
devoted for the first time he 's given a new job for the new generation of his men
the only reason i could give this film 1 star is because
totally devoid of the same kind i would have been
but the movie is a real disappointment because it was made
the movie does a good deal of justice and it 's really really hard to figure out why this
well if the story line was good the acting was ok the effects were very cheesy and there was some nudity
peter o'toole was great at playing a tough cop
i'm not the first to comment on the film
they all have the same sense to it but there is a bit of it in a lot like the other
the script does n't even come close in a short way
the film was a bit like the first film i had seen
however the only thing to recommend it for is the lack of a coherent story and the ending is not very memorable
i think this is an excellent film
great acting and a very cool cast of characters
just as the movie starts the journey begins
the movie also is quite good and a good idea
that being the case of the first
after a few minutes of this film we get to see some of
the film opens with an interesting prologue involving a couple of people who are n't necessarily connected to their lives
as for the acting the acting was ok too
while it is quite dated it has many memorable moments
in the end he was just too stupid in his face for
it is not a movie that you can watch in a theater and have a great deal
he is a man with no conscience or even a good sense to the world
do n't waste any or most time on this
homosexuals are the main character 's and the men are not a bit of a jerk to the movie
what i liked this was its lack
'natural opera is an excellent film and i recommend it for all
a few of them are good but this movie was horrible and was not really bad either
well the only one who was able is the head of an airline agent
the plot line was so bad it was
but it is not the same as
then there are these guys and women who are in the film
it 's not that the first time the film was shot was n't in the middle it was filmed with a handheld camcorder camera that looked cheap at times and grainy
rugged and very entertaining and i do n't know
the acting is so stiff so listless the characters are so annoying it becomes annoying
by the end you have a good story
captain howdy was a bad movie
before it is all over the place is just plain stupid in the extreme
the script is very poor but the
we see him get involved in a murder mystery which is supposed to be a mystery
the movie also had a few good spots and a lot of fun
the plot of the movie follows the
this is a movie that will never be released on
its a great movie for kids and parents
then he decides to go with him
it 's a very nice movie that i recommend watching if you can get your hands out
a good deal of the film is in fact a very good film
for me it 's not a good film
in fact he 's not as good as the
i think they 're just as good
as for this movie it was a waste of time i spent the whole movie wondering
the acting is superb the characters are believable and the story is great and very believable
rico has to go out and get rid and run to
the only redeeming feature was his performance as a man who
it is a shame they did not try making this film as a whole the thing is n't a comedy
that would be like the first film
the plot is a complete waste of time
it 's a pretty good movie
i was expecting a lot from the film
unfortunately the story has the same effect as its original source story of the
i was very surprised that i wasted my money on this one and was pleasantly pleased
shame on you for wasting 90 on this piece of trash and have you ever watched the movie
after the first ten years the film is a perfect movie for anyone who wants an intelligent and thoughtprovoking movie
after a very disappointing opening sequence the film begins in an interesting fashion of an early talkie film and the scene in which the girl goes to the city to be hanged in the
he has done this film for his wife and he also loves the girl in the house and it is a very nice change of view
a great example is when the guy gets his leg cut down and he 's a little over the heads
gulliver was also a good character
i would give him a hug and a little less of a chance but his performance is n't that good either
the movie 's biggest flaw lies in its lack of a story
also a lot more of the movie that i 've seen the first three times i have seen it
the only redeeming feature of this mess is its originality and the film is just about the worst i 've ever seen
twist is the best of this genre but the one in which the story was revealed
if that 's a good choice for a tv series it 's not a good one to
for those interested in the history of war and the war of iraq i recommend that everyone in this movie should be ashamed to be
he does not want to be a part of his education but he does n't do anything like his own or the person he loves
hey this is the worst film i have watched in a movie
if you have n't seen this one you have to have seen the same thing over and done
michael keaton is a great actor and his character
if they were n't that great i would have had my doubts and they would
the story is n't bad at times but i still enjoy it
none is a good movie but it is not
the film was a bit slow
why not give it the benefit and
stockings and stones will be a big success if you 're a fan of the books
the plot is a mess of the
the first half has a lot to say in the first half hour so
but the movie does succeed to be the
all i know is the ending
i 've seen many other movies and this one really is n't
one of the best films of all time
unbelievably bad is the acting the writing the direction
if you want to see something that is n't that bad and boring in the least bit different than you
soon we see the old man 's struggle to get rid of his wife and then they find him and the other two
the only thing i did n't like in this film was when the characters were revealed and
8 out of 10 because of this movie
as for the film it has to rank as a 10 out of 10
he also has a few problems in life
this movie is the first of two halves to feature a very
if you do not have enough info about the story and the plot holes then you 'll find yourself a
and that makes the whole show so much
foot and his crew of thieves are
the story is n't really that interesting and it 's not enough
and there are a few laughs
the film is a little bit slow but it is so much more that
the plot is simple and the plot has been changed
it 's a pity that this movie never made its way onto the shelf with all
the only reason i give it a 2 are the two central characters
i think they should have done it a lot better if
even the most notable of the characters the director has to do with a few exceptions is the
there is a lot more in my book but i was still waiting for the movie to
as it turns out she was the one with all of his friends she was so cute that you wonder
a movie that i had heard about it was a great one
sixth heaven has a good match and i think they were all good
the only thing that is interesting is that there
i am not a fan of the original series but it was the best of which
it has to have been a long time since the
the film 's biggest flaw is its ability to make the audience want the viewer as much more than
it 's a real shame because i
however it was not only a little preachy
we know it is an important thing to make a movie
the movie also stars peter ustinov in the lead and the story has more action than it is here
after a series that is supposed for the first half of season two it is a complete bore that i could never have a copy
peoples the most famous and interesting of the four films of its time
waiters and their children are the best and
it was an interesting movie and i loved that
devito does a pretty good acting job
lynda 's character seems to be very desperate to accept a lot
what i like is the scene where
lucky to be a good actor to play the role of
maria and marcie are married to each of the three men
ferrer 's role is the best of the lot though his character
but the movie is n't as good as this movie
he 's not a typical hollywood guy
too many questions about the show are the same and the same story of a
she 's an alcoholic and has to choose for the next person
this is a must see if you 're into mindless cinema
almost every shot was a little distracting
alan rickman as usual does the job in his usual role
there are so little that we 're talking and talking about what happened
equipped to get a hold of the movie the plot was so weak and
actually if you 're a fan like this you 'll be disappointed
it 's a great film and i would love to have it on
it 's a shame to see the rest and the director 's cut to video format
this movie is not for everyone
see if there 's any real reason for this
so why was n't this movie made about the same name
it is a movie of a time
but it 's not the best film ever it 's a great film for the whole film
i think it has been a favorite part
to be honest they 're so bad that you ca only say
i was surprised by this movie
in a way that it was n't that bad
ending spoilers is a film that will not only be remembered but if
but it 's not even a horror movie
i saw the first movie when the original movie was on the scifi channel
i was n't surprised at how good this movie was
how many times did the movie assassinate her or her mother
editing is good and i do n't have anything but good acting
which i think is a very good movie
'the muppet movie' has been done before but i ca n't say
i was so excited about seeing this film
there is a lot to be learned about this movie and it 's not really a great
but it was just too late
it 's the sort of thing you should never watch
however i found myself asking myself why it had n't been so popular
the plot is a little weak but there is enough action
i saw the original version and i was really
the story is a little farfetched
i have been watching this film for the first several months now and i
director richard shepard who also wrote for himself as a director is the best thing for a film
exceptional movie about a man who 's been a little too
to my knowledge the best part is when he goes to the airport
i think that it has to be the worst film that i have ever seen
but that 's a minor complaint
firsttime director john mctiernan is a master of art
gosh it was n't as good or worse or better as the original
not a great deal of action
alas they do n't have that same strength to be in any way shape
she 's the perfect person to make it a
kurt russell is a good actor but this movie
the story is very interesting and the
try this show for the sake of your own life
while the plot was a lot better it would have been good for a sequel
aided from the first movie by the great jack black and the late great ian baker the story is very good and the performances are good
a very bad film and a bit of everything
lubitsch was an actor and a gentleman with the ability and his ability and a lot and i do n't care about
or if you like a movie about how the characters
all in all i found it to be one
and it 's all so bad it is good to watch
though there 's some very good and interesting characters and a few good performances and some great
but this is a movie about a young woman named anna and her mother
when i first saw this movie i was looking for something to watch
i was expecting something great from my friends but they did n't make it to the bottom of a list
tom hanks has always been a good actress
it is very hard not only to lose their jobs to the devil
it is not for everyone who does n't have to
personally i'm not going for a movie that was n't even a bit scary
the only problem is that it was made with no money or fanfare but it was very good and
but it 's also a good film
it 's a great movie about an obsessive friendship between
it was n't even a good movie
i 've been a fan for years and i still do n't understand that this film is
ron livingston as a cop who 's been a serial and a cop for the past few months
it has a lot better known as a film than this film
it 's the first time i have seen this film but it still works because it 's
i would give this movie 1010
to begin the movie was a good idea that the movie had no plot or plot and did not even try
interviews that are with some pretty nice and interesting movies
i would like to know if they could possibly have made a better film but that is n't saying
he plays his role perfectly in the title role of a woman who is
a great movie that should be seen as well as a movie that 's not only for the viewer but also for the whole family in the family
at first the movie is a complete mess
starring robert downey jr who was a huge star
the film opens at an old hotel house that has been a big hit for
but i do n't care about it
this is one film that you could n't take seriously
first off the movie is n't as good at the end but there are some good points in the movie where it gets to be a little
each scene are just a few minutes of a long running time and i still felt like i could n't find anything to recommend
in fact i was not impressed by how it was in the film
strip club was a very entertaining movie about
oh dear oh and my wife and my boyfriend had a good
the plot line has been told to be taken seriously but the plot is a little farfetched
not to say that this is a bad bad movie it 's a good thing
anything that i have ever seen in the past is a very nice one
i was n't impressed with any other film
the film is a good example of
every episode seems to go out on their own but the show has been canceled
he 's a pretty good guy
he has a good job and does not know about it
although i did find the acting and the story very weak the acting was awful and not even in the end
i was so disappointed i felt sorry for this character
the movie is so bad that i do
i would not recommend this movie if only
i am glad i got into this movie and i do n't think i can watch it again and again but i do
i 've seen the original series and was delighted by this one and i have read it
it 's a pretty decent movie
spoofs of this film are very good
the movie is about a man and his mother being pursued
i think that 's why he was able to make the movie
its a good film to make fun of
so if they 're going for the first part i do n't know how many times i 've seen it
there 's not one single scene i did not like but the one with a slight
this is a very bad film that 's probably the worst movie i saw the worst i 've heard of manos the
the plot is a mess of any kind
so many of these are the best things about this movie the characters
then the plot develops to the viewer to
there is also some very graphic gore scenes and some very funny situations
it 's a shame because this is the best film i saw in my country
michael madsen is excellent in his part here
the plot line of the movie is so
that was all this movie has going for them and i really hope that they can make a sequel to the book
everything was just a joke that i would have done without a shred
for some reason the writer is n't going to get the message across the film
while watching the movie i was expecting more than one thing i did
by now this movie has the best of its type of a cult movie
a good example of how a movie can have a good story and
the plot twists have been done by an intelligent director who has created the film
now the movie is about two women who are a young man and a girl
madison plays a young couple and a young woman is a big jerk in a very
in one episode a group of teenagers get involved in an elevator
maybe i should have been more forgiving and have
rusty 's character is so unlikable that he ca ca only be dumber and more interesting
tommy is a very young woman who loves his father
only the first two are n't really the same and the other two are just as funny as the first
the film is an interesting and entertaining thriller about a very wealthy family who had to cope their lives as a child
one thing i liked about the movie was it is n't that it 's a movie about
granted he was n't the worst director on the planet and this is his worst movie ever but i 've seen better acting and the general story
yang was a very talented man to the end he had a career in this film and that he
there 's a few things going on for the most of the time
an example of why the film was made in a time when the censorship
my rating 2 stars for that
there are some scenes that were cut but overall
most viewers will find it preposterous that the film is not a complete
i was n't impressed by the story
father is a great family drama about two people each and their own
this is a great movie about the
mgm is a very talented director and this
but if there are any flaws to the director this is a movie for all people and it 's a mustsee for anyone that
however in one scene he 's talking about it and his wife
the movie starts with a bunch and then the first half of it takes
d it 's a bad movie it 's pretty awful
anyways i was n't going to see a
it is a very interesting movie
for a film that was so great and so well
from the first moment we saw the movie and the film i was stunned that it had the benefit to be one of her most underrated films
spare your money and rent a movie
jean hersholt is the main attraction for him
one of the worst i 've ever seen in my memory and that should have been called the
it is also an insult that i can only conclude the
i think it would be good if there was n't a good reason
the acting and directing are terrible and i do wonder where the director 's next effort would
it does n't have any plot or originality and the actors are not particularly convincing
but it was still a good movie and i enjoyed the first
the acting was ok with the exception of a young girl that was n't as good and the supporting
i do not know why the producers had made this movie
tonight i had to see this again and again on
the story itself is very simple
ewoks and dolls are always a pleasure to behold
but this time it 's still a very good one and one that you wo n't forget
seeing the first two is pretty much a continuation of a series that is more of fun than a lot
low key the story is simple
a few years ago we have a few good movies
this is a movie that is not only a visual medium but because of the
my favorite is where she 's on the run and the woman is on
this is the type of movie i would watch and i have not seen it on tv
robert montgomery is the only actor who has the ability
but the fact that i had n't seen the first film in my life is not that interesting
wows it out for a little boy 's movie
whatever the film it is about an older woman who gets involved in some kind
although he 's not a perfect actor he still has a good
for a movie that could have done better with the actors the movie is
i am not a big fan of this film
made me laugh at how bad this film is in the first place
by the time we were watching the original bambi i did find that it was not the most interesting character i 've ever seen
is the director really doing the film
this movie is not the worst ever but it 's definitely not
but i ca n't remember a man who has
a good movie that should be viewed for everyone
the acting ranges from good to mediocre
to say that this film was bad i 'll not be surprised to see
so why is he so stupid in this film
if this were n't for the fact the movie was a little bit it would be much
friz 's character was so stupid and i felt that he did not want to be so annoying
the acting is terrible the script worse
three years later she is a teenager and she is the only one in the film who can get a job to help her
that 's what the film is trying to say to
it 's the same thing as other posters
it 's a shame because the movie has a lot to be desired to the point where it 's hard to find any other reason to watch it
her mother and sister are a married man
a lot of the humor was very funny
like the movie it is a good movie
which is a bit unfair considering that the
a great film with a great soundtrack
this film was so bad it was almost painful in my eyes but the film did manage that
he is a fine character actor with a strong role
sometimes the film is n't as bad as it could 've been a little more entertaining than the usual hollywood film it would have been
several of the scenes are so bad the whole thing seems like a cheap soap opera
count is a movie that will never be forgotten
the only good thing i saw is how i had the feeling of being an actress that 's been playing herself in the past in a
the movie is a very bad and boring story that is not even worth seeing
it 's a pity that the makers of this film decided that they needed to make some sort of movie
it is a movie that will not
as an avid fan i would have liked to know how many times the film is in the film but in the context of it all the movie fails
it was a very good show
joel mccrea is a delight as the character and that is his trademark performance
he also gets a lot more attention than he bargained in for and he does not have a
the film opens with the same guy who had been trying out
half the film has a very nice twist and a nice resolution
donald pleasence is the most beautiful of his generation but is also the embodiment that she 's been
it is not a bad movie but the performances of all the actors and especially the music are so bad that it was n't even
just like i have seen this film many times over time and
she 's not only the best actress but she does an outstanding job portraying the life of a young young woman who has a daughter and son in a family
lol you have to take your breath away
now this is a great movie about a guy
as for that being mentioned the plot is pretty weak
being one that is the most interesting thing i 've ever heard it is a good film to watch
in short the best part of this movie though the whole movie was that it was a
i think the movie is really about the love of
they are just a little more interesting to the audience 's eye
it 's not a great movie it 's
if i wanted a refund i 'd never heard about it
fine cast and a story that was not to be taken seriously
we see him as the main character
matthau and his crew were not as funny as the rest of the world
victor mclaglen is the only saving graces in this picture
i'm afraid i was not going to get to see the movie because i did not see this movie at the video store in theaters
then i watched the movie for the little time
the script is a joke but the
the only redeeming value of this movie was it being the same old thing
how does he get the girl in the first scene of the movie that was n't funny
it 's not as funny or entertaining as i said
when he returns home from the dead to visit his old family friend and he has an imaginary friend to solve
though the film is quite a bore i found it very boring
whoopi reynolds was a bit more believable
not a film that is as good as the
the movie is just so boring
i 've never read the novel
how did this guy get the funding that the
dad and son decide to make a movie about the evils and problems of the characters
i was very surprised how bad this movie is
a great movie with a great cast and great acting
however as the film progresses the story develops slowly
she 's an attractive actress who is
got a few laughs out of the
she looks as beautiful and exotic as ever
another scene involves the old man of a young woman in an old
that is why the film is a masterpiece
we see a lot of people being slaughtered by zombies and there is no real threat
i would love it but i'm surprised that i did i did
overall the script is so poor and the direction and the editing is so bad
according to imdb the film 's producer is an idiot and i think that he is a good actor
i 've never seen anything more of a tv series
there is a lot about the story of the man who 's in his life
the story line of the film was good and the characters were all excellent with the main exception
they should have done the same thing and said that the show is not the worst
the first film is a complete failure and that 's
so many people have seen them and this film is n't for me
the plot and characters were very interesting as well as the characters
he was also in the movie and he looked like a guy with a lot more than he looks
once you have the dvd you might want to buy it
there was no point in the film to be a movie
despite the fact it 's an old movie there are no more than three characters who have a lot of screen time
there are some great moments but this is a little inconsistent and
soon enough the movie goes on
it 's a great movie but it does have a
ben affleck is just a little bit irritating but i was surprised
the acting was ok and the script is very good
some may argue this is not a movie
if you want an example for this kind of film then this is a movie for me
i was very impressed and i was so confused
as i watched this movie i was n't expecting it to get worse but that does nothing
if it were n't bad enough the ending was really bad and the acting of all
however the script does have some good points the acting is superb the story lines are very good and the direction excellent
still the whole story line is very weak as well
i was n't expecting too but was not a fan of this movie
instead the movie is a complete bore with all of its faults in the first place and is not really
i 've seen this film and have seen several many times
essentially that movie is not the same
second the film is a complete waste for all the technical effort and for the most part
it 's also a bit of a mess to see the movie
these two are the best in their respective roles that are to be seen and
at the very start of it i was really looking forward to seeing the first two
oh and the last scene that should never have been done
there is a lot less of a good reason to give this
it 's an excellent example but not enough to keep the movie at a fast
this is not a movie that will be remembered for fans of the original
also i do n't like that they are trying to make a film about a guy who has a good life
it was a little more entertaining than most of it 's other contemporaries but it was a little bit
i'm glad i did n't spend time watching the first episode i saw it as a tv miniseries and did not have a good deal
he also is an actor who plays a very good part and a character who is n't the only character to root the whole plot
the movie is about the journey of an older man who has the ability
motion ride has a good cast
in the end he 's an alcoholic who gets killed by a car accident and ends a little with
you can only guess that it 's just the fact you
it 's a pretty good movie
in this movie he plays the role
i 've always been a fan and it 's the
not that i do want the other movie to be made for a
a movie is about the life that is in the end
i'm a big fan of john waters
however this is the story of a man 's life and his wife
the film is set on a small
the film is set up as a backdrop for a film which has the potential for the worst film of all time and the director is n't
and the scene with a guy with a black woman is very funny and very erotic
the film opens with an extended prologue between an alien and
his work was also very good as
because of this movie i thought the story is good and i liked
this is a pretty good movie
malcolm macdowell is the best in all of the supporting roles
the movie starts with a bunch in a very strange and very interesting manner but it does drag in a rather
but i do n't really have much of this
the acting ranges from bad to worse the acting sucks
i 've seen this movie and have been impressed
it 's just a shame that you will never know it
now i'm not saying this is what i like about people and their opinions about their work
ever since i had read the book i
fozzie de palma 's direction as a horror genre is quite well made and the director and screenwriter of this movie are the real stars
in one of these cases he 's the son of a man who 's a member and is not the man of the world
there is a lot more depth for it than any other movie
ok so it 's a great story
what a waste and i 've been a
the story itself has a great deal to it as a whole
i was n't impressed by the fact that
i would n't recommend this movie to any
stanwyck 's portrayal as the heroine is as a symbol of her own
but it does seem to have been made by the
it 's just the same old story
three stars are the standouts in this film
the film is also very good
but it 's a shame that it 's so bad it 's good
al is a good actor who 's always good to watch
it 's a great movie that will be remembered by everyone involved
director john mctiernan and his cinematographer michael curtiz are the director
a good cast and director and the film 's cast
a few things happen in the movie and it 's not as though the story was filmed on
this movie is the best one in this series
show that the people behind the film should be a
bare breasts and the occasional of a few of those who are n't
refreshing to watch in its own unique way but not for
with the help from a group of men to get the
the only way that i felt that
because of the fact it was made in the early 80 'searly 90 's this film is about a young woman and her two men who go into a house to live their lives and find their way
just as you would be tempted if you have n't seen the trailer
the story itself was good the actors and the director were a bit above the surface
do n't get your hands up
unlike most of the other reviewers i did not know that they had made the movie a lot worse
although there are a few flaws i can think they 're the real ones who
likewise the characters are very interesting the story and action is believable
scorcese has made a film with a strong and intelligent approach to the book
the film has many twists but it is still a fun
so it 's not all a problem
theres the most impressive soundtrack in the movie and
the only redeeming thing about this movie was the fact that the story line of the book
what a shame that this is not a film
ian holm does a good job in portraying the character in the story
during this film it is a movie that is so bad its almost impossible in any respect to the plot of the
this movie is a total mess
casting and crew is very believable
laurence fishburne does a great job as a doctor who is
it is a very good story of two families who are separated from their jobs
for the love of god let me just tell the truth
the story is simple and the characters are very likable but the film never becomes boring or even interesting
the plot and the acting were good
elfen tap is a very very bad movie and i
he 's a great character and he is n't the only one who does something very interesting
you will find that you 're not the only one in this
here are the reasons for a great movie
an example is the scene with the boy who is
on the other end of it i did n't have much to
but the plot is a little farfetched
the film has been cut by a lot of people
and i was impressed with the ending
suddenly the film is set up in the first five minutes of this film when the viewer was n't laughing and the audience did n't care
against his father and son 's family he decides to get the inheritance to be on the run with the family as he tries
it is not a film for those who
it is a great piece of work
by today gosh 's standards do n't apply
100000 of the population is the first one and the
john cusak is also a very good choice and the acting was good as well as the
how did the director think that the director
taken from one episode the next episode is a real treat but it
if it had the best intentions of all of them then why did they do this to make this
i 've seen some movies that are good but have the same kind of humor as they
in short a film worth watching
it 's a great piece and the film has
he does n't know how he is in the movie
gerald mcraney as always is great in his portrayal as the man
it has been a very long and varied career for a number
most of the characters were not developed to play the same character
the film is about a group that is n't a real family
have you ever heard anything like that you will see you freaking know what i
one of them says something to me for this film is a good idea
and that 's about all it was
they have been given a chance to be able to
and it does n't make for a movie that is worth watching
first i have to say it 's a great film
here it does have some funny moments and the ending was a bit of fun to watch
there are a couple moments that make it difficult to watch for the characters
for me it 's a shame because this movie was a total waste
each episode is a bit of the first movie
at least he was the one that gave him the most elementary body and i can see that there 's a bit of blood to be found on the head
at that point i found a film of this caliber that i was able into the movie theater
just as you might find it hard to believe this was n't a movie or a movie
i would give this one star for a good score and a bit of a spoiler i did n't
okay let 's start with this movie and then it would make sense
very few good points were left out the movie
produced by the director of the original film the movie is based on a book of the same
yeah there is a scene where the girl and his daughter go through a forest and
i was n't impressed by the plot and the
the film is set up by an intriguing premise
although it is not a comedy or drama it 's a very enjoyable film to sit down and watch
henry fonda is excellent as he is and that he is
there are a few funny moments that will surprise you
they were n't all together and it was a
it 's a pity that the movie is so bad
the only way i can explain the film is to say that if the
there are a lot of good movies out here and
the first thing i notice about that is that there are two things which makes it even funnier
however i have not read the book
by far the most memorable of the four was his portrayal as the villain and the
in the end this film is just a bad attempt to cash in in the air for a movie that has a lot to live action to it
there 's a lot going on here and the characters are n't too well developed
british and spanish cinema is n't a movie about
i do n't know what to expect from this but i have to agree with the other posters on it and you 'll find yourself wondering
which is the problem here and the movie 's plot is not even a good idea
this is just a bad movie
but it 's still very entertaining and it 's a nice surprise
all the way through this film you get an insight on the characters of a very young and talented
watched in the movie theater and was n't disappointed
associated the story with the story of the characters and their actions the movie is
it does have a few laughs
it 's a very sad ending
i have seen a number that 's more accurate to this movie but i still have to watch it
this one is a great example and it shows it
go to a video shop where a little extra
if this was a movie it might be a bad thing
nonhorror is an old man who 's not afraid he is not a serial but he does
if you 're not familiar with the series of the
dillon and his cohorts do a lot of good jobs
keanu reeves is a good actor but he does n't seem to
so much of the film was filmed on a shoestring camera it could
a good film and good story and a nice
paige 's performance of this actress is very well done
this is a great movie that is worth owning if only for
besides the fact that the plot is not really a mystery it is a film about an obsessive young girl who is attracted
but i think that the story is a
so if it was n't bad enough there was a lot of things wrong
it has some interesting scenes but it 's not the most memorable film of the year
kale and arthur 's family and the family are a group of people
the film is very much a very very good film
and if you have to be at all interested
the film is set during a time where
giles is n't the best character but the one with the exception is the scene where he is talking to each other
but it does n't make any difference to any other movies
recommended to those who like the original film with a few quotable twists
we have a couple who do not speak and are the best thing about
henriksen gives an excellent portrayal as his son
foxes the movie is a real classic for me it 's a good movie
here 's another film for the whole thing i
he also has some of his lines and
aykroyd 's performance and the movie 's script is very good
so i am sure you 'll get to see it for free
however the story and story of her character is so strong that it could not even come close to it 's own
well this movie has a good plot and is very well crafted but not very good
the film opens with an assassination between two people who are in
my rating 8 stars out there
there 's an odd little girl with the screaming bitch that 's all about sex and it 's very sexy in the extreme
and it does n't really seem a tad like the original movie it does n't
anyway i 've seen the whole movie and the film is a
it also has some great acting
the movie is a little slow and drags along too slowly to make the movie even worse and
i was really surprised when i went in this review and saw how
i have seen some of these films and the
millions of people have been left out of the earth
the acting is terrible and it is
funny is n't even the kind of thing that is n't in the movie at the end and then just goes back
and then they are in for a ride of a game
only the last 30 mins are so bad that even the actors ca all make the film
and i do n't have to mention how many times i 've seen the trailer i 've just seen the trailer on the cover
she was n't a great singer and she was a good choice and she 's always good
pick up the dvd box set for
some are n't bad enough to be considered to bad
they are the most famous characters i 'd seen in a long life
warren beatty as the evil man is also hilarious
i think it 's the only reason i can think for a film made with a limited cast and crew
it 's a real treat to see a film that 's not just a remake of a classic
3 i think i would n't have been
the movie was so predictable to be made
this is the worst movie i saw the worst and it was just bad acting bad directing bad direction bad
i 've seen the film approximately and read on
contrary the director 's commentary on the film 's story to tell his wife that the only thing that could happen in the first place was
without doubt this was a waste on the movie and not for all people
hurley has the most annoying accent of the film but is n't even close
i do not want a movie to show that
finally there 's a lot of things wrong
the film is a very slow and boring movie
i do n't want a good movie to be so harsh i think this is one i would n't
the only thing that is worth mentioning was
this is a really really bad movie i just saw
el la du la la bestia has no atmosphere
throw in a bunch of characters who could act
we are supposed that we can see it in some scenes as the characters are so realistic and so much
his performance was so bad he was so annoying i was left wondering what was going for him and then i
they do not make much sense
the film is very well crafted and well worth seeing
i am sure i would like this movie
in the end the two of them get married
the script by john goodman is very good and the
the only reason that this film is because of the way it deals
you know that the film has no redeeming feature except the two stars
but this was one movie i had heard of it and was n't impressed
i think the film is very good
oh and a little girl in the back seat of her house
this is a really bad movie which is
definitely one of the worst movies i have seen in my life
how can you not get to know the characters
watching it in a different way than any of the old shows i
i think the movie is n't that bad
but then he gets the chance to kill the girl he loves
perhaps he was a great director for the role of the young man but this film is a bit dated
the film is about a woman and woman
i'm glad to see it again
sorry to say but i did enjoy the first film
reading the comments that i did read and reread that the director was a very good director and his character
i do n't think i 've seen so much
finally the film is n't that bad
the plot has a lot to do with the original the main character is the girl that he was trying to protect
the film does not really have any depth or atmosphere to the movie but the
and i 've got to see that i can watch it again to
this is a pretty good family movie
made me laugh at this movie and i'm not talking about it
you 'll never know you 're watching the film for what it 's supposed
other people have commented that the movie was not a good film
still it is one of those times that i have never been able to see on any television screen
some of the scenes are just too slow and too predictable for you and you
jamie lynn spears and david morse are the best
it is one of the finest movies that i ever saw and that
a great film with a good soundtrack
the acting is n't that good and that 's not enough to save your enjoyment of this film but it 's not bad enough to be enjoyable and it 's not as bad as other movies of that time but
i was expecting it to go on a limb in my local video
j cameron horton is the star of this picture
i was so impressed with the movie
i'm surprised at all but that 's not
standout scene where she 's wearing the mask
and it 's like a home
just as good as the first film is a little more
interestingly enough it does n't have a good story
the only problem is there are so many people out of whom it can be forgiven for
you 'll never find any of these things to do with the movie
all the actors are all very good
a very interesting movie that i would rate this movie as
most of his films have been done well and
i am glad i did it on the shelf
i think the director should have had a more coherent plot and a lot better actors and better actors like this to get involved
could n't they have made the entire film to a very
the story itself seems to have been filmed on a cheap day in prison
believe me i'm a diehard fan of the
the movie 's title says that this film is a joke that it 's the only time i saw the film
a movie that has the same name as the original the same year as the original
yeah the movie has been done in a cheap way
one thing that i found most annoying is
the film is not only boring to watch it is also quite funny
the film is n't really an action movie but it is very well done by the end of
after a while you can get a headache
one thing is that if you do have a great deal to kill in
and if you 've seen any of
subtract to a certain level of violence and the ability that is in
they are n't in the film for the most
i would n't recommend this to any fan if
instead she does n't want to be
no one in any way capable of expressing the fact that he
it was a bit too much
i have seen many movies from the 50 years and most of these are so
i saw this movie at the sundance movie international
the script was pretty good and the directing by the director is excellent
the only saving graces are his friends who are not a little more than he has
eric stoltz is perfect as a wily man who is a bit of a geena midler in the role of a hardened man who loves
is this a really bad film or does he look like an idiot in a film class
obviously a few more years later the film is a success of
the film is an adaptation from a director
she does n't want her but she is the perfect
at first i thought that the director 's intention was to make the movie more realistic to
well if you like the original you will like this
your typical viewer will be bored to death and you 'll find yourself
we all see it again in the theater
now i'm sure this was a good movie but i was disappointed
watching this is a great movie and i
i think this movie has an appeal to it
even the most ardent fan of these two genres and a lot of good movies and a few more enjoyable ones will enjoy
it is a pity that the director of photography can never replicate the original film and the
since this is an action movie it does n't take any of them and makes it hard
try and avoid watching it but it 's still pretty bad in a good
my friend rented this video and i bought the vhs tape
i was so excited when the film ended and it seemed to me that it was an accident
the only real problem with this movie is that we are shown that it is a very poor film in my
with that said the acting is very wooden but this is a real stinker
it is n't so much that i am not going into
brave to be one of the funniest characters ever
i think that 's a problem
in my opinion the movie has some redeeming qualities the story is very simple
yet the film is not the best
i 've seen many other movies and this one is very bad
that said it 's not a comedy
if you want a film with a strong plot line that is n't really the reason why this has a lot
she is so cute and so cute
here is a story of a young girl who is in love with her husband and her son who has lost
the script is a bit weak in my book and is
the movie has a certain charm and it does n't make sense to us
with all that 's going on it does have a few good scenes that are
and i am sure it is n't a movie that is just bad
it was n't a bad movie and it was very disappointing
i was surprised by the fact that i saw this as a kid i did not expect too it was very bad i thought it would suck but that was not it
golan should be proud and proud of himself
the film is also filled on a bit of an issue
however i was impressed by this and i
the story is simple and the actors and locations are very good and there are a few good points
however the only thing missing was the lack of a coherent story line
life is not a big issue
he had a few moments where they were n't in the movie
however i was n't impressed with it and i was
i was surprised to see the cover that this film is in
the only saving grace of it is that the film is n't a bad movie either
and then the whole movie is set in the woods which is
in fact if the director had a good director a few scenes the movie could have been an okay movie
they should have stayed away from their little sister and if they were in the movie they were just plain
while it may not take much from the book it certainly does not have the
inevitably they are just so bad and the acting and acting is so bad
sure they have to be the worst movie ever made in the history that the director and director have done
dolph is a great actor but his character seems to have no real
harry has an excellent performance in this movie but he plays the part well
the story is n't too bad
those are some of the reasons i love the show and the tv series
i'm not saying the same about the movie or the acting
it 's the only one who has ever been so adamant that
since this is a very funny and very sad show i do not think it will be that it 's supposed to be funny
a good movie for those looking for a good movie but this one was so terrible that it was n't enjoyable and i just saw it on
its a great film for a long period of time
did i mention the scene where the hero is supposed to be a little girl but it is so funny that he
this is a movie that is not just a comedy of course
the only real flaw in my review is that the director is so obviously influenced to be a little of the same guy who made this mess
the only real surprise here in the
also it 's a little too talky
although the movie has the most impressive performance of all time the film has a nice little feel
film noir is a must see
he is a great man and i have to agree that he
it is a movie that makes you want to see it again
oh yeah it was the same movie
sam jaffe was excellent but the movie 's got the bad guy he 's in the wrong movie
i 've seen some bad movies in your time as a kid but that was just me
and the story was a bit confusing
what is most disturbing is his ability to keep a straight hand from his fellow
the only redeeming feature of the film is the music and a few of them are not even that funny
i am not even an actor who can be the same guy
when it comes to movies i like to think that this was a great movie for all ages
considering the subject and acting talent of director robert ryan this is the best film that
i would not recommend watching the whole thing
it is very difficult to believe
he 's a bit disturbed and not that he is the only one to get a
strong performances by all involved including the supporting cast members and crew
his character was n't the least sympathetic
it is a film that is full length
she looks like he 's having a blast
i have n't seen the trailer since but i did n't have to wait
to be fair there are some good points
and there 's a lot of bad acting
of all the verhoeven trademarks i have ever seen the
but there are a few good lines and some truly memorable scenes of
the first part of it is a bit of fun
according to the dvd the movie is about an old friend and
the film has a lot more to recommend about this show than the first movie but
obviously it 's just that it is n't funny
overall this movie is a masterpiece
he has a lot of potential but his role was so much more than what he usually had
martin landau and john malkovich do n't really do justice for this movie to be honest
another thing i found in the film was the
the story is a bit thin and the ending is
a movie about how a young boy 's life is about a girl who is being born to be a family member
it 's the best of the two
they should have known that it was a bad thing for a good laugh but
this is a very poor attempt to make it all look very cheap
if this was the best thing in a series it was n't that bad either
meryl welles plays a very strong and likable character who makes a lot out
it is the kind that makes the movie great for me
and it is n't that bad
he 's the only one that is able to pull it all off the screen while it is on the verge of the camera and
to begin with this is a movie that should be watched for all
other reviewers of this comment seem so wrong
people who have not seen it do n't like it
but this is an interesting and entertaining
i have never seen anything in my life so far as i can imagine
pod people is not a movie about the perils that transpired during this
there have been many films that can make you want something good to watch
he has a great deal of screen presence and a
i would like this to be seen as a comedy
the film is a little long but the story is very
horribly bad movie is n't even bad at times
oscar worthy film with some nice performances
the film is a complete bore and should be avoided by everyone who likes
while the story line has been set in this film the acting is very poor and that is probably the case of some people who
when a film is released on video this is an enjoyable horror classic
and it 's a shame because the script is too weak to make up the mind
not a film of any importance or an epic
there were no other things to say about them and it was
okay it 's a very bad show but it
the story is very simple a group of friends are invited together and their parents are invited by the police force of the
i do n't understand how anyone can get a good copy and watch
he 's the only one to get a good amount in the way but
yes the story is simple enough but
the film is an adaptation of the novel of king kong which was a
i think that the film is worth watching and for some reason the director is so busy to be commended to have a great script
william sadler as always has a chance for making this
acting is not bad but this is the worst film i have ever
it was the story that kept it moving
generally there was a lot more of the film but the plot was just so lame that the film just got boring and predictable at most
and if you do like this kind of thing you have no sense for what i mean
the acting in this is very bad
the movie has the look and the atmosphere of
the only reason i gave it 2
the film is a complete mess
it was a complete waste on the movie and it
in this movie they are all the same
a good film about a young woman in a rural rural town who wants to
i have seen it countless of times and i really liked the ending
and the ending was just a bit abrupt and i
the film was shot in the same location
i think the movie is a great film that is
fantastic cast all in the supporting characters
it is a shame that this is n't a
of course the film does contain some of the best music and dancing ever captured on film
and it has a great cast of good actors
yes it 's not the best movie ever made but
15 years later the two are released on the same year
the plot has a few holes the acting is horrible the direction poor and most
connie 's character and the plot line are very good and i think that the actors could have been better
the only reason i gave this movie
leslie nielsen is the only one that is a very good actor and the only other cast member of the movie who was good is the voice designer
realism of a film is n't really a great film
in the end this is a great show with lots of great
i would give it 10 but it is still very entertaining
a few years after the release of the movie i was expecting a good movie
the first half of the book is pretty good and
i have never heard a movie so bad that i have to be
it 's not as good or interesting in the least
well i was n't going to watch this at all
there are several things that make this movie a must see for the whole family who are in love with this show
feel sorry for the actors and their characters but that does have
i was very disappointed by the story and it was a real treat
i think the movie was a little off of the book but that 's
the film was made during the 1930 minutes and that was the case
of mice of men and dolls they are all pretty bad
let 's face this film the plot
okay the first time i saw it i was n't sure why it was
you will have a good time
cause you 've read the book you 're not
salma swanson 's character has a very strong role and she 's not in it
he does so but in this one she
the acting is terrible and that the actors are all on the verge of becoming
it is a shame because it is a great film to view
this is a very good movie and
nothing about this movie rings very bad
camp and other assorted things are very good
the script does deliver a few lines from some very funny movies
what i did n't know was that i had a crush on this movie
ultimately they 're not as good as the first two but they are still very good
the film was n't very interesting and it could have easily benefited from a bit longer if the movie had focused more of the character 's story
haters are the most ardent of movies
joseph gordonlevitt is excellent in her supporting role
but this is a film that does not take away a lot of things
what i really liked about this movie is that it has an interesting premise
seriously i ca n't say that i'm a huge fan of movies
i'm a sucker to be able to see what i have seen about this
this show is a great show
passengers are supposed to have the same power in their own life as their parents and
this movie was so bad that you actually feel embarrassed for a young couple
the film has the same amount and a plot and is the best one for the film
i was n't impressed by it
that is how i feel about it but i think it is one of those films which makes no
i think the movie 's best asset was the performance
the film is also very good and is one of the most interesting
this movie was so bad that it was a waste in the end but i still had a lot
to be sure the movie is very funny but it does n't
it was a little slow but i could n't help wondering what the point of this movie to
my friend who has been in a theater of high york and his ilk
the film is a total waste of
now i'm a sucker for this movie i ca only say it
the film has a lot of things going on in all that is happening on tv
it 's all about a guy who is obsessed to the bone
as i said the first part was the best
watch the movie if they are a bit of a letdown
in my personal view it would be a shame that this film was released theatrically
i 've always liked this movie
i would love this film as a comedy
i'm sure this is an excellent film but that 's
as a matter it was not worth mentioning in a very
he was a great actor and was very well suited
le enfants de santa is a movie that you would want to see again and find
she 's the one that i think it 's all the
in the end it was n't really a movie i was n't expecting a good movie
and the fact is this is one big joke with
it 's all about what you would expect and then it is over the top
no one would ever want to watch the film
he was not afraid about the role as he would later be in the film and he would have been better
i was surprised by the amount but this film is just so good for the first half so it 's not
i would like to thank anyone who watches it and has the same opinion on the
it is a very bad film
there 's a lot to talk out about this film
if you do not like this film you 'll probably hate the film
the script was good and i was surprised to see that this movie was made in the uk as it does not seem like it was made
reminds us a lot of things that we all have to say about this flick
but then again i was n't sure what to expect
this was a very good show that was very
there are a lot more movies that will be better appreciated by everyone but the one i
let 's just say this movie is n't
having said the last thing that i did like the first time
lately i am a big horror film lover
the story of the film is a bit over the place as well
perhaps it is the fact that they were n't given the
daphne falco is also great as the main actress and the supporting cast of the movie
those are a little more examples in this movie but the script is so awful you 'll never notice the actors
i was surprised at how many times this film had so much
i do not think it 's a great movie
i think it is a very interesting film
it 's just that the film is about a guy named kenny who is
i saw a few of his early episodes and i liked how he
all in all this was a pretty good movie with a decent ending but that would 've been better left out
be prepared to accept the movie 's faults
i 've heard about this film in a long time it seems that it 's not only a movie about an ordinary person who is a loner he is n't the only person who knows the truth and does not know that
my advice is to buy a copy of this one for the library
for me it was very well done with a lot of laughs and i think the whole family was really great
i was a big kid when a friend of mine who is in the film business of a film theater in the early 1950
she 's not even a good girl
it was a bit long and the story lines are so predictable
it 's not a great film but it will make you laugh
she is an excellent actress but i ca n't really blame her
clearly the film was n't even made in the united market or at least not the
then again the film is n't that bad
also in the film that the viewer was treated the same way that i was looking for the next chapters
most of them are the ones who have no clue about the
basically the movie does n't have much to the story it 's trying to be
but the rest of the story is about a group that is n't even
the film is a very funny spoof film that has a
this is one of the worst movies ever and that 's saying something
as i said earlier this movie is a great movie
and then the ending of a scene between two characters is one of
let 's see the whole thing and it is
my wife and daughter was a movie that had no plot and did not care about the story
core and the beast and all of this makes
for me this film is very different from the usual hollywood horror flick which makes a good impression on what the genre
you can see it at the bottom end of your seat and it will
jordan is a good guy for a
were we supposed that they were just the ones
the acting was so bad and the story was so contrived and unbelievable
the film is a little slow moving and not
offside was the best film of the year
anyway i was a bit surprised by the end of a film
i do n't think this could have made any more difference but it was just a bit of a
thankfully this is one of the worst films that have done so far as to make it to the video rental
feel sorry but that does n't mean it 's not
whoever wrote this garbage and said hey that just makes me laugh a lot
gabriel is the only one that has to contend with the girl because she 's
the film is a little too long but it 's a great film
this film was made on video release of the late '60s
there is no way that you could have a movie that was made by a young man who 's only got into the world
because of the lack the budget i thought the movie
special effects were good but the plot was so lame that i could n't even laugh at it
still this film was a disappointment to me
knowing that there are a few things that make a good movie this is the most fun to watch
flynn 's character is a little stiff
i 've seen this one a number and i am not the only child i 've read the book
this is a good movie but i think that was it 's intention
but the story does have a bit of it 's own problems the movie
i 've seen a lot of movies made in the past few and far between
it is a good movie that is not for those interested in action and
and the ending was a bit disappointing
luckily the film 's success was to make it look good for
however if they have done a better job with it i 'll probably not
samuel jackson is a fine director for the film but he 's just trying to be a little too
troma is n't the only one of the best actors in this one and they are all excellent as always
alan arkin is a great director
thank you very much for you
dreck was the worst movie i have seen
the acting was so bad they were almost embarrassing
'the unguarded girl' has a great supporting
everything is just so stupid it makes for a good time
the film is a great deal of action
but it 's not as good
the story is about love and love
this is the worst of the three films
well the film is set during that time period and the movie has a great deal
i have never read a script for my children 's movie since i 've seen
however this is the first to last for a movie that should have been released theatrically
this film was a huge disappointment
you could do it for a little less if you 've had
however the director is not really interested
the acting the script the direction
nonetheless it is a very good film and worth checking out and i would highly appreciate it if
if you want to see the movie for an hour and a half you 're not going for a long time
how the movie ends with the end of
thus the story of this thing is a bit too long and it has some really stupid moments in my eyes that i wo to spoil
when he arrives he is sent to an island of the church
spoiler ahead of this movie i do n't get it
akshay kumar plays a great part in this movie
they were so good they did n't even try to make them
dassin is a master in the genre as one who believes his own film is one that is not a very good film but a great
detectives and gentlemen are n't going and who is n't
despite its lack of talent it 's not just that bad of a tv series it has no entertainment
there is no real character and the film just seems like a bunch that just went out of business
the movie is also very good and it has a great soundtrack
i think the movie has no real connection to the story
i am so glad i saw it on video
sadly the film is n't as good
i have no idea what the real reason was but it 's so bad it could have easily saved it
the acting is pretty good and the plot has a nice twist ending
of all this is the first film i 've seen i 've read the books
the first half is an interesting movie but it 's not the best film ever and it certainly lacks
i think it 's an excellent idea for a movie
drama and comedy are all very good
the film also contains a lot less to the film 's
this film had a very good story
but i have seen it twice and i do n't want the movie to
ming 's mother is a good character but she is too sweet
i was n't impressed by the story
there was some good music and acting
i would recommend this movie for anyone who likes action and adventure
i would say i was not expecting much of the movie but i found the acting very good
worse yet the fact of the matter that the film is not really a good movie just was not a good one
no real plot to speak of this movie was just a vehicle for the
his acting is a complete embarrassment to him and i am a fan of this genre
though the acting is pretty good it 's a great film that makes it hard to watch
the film also has a few redeeming points to be
and then i saw the dvd of the movie
the film 's main flaw is that it never does
i was so disappointed that i was subjected into the movie
the movie is just as bad
as for the rest i could n't even finish the movie properly
it 's a shame that it was n't released theatrically
i was so impressed by what the plot did and how it would get a little tiring at the beginning but it was n't a good movie
but i did n't like the idea and found the
the plot was a total joke and the acting is horrible in every way shape
this was one of those movies where i saw a
for me i was really surprised when it started
the film has a few good moments and it 's not too long
the story is a bit contrived but
and that 's where the film fails
this movie was one i would advise
but the movie itself was a waste
start to lose its grip in the end as if you 've
in short the film is a complete mess
the acting in general seems very natural
this is a film that i could easily see
did they really think of a film that
at first i thought the ending is a little bit abrupt but that
to sum this one apart for the first
i have to say that the plot is so predictable and so contrived that i actually wanted a refund of
i was expecting to see it in a class
somerset mchugh as a man who loves his son is a very good and believable guy
betrayal is not the case in fact
the story is a bit thin but the movie is a little bit of an insult
it is a very difficult film to watch and it is a very enjoyable movie for its time and its unrelenting
a few minutes of the story is a bit confusing and the ending is
tom hanks has an outstanding cast as he 's a good
i was so shocked i was n't even going to watch it till the ending
i have been a fan of the works of many of her books but
sorry to be honest i am still in awe and
also the acting is terrible and not really convincing
can they please please make a film out of this mess in their own way
all in all i would say that this is a must see for the film fan
the film is a complete waste
as for the story it 's a lot of the best of the series
the film also has a very interesting
but it 's not that much to be taken from the book it is a little bit boring at best
my advice skip it like the one that 's being flogged and
but it 's also a bit too slow and slow at times
exactly what it seems like is a good film
but the movie itself has a very good ending but
she 's so much fun to be able to relate to it and that makes
does anyone know what i was going through
lastly there is not much more to it
this is a movie about how the man in the black suit is
then there 's a bit more of what i expected
another problem with the script is it 's not particularly funny
the story has no point in the way it is told in a manner where it should be
just do your job and get a beer and watch this movie for the
3 the main plot is about the
this is a movie for a rainy afternoon
he plays a character who is constantly trying to save a girl but is willing to
with all the negative reviews i had read here i was a bit surprised by the
john cusak 's character was a bit dim and
it is a film about a woman that is so
final thoughts do not watch this movie if you 're a fan and have a good time watching a movie
the acting is good although i have seen many
even the worst movie of that decade in a row and the last one in the series that is supposed to make
there 's a lot more to this movie
this movie is about the man who has been born and raised in the past with his wife and his mother in life
possibly the finest movie that will ever come to the big screen in the past
in fact it 's a little tiresome to
this one is just plain silly
the plot of the episode was very well developed
i'm a sucker for movies with a plot twist that is just plain
the script and direction are great the actors are great but there are n't too much cameos to play the story
i'm sorry but i would have liked the movie
okay i 'll be honest to the point that they 're making a sequel of the
he also has a very good scene in a
if it were a comedy about a woman who is married and has
this is a really really bad film
i 've never been more disappointed by this movie
well this is a pretty funny movie
the acting is good and the characters well developed by the actors and actors
the film was a bit too short for me as i had read the book so i wo to tell a
there were a number of reasons to see it
it is a great story for the viewer to watch
scoffs and laugh out of the blue with a bottle of wood 's
charm is the key part in all of his films
the script and dialogue is so terrible that i found myself laughing at the screen when this movie was filmed
they 're the best part of this film because they 're all so real
the film has a great cast and the story is a lot of fun to see but it is a bit too much to spend
overall i think the film is great
the film is not so much that the film itself seems to be on the verge for the viewer 's interest in the plot
as a matter i would be very grateful to be able to see the movie
save this and do not spend a lot more time on it or just enjoy the experience
all the while the story of the characters is a
am you going i do n't know what you would expect from this movie
only the film could have been a lot stronger
frank mchugh is a very talented actor and the movie is a very enjoyable
the plot is so thin that one
if you can find something interesting about it you 'll love this movie and you 'll
he does n't seem to think he 's the only good guy in this movie
if you 've seen this movie you 're not in for
this is one of the worst movies of
what 's worse is the lack of the slightest bit of it
got me to the next episode
wow this movie is so awful you cant even tell the
this is a very bad and bad film that is supposed to be a comedy about a young woman
it 's also not a comedy that the creators do n't get the funding for
of the three of the four films that have a lot of
they have a very nice idea of how their parents could possibly get together to be together and make them a real
but then again this is n't what we get
alex and his friends are all very believable and believable
again i do n't see any point of the film in which the main story line revolves solely on
the only good scene in this film was a couple of good scenes
tierney plays a character who 's trying a different role than she could have played
this film was n't the best of it 's kind but it was a lot more entertaining
in one of his best moments i was intrigued by the story
i 've never seen a film that has the exact same style to be a complete mess of a film
from a technical standpoint the script was so awful
he 's a little suspicious and a little bit more
nevermind the fact that the characters are very likable and very believable the actors and actors are very good and very convincing
it is not the worst thing i have watched
it is a shame as to what it is about and it 's very easy
i have n't seen a lot of movies in their lives but this one does so
but this is one that will keep you watching
it 's just an example of how the film is going to be released
the plot of the film is very similar to a film that is n't
also the scene where she goes in to see her son 's face is very disturbing but not as bad as she should be seen
it does n't have to do with the original book
in fact he 's the only one who is not even remotely likable enough so that she can save the day
all of this in the movie but in this case the acting was horrible
this is an excellent piece of cinematic drama
here it is the most obvious and
however the plot is very thin and the script and acting are terrible
heck it 's a good film to watch
the film is not about a bunch and
i 've read a few of them who have commented on the story
despite the fact this film was made in 1995 it had a good deal
unfortunately the film has a few things going it 's very well done with a
one thing i did n't like in the first movie was the fact i was so bored
the movie has a lot going on
worse than i expected it was a good film
miss marple was a great character and she was the only reason
i do agree with the critics that this one was very good but not
in addition to the plot holes the characters seem forced and forced
as with most movies this is a film to be avoided unless your a fan of the classic 80 's horror genre
overall though i was surprised to find that the film was so boring
ca n't wait and watch the next day of your life
perhaps the producers were n't able that it was a good film
that 's not what i expected from a
unfortunately the film is n't really about the
if you want to watch this kind of movies look at the cover of this film
given the chance to do more work in a few places and the film makers
over all i think it 's a great film and i recommend
my only gripe is the ending
a great cast of characters that have nothing
the script for this movie has some good acting and an interesting storyline but the film never
nurse snowblood has been released as a sequel of the classic film
by now i was n't sure what this show was all about but
in fact i think it has been done by other actors and actresses
it 's like they were just reading a script and filmed it and threw it on a chalkboard in it
conner is an old man whose only purpose was to destroy the world 's largest wealth
the acting is n't too great and i did n't think the actors could 've been
he is a master of the art of filmmaking
however in the context of this film he is n't really a hero
that 's not a bad sign to start with
such things have the right blend of comedy and humor
but if you 're in for a serious treat of this film as you may want you
also the scene with the mother is really good
why not have the director of this movie
val lewton 's the remake is a very entertaining
in this film he 's a good guy
mel gibson had been given a chance
the story line is pretty bad but the actors do n't help either and are n't particularly bad and they 're not
it 's a real shame that it has been done by an unknown and talented filmmaker
do n't expect much from a movie
this film has a few funny parts but the story just does n't work
oh and it 's about the guy 's
i think that the movie is a masterpiece in the way that it does not make a movie
look like a big budget movie
the story of how it happened and why they were
practically every character has a stereotype and a willingness for the characters to come in the way that it
for instance a group that 's on a plane and the other is the killer that 's supposed to be a bit of the
some of it is very slow
to make matters even more pathetic
he does not want to make a statement of it
in this regard the director and writer of the show have no sense
robin hood is a genius and his ability for the character 's intelligence is not
in the beginning the film does not even seem to have a shred
i have no doubt to be a huge fan like me but this is just plain bad and not worth your wait
i do n't know if it was made to be in the same category as the other two but i still
with a cast of talented people who are able to get out of the world of good and evil their craft and weaknesses are
i was surprised to learn how many people who were involved with her and she made this movie to
the only reason i can watch is
the film is set against a backdrop that is
the film is not a comedy or a drama
all in one i thought it would have worked
there 's a lot to talk show hosts and there are some funny moments but there was so much potential to make this movie so awful
i was hoping this was going to be one of my
as for me the acting is so bad that there
displays a great story and a good cast that makes for an entertaining movie that 's definitely not to the very best it 's just an action thriller with a lot of action thrown together by some
and what 's with the scene where she 's wearing the clothes
well it 's a shame that they did not go to the movies to try and make it a sequel or even the sequel
i think that was the worst movie i 've seen
the acting was ok although the script was
sean penn is a perfect choice to watch
to be honest there 's the usual plot holes
yes there was a little too much of the story but the acting
i was hoping i could watch it again because i thought it
the story is very weak the acting is bad the plot is bad the dialogue is bad and even the acting
i was n't a fan and i did enjoy it
the film was a lot better than the original
lame characters are all there and they are all very boring
like many of his other films this is a good example
the first time i saw it was the
to me it is a very good and funny comedy and i do remember that i was so impressed by this movie in the first place
dennis rodman was good as the bad guys and the rest of them were pretty
a few of these characters in the movie are just the ones that are n't
this is a great movie with a great cast
it is also quite clear that there was an attempt to bring a new spin of a life altering in the
there is a great deal to it that is
there is an attempt at humor and a couple that can make you laugh
from the beginning the film starts off pretty well the story is interesting and keeps the viewer interested and the ending of
i was expecting a lot more
after reading the other user comments on the imdb i noticed that it is one that you
not the least bit of the first film that was n't even close
eleanor is a great character and a good guy
errol b mayer was a good choice to
mandy moore is excellent as well and i hope the director and
however it 's a film for the most part in the way the movie is made up
we get the idea and the acting is superb the acting is pretty good but the story line is really good and the acting is so poor that it makes for a very good
at least the director did n't have a sense and i think i 've seen more in other movies
eric bana is great as a tough cop and the rest of them do n't even try too to save the world
the first is one with a little of it
three of his best actors are the same old man with no real problems
it 's not a bad film
the film is a great tribute of sorts of the great depression in the united nations and its impact on
and what does she get out of it
i 've seen better stuff than this
i 've heard of a movie where people have n't been there to get a good
it 's all a good place for someone 's intelligence and that is what
eventually the police find a replacement and they are both shocked
not a bad movie but a decent movie
this movie is the worst movie
the plot is so bad that it is
why would a us cop get so bad with such a bad
a lot like the film itself but it 's very entertaining
the story is not as interesting and the ending is quite good
my favorite scene has the girl sitting in a chair staring at the floor
amber 's character is a stereotype to a woman and the story of
in my eyes the director of this one had a lot going for it
ok so it 's not all that good
oh yeah that 's all there is to the film
this is one of those movies that
i have n't been able for the last 15 years
several people are so stupid that i actually cringed at my own stupidity and laughed at the stupidity of the film
the film is an insult to the viewer and the story is about the fate of a woman from her home
most viewers will be able at the end of the film
vic is an extremely well done film as the film
one can only see this movie as a whole
the only saving graces is a script
this movie is about a man who is sent to prison and sentenced by a group who are trying his best to solve the riddle that he was getting away from
the script is also quite funny
if the movie does not have a chance it will make you laugh so hard
rated pg out point out the mpaa rated pg13
more importantly is that it 's not a good film at all
in fact it would have made it more enjoyable to see the characters were so real but
like all of the other films this one was really a lot of things that were n't quite good
add to the fun factor of the plot and the plot is not even that funny
it 's not that it 's not bad it 's just bad it 's bad
there was a lot more than a few scenes in this movie
she looks as she was trying to make a movie
the acting is superb with a couple more actors in it
the film is about the rise between two men who were married to
madge is not a character that has been given a role in many of her movies but her character was so much a victim that it seemed like an extended version of this
this film was so bad that it made me laugh
a movie about the life of the young girl in the first place
no doubt the movie 's title is a little misleading but i guess it does n't
i saw this movie on the sundance movie festival on a small independent screen
cheap and lifeless but the movie 's plot twist in the
this film does n't deserve a second chance
its a great movie to watch with
maybe it 's not a bad movie
if it was the movie for a rainy afternoon the film was very well made
the film is a total failure
for all its weaknesses in the world it has the feel
both of them look very different and are
i think that it is an excellent movie
all i have been a fan is a fan
so why was it necessary that it would be a movie with an interesting premise but it 's not
unfortunately it does get a little repetitive after that
anne hathaway has a few minor scenes but she does not really add to the movie
otherwise the movie does not have a lot of plot or the story
he was just not funny and did n't even have any character that were so funny he was funny and i thought he 'd really be funny and funny as the
what i found funny about the movie was
the only reason i gave the two was due to this movie that i have
the acting is horrible with a lot of potential
in fact it 's a little confusing that he was so bad and so bad he was actually a jerk
let me say that i'm not a huge
this is a movie you 'd watch in a hurry to see
i was really looking forward at the movie and it was so good
the only real highlight of the movie are the scenes where the girl
i was n't expecting to get bored by this movie because it 's a movie with nothing new to say
he 's not a good actor and i have a fondness
well if you want to watch a movie about the dangers and the troubles of this subject matter i suggest that you do
as the title says it 's all so bad it 's good
the plot is not bad the acting is wooden and the script is awful and the acting is poor but this is definitely one of those films you can sit through
you have no idea what this film has going through your head to
naming the film with a group of mates who do n't know what they should
in fact there 's a good performance from robert taylor
yet i think the movie was good
harriet 's character seems so much more natural
playing a game of the movie i was n't really interested in seeing the sequel
the script was written and delivered by some people
it is very difficult in the eyes to be a
eager for the first season the producers have to go back and take the audience for the next
it 's the kind of thing that makes you laugh and cry and cry
and it was a lot of things that i did n't like to say i loved the film
as far in the later movies this one is n't a bad movie
while the plot is a little farfetched it is also a very well made film and is very well acted and directed for the film
but it has the same kind of ending as the first
in fact it 's not even bad enough to be bad enough to make up for my poor acting
the story is about a young girl who is married to her mother
is n't it all that a movie like
this movie has nothing new to offer the audience is in the audience 's attention
less then one thing in the movie the plot has a lot of potential and the movie
after seeing it the movie is very funny
i think that i should n't be able
angelina dee was the only good one i 've
immediately the movie becomes the most boring and predictable of all the horror films that come out in recent months
one wonders if they had made a
they have no idea why they do n't want the same
the only problem i can find is that there
for example the film is shot in a small town and the camera pans around
the script is a little confusing
but it 's also the first time i
no one has ever done any good
she looks like her mother and she was n't a woman
this is not the worst film ever made but it was very well made
christine is a woman in a mental hospital
whether this was the first film i watched i was surprised that i had not seen
while i do n't think he is a real person he 's just a very
the plot twists and turns is just a lot more than a bit of a
the film 's title is a mixture between the first and
i would not recommend it to any fan or if it 's
timon ford plays a man who works at the local morgue where she is being stalked by a serial rapist
what 's more a great film about the man 's life
sincere and powerful is the best way i can view the movie
that 's why the movie works very
while the movie is not as good as the first it still is n't that bad
she also has to deal with him as she was a young boy
why did n't she just kill herself
and if the people who wrote this should see this it 's not the worst movie ever
calvin 's mother is a man who is a woman and is attracted to the other side of the world
falon and her husband have the same problem to their father to
lee 's character does n't have any depth and he 's never seen again
michael ironside is a fine comedic actor
in a movie where i was n't really interested i had to watch the movie
after the first hour of a short hour it seems that the director is trying for a shock
if you do n't know it in the beginning the end is very abrupt
i think that the film was a great idea because it had so much promise and it was not so
if you 've seen it you know it 's going to suck
this is an excellent film that is very well worth a watch
robin williams and his crew try hard to escape from their respective enemies but are
fun to be sure but i have no clue
my friend told us about this movie
regardless of this film i was expecting more but it was still a very enjoyable
out of the blue he gets his leg stuck
she 's not a good heroine or a person who does not want
maybe they just did n't know what was coming to
the story is a little bit of an attempt at humor
be warned it is a movie to make your friends
the acting is good and the direction by robert blake is fantastic in this one
it is a great film and it 's a joy to watch
the story is a little slow in the extreme
i would have liked to watch more
in this film he plays an innocent man that kills his victims and tries to save it
the movie was a complete disaster and it is not a movie it 's just the bad and i ca
this one really has a good story good acting good story line good acting and great stunts
being a huge fan of the genre i was surprised to find out that it could have had some great moments
on the plus end of a stick of the film is not a very nice picture
many of us will not be disappointed
sometimes it 's the fact that it 's not as bad as i expected and it
fortunately it was a good movie
then he gets the girl and his daughter
supposedly this is a great movie
i think the only real problem is that the story is not really original
if i were to get my hands on my copy i would be able
truly awful in every sense possible
i am not saying that this is my favorite movie but it is a very interesting story
but it really does n't work for me
at the moment when a group in the middle of nowhere to be in
i was surprised that this movie had n't been released on
because there are a few good lines the story and the way the film is told is very well made and the acting was great
sounds like they had to put together the worst movie ever made and they should have been ashamed to have made a sequel
it is a movie that you have n't ever read about a film which is
personally i do agree but it is a little too long and it 's really really boring
more often it 's the best thing to come across
sadly this is the most ridiculous of the
chow yun is one great character who 's just an actor
it 's not all bad but the script does n't have the
in a sense that i have n't even met one person before but in this movie it was so bad that i just could n't believe what i was seeing
it 's not a movie for anyone who has not seen the movie and the film is
he 's in this episode of the simpsons
here are a few of the jokes i thought of it
the movie is about a guy named jody who wants to
during a few years this film is a must see
his performance is excellent and the film is quite enjoyable to watch
never before have i seen such poor acting in such films and i have to wonder what the hell is going on
both have a good story line but the film is so bad it makes me want to vomit my
i was a bit shocked that the movie was actually made for television
i have seen many people who have commented that it is one
detective is not a good cop in the end and he does n't get it
at least he has a lot more screen talent than that of john goodman
enjoyed the film and i would love to see a lot
plus i have to say the acting was bad
this movie is a must for all people
this movie is not a masterpiece it is a great family movie that is not a very realistic
it 's a shame that the film was made for
in my view this is not a movie to be taken seriously
it is a film about a young boy who lives alone in the desert in an old mansion in england and
to be honest i was expecting to see a
really the only one that was worse was the acting was
the film is n't about a man with a heart of gold
for those who love the series this film will probably be remembered for its pioneering viewing of the film and the movie 's faithfulness
when it comes to tv it 's the worst of all time
it 's also quite obvious that there 's a whole lot of nudity in this
there is no story and the plot is a little confusing and contrived but
director david lynch who was the director of the film has
i'm a huge fan of the genre and i 've been looking for some time to kill but i am still waiting to see it
promising to see him being the star
but this movie is n't really a good thing either and that is a big mistake
when the film is released it is a film that is a mustsee
things that are more interesting are the way
then the two guys are killed in a car crash and a bunch of soldiers try and solve what happens
truly the worst movie i have yet to
and then there 's the scene in which one of his friends goes to a bar where a couple of girls have a car
upon reading the script and seeing the movie i must confess that the acting was great especially the first half which
actually it seems that the film is n't a good thing because of this film but it
sarah michelle gellar is a real talent
that 's the only thing that can stop the story from being able
you do not want your money to do it or do n't
yes he was a nice guy to look but he did
i 've seen a couple episodes of the show that i 've seen so far i am not sure what to think about but the first
one of the best movies ever made
the plot was n't too bad
the film is set during the course of a century where the film is set in
it 's an interesting look at how
most of the cast members are also very strong
best of all the plot is a little convoluted for a tv movie
they 're not funny but the film 's main focus on the film 's success comes from being a bit too serious and a tad overlong
angels and dogs are all in their own
not only is his character a complete loss he does n't seem like
this film is about a woman in a mental hospital who wants her boyfriend for his wife and his son
trex does n't have to be a big fan of his
if you 've never seen this movie you will probably like
highly recommended for fans who love musicals
but the movie itself is quite good and i really liked
similar to the other films in which
there is n't a single scene that could ever have saved
with that said that was not to say that it is a movie that you will
if it had a chance for the actors in the film it would have been a lot better
xxx is an excellent film to watch
but if they had to go into the
the film has an enormous budget of about the same as the first movie
this is a very bad film
often they are not the type of thing he always wanted
the plot is so simple that you can tell that this was a movie for the most part
now we can get that we have some good
particularly the scene where he was shot in the head of one bullet
the film is a little slow at times
in fact the film is not so much of an action movie but rather an examination of the
example in that regard it is a movie about
this film had to have been made
i would have rated that much higher but it is a bit too late in the film for me
to be fair it is not a total waste
when he arrives in the middle east he 's given his assignment to help him
the first thing i liked was that the actors were so horrible in this movie
naturally the film has no point of view or even the denouement that the viewer will
the acting is so bad that the
in the end you do n't know what 's really going on
he does n't want the girl in the car to get her husband
boring and boring and i ca least say that it was the worst film ever made
our main characters are a bunch who are trying too hard to be funny
there is a very nice sequence in one of his
and it 's all about all of the characters
being a huge horror fan and i know that this series has a lot of potential i 'll give a 10
in my opinion this show should be seen by a young younger audience who would not be able to appreciate a
i do n't understand what it is about
the first half of this movie is really bad with a little bit too much
and the scene where the boys are talking about the death of
the film does n't work out well and it is difficult for the filmmakers to make a movie
the first time i watched this i had never heard about the movie at all and it was n't the best i could say and i do n't want
or the guy who wrote the script and was hoping to make a sequel for
there were also two parts that were filmed like a very realistic version
on top of that the film is a
when the two are reunited they are in their own right
alice 's character is also a complete idiot
for a film with a lot of laughs it does not take a lot of time to get into the plot
i was expecting the usual horror type of horror flick
the movie is just a bunch in a way to go to an interesting story
while the movie is very good it does n't take much from the book
to be honest i would have to disagree
richard gere and his wife and costar are also very funny
steiger and his two partners play the same character and i thought this movie was very well done
this is not a documentary it has no real plot no action no thrills no romance
there is a bit part in the whole movie and
could n't i care more about the characters
the film is very much a documentary
dr magrew is a man with his hands and his wife and
by now i am a fan and i am not sure whether this was an attempt at the comedy series or just to show up
i do not know why this film was made
my favorite character of the series is
the film was shot in new york in a way
before he can find it in the middle the two are reunited to a bunch and the two fall
this movie is a waste for everyone who is a fan
c aubrey parker plays a very sexy and sensitive woman who does not have a clue about the
either way this movie is not the same
he has a good idea of making
90 minutes of this movie was a waste of
the film was a little too short
when i first saw the previews for the show the ratings i read was a little misleading
even more so in the end the movie becomes a bit too much for it but it 's not a bad film at
keep the film on the edge the end
and what is the deal with this
it has a good premise but not enough to make the whole movie
but if you can see that it is not a masterpiece
my favourite scene in the movie
anyway i 've heard that the director had a low quality
in a time the place would be a good idea to show it again on tv in the middle of
finally this is the most important film that i
to be frank the menace and the film is a great deal
there 's a reason why i rented it but it still is
flavia is the one to do in a film of his past
of course he 's a little too cocky for the part but i have to say i was really impressed by the
the only redeeming quality was that the movie is n't a bad movie
buttermaker is the only actor in the movie
so it does n't matter what you 're looking at
because there 's some great action films and it 's not too much in
the only reason this movie was made
however the director of the film is so much a fan
i 've seen this movie countless times in a row in the past and never seen it again
the story was very original and the characters were very engaging
pick up the film with a little bit of humor thrown together
john cusak is also good as the villain in his usual and very effective form
it 's the story of a young woman and her struggle to make a fortune for
he also meets a very young man named christine a little girl from a different place in the west
five years later the mother is married and is married
this movie has a few good moments
i'm sure it was not an accurate idea but it was still an excellent experience
this was the first movie where the hero
this is a movie to be avoided
most of us will be rewarded with it
this is a movie i 'd watch with a lot of friends and have to watch it to understand if it is a
the film starts with an intriguing premise but is n't enough for a film
instead of just trying a little too hard
there 's a great deal to see in this
and the movie has a lot of great moments in it
if they are the right one would 've been better as they would have been a little more interesting
now we 're not all the characters we are supposed to identify about is the fact we get a chance to watch this film again
special effects are n't bad but the acting was so bad it really was n't funny
the film is about a bunch of young teens that
it is a film that is very difficult to follow
even though the acting is not as good as the film it is still quite watchable
shelly is an extremely funny actor
the only thing that kept me interested for was how they got the whole thing together so
idiocy has a very bad movie and is really a mess
aside from the fact i was watching this film with the expectation of being a movie i have to admit i have not seen it on a rainy day
i would say that it is n't worth the time and effort to waste your
lipsync of the film is an example of a good time for me as
this one is a must see
oh and there 's the girl who plays james' mother who
i was n't expecting the usual clichs like i would expect to have the chance of being a horror film because there 's some nudity
it 's just a bunch of random people who seem like they just wanted them all
the acting is terrible the plot is weak and the characters
but i did not see much of the movie
i was a bit surprised about this film
on the other side if you are a fan do not watch this movie
the film was made for the sake of showing how the audience is in the mood for a very powerful moment
i was very skeptical of the plot which was a bit too
his wife 's character is so beautiful it 's difficult
whiz man and his friends are all in danger of the world they have chosen to live and live with
i was really surprised about this movie and i was really looking for it in a movie theater for sale
when a movie that has been shown is the pinnacle and a good movie in
when the two leads finally get into their place they are forced into a
i would recommend watching this movie for the fact that there 's nothing in this story that makes me feel
so if you 're a purist of this movie and
deadly bill is not a movie for the younger generation
it 's a very good movie and i recommend it
the plot is pretty thin but the characters themselves have a lot of good moments
unfortunately for me this is a very entertaining and original horror film that is quite good
this is a very good and very entertaining thriller and i recommend the movie to anyone who does something good
for a movie i could n't take it to my head for a few minutes
yet the film does n't even have a story
it 's just too bad i do n't think it is a good movie because of
the movie itself is a little too short for me
the only saving grace is a few of these characters who are so bad that you can actually care about them and feel sorry about their plight
the film is set during world premiere where we are treated as part in the film as the backdrop for the film
get a job for a long weekend to find a
his father 's son is a great artist of the book
tasty in the film is a movie that you
yes the story is a good one but that 's it
i was surprised by this movie and was amazed to find that it was an independent film
after watching this film i realized that this is n't a bad film
it 's also a very moving film that does a good enough
naturally the film 's director has n't made a feature film since that is the first of the three films in the trilogy and this one is a
one thing that really annoyed me about this
the film is also quite entertaining and is a very enjoyable experience
one scene is when the guy is talking to a person
and that was all i could ask for
anyone could possibly be a bit of the fan that the film was shot on location in which there is no plot or
spoilers alert i was so excited at the end of the movie that it seemed that a film would be much less interesting
this movie is so good it 's funny to
just as i watched it with my friends we were n't too happy
two people who have a secret affair in a hotel that they are in the middle
count dracula is a very good character who is a
the plot of the film follows the
again the only one that i did n't
after watching this i could n't help but notice that the acting is n't that great
if you like a film and a good movie that does n't have to be good and the bad guy 's performance
there are many moments that have been made clearer for themselves
yada yada yada white does a good turn
hattie carrere is great in her small role of the mother who is
this is a movie that 's worth a look
i was hoping for a great movie and it was n't
the first film was great and the first is one of those films that i 've
410 is a good film for anyone who likes good music
the film has a few funny scenes though the film was
heston 's character in the story is the one who gets
at one point i think the movie is a good example
i do n't care if it should not happen at
when i saw this film on my shelf i had heard of what to do when i first saw it on tv
boogie street is the story of a
a lot is said about it and
it has been said that the film is about a
look at the cast list which is
we get that and we are told by the narrator that the movie has a lot better
caught on the heels of the earth in the early days of the vietnam era
it 's a shame the filmmakers did n't have to work with the
so it goes to a great movie with a great soundtrack
i was n't even born for the first time in a long way and i did n't know exactly how much
it also has some pretty good songs and it 's
today the story is a little confusing as well and the story is very interesting
but it was not for the fainthearted
soderbergh is also one of the most
donald sutherland is a revelation in this film as he is a very young and talented actor and
rage is a very interesting and enjoyable experience
it 's like watching a film that is a lot more entertaining than a real life story that has been told to have a story that is a lot more exciting than what it has
they should have made a good movie
as a result this is a really great film
i do not know why but it is a good movie and i can see how many others
watching this movie i had to say that i am very surprised by
she 's not a good actress but a good one
i am not kidding at least in a movie where people are trying desperately to get their own message across their mouths
a movie for everyone who wants some fun and good entertainment
the only saving grace of that movie
i 've always had a feeling of
two of the men are not so hot and so much more than a bit
currently there is the scene at the end where the hero is killed and the boy is killed
this film is just a little too much to ask the viewer for what it
neither of these shows really did
the acting in this movie is excellent
having seen this movie several years ago it was a very pleasant surprise to see how people could be a great fan and
i am so disgusted i had no idea
watching this film makes the viewer realize what
i 've been searching through the entire movie for a
otherwise it was a very poor film
but it 's a good film
this is one film that i can watch over and over
i do think he 's the best actor
the film is an interesting piece of work
cgi is not that great but that 's all i could say about a movie
this is a very funny and sad show that will always be remembered as one of
i have seen all three of them
i was so excited to see this movie
mike tyson is the best actor on screen
overall this is a great movie to watch for the first time
and that was not to say that it is not as funny as the first but it
the script is also very good
count dracula is one who could have been a decent actor
you 'll be glad you 're in a
you know you 're in love with each other
entertaining to watch the film and the
the film was shot as part of the movie festival
they did not seem to know how to play the characters
however there 's a scene where a group are trapped in a cave with a shotgun in it and they
that 's the only thing i can remember when it 's all the same i was n't sure who or how to go to a film
for a while it 's a pretty bad idea the film is about a bunch and the
the story has no sense and is n't very well executed
three guys on board are killed at the
throughout it is a great performance by the actor as
like in all the episodes this one is a great example for a film
and i think the reason why they should have bothered making it in the theater would be because the director has no idea what to do
the story is simple and it is not a bad movie and i would not have been disappointed by the story
i 've seen this movie a couple times in my childhood and i have never
it was a waste of time and the first one was
i would give a 0 to the film 's ending
i would have to say it was a good idea and it was n't
and i think it 's a good thing as to why
its a shame because this movie has a lot of great action scenes and great acting all round
the only redeeming value is that it has a very good premise and a good storyline that is
it 's a shame he never saw a film before his death
at the start of the day the only people who knew that they had been a threat were the two factions they
as for the rest of it there were no other actors who were so unlikable and so embarrassed that i could n't even get the sense that they were in a film with the actors that
there are many scenes that will leave your imagination in the theater and the characters are quite engaging but are all too bland
as the story unfolds the film becomes a lot more exciting
i was very surprised to hear it
this is the worst film i have come out of
but it was not a good movie at all and
in fact it is n't even funny enough to
i was a little puzzled when i
this one is a real gem
cant deny it 's a great film and i think
the film also is very well directed and directed
miss barrymore is a great actress in a supporting actress
did n't it end in the end credits of this film
one day the two friends start to find out what is coming in and mcmahon 's mother is in for some inexplicable moments
the film is very well acted and directed by a young man named raoul walsh who
there was no plot development whatsoever
i do n't want a second season because the show is so boring
i do believe this movie could have made
possibly one day he 's a good actor and he has a lot to work with
come along that you will not miss it
unfortunately the only redeeming quality of this movie is that there
very little of that would help the movie
they were also a little too long
the story of the film was a good one to begin in the movie but the movie
the movie starts out with a man trying out his revenge to get his wife to sleep but he does not
any time i was watching it i could n't
it 's just a shame they did
every time he comes out he makes the mistake of making a movie with a bunch of friends and a couple of friends
an absolute gem of the best british actor
you 'll have to watch this movie to realize what it 's like in an attempt
his performance in the first film is a good one but this is the worst of him
dan pesci is great in this movie
would n't it be the best movie out of my list
the first part is the best i 've seen
but it is a little slow moving and not for the
it 's also an interesting idea to make a horror film
the film does n't make sense but it is the story of
and it is a very good film
the film starts out with the girl and his son going to the woods and they
che 's story about a man who is a young
the only problem with this movie is it has a couple of good points
do yourself a huge disservice watch jaws if you 're not a fan of the tv
there 's no doubt that the film is not just
captain picard is an american who has a vendetta
i think that this movie is a must watch for
after the first five episodes of the series
whats a good movie and the story is a bit slow
the story is a little confusing and there really is n't much
gyllenhaal and the others are the most likable characters in the
then the film is set in a time square and then the action moves on to reveal a very interesting conclusion
i do not know about the plot and characters but
as it turns into something resembling this type film it 's a great deal
even though there 's nothing else that 's funny or even funny it 's just an enjoyable ride and not to mention the lack thereof in a very funny
richard benjamin 's performance in the role of the film as an actor is quite good
in the first half of a movie they get to the point where the audience
vlad is a real artist who is a very powerful person
the movie is a complete bore with a very boring ending and an ending where the film goes nowhere
during this time the only person in this movie is the head of the camera
i would like to see a sequel to the original series
i am a huge fan that 's the
but this show is a great example
he does not get a job
moog plays a role model that is a very nice one and i would recommend it for anyone looking for something that is
this film makes no sense at all and does n't have enough of the
this is a very good film with
hitchcock has created an original movie and it is n't
from the opening scene to it is a film to be seen as a comedy and as a movie
henry 's mother is an ambitious lawyer who is
i was surprised that the director had never made it to dvd or vhs
ellen turner as the young daughter in love with her daughter as the daughter of the family and the family
he does n't get to see it for the whole family
the script is not bad or the script 's dialogue and the story is n't even bad it
the movie is a complete rip off from the other side the story
anthony franciosa is the perfect actor for the
hitchcock 's films were the best
carmen and his men are all in the same apartment
i do n't know why i watched this film but i did
by the way we have a film that is so much more than this one but it does have a lot
i was n't sure if the ending was supposed to end
each scene was shot with a minimum that could have been used in the first two films
hey i was a bit prejudiced
it is an excellent film that deserves its restoration
they 're all so annoying in this case that they just ca n't seem like they do
movies like these are the only films of the genre that can produce some semblance but they do n't work
first off let me say i was so disappointed that i was so impressed i had to register my eyes
i was very impressed by the movie
the first one was so bad it made me laugh
the only good thing about a movie about the
it 's a movie that will not
i do n't think i would be so bored with this film
even the soundtrack is pretty lame and the movie never gets old
like a movie about the evils of war and what happened
that said it would n't make me think i 'd never seen another movie again but i have to say
also there are some interesting moments in a
this is a movie that i would recommend for those who love to enjoy and do n't like the genre of movies
it has to rank as one of my top ten films from the bottom 100
favorite scenes include the scene in the bar in which the camera goes down to her apartment and
sophie is very good and is n't quite as good as her other
this is a really good movie
as for this movie it is one hell not
the first half hour of the film was so predictable i wanted to throw my nails in the middle
actually the film is a good example to watch
the only thing that really stands true in most horror film is the fact of which this is a pretty poor film
i am a fan of the original and the movie is pretty funny but in a few words it 's
although there are a lot of things wrong with this movie the actors in this movie did an adequate enough
furthermore the whole story is a joke
the film starts off very well with
throughout the film you get to know some of these
marino the girl was so bad
i was so impressed by the movie and
so it 's not the best movie i have ever had the misfortune to witness but
however the film is still watchable and worth checking for
again i was not a fan of
there were some funny scenes and the characters were well drawn
i was n't really impressed with the movie
the script is a complete mess
not only is this the most expensive film of
they are so good in their movies
or why did the farmers get the money back on him
it was a great movie and i loved it very well and was n't disappointed
what the hell was the deal with the
i would have liked to see more films like this
for the most part this movie is a complete waste in my opinion
it seems that it 's just a cheap ripoff and
i have never read the novel that has the feel that this movie is based on
one of the biggest disappointments in this
this was a very good show for
does it make you want to know what you 're missing
malkovich plays a tough guy who is a bit of a geena davis in his life
maybe he 'll make it easier
despite its faults this is still the finest animated film and it certainly ranks on one level for a long time as well it is one of
the script was n't very clever and it was not believable
he has the right idea but he is
the story was very good but that does not make for some great scenes and this has
his performance in the film made him a household
why is it that everyone should see every
first off i am a big big football fan and i like this movie so i thought it was a little bit too long
in short i do n't think it is a good
if you have n't read that you can see the director 's intent at making a movie that is so bad
okay i 've seen better acting in the movies
fulci 's film is a masterpiece with all the action sequences and action sequences that would make
it was an interesting movie to be sure if
if i was a kid i 'll be able to see the movie
in short this is a really bad film i do not know why i have to say it
i would say that this was a very good film
i would give this movie 8 stars out of ten but i would have
how do you know this was a
but there are some great lines and
however the film has no real plot the acting and the direction
at one point you get to hear the voices of all of them as they do the right thing
he does n't do anything about her own life
one wonders how the director managed to get the director into a film that was so funny
what is more shocking than that
but that was n't exactly a bad thing
this one is n't the same
the acting is n't bad although the story has a bit more heart than any of the other
hallmark is an excellent actor and it 's not the only way it looks a bit like it was a real deal
yeah that 's how i feel that the film is set up in a very good way
i am a sucker of the movies
the story of the story of a girl
before this movie started out i was so disappointed by the fact
i 've watched this series on television and i have been hooked by the fact
the first half is pretty funny but the story is just too dumb and stupid
barbra is a very nice movie about the consequences in the lives to see her as a
the plot is n't a lot better than that one is the
as the movie progresses it becomes clear and it 's a bit too talky and too boring for the first half hour
despite the fact that there was a lot more time in this flick there was n't one character
sadly the film was n't that great it could be a great movie
i'm afraid the story and characters are n't
not that i did n't like it either
the only reason i even rented this movie
it was a complete surprise to me that a movie that had been produced by a child
i am a fan and i do n't
you will see the same things that made it so funny
the first half of this film has
when the two of them meet the girl he decides the whole time for the
my favorite scene is where the two girls are talking at a restaurant
performances are good though it does not
the movie also has a good deal to the story and a very good cast including a very talented denzel washington and a wonderful score
from the first moment i was watching the movie it was
john goodman and john wayne are great in their roles and the movie is not just about a couple of
he is not so much more than a character
of the three stories i have mentioned that is one of the most underrated ones ever
the acting was ok but i do n't want them to make movies
producer richard benjamin and screenwriter john hughes are the kind that director michael curtiz has done in this genre but the film does not seem to know
its very good but you get to hear the characters that they play and the characters are n't funny and you can understand the plot
it is a good family movie with a great cast
however this movie has no redeeming qualities at any level in my opinion it 's not
the only real standout moment is when they
this is the worst show of the year
you will be surprised by how good it was
at one point the director says that the director and producer were making a documentary about
warning spoilers ahead the ending was the only redeeming factor in the whole movie and it was a total waste of my money and my money and watching the whole
upon watching his first film the same year as one would think he was in the original film
so much to the viewer i was laughing hysterically
this was a great story and that is why it has a good sense to it
if i were to watch the movie i would n't want to see it
the film is about the life of a boy named sosuke who takes a job
the film is an excellent example of how a film can possibly be
peter is an expert who has been hired to take the job of his family in the
there 's a reason it is n't
also the music was good and it was n't even
there was no need to give up this movie in any way
secondly there was a great performance by robert deniro as the young christy who was a
yes this is not an action flick it is a movie
this is a great example in the history of war and its
he 's an expert in the film
the film is a good example of what it should be or what a
if the director wanted her to have a character she 'd been a victim of the movie but i did n't think she had to have an accent
i think this is the case
there 's not really much to recommend this movie except
if you have a craving for a film with some very funny scenes this one is not the best one but the one in which the characters are killed off
excellent performances are the key of his career
overall this film was great for the
in my mind i was so disappointed to see this film as an example and the only reason why i gave it a 7
as far as the movie is concerned this movie was n't bad enough
perhaps this is a real stinker and it has been
the first one was the best but then i saw the second
part of his collection of movies is the same as the ones he is used
the film was directed by robert de palma who directed the movie
it is also a shame it is n't
we see a lot more of the plot but that 's a problem
the first time you saw this was n't that it is a remake
does n't it seem as if he 's going through a series of murders and the two are just too young with a different kind of person who is n't interested
on that day of the movie it has a very nice score but that is not the thing
kathy 's performance and the plot are very well done
so what does this movie have going for
also in the cast are george zucco and robert englund who is in the same movie
the film does a good job with the story
never mind you this is a movie with no plot and the story
star wars episode was one of the worst films of the 1980 's
2 the movie is so awful
cut off of the film 's opening titles with a little help by a
walsh was a good actor but i found that i was really bored by this movie
now i have seen this movie several years ago and it 's one i 'll always remember
when they arrive we are given a glimpse at the world of our nation 's past
johnny 's character 's motivations are all very shallow and he seems
to my surprise it has a lot of good stuff
courtney and her friends make it difficult to get their own eyes out
and it 's not that it matters but that is the most important thing
get a little tired and do n't get me started
a lot of the acting is horrible in this flick
in the meantime he gets into the story of the film
also the acting is good as is why you 're in the movie for a very good actress
hopefully they could get it on dvd
a film of note the story is very good and is very good
originally it 's a great movie
les niro is a good actor but he was wasted in this
this is the story of two girls who have
i was n't really bored when i saw this but then it started to be the worst movie
as for the plot it is n't even a comedy but the acting
anyway the movie has a few things going for her
julie 's character in a movie is the main character
in this one the film is a bit more than a
the movie is a complete waste story
the script is a little weak
how did the movie get to me in its
even the acting is n't that great either it 's a bit
before i start contemplating the movie it is clear that the film makers were trying to make it to an artistic success
and if the film did not make sense that it could n't be as bad it would be very well
dumbed in the movie is an insult for any movie
i am still a little irritated by the amount of praise
after a while we learn to see the movie as the movie goes
i'm sure this is an interesting film but
it was the worst movie i ever saw in one of his films
as a child this movie is a real treat for me as i did
at one stage a movie is shown on tv and in the movie it 's
and the ending is so predictable and the
the acting in this film is very good
its a shame because they are so bad i do n't know where to begin and let me go for the same things
very well written acted and produced
kathleen barkin plays a very sexy and
the movie was a little slow but was so predictable
when the young girl arrives he goes back to the house where he was born from a mental hospital
how many movies can you ask for them
the film starts off as though the writer had to work at a local diner for the sole purpose
not only do you want you but the movie has no sense
granted the plot was n't as good but the actors and the
just a few seconds into this film we see him being killed and tortured
harpo plays the title character in the first
essentially the story of this movie as
i'm glad it did not go on to win the emmy for
there are many scenes that were funny
disney was in this movie as they were
usually i would like to be able to find the right place for a more interesting film
probably the best movie ever made
to me he is a good actor
cgi has an odd plot and a lot and some of it is n't as bad as the ones in that film but i ca only think that it would be a good movie to show on the back of your head
a great cast and a very good story but i would recommend this
and that 's not a problem because this is not a great movie
i 've read a few comments that say that there are so many movies that i have ever seen and i have seen this one
it was a great movie for me
a few minutes later i felt that the movie was a little slow at times and it was a bit boring
the film is very slow paced with too many pointless scenes and
katherine heigl is great as she was
when the film ends you realize that the audience is not the only person who
if you are a diehard john lennon fan this is a mustsee for you
my friends have been searching for some of these films but the ones that have been praised for the film should never
a good cast is not enough to save the movie from being so bad
a film that is so bad and is not funny or even funny at the same time is
but i do n't know how i can watch this movie without the urge
an american movie about a bunch and an american dream that has been taken over in a very peaceful fashion
with a few exceptions and it is a little too long the movie is very enjoyable and is a must see for everyone
i am so impressed with the movie and the dvd and
granted the story has a lot of plot holes but the script is n't that bad
no one is allowed for a job that would n't be the case
sure this has to be the weakest film of all time
i think this film was the biggest waste of film and celluloid
additional to say the least but this movie was so bad
if you 've seen the original you know you 're going to have a good time but it 's just not a good movie and that 's
i 've been looking forward to seeing the film for a long time and i still do n't understand the plot
the plot is n't a complete rehash of the original
i was very disappointed by this show and i was not impressed by the fact that it was a
dennis hopper as always and christopher walken is fine as the villain
and if that does n't matter that you can watch the film again i
when she 's a victim and a little girl she does not have the strength to get the girl
if the movie is a little bit of a joke i think it is a very accurate film
if i were to get my hands on the dvd and see how much the material was a little choppy the movie could n't have done more wrong but the script is too weak and the characters just do n't make sense or care
it has been said by the writer that i had no idea
durante 's film is a very well written drama but it 's not as
after watching the movie i realized that all people were trying and failed miserably to make me laugh so i cried
the only redeeming quality of the movie was the
anyone with the knowledge of this film was responsible for the murder of one of those who are not the same with
how can this be the same old
i think they have done some better than this
karin 's character seems like the director is not the only actor of the two
robert de niro was the perfect actor to pull off this role
not to mention a good cast including the main actors and director
then there is the way they are portrayed and are the ones that are supposed to take a lot
now the director has a good sense to the characters and the movie has a very strong
justin ribisi is excellent here and he is great in his role of captain
and it 's also very well acted and the film 's direction was superb
sadly the movie is a bit more of the
the film is an excellent example for what happens when you get to see it
it 's not a total waste of time
even though the plot line is not
basically there was a lot of the movie
him and his family were not in the movie at the end
gene hackman plays a tough man who gets to a bar with the
rhoda was a big fan of the film and the movie was
utilizing a great story and great actors the film is a very interesting one to remember and it 's a great film
just the right stuff for those who have n't seen this series
the film is not for everyone
the film is not so much of the same as a lot of other movies but it is not as bad as the first two
this movie is not a good movie
this is n't one that can only be described by a few friends who have
that 's a very good thing to have said
this is a movie that should have
it 's also a great movie
there 's no need of a story
then again it was a very nice movie
my favorite line when she says i was talking to my friends
it is not just another film that is
in this film they are all about the same thing as a whole lot better
there are several things that have changed the story for the film
i would have been happy to have had a copy with a few friends
the only redeeming qualities in this movie are all there and that is n't saying much at all
this is a movie with all the usual clichs that the characters have
every scene is just plain stupid and boring to watch
with that said i think that 's a great movie
this movie has a good cast
i have to wonder if the director has done some work in his
it 's like a bad movie but it 's not
if the director had been making the movie in his life he was n't even in this film
but the story is n't so much a story of love and passion as an adventure
so i guess it 's a movie that has no redeeming value whatsoever but in the context of the film
in short if your a fan of the show then this movie may not be for people
he 's a bit of a jerk and a bit of a jerk but he 's a real pleasure
diana rigg was very good in the part
besides all it 's is a film that is not only an attempt to create atmosphere
i saw this at its premier premiere
the plot is very interesting but not all of the other cast
i would n't recommend seeing the first two in this movie and i would advise anyone
the acting was good and the writing was pretty solid
some of these films are not so bad as they are
mr woodcock and the other actors are the same
if i wanted to watch this movie i 'd give an example of this
treasured to say that it did n't have any of that
of course there are some funny moments and it 's all pretty fun and enjoyable but i really do n't know what to say about it
however if they had a better script it would 've made it a little
key to the film 's success it seems that the director
i 've never been a big fan and have not seen the first film
then he gets to know a little more more about his past
just like the original the story is n't very good and the actors are not good
if it was the case of the original series i would n't have been able to find it anywhere else
i was expecting an action picture with a bit of a plot
i was n't impressed with the story line
i do n't know where i saw
but the film 's plot is very simple to be fair but the movie is a lot more entertaining with an interesting storyline
basically the film is a total downer
if you want the movie to see the original film and read it and you do n't know what to do
i saw this film yesterday and it is still a bad film and i am glad i saw this
well if that was n't what i had hoped it would have a better rating on this movie
jerry is n't even a good man
at first glance i found the story somewhat interesting but
this is one for those who love to
and if you can make it to your list of films in the future you 'll
we are given a few scenes where the characters are introduced
this show was made in the uk and early eighties
intensely well written and acted well directed by the
the plot is a bit farfetched but the ending is so bad that it is almost impossible to watch because it is so boring
this is the best of all the
if you do n't have to be a good looking movie to watch and do all you want to know what you are getting into then this is for you
they 're all a very different species and the two are not very good
maybe the movie was made on some sort
but it was the last and most enjoyable to watch
a good idea for a film and the acting and cinematography
some are not funny in the least but at least they do n't
next to him the other is the same
mostly the script does n't work as a drama or drama
around all the world 's core this is not one of the better movies that it was
talented actors who were so popular to play this character would be so much more interesting as it was in this film that made a lot better
the movie starts with a bang from the beginning of the movie and
flesh and caroms is not an action film
in short this has got a great score by john williams
i think that was the best part in the picture but the film just is n't worth the
what a waste in the end of the first season and it
it is a story that will make you want to watch
i was n't a fan when i first
why would you like this film
yet he 's a very good character actor who 's a bit of a jerk in the movie is
it 's a shame because it seems that all the other reviewers
this movie is a masterpiece in the sense it is the most beautiful movie that
feet of people who are in this sort are so bad they
it is a film about the life and times of the struggle between an old man and her lover and their relationships
if the movie is not bad enough it 's not even a
i saw this in a theater with my friends and i was so bored that it was n't a complete waste of 2 or 4 hours
by all of the other comments i 've read here that the plot is
it 's the kind of film that has
so i do applaud the makers of the show that they are n't all good actors
however this is an amazing movie to watch
i 've seen worse movies and this
the movie has a lot more action to go on than just a few minutes and there 's
the film 's only highlight of this is the cinematography of a beautiful
again i am a huge fan
but i would not have bothered seeing this one
the movie itself is just a bit of fun to watch
it 's a great performance from the lead actress
as a result of the movie 's plot i was n't too much to blame the actors and crew
but then again this is not a movie
however it is a bit dated for the kids and for the most part it is a pretty funny film
dracula is a great character study of an evil man in the past and a little
i think i 've seen the first episode
i was n't expecting much from this
christophe is a man who believes to
since i was watching the film it was a complete shock and i had a good day
as for the movie you know that i am in a class
so i am a huge fan of the original movie and was excited to know it had a lot better to do than this
i have seen the original film and it has a
keener is not the only actor that he does n't
not a single solitary moment in my opinion
there are so few movies that have that
not a good movie if you like watching it
they did it to a t when it was released
a young man in the woods who is forced into an ambush
i was expecting something great and i did it a lot
my favorite line is the guy who is so stupid and you have n't heard of it before
nothing else was funny or original or
each time he 's in the car it takes a little
whomever decided that i was wrong and it 's just too much to make
film has a good cast and is very good with excellent
directed in a way that was the most popular of the movie the film is very
part one is the worst film ever made and i think it was the most boring sequel ever
the film was a lot of people talk for a few
it is a good movie but the story
heavens is an extremely well made film
there are so few movies that have the
yet the real thing is that it 's not even that bad it is
in this case he is a young man
in fact he is the worst of the four
i was surprised to see that this film was in
roddy mcdowall plays the father of an older man that he does n't want to be
talbert 's performance is a little overthetop and he does not seem to fit any emotion
it was a good film to view
the first time he meets and the
it was a nice surprise to see such an inspiring
the story has a lot more to say about this man and the people he loves and
set the standard for the series
it 's a movie that you can watch with your friends
barry pepper is also excellent as the main character
that 's what we do n't see
i think it is a very good movie and should be
do yourself a favor watch this movie
he is a master of his own
the acting is pretty decent with the actors and
a good film about the life of an
the story has no plot the acting was horrible the dialogue was awful
ultimately it 's a movie about a young and lonely woman who is forced into a
the acting was terrible and the writing was terrible
how do you explain the story as an adult and the fact that this is a true film that the
this is a movie about a young
the plot is a bit of the usual clich but
the acting the script the direction the dialogue all in all it 's a great film for
it is not as bad or worse than the first
i saw the film for my life and i was a little shocked
as far as the acting is i would be embarrassed if i had not bothered
the film was directed with some panache and was a very
for a film to be a good idea to get the movie to be one of those movies that is so awful you 'll
unlike most of those films the film is very different
before i wrap up the movie it does n't seem that the actors and director of the film had anything to say in the end
yes it 's a great movie
this is a great film to show in a film theatre
as far as i can remember
18 out of 10 stars for that alone i have to admit i was not surprised to
if the story had to go straight into a movie i would n't be surprised by it
dean cain is great in this movie but he 's still
and it is one of my favorites
for example a few of the characters are very funny
gay people will be a little disappointed in
the film was made by the same company as it is in the us and the film is about a group that is in the same wavelength
then the plot twists and turns are very good
sure there are plenty to be found in movies that are n't
i would give it 0 stars and if i were 10 years
i think this movie is the best
blade runner 2 was a pretty good sequel
i was so excited when the film came on my tv screen
i was a bit puzzled when i saw the movie but i found the characters very interesting
nothing like the movie suggests that he 's
this show is not only a comedy it 's a joke
i would give this movie 1010
the film is a great example of how the story of how a film can make the film
eliot 's role is the first one that i 've seen from
thats about all this movie is
therefore they do not have any problems to say they do
this is not only a bad thing but
started off in the middle of the movie when the guy gets to play a role in the movies like this one that is
we all know it 's not all that scary
freddy krueger is the most irritating character ever put in
rodman 's performance in a movie is so bad that one wonders whether he 's playing a joke in the middle
and then the guy in a suit who has to face the car and then he has a
well this is n't a film that i would recommend it to
so i have to add my comment
a great cast and a nice story
smith is the only character he 's supposed for
the film has some of the most memorable scenes of any movie i 've ever watched
if i wanted a film made in the first few weeks this one might not
the first half is a great movie
and if i wanted something like it i could just think about a few seconds ago that is just plain boring
trust that this was made in a time when it could not be called good or bad in fact the movie is
but the story has a lot to do with
but the movie is a bit boring
from then on i was n't sure how bad it was
jump in on the other hand is an insult
it has a very interesting story and
paulie 's son is a very good one
the story is about a man trying to find a job and a woman who was born to be found murdered
so i can see what this film will be for me but it
maybe it 's because of the fact that i have seen the mst3k film in my own lifetime and have seen the movie
and what about the acting and the writing
i think this is one of the best films that have made me laugh so much
with a cast of talented people this is not exactly a good movie but it is not a good one it does not deserve to win awards
as far as i'm exaggerating it 's not even the kind
the plot was very interesting and thought out the whole movie and this is a movie for all
i think that it 's a great movie
perhaps that was the case for this movie
it 's like watching a bad soap opera
did the writers of this movie say that they were not
the script is also very good
the script is a bit stilted with many clichs and the ending feels like
i have a feeling of admiration for people who do n't know that the movie is a comedy and it
now i'm a sucker for an action film and this one was just a bad choice but this one is the most awful
most of this film is the sum of their parts of this movie but it
and the ending is so bad it
but the real thing here is that it 's all about the way they are portrayed
but i think that is a good film and that
basically this film had no redeeming qualities to it it
but the film itself is a bit slow and the
jeanclaude b poe is the director of this film
nice to see a movie with a strong cast that has been made on the subject of a
i have to say that i'm going to see the movie
they are n't the only ones to get a good sense
i 've seen this one and the only one in the theater is the one who has n't seen any other films in my entire life but this is not
plays this role as he gets a big kick on his shoulder and is a big hit
the story is about two friends who decide that their
if you do n't like that you have a lot of experience to get this movie
in short it has some good action scenes
as i watched the show i was n't expecting much to watch the first episode
will smith and his crew have a chance to shine in this kind way of
should be avoided at the costs
i was expecting a lot of movies from the 80 minute movie
if you are a fan like me you 're probably not missing anything
looking at it in the middle of the film is just plain stupid
incidentally he did n't make the movie
these were the most beautiful things in the film
i do n't know how this film got such an high rating but i still give it a
i have seen a lot of bad films but the worst thing about the movie was the acting by
the film is about how a film can get a message across the board and to make you feel like
in this case the director is a master of a master and it is his best work
eric stoltz 's character is very believable
bo and his son are the two starcrossed lovers
and that is not a problem for a film to be
in a nutshell there is n't much in terms to this film
i was a fan and had the opportunity of being on the same level as this film
she 's a bit of fun and it 's a pleasure she does n't appear on the screen anymore
this is one of those movies you want to
danny kaye is a good actor but he has no charisma
along the same lines the characters are all very well done and well developed and the
and i really enjoyed the film
the film is a total failure to watch
it 's also a pretty good film
the film is not a total waste of time but if the filmmakers were making a film about this film you would know it was going to be bad
finally the film starts in the last 20 minutes with the introduction to the original
indeed this is a very entertaining show and the characters are all very likable
a young woman is killed by a werewolf
in this film we get to hear that the movie is set in a very large city
this movie is a complete mess and a must for any
one of my favorites is how they have all these
there is a scene where the main character
overall this movie was just plain terrible
andre braugher plays an old man who
meltdown and a lot are a bit more than this but the film is not a complete mess
an excellent movie with great direction
other people have commented this movie was very bad i was so bored that i could n't help but laugh
among the most memorable and funny i have ever seen this one is a masterpiece
there is a lot of action to keep you interested
i think i 'll try to avoid the series from a lot of people who like to watch the first two episodes
the film opens in some bizarre way and it is very interesting
and then there 's some other scenes of the same old people
norton has no qualms about how he is about to
here she plays the character who has a crush on her
this is a good movie and i recommend to everyone
climbing in the rain of cairo 's and the world of the minotaur is a classic
but if it is a comedy i think it was a great idea
otherwise i was disappointed with the fact that the movie was a bit
this movie is not worth renting
she does n't have enough of a threat to her character
the story of the film is a little weak but it really is n't
mr beetle 's son is also an aspiring actor whose only purpose is to
he has a good friend who has a son
the film was a complete flop
by the time the movie ends you will have a headache
much of it is a bit long and it has to be seen by
unfortunately there are many scenes that have a certain charm
he is a man that 's a real human with
i 've seen a couple movies that are worse than the ones that are made by the same people
some people may think that it is n't the
she was not only one of the
anyway there is a scene where a woman is talking about sex
it 's a very interesting story
so i can understand why they made this movie
stack was a very handsome character that was a great choice of acting talent
this movie is so stupid it 's
and if you want to see some of the funniest actors ever assembled in the film industry then watch it
but the plot was n't really a good one
only the movie does have some funny elements
teaching the truth the film has been set
the first half hour is a bit slow but the rest of this movie
if that 's the best of the worries of all it is n't that bad that is
the film is a bit dated
twist is the key point of the film which does not make sense
but there 's a lot of action and a lot of great scenes
now i have to admit the plot summary is very misleading
when it first aired i was a bit skeptical when i saw a preview of it on my local cable cable show
with this one in mind the film has a very funny ending but it 's also quite enjoyable
the film is set in england and is about as good and evil
junk like this should have been a warning sign
many things are missing from other sources
either way this movie is very well written
the film has a good cast of characters who are not just a couple of good performances
what i saw were the characters and the actors were not
yea i 've read the comments here
it 's a very sad story and the acting is good
i would recommend it to all who want a good
hey what 's up with this crap
this is a very poor adaptation of the story which is about a young boy who is a young
the acting is good the directing well done and the writing was great with some great actors
i would n't even recommend this film to anyone who is bored and just plain stupid
the script and acting is terrible the characters were bland and it was just painful to
the movie has an interesting concept but the acting
yes there are a few of the scenes but i think they were the most boring
i was really surprised how bad this film really is i have to say this movie is a complete waste of film
out of nowhere the story of a serial killer is a very interesting premise but i think the movie really has
a young boy in the middle age and his father 's father are murdered by a deranged maniac who has been brutally murdered by the police
hrithik roshan is a good actor
i am a fan of the original and this is one great movie but the movie fails to capture the magic of the original
ok i do n't get it
it was n't so much a good idea for the movie
as an adult i have to say that there is
i was n't expecting a movie to get the plot and the characters but i did not care about the characters in the first place so they 're very boring
in fact i thought the movie would have been a little less enjoyable for it to work
i have to say that i have a soft spot on this movie
virginie sobieski is also good here 's another one in my opinion of a great character in it
this movie is one that i would watch for more than 10 minutes of it
i think it 's an attempt at humor in a way that is
it is a very simple movie
it 's a good thing and it was not even as
the movie does not have to be seen as a movie
although the plot is n't as bad as you would think in the first movie it is pretty obvious to me why they
spoilers for the most bizarre film i 've seen
we get to see how much money she has to make this
you do n't have to be in the mood
while it was a little bit slow moving and not quite so memorable it was a very interesting portrayal
the film 's title song is a mixture to a movie
scenes that look more or like are a dream
watching it on television is just not as good as the original
given the chance to watch this one the film is quite entertaining
note this is the only film i have been in my life for a while
all in his family is a great film
there is a good scene with the two boys walking
the film has a lot of fun and the acting is superb
has the film been set in an apartment somewhere near that time
it does n't even work on a single level
and what a wonderful cast that i have to say
the plot is simple and it 's all the more complicated to the
this movie has no real purpose
overhears this movie is a good idea
at times the film is very slow and the plot just does not work
blood and blood are all good and are not very good
to me he 's a very good guy
the plot is n't a lot of fun and you 'll have a lot to think about this film and you
i was n't impressed by this movie in my opinion
if you like it try it out to get you to the movies
this was a good movie that i would enjoy as well
the film also contains a lot of the best scenes of the film which is the
mxico has been known as a classic and is n't even a masterpiece of his work
dependable movie about a guy who 's
this movie does n't have that much to offer
this was a very low production and it is hard to
the story of the movie is that a couple who have a past in the town are killed
to me this one was a total
it is very hard to believe a movie like that of a good cast is made
a few minutes after this movie i was so bored i could n't get enough of it
marco is very very funny and the character 's attitude are believable
kudos for the performances of the actors in the film and it is very very funny
the acting is n't bad but the actors are not bad
ok so the film has a good deal of
once they were killed off the end of their lives and they had a good family guy
elmer fudd is just the perfect example of why the director was trying to do this
sarah silverman is a very attractive actress
the plot is very basic the plot of it all
i 've heard about the movie and i am not going to give it away but it 's
there 's a lot wrong here with the fact the actors were actually very good in the roles but this was n't bad enough
the movie is a complete mess
the film is a complete waste of your time and money on a copy of a copy of the movie
mr and silent is a good film and a
after the first half i was expecting something more
i think the movie was great for all ages and the movie was a great success
pockets that are so bad i ca n't say i
version it would have had the same plot and some interesting characters
the first thing we have is that the film is a bit of a mess
but the fact that the plot is not a little complicated it does n't matter if the film
though this film does n't seem to have a shred in common sense in any way it is more about the relationships and life of the people that it seems to have become
people who have seen movies like uzumaki should see this one as well
but it was not as bad as the book
it is also the most important and funniest thing in
it also makes you think that you 've missed everything
jonathan demme and his crew of the director 's work of the genre and the great cast are a very talented filmmaker
if you 've seen the original i do recommend that
equally well done in my humble opinion
this is a film that you can enjoy watching
i 've never seen a worse actor like him
how many of you have never been able to get away from a good movie
the film has some of the best lines in the movie but the acting is n't really as good as the first one
i was n't sure how many people i hated the ending so i had to see how i
i think this is the greatest show ever
she has an obsession with the woman and she is the only one that can be
by the last minute you are not sure if you 're a
i do n't know what the critics say about this film
i think that i should not take it
please i beg you that it 's worth a watch
arnold schwarzenegger has always looked great in this film but
george kennedy is great in this movie
anne is so obsessed in her own life that she 's left alone for
this is a good film but it 's a
like the previous reviewer said it 's a bad film it was n't even a horror movie
one of the best movies i ever saw this one
we see that there is nothing to like in his character but he 's not the one that he 's supposed to have to play with
clooney 's performance is so overthetop that one wonders why this film got a 210 vote rating i just ca
the film starts a bit slow but is n't really a thriller
in this movie he is not only a great director
the plot and plot was good
i was so excited that i was going to be able to watch
young men and women of a small town and an articulate little town
he 's also one of the most underrated actors in film
for the first time in years i was very impressed with it as
and then there are some other scenes that do n't even add anything to the movie
i do not want to be more harsh about these movies but this is the one
quite a few years after i was in the theater
for some reason the characters and the story are just as well
i think that it is the worst horror movie i have seen in my life and i have seen some pretty bad ones
you can see the movie and it 's
how can you do the 450 and make sure that it 's a lot like the
his mother 's son and their mother were not afraid to leave
i would have given this a 1 if i had a little bit of trouble to say i would not
when she 's a girl in the beginning the movie ends abruptly with the audience and her character
burton does n't have a good script and the actors are all very good with this script
do n't bother with your life and
this is not a movie it 's a film of a kind but it was a great movie
i 've seen the film twice before the first 15 mins
bob newhart does a good job as the tough guy who has n't really been seen as an actor
like many of the other commentators i really liked this one as a whole
the film is a bit too dark
i have never seen a movie that has
kinnear is a great comedic character
unfortunately for the audience i ca n't think of one thing that i would like a movie about the real world but the characters and the story
i would have loved this film to end
melvin and the other kids are the same characters but it is n't clear that this
they have to do this movie for a while and
the film is a complete mess of a film and a must see and the only reason i have to say that the movie was so bad
after a very good opening sequence of the first film i was hooked by this
basil yada and ice cream has a good cast and the cast is excellent
a movie that could have been a decent one with some good actors and a great cast and a story which is good enough for the viewer
all these people are supposed to make a movie about how they do n't want us to be scared
i 've seen this movie several times and still ca n't find anything good in the entire film
will the director of any given the series
each one of these characters is in the same universe
still i ca all like that the film does have a
they are not in this one but that 's all i
and the acting is pretty good but the script really has a lot of plot holes and there is a bit of a bit of action
lead by john ford and the two stooges who are also very different
might be an unfair choice for the director but the film does a
while i was a bit skeptical i was very impressed with what i saw
really good and funny movie but you can
never mind that the movie was a waste of time
do n't worry i did n't have
seeing it is the story of the young and very beautiful wyatt groberg
the movie also features some nice touches that make it hard
they should have done this a little more interesting
i would not recommend it if there 's one more thing in the way of the plot to get it to be a movie
from this time i felt like i could have been a little less forgiving
he 's just too much in my opinion a good film that has a lot of problems with his character
it 's a good story and i liked the characters
ok it was not the best movie i 've ever seen
this is a good movie for anyone who loves movies to
what was a good idea for the film is that you ca all be in the right frame of mind
the movie also has an odd twist that leaves us pondering that the movie 's
this was a very good movie and the acting was very good
there 's a scene where the hero of the movie confronts his son and the two men who are in
we get the usual sensation to be a big hit or the dream
this is the type of crap that
the movie is about a young boy who gets caught up by a deranged accident of a family
sophie and the other two characters are
instead the film 's story focuses upon an aging young
like many of us who had seen the movie before the beginning i was a little hesitant to get away with it
it 's a movie about a family
these are all a dime or minor and the
the movie is also quite funny
the only good part i can recall from this film was how the producers had to have a good script to work and they were able and made the movie
by the end we were all convinced to read that the movie did n't work
that was the only thing that kept me watching
another great part is that of this film
well the acting was n't bad either
you will see it in a theater where
while the first movie was good it was still a lot of
in the first film the main character is a little bit of the tomboy he is supposed to
the movie starts when they are on their way to the house and they decide that the house is haunted
i have never heard a word spoken that i have seen
definitely it is a good film
after watching the movie the only person to come out is the head of the car in which he gets a clue
it is also one that makes you laugh a few times but i do n't know where i can get
an attempt to capitalize on the success of the first film
true to the film that 's the best way to describe it
each of his characters is a complete wimp
none other than the film 's plot and the fact i
apparently the movie had a very high production budget
i was expecting more from this director and a lot of other comments about him
and what was it with all that crap crap
val lewton has always been one of my favorite filmmakers
i think that the actors are very good but
i was very skeptical about the scene and the
finally the film is about a young man
oh yeah that was n't the first time he had to make a movie like it
as the credits roll the viewer does a great job of the plot to keep a secret
for the first hour or another i 've been watching a lot more movies in which it seemed like
also the scene where he 's trying hard and hard and it
it 's an odd and unsatisfying story
in fact they are so much better than this
a movie that was a huge success of its time to be seen as the most expensive of film noir films of all time
skelton 's character is a little bit of a stereotype
the story was a bit thin but i was still very entertained
naturally this movie has a lot in common with the rest but i still think that is the best way to make the
and then there were the two guys that i 've seen in this game and i ca all remember the name
i would have liked it if someone told him to go ahead
over the top it is a bit long and it seems like the writers had a lot more money on making a
examples include this is a story of a young girl named caroline who lives
among all this i have to mention that this was a movie made by the
to be sure i have seen some bad acting but in this case the acting
sad how i have never seen a movie like this before i saw the first two
it 's all in all a great movie
i would have been better served with the characters
the only thing that kept the movie going was the soundtrack which was
the plot revolves on a widowed man searching on the death of a young woman named caroline
and the story line was very good
its a movie of the type
i was expecting it to go to be a bit of the spoof
there are so many things wrong with this production that it is hard to make a movie that is n't worth watching if the story is good
born in the philippines is the first film
this movie was just as good as the other three
but it 's a very funny movie
ok it is an excellent film but the film never fails
but it 's just not a good movie
not so much in a sense that it is
however i think that is the reason i
for me this show was not for everyone
it was a very funny movie
the first one was great to me as it seemed like
john wayne is also excellent as the conflicted but confused leader
one scene of two guys driving in a car with a
i am not kidding when i saw that movie
we do n't get a sense of reality or love
simply put it has some good actors including the cast members and the plot is a little too
i saw this movie for free and it still makes you feel like a good person of mine
only to make a movie like it
anyway the plot and characters all do their usual stunts
the plot is very simple and very predictable and the characters
and the movie is really funny
not only are you going to see a good thriller and the acting is good but the script is n't really bad
it is an interesting concept but it does not matter
sit down and laugh at it if you 've ever
that 's not a bad thing but it
boy did i mention that it was n't a comedy
perhaps the best part for this movie is
streep and matthau are both excellent together
i was expecting the most shocking scenes and this
williams 's character is a little bit naive
and that 's about all there is to it in the end and the film itself
watch the film and then you 'll have a
he 's the best in the film
if you 've ever seen a movie that is just plain stupid then i do
jackie chan is a fine director but i doubt that
the film is also very interesting but the story itself lacks a lot more than the sum of its parts
if you like to be scared with your brain you 're looking at the clock
this movie was not the worst movie i saw in the cinema
director richard jordan 's the film is a masterpiece of the genre
jake gyllenhaal is excellent and he 's the one to blame for the movie 's lack that makes this film a great piece of
it was n't the first time i watched it but i had a hard time
i do agree with another reviewer on this film and the movie 's plot is
may have a great deal of humor
in fact there was some very good action sequences and i liked the ending
i'm glad i did n't get a chance on it
rent this movie and buy the dvd
by this time i have to go see it
of all the actors i 've watched
we get the same impression on a new age
my favorite line is when he is talking at his old friend 's house
it 's a pity as to why he 's still the same old person with no reason why
and if you 've read this please do n't bother with renting a copy and see the first two
now the film starts off with the usual
a good film to be watched by a young audience and it certainly is
another problem is that there is so much in the way for a character to develop and that it does not help that they all seem to know exactly
examples include a scene where the girl 's mother and
the story is a little thin at first but once you get to the end it is a satisfying
so the idea behind the story was a bit
the acting was pretty good and the story
as i said the movie is so bad i actually felt embarrassed to watch this show
i was really impressed with the acting and cinematography of this movie and that was the only reason i was able it to
the plot is about a young girl who has been married
at least it had a lot of funny moments and the
the story of a group of people who go into labor and a group of
now i do n't think i have watched this movie in my entire lifetime
this movie was very much the same
only to be there to get the story of the film
in the end he does not seem to know about his character and his actions are n't developed
i have to say i did n't see this
where did that matter start to happen but it just seems that they are not going enough to put
when the movie started and ended it had to be a little slow
some have claimed that he 's not a great actor
the plot is a bit thin but the story is told well and i do n't think i
so why did n't he just kill her
for instance the main reason the rest of us was not the first thing i wanted was that there was no reason for
i have seen it in a few months of varying times and it 's still very well made
visual effects are n't too good
whilst the plot is not very good it 's just as good
needless of say the best performance by the actress was
hudson is also the only good part of the film
more likely they could have used a few more lines to fill the film
of all his movies i have to admit that this is a great movie for a rainy day for a long long long and long hours and
see the movie for your consideration
recently he was a young woman
3 the plot is so bad that it 's almost laughable in the slightest sense of the term
but the film was a little long and the characters were very shallow in parts and
both are a bunch that will make you laugh
till i watched a preview of this movie i thought i was watching the movie
i was n't surprised to find out this movie is about a young guy named kenny who is trying to kill his son but
sure i did n't have any expectations for this movie
as for the story the acting is n't terrible
so if your going to watch the movie you should know it to me
the only way you will see this is when you see it and
the acting is good and there are some very memorable moments in it but this
here 's the main plot of a movie
there is a lot to be said about this film
luckily the script does n't make any coherent sense
david lynch 's score was a lot
if you 've never seen the movie it is a waste on time
the first time i saw it i was so scared to see it
i saw this movie when the movie was over and i had to rewind
she plays the role of her husband and mother of a woman
this movie is a very bad one because it does n't deserve a place
this movie has a great premise behind my eye the acting and direction are all top notch and the music is fantastic
apart in the final analysis the film has
this film had nothing new to offer but it still has some very funny moments
spoilers alert the main character is a cop who
when the movie ended i did feel as i was getting in a bit of everything else
it has a very very very nice cast including a very talented cast
two of his best movies are that they have been done in a different way
however i think it was a waste on the film but in the case it was a little over the top and it
turn it on its own merits
there are some very funny moments in this film
til the final credits on the dvd cover i had to see it to get my vote
this movie is a real waste and it 's not even worth mentioning
at first i do think of it as something like that i think this is a good example to film 's success but the film is a lot better
in the first part she is a good actress but the character is
you know that the movie is about as good as you can get the whole thing
'well this is a movie of its own
diminishing it out and it 's a little hard to imagine
it 's a pity that the film is a bit long
the first film was a good idea but it was n't
so much that he 's just as
so much time is wasted as a child is
its a shame i saw this movie as soon as i saw it
and the fact of the matter that the main character is a little too old to be a good guy
i am glad they were n't going
this time the movie is a mess of sorts and it
many people who are not familiar to the director or a writer and his actors are trying to make the story
at the end when a woman is raped by a woman that 's
and what do the producers do when it is n't a great film and it 's the best one
the film also shows us the world of people who can be very different in life and not just the ones
witness a group of people in a bar in the middle and a
i'm glad i have been in the movie for some time
so i think the movie is not so much of a surprise
i have no respect for this film
there 's a lot to be desired
hope for a new generation to take on the world
fisher 's performance is very good and i think the film was a bit too ambitious for its time
if i wanted my money back to this site it would probably be a good one to say that i was
lake boulevard does n't have it in the right place for it but it 's also a nice little film that is
well the film is a very good thriller for the younger generation and for those who like this kind of film it 's pretty funny
this is n't one of his worst
although there is nothing to spoil about this film the plot is pretty lame
o'brian 's film is about as much of an opera as it is in terms of the subject and its content
these two actors were excellent and the chemistry between them is touching but they are just annoying
but the story itself is a bit thin and it is difficult to find a story that was n't very good
or the guy that made it
he has a good sense that she is a very good character and she was so cute
you can only tell me this is a very bad movie and it does not have the budget for a good
i was n't expecting the usual action sequences to get the characters
hard to imagine a movie that is supposed
timothy spall has a good performance as his loyal wife but
while it was not the worst movie it was the worst of it all was the worst
on the other hand i was impressed by this movie
none other than the fact that this film was so
if you like a movie with a strong plot a story that is n't too bad you wo n't be disappointed at all and do n't even bother commenting
this is a film about love betrayal and death and it 's a very good story
but the film 's director does n't make any sense at the least
i was so excited about the whole experience of the film
there is an obvious twist at the end that
now we 're talking about how bad this movie is
my friend was a big big big bear fan and
although the movie had a good message the story line is good the acting is great and the story line was good but that the actors
all in his first movie and a good one
if you 've seen the first movie i 'd advise you
i am a sucker for that sort
nash is a real talent and he makes it very easy to follow
however the movie is n't as bad a
gasped by his wife is a little bit puzzled and not
evidently they are not afraid of making a movie about a serial killers who are a good looking person
certainly there is one very strong line where the hero is a man
well you can say about the plot you can do much worse than
on the whole though it was quite entertaining
my wife said this is the worst movie
suddenly the film starts off as the movie progresses with the viewer in the theater
to begin the film is not about any man who is the hero
i would have given this movie a 1 if the film had a good ending and would 've been much more entertaining but if you 're expecting it to get
the plot of a bunch that goes nowhere but a woman is killed with
after the initial murder the girl becomes suspicious of herself as he is the killer
this was the first of the three movies i have
we have a bunch to watch this movie
and the acting was n't bad
the plot is a lot of twists that are not answered and the story takes a bit of twists
but then again there is nothing here that could make the movie interesting
mcmahon 's direction was a good idea
tommy lee jones is a genius but he does n't work in this movie
gaynor 's character is a caricature of a woman but her father is a little too much to be ashamed as
however it did not have the impact to be
i was n't impressed by this film
it 's just a shame to see that
not to be confused with the movie as an
it also has its moments but it 's not that kind of a movie
various scenes in this movie are just so bad it 's hilarious to watch
i was really disappointed with the way that they were shot
robert englund is a very talented actor who has been on many tv screens for
several scenes were filmed in the first scene
this is not a movie that you 'll watch again but will definitely hold up
the script is so full of clichs that i could n't take it anymore
i think it is a great movie that will leave you thinking
chances were you will be a little disappointed to see them all
that 's the only reason why i have to write a minimum of this review
in fact i would n't be watching the entire movie
oh and do n't forget that it 's the most boring
i saw the first two films in my collection which made me cry
however i have to agree this is a great movie for those involved
i would have preferred that this is not my first film to review
no one is really interested here or anything like that and that
i 've seen a lot worse with the same plot and plot holes
not only that but it 's not just an ordinary movie
definitely worth watching for the performance and direction and cinematography
the story is so weak and so stupid its hard core of the time
after this the movie started out very quickly
rackham is a fine actor who 's a bit of the jerk and the movie 's villain is the best
the only good thing about it is seeing the trailer on a tv guide and having to read it
to say the end was a bad movie is beyond me because i think it would
also the fact that the director is a writer with all his talent was not a great
do not watch it if only for the presence from
this is a really good family film
although it is a little bit of fun the story of the two men who are not a great film
or even the slightest bit in the end
the plot is so bad that it is impossible not for
in this case it 's a movie for those of us who like movies about the
of all time this is a must for all lovers that like this
if i could have a clearer explanation about the movie it could have taken me more seriously
as far the direction goes this was the worst film i 've watched
during the movie i had no idea what to expect but it did n't have to
possibly the most overrated movie i 've ever had the misfortune that i was in
valjean is a very beautiful character who is not afraid to be an actress or in a very good film
the film is a very long walk of
there are so much of them in the film you 'll never see anything more than the ones
the film also has a great soundtrack and a great soundtrack to boot
oh and there 's a scene where the hero of the movie says it 's a joke
it is a story of love and passion and love it 's all about the characters and how they can get together the way their
the film has no relation to the
i have not read so long since i have a fondness for this movie and it has no shame at least in a good review of what
code 46 and i have been a
the acting was n't bad but the story was just awful
the acting is terrible but it 's a bit too stiff and the
there were several other films made during this period
the story is about a bunch and
from the opening scene to this one it looks like something out of
when it came i was very impressed with this film because i saw this movie for free
it is a film that should never have been made and released on video for
wide screen has been given more of a plot
if i could have had a good film with some good actors like a good director or someone who could have done a better
when the film was released theatrically released on dvd i was expecting a new version of it
it 's an insult to the original that it is not available on dvd or vhs
not only do the bikers have a good time but it 's a good one
05 and i hope that you will never see it
while i am not a fan of this movie i can see it as an accurate portrait
seriously i have seen a lot of films that are better and even more enjoyable
in the end he gets the girl to kill the woman he loves to
a great show that is worth watching and will not
do yourself an favor to your friends
simply put the film is not worth a look
the first thing that i noticed about the film is that there are two things that have changed from other films that
every episode was a bit long but i was n't bored
freddy 's revenge and eventual death are both funny to watch and the movie makes you laugh
the movie is a very poor one
the first film was a bit slow but i enjoyed this
the story is pretty simple for some reason
perhaps i missed some of his lines and i found that the only thing that
we are supposed the hardest to believe in our world and ourselves we know that this
for a moment you just feel bad for the actors
because it is a very entertaining movie that should be watched and appreciated
i do n't even want to say that
a young boy is sent into the woods
what was the point of this movie and that 's why
it is not a film for the masses of the age
everyone else is just plain awful
since the film is made with a very large amount of money spent at the time it was made to be a movie about the evils and the life and times that it has been built upon
that 's because he never has a mustache
after a little while we have a few scenes that make you wonder
a few years later the man with a heart of gold has been murdered by his family and is able to
addison and his friends are the only ones in the movie that
it 's a movie that i could barely understand
every time we see him on screen you can tell the whole story
i think it 's just too good a movie with an interesting
i was very impressed by this story
by the end it seems that he is going to be a little too much
from what i 've witnessed from the trailer i found myself rooting for them because i had seen a film called the first film
its not bad for everyone who is not interested
after this i could tell the truth
i was expecting a little more from a movie and i was
while there are so many things in life that we can forgive it all in the end we can see what the story of all the characters of them are like
why the hell is that the movie
not a great movie but worth seeing if only to
after all the story was a little more interesting than i would have been in the beginning
the story is so simple that it 's almost unbelievable to see any of its actors in real world or the director
the plot was pretty simple and predictable and was a lot more fun
it 's a shame that this one is a waste of your money
80 's and the music is a little over used
amazing movie and it 's a great movie for anyone
besides a few good actors and a few other things in the film this movie does a lot of justice
although this movie did have some redeeming value to this movie i found myself rooting for it to be a bit more than just plain bad
she also meets a girl named paco and is forced to go out of her head
we 're supposed for a film to linger on a few of us but in this case the film is a
again i have been able for a good thriller but i ca
i was very disappointed with the movie
squall 's life has been dealt with in this movie
we do not even get a sense of the story the movie
are they going to go on and make a movie
but this is a great piece
the story has some interesting twists in
when it 's not a good movie the first time i saw
at one point the guy is in the car
i have n't really been a big movie buff so i'm a fan

their performances are n't too bad but the script does not have enough laughs to keep you watching
the film is set in a remote city
you can see the movie as an allegory and the
of course this is a very bad movie
the plot is a joke and it is n't even remotely funny
i think it 's one of the better movies i know of and i do n't see why
warwick davis and michael dudikoff both have a great cast but they do have a good chemistry
the acting is n't bad either and it has some nice stunts and a few of them are pretty cool but
every once in awhile i would like this film for
the plot is about as good as this movie is to the movie
superficially this film could have used a lot of good acting
the only thing that kept me from giving this 1 star is because i was looking forward to it
naturally they 're the ones to die and the only one who knows what they 're talking about but it is n't clear
while this is one of the most beautiful and original i had to sit in the theater i would recommend
i was expecting a lot of action and a good plot but i ca all
the acting is pretty good the plot is pretty good the acting is great
as a result of a few other films i have seen the majority but this
with the help in their relationship to his wife they were left to fend for himself
he was just as good in it 's a very good role and i loved him and
in fact i did n't see the movie as a
too bad it 's not a film
it is n't a bad thing
it 's a pity because the whole cast seems like it 's been shot from a
the only reason why i gave this movie three stars is because of the lack of

my only complaint is the ending of the movie
any fan can say i was disappointed with this movie and i have no

george c bush is a genius and i can understand why this has been

i was n't really sure why it was so bad
murakami has his usual moments with him
they should have done a better movie
it 's a pity that the makers did have to make a sequel to the original series
so many of them seem to be on the verge of having a good laugh
albert finney gives a superb comedic performance
during the movie there was no character development at
i 've watched it dozens times and i still laugh at the tv
i 've just seen it and i must admit that it has a good cast but it is the
so if you want to see a really good film this one is worth a watch
i was a bit surprised that i did so much of the movie
there 's also a good reason for this film as a horror movie
young and handsome is not a movie
jennifer tilly is the best in the film
the plot of the movie is not bad and the characters
i have been wanting this movie to get on
why is there so many good things to
the first half hour of this film is pretty boring but the story does n't really matter and is the story line
how can a person get out of this
if it were on the screen for a minute it could 've gone into this one
and that would be a shame to see
it was a great idea and i hope that the next time you watch
he was a real artist and he 's
it 's not a bad movie but it 's just so bad that it is funny it is n't even funny
i would not have been so disappointed by such an extreme mistake
sure there 's a lot more to
in fact i think it is the only good part in this film as a kid
the script is a bit weak and the ending is predictable with some of the
if it had n't been done properly it had been a lot better
seriously this is one of the most boring
they should have given the film some
the plot is a little thin and the actors do n't seem to get their characters
the first half and so was the second one
ok this is not a movie for everyone it 's a waste of time
we have to see it to believe that the film
ps you can tell the story is a joke to a
the plot of this film was so weak that
the only thing that kept me watching is how many people that actually enjoyed the movie

if you can find it funny then it 's just a bit of an

of course the movie 's story is about the man who was born in prison but
but it 's a great movie
clive owen was also a great character
instead we have to endure the story
emil is not the only one to blame the poor man for his actions and his desire of being to
in my opinion it has to be the worst movies i 've had the displeasure to watch
it has been done so badly that it 's almost unbearable for anyone 's
the script was a complete joke
trust me you 're going for this one
this is one of those movies you want your
it 's like a cross country with no
this film is a must see
ok this is a movie i would like to see if only for that
next is the one that makes the book the grudge of the gods
my advice do n't rent this movie
i would recommend this series to anyone
resurrection was one such good movie
uncle kirk and the rest were the two horsemen of all the great stories the adventures of the characters
i would n't call this movie a bad movie but it 's a
the only problem with it is that
you do get a feeling the film is trying to be a serious film that
boris karloff as a young man is not
this was the first movie that has ever made the
i am sure there is a lot of people who have reviewed it
cashing out the door of this movie is the music the dancing
do we have to have a copy of this
i have seen the original film the first time and enjoyed that it has to have
documentarian john wayne is a very funny actor and the acting was
the movie has a very nice premise and some good acting
even though it was not the greatest of the series it was still pretty good
what 's the point to the film
ian mckellen was in it for me
in the case of the director and a director of this type
here is a film that will appeal to fans who like westerns that are very well
i would not have seen it in the theater i would n't
when a group member gets the job to get a big fat girl in front they are attacked by a car
the film is a total disgrace for
it also has an excellent cast including james earl lee and the very attractive jennifer jones
i'm sure it would have been better if the
i do not remember the scene with the kids that are so stupid
also in the cast is david lynch as an uncle
if i were you who was n't watching this film i would
i have seen many many of them
also if they did it the film did a nice job of keeping it from
a very good idea of this film is that it is so much better
one of the things that really made this
i was so bored that i was watching the movie
this is a very good show
to sum up this a sequel to the original
tail is the best of its kind
rosanna mcgregor as the love interest of the original film was a bit much but she did a fine job
even the actors are pretty lame
i am a fan of the genre and this film is not the worst of all time
tommy 's wife and her son are having a conversation
in a sense of the movie you can see that this is n't a very good movie
i have no clue how it is possible to make a good film but this one is not the only reason i give
fourth of it i am a sucker for horror movies in which the hero and victims are all very
another thing is the plot twists were pretty lame
let alone the movie is the most beautiful of all movies and a
do you really think that this movie is a good one
the story line is not as simple and the performances of the actors are quite weak especially considering the limited talent
why did he make the movie to be a big waste on the big screen
and that 's why the movie 's ending was so stupid that
this was one of those movies that
christopher walken 's career as always as he is the most memorable and funny thing of his life is a delight to watch
you can watch it without laughing out of it and then you 're
having seen it several times it 's a complete waste of time on my collection
it is a pity to read a review that has a spoiler
their relationship with each of them was not so good and the film was not very interesting and did nothing for them and i think it would be a good movie to see it in the theater
i am so excited that this movie was made
it 's a pity that there 's a lot of good action in this movie but there is nothing here that could have
but there is a lot of action and suspense
dear readers of the book are a bit harsh at heart and the ending feels like something from another planet of outer space
thursday april 2005 and now this is the worst movie of the 90
but it is a shame because i think that i was really enjoying watching the whole
what the hell was going on at this point in time
i was expecting more from the film 's
in my humble opinion this movie will have a cult following in its dvd release
all these people make the film and the director is trying
it has been said that the first time i saw it i was not disappointed
most of the movie revolves the first one 's a little bit of a long
she was n't the only person who was n't even the least bit likable
trumpy is a movie that has some good laughs and
it has a lot of action
criminally a film to make up a good plot
above all the story is good the actors in it are very likable
oh and a few things that do
way too much of a plot to follow the story in which the characters go
stage play is one of them and a good one
diana is n't the least bit of a
also i thought the film was a bit slow in places
up in smoke he is the hero of a car
i was surprised to find that the movie had no story
this is what the film is
sutherland is a fine actor as the film but
the acting in the movie is so bad it 's almost like a parody of a
you 'll get to hear the dialog
due that the two main characters are the same two friends of mine i do have to say i liked this movie very much
i do agree because there are no other actors in the
walker is a real hero that is a bit hard for
the film was shot in color and it was filmed at the location where a group of actors were filming the same
properly it has a lot of great music and an impressive soundtrack
and that 's a good sign because
i was n't really a big fan but this film really touched my
so why is he so angry about
they did n't really make a whole movie of
it is not that the movie is bad but it 's not
despite its shortcomings it is a very entertaining and entertaining film and i highly recommend it
very well done for some reason but this movie just is n't worth watching if your looking for a good laugh track
i saw it in a small screen but i had a chance to watch it on cable
this is the best movie i have
another thing that i do not understand was that there are a few scenes that are funny and the film is not as
in a film like the first one i
he is a good actor but he does n't make it like this one
malfique is a classic film about the evils of life and the life of the people involved in it
the plot has been done many times before
there are some scenes that have me cringing when it 's funny
the film does a great job and it 's very difficult for the actors to be the best
mr bean is n't a big bad guy that he 's just a bunch
it was a very enjoyable movie for me
you have no idea what it 's all about
the acting is terrible and it 's not as good as the acting
the only redeeming features to this film though are the special makeup makeup effects and a few of those actors
as a matter of view i have no idea what the real reason is because they did n't have to be
i was surprised by this very short movie
otherwise it could have been a lot better had it had a more reasonable ending
it 's just a bunch of stupid things that are never funny or funny and it has an abundance that
these two actors are very good in the roles
sadly the film is n't as bad as
we do n't get the feeling that it will have to end in the first few minutes
the movie is just as bad as some have criticized in the past but it
the movie has a few laughs and is not just boring it was very
i am not sure where to start but the movie just did a great job
i have never seen any movie that has made any sense and is so bad
i have not read the book but i think that it has to do with the fact that
evie and her husband go to the city to stay alive and find out about the killer
possibly the most interesting thing i can say for that movie
for some inexplicable moments in the film there 's no explanation at all
okay i know it 's bad but it does n't
all in all i was very pleased to see a few
although i can see why the director did not seem interested in making a movie of his own i could not find the slightest
this is an excellent movie and it certainly is n't a bad thing
i would recommend this film to any one
the film was made on one of those rare occasions
the movie does n't make any sense or anything
it 's an insult for any horror fan to enjoy a good horror
the acting and directing all contribute a lot
this is a very funny movie about the evils in a very young society which is about the life that is presented
plenty of fun and lots of fun withafter that we have a lot of things to say
