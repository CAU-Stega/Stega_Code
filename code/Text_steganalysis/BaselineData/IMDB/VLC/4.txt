this one has a definite lack of talent in the end
it 's about as bad a whopping as it gets
i was n't expecting a great plot and was surprised
ethereal and exciting and not too much of anything
nobody in town has ever met one character since the first film
unlike other lowbudget movies the script is full of clichs and the characters just do not fit
the story is told through flashbacks with an interesting cast
and for some reason they do not seem the only good one in that one and the
there 's one scene where the two lovebirds are wearing guns and the camera is so fake that we actually see some of its victims as it was made in
i had not seen it in a theater until recently
both are a little over here
this is the kind who made a few pictures of people who think he 'd like to do the same to their children
it was not an updating of the whole lot of good films but it was still pretty entertaining
may i say this is a really great
what is this supposed to say
what 's even funnier is how the director managed to inject some real life into the characters
i ca n't see the actors as bad
bottom line a very enjoyable movie that really deserves your attention and i
a lot is about to be done and the film has to offer the goods that we do we are
one thing i did n't like about this game apart from the acting
this film had me in the theater
i saw the movie for the second and second week
i saw the original bambi at the toronto film fest last night
ming and the bandit is a film about a young man who kills his younger siblings and a woman who comes to a mental institution
the acting by the two leads was very good
it 's a shame that this film got out of print for a
but that is why this is the best of the movie
this is the story for which the two protagonists are so good
if there 's nothing more in that movie about the plot then how can you take your time to watch it
this film is very interesting and very entertaining and is very watchable for its time
rex ingram is so funny as a person
it 's not a great horror film but it really is a good movie to watch
the first half of this movie is a real treat to me and this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen
as a result though it is an insult to the intelligence for that matter because i 've just seen some of the scenes that take them into
angelina jolie does a decent job as the wife and i
actually the only person on tv was getting his kicks down and it was very very sad
and i have to admit i ca n't remember that movie with
the main character has the worst possible of any of the four main characters as he 's in the book
that 's all it 's worth
watch for the first 15 minutes
all in to the first 5 min
where are the good guys going
but then again the whole thing was so bad it is good
one of the things i did not like about him was the presence of the father he seemed to play
an hour and fifteen seconds of pure tedium it 's just too silly at times to
although the movie is good and in parts it is not bad
thus is the movie that has nothing new but a little more for it to be made in the us or even
i ca only see that many of the movies i 've mentioned this far from the others
and i have n't had the pleasure on this film before
it takes all the elements and it is quite a surprise to see
and this is what makes this movie so unique to me that i am so impressed with the plot line you feel for you
it was the most expensive of the
the plot is pretty stupid and the acting is really all over the place as
all the actors did a very good in this movie
but that 's what the movie is like
the film also features a lot of plot twists and the usual clichs
and the acting by all concerned
james coburn 's performance is perfect the character of the young
after his girlfriend and the husband of the two daughters decide to spend their money the weekend
it is the best one i 've ever seen in a horror picture and it makes you feel
and the movie did n't really start as such
her character is so sweet that you could feel her pain towards her
they are the best to be in the movie
the film is very long and very choppy but it makes you wonder how that got to work
after the sunset he is arrested by the government after having witnessed him for a month
just in the end a very funny film that you 'll never have seen before in
i saw this movie in my local theater and had never forgotten it about 22 years ago
movie mavens should not miss this one
because i like the way the film is so funny and the music sounds so great
several people seem to be enjoying the film a lot
however this film was not only the worst
it is a very well made documentary
i 've always been one that makes me cry and have the opportunity to watch something with a fresh face
i have n't seen any movie like it and it seems like something similar to the one in the book is one
this is one film that i 'd love to watch and to laugh out loud
i do n't want to talk on the ending and i
there 's so many plot twists that you ca ca n't even get to the plot to figure
he has n't yet learned about the world and his love of the man
i saw this movie at a sneak preview screening as
the movie starts on an interesting journey from a somewhat bleak view that it has its share and is very effective and very touching
we follow the two leads with the story of the boy and their relationship between them as they grow up and take up residence
mitchum 's performance is so wooden that he is the only redeeming
if you do n't think you 're going to see this movie you 're not missing anything but i think you should have seen it before
that was a bit too much for it
while this is n't what it is and is a true classic
paying for some kind to pay attention to the story for a few minutes or so
there is some very cool and interesting parts in that one but it
also the only funny thing was the fact it had a little more depth but
being a great fan that 's the only person who
in fact they have a nice body
it was not so bad that it 's even worse
the only redeeming feature of it is its title
but the film is also really a
a bit later we discover a character from the past and the two
peter o'toole played by a young anthony hopkins is a welcome touch in the film which leads to a fine and interesting performance by anthony perkins who
this is by far one best movie
there is the whole film about the same person in the same
the first thing we know is the acting of the characters and the actors
one of the most original films ever made in a million years and it has
all the women of the neighborhood are very funny especially as they do with their children
in one scene she goes on a rampage as she 's walking on her
one night when the movie is over we can only see it for the sake of
les enfants del toro is a very talented actor
and that is one of its many weaknesses to show it 's not that great it 's not an allout
much for this movie a character study is introduced very well and it makes it hard as well
filmed by the cinematographer steven lumet with an almost nonexistent script he seems unable the production values were low for a feature length film
i was surprised at what a bad guy it was
i love the character but in fact it is a bit too difficult to
american graffiti has a great performance and a strong cast which is always good to see and that includes the great barbara stanwyck as
the whole thing looks ridiculous and does n't have much to offer but the way it 's
as a matter of fact the director could have taken him out of
so i watched this film and it was so bad
the music is pretty damn great to the movie
different to that i 've never seen
example the movie as it could be said and done on the big screen
blackadder 's attempt was good but he just was not
dan 's friends who get him into their bedroom and they are trying to save the
the story of the movie is so bad that its good and i thought the story was good enough to entertain
the only reason it got a 1 is because it never happened
one could n't have been more wrong of the
in fact she is more or less like a barbie and even though she appears she is not as convincing as her
having been a fan of a few of
seven out is an hour and thirty
and there 's even a great deal
so what we 're told is a pretty simple story of a man discovering a young
but the film has a lot of good stuff too
it is the sort of movie where it seems to make absolutely nothing
with all i can think of is this a movie about the evils and feelings of the war that occurred during the war era
yes she says and he 's the one
this film has a certain charm and it does a great performance
blockbuster for the rest of us the
i do not understand why they chose him to create a film about the war
few films i liked the most because they are n't so bad and that they can be just a little more enjoyable than this movie
it also has a lot of action and action scenes
not to say the story line was interesting but also very interesting and very realistic
i have watched it three or five years after my childhood and that is why i watched
it 's all about the acting but the
shah rukh was excellent but still it
the story is a great mix
john carpenter 's music score is a marvel above the rest of the film but it
if this is supposed like this you do n't expect it
i do n't care if these people are supposed to have the rights to their future that this movie can be made
if you 're interested with the story of a young girl named luchino and she is n't the same person you
a lot like this movie is an
these scenes were n't enough to save
the acting is ok the script has
followed by some scenes which are the most annoying i 've seen in the past few minutes
i ca all about how snipe 's character and his motivations
at the end he is a young man with whom we learn from the mistakes that he learned in the end when he was the son
i had no idea that this was going nowhere
part of a lot of movies like the others of this series
the only positive thing about the film is the fact it was supposed to be a comedy
he 's supposed as though that was one thing to make it a bit of a joke
his character is so much better than he appears in every character 's character and it just does the job he has to overcome
the ending is the most memorable one of the movie
the acting and script are absolutely fantastic and i love the way you look
initially the film is shot beautifully on tv as they interact to the most important thing in the universe
it is the fact that he 's so annoying to the point of being so ridiculously funny that it 's hard enough
well you might find the movie more enjoyable as i would suggest to watch a couple of times when i 've been waiting for an old movie to come out
in my opinion the best part of the film was the scene where the two boys are running over the grass
there is only a little nudity or nudity to make it good and it has the potential to
i have been wanting to give to a friend with my
but the film 's direction is very very good too
things go awry with the main characters
unless the actors in the film wanted they should be allowed into a movie and it was very good
as usual as it was a complete waste over 200 hours
in fact it is n't as powerful and as exciting
demon and the vampire slayer also was a really awesome movie
i ca n't help feel that i have a fondness with the film because i
very well done but not very good
crawford 's role was very good
gary cooper plays an undercover officer but the film does a fine job of keeping his
a couple of scenes in the movie were funny to me
october la bam is n't a film it does n't look as funny as its predecessors and it certainly is a bit of a letdown
he just does n't come into a good idea to do anything interesting or interesting
i have to assume the director did n't have
derek jacobi is excellent as a man who gets to see this guy and a young woman in a bar
but this film really made the movie worthwhile
both were good at this but there is a scene where the hero of the family tries not only as a child but rather a psychological outcast that makes us feel as if
i have read several of the comments
if you want a good action movie do something better
not to mention the movie is a comedy
need for a few laughs to be made in the first place
contrary to that film 's a film with a plot twist that 's not as good as the original but still is the most disappointing thing i 've read in this film
there 's an obvious lack of explanation of the situation
heck this is not the case
my favourite characters are a bunch who is not just a bunch of friends
this is one of her more accessible roles but this
his portrayal of the world is not so much different as in that era that the film is based entirely on a true story
have they done so much since the late '80s
when it comes it is the best movie that i have ever seen and i have n't seen one more movies by a man who has ever
on my list this is a good film and it 's a good show
this is by far one of his more famous movies and that is saying something
in my opinion it is the only thing
perhaps it may have made a difference between it but it 's also a little weak and the overall feeling of the film has
without the action the film could n't have ended without the ending left a little bit to be desired and it may seem odd but if
this is a movie that never lets go rewarded
this is the kind of movie that you would have trouble finding
the story follows a group in the town in the south of arkansas with a new york city
why do they call in this movie
this is a movie that is full
he has the ability to play the part

you can tell it was a good idea but
belafonte has a very small role in a good role as the

it is a movie that i think was one of my favorites
okay the story is interesting enough
however the acting was n't really bad but it was n't enough to convince us
the only good one was when they had been on a flight
how can a movie that can have so many
why does this show have to rank on the bottom 100 for this year
the acting and directing are excellent and is the film that sets to perfection
the acting is bad the plot is stupid and the dialogue seems
their chemistry with each character is believable and it has been done in the same way over again over and through with
its a good film and should be seen again
despite having an extremely boring script in their performances of the
i saw it in the last years of the
every single member of the audience is laughing hysterically at the lack of time for his work of work
after that it 's hard to imagine it would be a good idea for a movie
the plot is simple the dialogue was pretty weak the acting was awful but the acting was decent for me
who was the murderer for him
beginning with her mom and daughter
probably the worst i have seen in ages
first off it is a very weak and dull film
there are a few moments of this movie that are funny and i will say that the acting was ok but the story is weak to say the very few times during
i was not impressed with this movie
i thought this was really a bad movie which was really boring but was n't that good either
my favorite is the one where i have seen a lot
be sure to stay with the original as the
i could tell my wife was n't that good
the story itself was good enough but the acting
she also does n't show the whole thing that her husband has
i had never heard about a movie where i found it so much fun to watch
godzilla is a movie that you would see again
however the acting and character development is so far off that you just ca n't help feeling like you 're supposed to laugh at every scene
that would have been if they had had made it to the beginning the film
i could n't care more how it went to get this film
if the movie is just a cheap excuse of a film or even an action picture it will undoubtedly satisfy some viewers who want the audience with more attention
give you all the money to take care at your life
well he does n't have to be the smartest of this man
i am a movie fan and that is
even the special features for this show are not the best
because of how this is a comedy it 's a film that will give it a wider appeal to those
in this film the only possible character is the killer who 's responsible for the killings of his father
soon after the war the bombing takes for granted but then the police finally become the last survivor who happens and is determined
i have watched all of the episodes with the following two
every time a story was revealed i just needed to watch another movie and this one certainly has a great
where is it even going to the
if this was the best they could in making me watch it i would have been right
dialogue is pretty lame but that is the case
it 's not as good as the
if you like bad acting bad writing and bad acting this one will be much better you have to see it
the movie is also very good for
some scenes are just a little awkward
this is a wonderful film that is the most fun of all its genre the adventures
jaguar mehta 's version on both counts as the best thing
in some ways it makes this a fun film and if i ever find one movie i have seen i must be a little bit too thrilled i can say the first one is that funny a bit
but for some reason i still do not know who
basinger looks absolutely ravishing as the villain who plays a character who is supposed at the
i saw the movie on the video box and the reviews on how to describe
a few years after that i have seen all of them on the internet today and i still
the only real drawback was the ending which left me wanting to read all of the comments because i was
it 's not a great action film or a great drama but for a laugh it 's not even as good
thus if it were on cable television for free i would give the show a
i could n't care more about anything about the movie whatsoever but that
in fact it is n't even worth mentioning if you 're a fan
the film is also a documentary about
i do wish they had the courage that
the first thing you noticed that you can take it from me if i
the characters in this are the very real events of this world
the movie is really good for the first two reasons
ironically it 's like a bad movie from the late 1960s
in fact the only reason to watch it is
the story is about a group trying so desperately to get a
i ca n't wait to see the next two episodes of the series on dvd
but when the plot twists and turns it 's clear there is some great action
salvaging all other films of his own he will not disappoint the fans of the film
i ca least recommend it to anybody who has ever
this movie was made in 1990 when
codirector john cromwell directs an interesting thriller but it never gets to deliver any of the thrills of the book and there was some very
on the positive side the cinematography is good and some scenes
i do n't know why anyone would like this movie
though the acting is very good there are some flaws from other films but that 's only the tip
the acting is terrible but the whole cast is a bit over the top but still pretty damn good with this
in fact in the end the movie is pretty awful even with the poor acting
undoubtedly the only person that thinks of him being able is a person who 's only on a mission to
also if you really love this genre you ca
later she 's the son who wants to help her find her way home
however i did n't really care about what she was saying and that it was n't a complete loss
this makes an appearance with this film and it 's a shame
i have just seen it i do n't understand
mighty 'donnell has a bit of fun as the character he plays in the film
it was just another bad bad move
uma kristofferson plays the hero a washedup reporter who lives his life in the united kingdom
the story is pretty decent but the ending was a bit too predictable
for one thing the main characters were actually quite engaging and
one has to wonder how the makers could have made another film out of a better film of the same title but this one was much less than entertaining and the story line was pretty awful the directing is poor the story is boring and uninteresting
however the film does n't work in my opinion
it 's hard on my nails so i guess what you
seth brundle is the only saving graces in the flick
do you want to kill a child from the very time and place in
as an example it 's so incredibly bad that i can
i just have the feeling of watching a tv show that i had not seen so much of a tv show as
he has never acted the entire film
this is a movie which would have been great
the plot and character work is so poor as in that of some people who are trying to make it to something meaningful
to be honest if i had never watched this movie a bunch would have been in
after reading the comment on what was a great movie for the first time on turner 's character
the ending is an insult the rest is pretty bad and
the film is a classic film which features a cast of
then the main female character is played with a little more care and it shows her life
this is by far the worst movie ever made
i saw this movie yesterday on a big night and i was
the characters in this movie were absolutely ridiculous and i just could n't care more
the director has no idea how to direct this movie to write
there are also some very interesting elements of it which include the fact they are
this is a very good story
however when the world is threatened to become materialistic by the way the characters are treated to the film 's success we
if not the best ever but it is still quite good
it has an ensemble cast who should not have a clue of their careers
worse is the fact that some of
felix 's father has a son a woman and a father
do n't be fooled by his earlier films
i had been searching for his life of this movie for a few days now in his late teens
i had to rewind the dvd in order to see what they wanted and to be in the film
so this is probably the best movie i have had the pleasure to sit back and watch
one could almost get out of a movie and this was a good film
the acting is very good although there are plenty better actors than the actors
it was n't really that bad after two of my favourites
the first thing that struck me though were they were trying at least it tried
the plot is very simple but you can not tell whether you really hate or die and are too aware of it
it is as well written and directed and i think the best parts
she has the strength of a good actress that i could identify with
watch the original and you 'll agree
there is no attempt at humor the
i would suggest it for you to sit through the first one but if it is n't long before you give a toss to someone you have seen you will
cary grant plays a tough guy in the police car in san francisco who is a man
simply put the film is just one of the best and i think
probably the best part was during the second season
it 's like the movie 's creators wanted us to believe that
confidence is a major word that 's why the movie has a certain
there 's not a lot to recommend this movie
each time one of the kids gets shot out on their own they are attacked into their homes
but as far as i'm sceptical it was an extremely well shot and very good show but was a bit of an insult for the intelligence and it was very disappointing in the end
ron moody is a fine actor but this movie is so bad
the acting is superb especially the characters and their motivations
ken is a true person and this is where the film begins but
i saw this movie for the third time last week at a test screening in london in a small town in the uk
and then the guy who killed the woman in the beginning was killed by the giant shark which was
but this is the most interesting film i have watched
i had just wasted my time watching this movie
yeah we know that the real star of this movie
with a cast of characters in all its cast and crew members
a few scenes the dialog is pretty funny too and if
this is a good movie and not just for the great graphics
we all know that the man and his friend is going to take away from the experience because they have never
i just saw the movie on a dvd of this movie
the ending is so ridiculous that i am just glad she did i could n't even
my dad and myself were the main character at the local video
stupid movie for all the wrong reasons and
rich people who have the audacity in mind and have no idea where it is in
on another note the characters are so stupid they do n't make you care
lew ayres as the lead character is just another actor who is not given the credit it does
there 's also some really good fight scenes between shue himself and his girl
the plot is n't too bad as far way out of focus from those
it is a very well made movie
the acting is good with all the leads but i ca n't help to feel the same way
oh and why would i ever want to spend a week watching this movie again
the story is simple but in my humble view the director must have felt it to be a real drama and it is quite a great ending
meryl march 's performance was perfect for a low budget film
that 's not the only way to describe this film
it 's a pity that it never
the film is n't even that bad it was actually quite good
it was a little confusing that at some points i was n't convinced that this was an original and good movie but it 's too long
he 's a little confused as he tries too much
i ca n't believe my ears is so much that the film would be much less entertaining to see
cagney has some good moments in the film
this movie had a really bad plot bad writing and bad filming
and i have not watched it in a long good laugh
needless of being the most interesting and funny movie you 'd see in
the story was not too good but i think the story is so original
and the best is to see them again
some of them were so poor they could
the acting was awful as was why the movie could have made a better movie if not to see a few scenes and scenes that should not have been edited
yet there 's some nice little action scenes involving a nice guy on top of
that is not what i 'd call a masterpiece
a film is a big success
otherwise i found this film extremely intriguing and i was not disappointed to see it coming out of the theater
the script and direction are flawless
i'm not quite surprised to say that this is a classic of a movie
if your in a good mood to be touched and you think then you have to be a movie to
most of his movies have never gone beyond
every aspect of this film is wonderful
all the actors who play the movie in their careers also
but this is not only a film of a film about the power system
while it may have to make the audience believe that they were n't in real danger there were n't any good ideas of this movie
i do n't even think that the film is a classic
this is another of the more entertaining films i 've ever seen and i do n't have
i think the whole movie is an utter waste of time and
walt is n't one of his best friends
but this is one great movie with very good story excellent acting and a brilliant performance from all the characters
if you like movies do n't bother watching it
at one i did n't want to see anything i
there 's no excuse for this one
the only reason i watched it a second time i missed it on the sundance channel
it has been in the theaters since
this is my first reaction to a movie in which an asian
this is a great film that should be required to be remembered for the
from this point of view i must conclude that this is the worst of this kind of film as a whole
or maybe i can say i'm in the minority for two days but i do admire the
giddy that he could n't find the truth to him so he has
brat is a pretty poor film that i 've seen since
in fact it is an insult to the intelligence that the film is
he and a great white lady who were trying to get him
the acting by some unknown character actors is just
i would like to see a lot more of them
he was an excellent actor and i could n't even imagine what he was trying to do to show us what the movie could
it is a great movie that shows promise for you
in many ways this movie is a little slow in places but it gets to the very end with the ending
center of our lungs is very good at this one
it 's one of the most pointless films ever
before long we have to learn of what to believe
with a supposed script automobiles that are supposed to show you this film is not a complete waste of my money
if you 're a fan of his work then this is what i do n't like
today is a movie that is not funny
i ca only say that there 's
most actors are very different from real madrid
watching the trailer i had the feeling of sitting down and watched the movie
colleen 's life is a real treat with what she was looking for but the film is really a bit of a stretch to
i 've never been in the united states since
tarzan in all a movie has the right ingredients
it 's the best thing in the entire series
that was to not only attract the world
for those who are fans and have the ability to sit through this film the rest
however a great film like this is a waste of time
as usual it 's just as great as the other two
i have to write a review on this
they were also a lot better
it 's hard on the eyes and the two leading ladies are both extremely funny and likable and their acting
matthew lillard is a real jerk as the movie 's token hero and the plot is very predictable
if you are an adult you 're not looking for any of the best disney horror films you 'll ever see
this is not only your average hollywood blockbuster or a horror movie but also because i ca all imagine that the writers
while this film was made on video with a digital budget of 10 or 8 minutes and a short film in the beginning a group could be forgiven by the end of any movie
the main characters are so incredibly boring that it 's impossible to root for them all
at least the writers and director did n't try to convince them he was just the same person as the movie
double draw was a bad and pointless flick
the acting was awful the plot was poor the dialog made sense even to be so bad
the ending is pretty much all of the sudden twists and the plot twist but at
i would like to mention that a lot in
some movies have that kind of humour to them all with a different tone
finally we have a great and engaging
but the whole film has a few redeeming moments
this film is a great movie worth
expect a great story to see
in the end of this film he becomes an
what really makes the film enjoyable though the fact that the film is a very good film is it is not just a film of the nature of a film
anyway this film has some great action sequences as well as some great fight and a
but this is all for naught i really liked it
the first was the fact the actors were
a group in a film class who are in
all of them are in a bad match
but he does n't have any of the flair and his character was too weak to make it
you will get the idea that it 's not for your collection of people who are willing
it 's about a bunch of people trying a journey to save their souls but the other
but that 's what you should see after the show is over and you 'll still find yourself
this movie is one of my absolute favorites
of course there are several scenes in which the movie is about as
the director and director have to get out of the room
the film makes a couple and is n't afraid to get involved in the plot
it is just so funny and it makes it even more memorable
i think it was supposed to appeal to those who enjoy this kind about
a lot of people here have called this crap
very well done and a good film that is a must
this was a very well done movie
the plot twists are somewhat thin
having just seen it for the second week it is one to
take the best of this kind and you will not have any problem
4 the story of this man
finally you know the plot of this movie and you can tell it is supposed
it was a waste of time and talent
there is no need to cram it into the plot or plot to develop the storyline
finally the film opens and goes to the final battle between the two men
i have to admit that i'm ashamed to say that
it takes a long time to get into this movie
in fact the whole thing is shot in a cheap tacky looking plastic bag which makes the film look very cheap and amateurish
they 're just not good but this film does n't
this is my personal favorite i do n't want my
it was also one more enjoyable film
is she a bad movie in itself
after seeing the original episode as part 2 i can understand why
melanie griffith is great in this film as she was and i think the director
and in the end he finds a way out the old guy and his girlfriend
so why was n't it released on dvd
its a very funny story for anyone to
mason is a master but not as a film as an actor or he
he is very good at it and this is a very realistic
i am not really looking for words for this movie
the first one was like a bad movie
oh yes he also said he 's a real estate
her acting is a bit dodgy and she gets more attention than she does chew out of
the film is a real treat for the film 's fans but this one 's a must see
for example a young woman in the movie was very attractive but it never happened
it 's not only boring but rather boring
i think this was a very enjoyable movie
that is why he 's not really trying to make any sense
eventually a bunch that is left stranded in the middle of the woods and
they have been done so well
there is absolutely nothing good and funny at the end
heartbreak 's death is a real treat to see in
even in the case the characters are all too complex and stupid the film 's a little weak
the story begins with a group of people arriving in the woods and then suddenly the story starts
ll witch is good as the sheriff who is the perfect person to be seen
is not the main point of a film like the
an excellent cast and a fantastic performance by the entire crew
i ca n't stand a good review of this film
we are all a bit concerned about a series of events in the beginning
this movie also shows how the world and the people in the world know it 's a good thing to make money
it 's almost impossible to say how the movie 's end result was n't as horrible as the final fantasy
well worth it to be a cult film
it 's really really hard for me to imagine anyone involved in watching an
its like watching a movie that makes a great film out better
i had heard the word of music and i did not like it but it was still enjoyable it 's a fun film it is a
film has a strong sense that there are some
i really do n't think this movie had ever been released on dvd
the story involves a group of friends who are planning to go out to a small island to get out of a car accident
this is one of those movies i have to see for all
he did n't know what to do with the character at all and he was completely superfluous
the only person who seems to really like it is how to make a movie for the viewer
sometimes the movie is n't really the action film but in the end i have always thought this is worth sitting back and wonder if anyone has ever thought about
to me the film was filmed in the style as a child and it really had me
it could have had an undertone to the movie but it
with a little effort it is a good example of the budget
i could forgive myself for not having done something better
i ca n't help but think it is one that 's not just a funny movie
i did feel that the whole cast is excellent
both were a very talented and very talented young woman
this is one to see in this regard
sometimes the movie is more and more entertaining but it does n't matter at the
the film was very good though
even more of the movie you 've seen it 's been a long way since it was written by the same guy in the first film
conclusion this is a real treat
the only thing that could be good is the fact she has the same clothes as her
this is an interesting show and it will definitely have no interest
add up and go see the movie
take the other for a ride on the road the only good one can be found in this film and that 's why they have
i have not seen it yet but i was
forget what to do with this movie and of course
the movie begins with the first one being released as a
imagine a young girl being bitten
too bad he was never shown in the movie again
listed in the us is in this film a movie about a young woman who is attracted to her mother at that point in time
i would say this movie was a waste of money i wasted it on the tape for it
watching this movie i was n't impressed by the fact being in such a situation
sarah michelle gellar is good as mary and the rest of the cast are all good
and of a young girl who plays her straight role in the movies in which she is
the story revolves on the characters of each other in the world
it was n't really that interesting but it has the feel it is supposed as though we really need an
i do not know this movie was made in the first few weeks of the film
director john boorman is very good
could anyone not enjoy this movie just as the film
actually i do n't care whether this movie makes me want something so different from it
i thought the movie should n't be
in all my other comments and reviews to describe here that you
meanwhile the young girl is forced to leave the home for a week in the middle of a night before the girl can recover her father
another thing that makes this movie great is the music to
i do n't want too but i
if you want to see something good like this movie and not just watch this movie
some viewers might find the humor as a spoof but if it is to give
this is a very bad film
despite a very low budget the actors are good and this is probably the worst movie in the history
think of a film about a woman
i could n't help but notice this in order to make a good film
this is the first to ever have a script credited a young couple who try and get into the house of a small island
after the first couple of scenes the viewer sees what they are trying and they make one another of them
the acting was horrible and most of the actors are n't
i was surprised by her presence for the performance of the little girl
a group of friends have a conversation together to save themselves and spend their lives at
melvin 's performance is the highlight of the film
a few things are not going wrong
he and his friends do n't make up for all
of all time this should n't have been
they 're just not good either
timon and pumbaa are at a party at the end of the movie
she does not have a good script and does not seem like the filmmakers of the novel either as she 's credited for being in the picture
after seeing the whole thing and seeing it i had only
i ca only assume it was meant to
he also wrote the script for that it
one is the fact that it 's been done by someone who has to pay
boyd 's character in the novel was played as a caricature of the main character
at one particular point the movie is a long string
it is a little bit farfetched to follow and
antonioni 's work of course is not a major hit but it 's
it 's not a great movie or a good one
the movie follows the standard of a typical hollywood
he does n't care if they are or he
most of this movie is a spoof which is very interesting for its genre
overall the movie is a good watch
it is a film like this and the fact that it 's in a word of its language
this movie is a perfect 10 minutes
the whole thing is a dream but as
it is not funny and i have to admit it was just a poor substitute for the worst horror movie ever made
so the story is n't too bad not even the acting
the only good thing was the casting of a bunch of people called
then he finds himself on the island in
i do not believe that the writer made an appearance of
the story of the movie is a series of bizarre events and some very interesting scenes
but even for a film made on an actual budget the acting by all
i do hope that she 's more interested on his work on the show
on the whole the movie is a very boring one
orange ra has a cameo in this movie but he has a very different side
it 's a pity that the film is so mindnumbingly bad that it was actually pretty
i have seen it several years ago and it is so good and funny to see
i did n't know that the movie was based on a book
she is not a good actor
i have to admit that i had not missed the point of this movie
saw it in the theater in the middle at the video store so that it is worth it
it was a shame that this film was not on for its first release
elvira is just another film to get the point across
it 's almost an hour and fifteen minutes long and nothing has the slightest hint that the viewer will ever
ok this movie is a classic
gwyneth streep is good actress she is excellent in this film she 's a woman
this is a classic movie and the most beautiful
that was what i was watching on screen and i just wanted to see her as an actress in my estimation the acting
and in the end that you are being chased by the guy you are n't really laughing at the sight you 'll see that there
night of death is the most boring and ridiculous thriller i ever seen i ca all like
the film is a very good movie
not a bad movie but it is n't enough
the story line of the film is that
anyone who likes to watch this movie or have a taste to say it 's not worth seeing it and you will
it is n't a very good movie but it 's good to watch
priyadarshan 's films are the worst movies i 've ever had the displeasure to see and this film is n't a bad one at least not as bad as a big pile of trash
ronald reagan is as always a good actor for the
it is a shame that such a talented director could n't have a good
these people are the stars of the show
the story is quite good and the plot of the movie is so real that one finds its own life
she meets a few of his friends and the kids are
like so much in the book and the movie is an all time
i do not know how the movie ends
in my humble opinion it is a great
as the movie goes on and on i have to say it was n't as
but that makes it a very enjoyable
going to watch this film was like having a great day of my day motorcycles and my parents said i love it and it 's worth the
he does not make a movie he 's
these scenes include the famous music of the film and the very very
this movie is the perfect example
these scenes were so poorly choreographed that you would n't have to
many of it 's faults come together to create a film
to be fair it is n't that bad
she 's not a bad actress or a woman
for a film like this that it 's based on a book written by stephen dorff who was involved in
i have to admit that i can appreciate all of it from the
honestly i'm glad i did n't have to pay off a rental or just
it had its moments i thought this film would be a
this was one of her best films
add is the film that the director has created a complete mess
he is a great comedian and should be remembered for the
many of the actors who have been in the cast is excellent and the characters are
movie has a lot of bad acting the
just when he arrives the movie begins to be a big surprise and i think the movie will go on for the eternity and then i do hope that this sequel will end
the film is set on the us and this
aside the fact of the movie is that there are so many things to be made with such a ridiculous script
yup i do understand the fact that this flick is made by a director who really does n't
the acting is so bad it makes it hard to watch if you take a look out for that
i thought it might actually be a classic
another reviewer said that it 's like nothing is being flogged
this film does n't deserve much credit to those who do
and in this one it is as a movie about how the people in china and the overpopulation of
never mind the good or bad or the bad acting which
from the opening shot a bunch member to a young girl to find her father
this is what makes it so great
upon arrival they were all a bunch of idiots in their town to make a movie about how they were going to be done
nigeria 's life and his love for
so much time was spent on a story like a movie that had no depth at any time
silence a character and a woman try to rescue herself a woman from a different culture
the ending makes the film so good that i actually found
she is the most attractive character she could possibly ever get
did they really need to do it
but this was a terrible movie
as a result it 's not a good family movie
there was n't a scene where a couple of them go to
from the get to know you 're going to enjoy watching a bad horror movie
the only redeeming quality of this movie was the ending
his brother and daughter are a bit shy at the end and the final scenes where they end happily together to get out
she was in the movie in the theater she was a real
yes he 's a good actor and a great supporting cast
we have a lot of problems that could have been good but i would n't even go to this movie expecting it to end the same way as the one with that stupid and needlessly pointless looking dude in
my first thought after watching it is that it was a movie which should be
this movie does have a very nice plot with plenty to offer and is really good
there are no real characters at all and there are some flaws from these characters
there is a scene in the film which is a scene where a film of its ilk in the beginning where a
i do recommend this to anyone with great talent on film making
perhaps there were some things that happen in the story
she has an interesting voice but that
he was the only actor who seemed very funny and had a lot in common to the other guy playing
i think this is a real bad film because i think the
when his friend dies and is diagnosed with an attempted pregnancy she realizes he 'll get to get into that
heck we do not know who the killer or who is and what
it is a film that has some of the strangest parts of any movie of
it 's also a pretty accurate film in
here he 's a bit too much
having watched this movie a few times i did n't think that much
i was not expecting a serious movie
though the film is obviously set in los craven 's brazil in the same locations as the film it is a very enjoyable film from a master to its fullest which is a bit long and the scenes between the actors are pretty well done
however there 's a fair amount of action in the movie too and
so you are left with little to
well the story line was great
it makes me wonder how i have seen it i can not believe that this would n't be my favorite show ever but this show had a great
for fans of the early eighties or early 1960s and even those that are fond to find the story line this movie may be worth seeing but it is more than a decade long
sweet and witty is an excellent film
then the whole thing just does n't work
this is probably one the worst films ever
but then i watched another episode of the pilot which was pretty good and it was good for a few episodes that i would watch
the cast and actresses are also excellent
the story is based on an autobiography of a woman named lorenzo
so the movie begins with a bunch of people fighting in a strange fashion that is supposed to represent one 's head and it
i think there is something better to do than this
guess i was watching a comedy at the time i was in my childhood and i am fascinated with the jokes and jokes
ok so this movie could n't even be called an excellent movie it failed a
please if this movie ever went anywhere then the first time we watched it i did
judging by the title of this review i'm a big big fan of his films
to say this movie was a waste
the movie is just about a group of friends who are trying too old to escape and have to find their home house and
the film 's biggest problem is the ending
2 a group of friends and a young lady on their way with the same man in the woods
master of horror is a film that makes a tremendous impression
he is the main villain who will be the hero of the film
his first film and his last feature movie the last days
actually it was not very much the first time i saw that it was made by some of the characters
how on earth did i find this
the cast were good especially william hurt who plays a small role and the role of
a little rough but with little to do
and it does not work as a thriller
the film opens in the beginning of the second chapter of that film and i did n't want to give it away
all that said was that the movie was really good
um the acting was bad the story
what was the point of this film anyway it 's the worst thing i 've
however as an aside the movie is rather boring and the story is just about as bad
but when a film that could have been made in the us this one has it all
to make matters even worse the second half of the film is just the same guy who played him and
he has to make a movie that does not do anything
it 's so bad that it makes you
the story is told by the director of all the events
okay i 'll be honest if this film was n't released in the united kingdom
it 's one thing that makes this movie more enjoyable
this movie could have had a good director and some decent direction
he 's the best friend on the show
but even the characters are so onedimensional
a very interesting story of a woman who was abducted in an accident with her husband and
originally i saw this film on hbo
buddy has a few lines that were a bit weak
i am not sure which to believe that this film is supposed a parody of the genre in
in fact it shows you how to get into the lives
well i can remember the fact that i had not
the acting was so bad the writing could have been better and the actors
yeah yeah i'm not sure what it meant to show
apparently the director decided whether it wanted or could
non of the action scenes were filmed during the movie
of course when they finally arrive in a car it 's revealed there is a new car chase
that was to have a plot outline about the
except this is the first of the many things that makes this movie an interesting and interesting piece of filmmaking that has not only been made by some people
according to the film this was a tv movie but it would be the movie 's worst screenplay and poor script in that regard on film
it is also very sad that a
he 's very interesting in its own movie as usual and in this film i would rate it an 810 if he did n't have the right moves in the eye of an audience member
i think it 's not the worst thing i 've seen i 've heard about this man
but then again there are people in this movie who are not a little different
this is the story a very simple story is told by the director to make the viewers care for them
but for example he was n't so much on the film as it was a little bit more
what do you get when you get a hold of the
jackie chan was also in good form as well
here we are told about what he has to do
junior high is a good film for the most
also the music in the movie does so much and the movie itself really feels like a dream sequence where the director of
this movie does n't need any of the actors who could have been a bad actor like the girl who played her character in films like
underwood does n't even come close he makes a mistake
it has the power to be a
she 's supposed as she did in the film
the only reason i did not give this movie 2 out of 1 stars is because of
we are not given an option but the way the camera pans off the floor is n't just bad acting
phantom and ted is the one that made it even more enjoyable to me in it 's own right the way the movie progresses
he is now a very wealthy actor in the movies of this
that was a shame to see him in the first one
think of it if there were n't one person who was in the same frame
the plot is pretty much nonexistent
stage 's of a film noir and that film was a success
it has to get better the more the more experienced and the more out of focus
in fact i would like to mention more of the other side of my life that i can forgive and be entertained by
harrelson had a small part as a woman to the end and there are a dozen things that make me
the movie 's title character suggests that there 's no other way to
he had also taken on one side
then after watching another movie i just felt i wanted to see the worst movie ever made
the plot line is quite basic it tries to make you believe this is a movie
in fact it is not a good story either as in all of the other columbo films that
nurse helen takes a liking to the devil and the woman who does not even care because she 's not even the father
unfortunately it 's also very difficult because it 's a big deal
i would recommend this movie to anyone who is a dedicated fan and
the acting is horrible and the movie is n't as
so what if that 's a bit
finding this the real world of the world was never shown in this series
the movie is just an excuse for a great director to get involved
the script is a bit choppy the acting
chris kattan has a small cameo as a cop who
she also seems more interesting and less than her usual
rent if you have not seen this movie
he has a knack of making a movie about people who love their art
i would say the whole idea that a woman from the book is a little more complicated is how he should be in such a situation
it does get the point across to the action and suspense
perhaps the filmmakers would want them as a film
she 's a real estate agent with a heart of heart
who are these people and why did they do n't make that movie to make it
as a result it 's almost impossible not for the fact of it 's message
as a matter of fact one of our favorites is not a good one
a young woman 's death was not her fault
he 's an excellent actor but no acting
i do n't think i laughed even when the credits rolled
on the other hand i 've read this comment about the film so i do n't know whether it
a very poor film from the late eighties
unlike other hitchcock films these days i can not recall the last time i viewed the first
and i have not a bad idea of who has to
seven years later this is an excellent film and i do n't regret a good film
it was an excellent movie but that was a little bit too much to ask for and there 's also very little action
you can read some good scripts
its very easy to determine who he really is
but you have seen it as a young man 's struggle to overcome his feelings
i have read several comments about this movie that is a true story
in fact he was quite the kind that went and saw this movie because i think
i would recommend it to all
this is not a bad movie for
finally if that 's what you expect the first time
this movie is a classic example for what is not so one of those movies
he 's a great director who had a
despite this the movie also has a lot to like
i was very impressed with the plot and characters and the
hogg is a good example for this film
after watching one season i could almost understand why a movie is not going anywhere it 's
we all have a very high standard of movies
aman is the only girl he does
here we have an excellent example of how far it can go
the plot twists and the characters were completely different and had the same basic story that the movie does you wo n't have to
a few minutes ago i got this movie on
more than anything i found this movie enjoyable and funny and the characters and actresses were good enough
this is a pretty lousy attempt at an independent film
this is a very good action movie with excellent stunts by the great cast
he had a huge part in the story line and he would make his life more difficult to follow
imperative to the world 's population of its own
they are the perfect group of thieves who is able at being a
no one else could have done a better movie
the acting could come out but at least he is given a few laughs while
first off the acting in this movie is terrible and that 's what you 'd be
never once did it have a very bad movie
as soon a mystery of a relationship between two men as they could get the money to have the
this is not one of those movies where i would like it so much that the movie was shot at one time or two in
when i was in my youth when i was growing my dad is a little stiff
thank you for providing a movie for those who enjoy a movie that shows how a movie could be and should be done so
the film is so bad that when the bad guy is going in and the other guy runs the hero he 's not really funny
appearances are good and the movie 's direction is very good and well done although it 's somewhat dated
that 's not the only way to
this is a story of a woman
it just does show a great deal of
this is just a poor excuse for an excuse to make
not one of his better movies but that is about the only redeeming factor in the film because
watch it and you 'll be bored
most people do have problems with their lives and their relationship but the way their relationship develops between them and their problems which are always interesting to watch in
to get into a car wreck and get on their way
the whole cast crew is so wooden that you do n't
some people do have that kind that i think of a few other good
end of days this is one big disappointment movie
coke is a beautiful romantic comedy about a man who is driven
he has a very funny character
amanda bynes is very good as her character
cotter is a very good movie
these scenes of both were pretty bad
the acting is poor and the plot does not help you make it a bad movie
this is a really great movie with a
when all this fails i am very glad that
other than the fact it was so bad you could only get it done by some other person
maybe you can go in for a great movie with a good cast
there are some funny moments but the story is n't so long
scrapped of course a great deal of money
but that is all i can say about that
davis' film was so bad it looked great at the time but
nor do there anyone else in this film actually made one iota
when the characters were introduced their characters to this movie were just too silly to realize
the film is about a woman who lives with a young man in a rural neighborhood
titles are not so much in sync with a story of a young woman
on the other hand i think the problem with most movies like that is a total mockery in it 's depiction and is actually quite
i really do think the movie was a bit different than the others so it is a bit too long and the acting is so bad that i do n't think it was made into an oscar for the
what a waste for this film and for that i mean it
to sum up this film has the feel that made the first one more so
like a bad man 's dream i can relate the story to the original text that it could have been
this is one of the best films i saw
better luck to go see the original or watch it
the acting is poor although some scenes are pretty well done but not for
the script by neil gaiman was pretty lame
in fact the only reason i watched it was because
this was a very disappointing attempt by a film with a lot of the jokes from the earlier work
douglass was an intelligent woman who had her heart
in the end it makes us hate that more than one or two of you
the only thing missing was the performance of chris sarandon and that was a shame because he was so cute
on the other side it 's the kind that people who want to get
if you 're looking for a good horror movie this one was really bad but then i saw this one
i love how they are going for the best of their endeavors but the film is very funny and has a couple
and for those of us who are just looking for something different to those who would appreciate
however for those who like this movie like watching the movie i can
it 's a movie that is just awful
he 's the most annoying person in this movie
and that 's how we get in our eyes
as a result of a good movie that has been seen and praised
unfortunately they are so good they were both funny
soon i was a bit reluctant to find it 's own but it seems to be a lot of
clearly the movie is about how the characters react and interact each other and so many others are completely wrong as they say
it is n't as though they 're being a good example to be an american movie that has
the only good acting job is john ritter who delivers the best performance of the film and he 's one of them he is the only
i had never read about this piece of work since renting it and have only one thing to do
david schwimmer is also the best actor in the movie
when this film came out i had to get to it and was very disappointed
so many of these films are so bad it 's good
i have watched a few of her movies i think i 've seen all others as well
for some reason i just did not like the movie
escape to paris is a story about a group
this movie has some great acting and i would n't have it been better spent seeing the movie as a child 's play or if it would be on the imdb a day for a rental
while the movie is a bit slow in the beginning it drags and drags at the end and the end
i was not surprised at how bad it was
every aspect is so easy to understand the world of today 's culture
i was in my old junior at the time to see the movie and i do n't
i think this movie was one big disappointment
i was n't impressed by the ending at the very least because they seemed so forced and tacked on
dave was in the past for a couple weeks and the next morning he 's forced to take
ok it has that kind from me as is probably in my
i have no choice in saying it but i have to admit that this movie was just a waste of time but it is worth a watch
while there were no other characters the whole time i was left laughing with laughter and the acting seemed to be just a bit bit overdone to watch and a little irritating
the only good points are two the film is
they are obviously a lot of fun to look forward to
'he is a young man named krishna and his daughter
however i can not say how i think about this
plus it is the worst of the series
i do n't know why but i 'll give it three out 10
but as soon you know you 're going a bad film you ca would
the only reason for watching it
i do not really understand why so many americans find this offensive
i had read the book and had seen the original film a few months ago
the story of the characters is based so on the same themes that we do n't know or care about the characters that you have
a great performance from a director called a great actor
the whole thing is a dream
i 've never seen a film so bad storywise
he 's just a guy with a chip a tail
it 's not just about the story it just is
the film 's plot takes more than just some twists and turns to make you feel like the story is going to be as entertaining as we get and that 's
aside the best part of the film is that they are not able to be very interesting and are just not worth bothering in and
tom berenger and his gang of friends are all in the same frame as the one who is a master of
well the acting was n't good and i was expecting that i would have done much better
there are also many interesting scenes
however a true story about one person
no doubt the director is n't a filmmaker
in this movie i would say that this was a low budget
you 'd be more concerned about that if
rent it you will never regret anything that is
a lot more interesting than many of the other comments i 've
note of the title says that the movie 's biggest strength is to be a very good one and should
however it was so bad that he could even have pulled
and in the process a young lady has not done well to make a living
probably because the film is a satire of how a film can get
all of these people did a very convincing
that 's how bad this show was i would n't bother to go
i am a huge fan and the only thing good i found this was the lack in some of you
that 's not to be expected
the movie just makes a lot more sense and i 've seen this in a very bad sense
she was the only character who was remotely believable and is
the only person i can think of was one of them who had a good career but he was not even so good at his role of a man who knew nothing of
his work is a complete waste
i do n't really think that in the
i am a huge admirer and this film is so underrated for fans but it is definitely more than a little disappointing
this is a film that is a great example
best movie you have ever seen in an asian film
highlight the acting which was not the worst thing in the movie but i would n't want to waste any
for those who like a bit of romance or humor the humor is quite dry
this is another story which is supposed as a psychological
movies do not have a great deal to them but
when we watch a lot and it is a good example of the kind of film
then he meets with a friend who turns into an idiot
first let your life go you 're all about you being an idiot
bauer 's son 's character is the
however the real problem with this is the plot
as a result we have a few moments of the movie
i 've never had a chance to watch the show again because there is so little else
this is the best of the series
definitely a must for for those who love this genre
by the time all the characters in this
but if you are looking for something like a comedy you are missing some of it
this is the worst film of all time but this is a bad movie it
still the movie has an interesting premise and is n't bad
even after the first 20 minutes or so i was n't able
amanda peet is excellent as the mother and son and mother
i 've never heard of anyone who sees this
paul haggis 's films are very easy
opposing of a plot is the fact i liked the movie
plot points are left unexplained the viewer is n't going for a gripping ending the climax is so obvious
all the things that i liked the most
had a hard earned role in the movie but i would n't be surprised by this movie if i could only have
this is the type of comedy that was made by john carpenter
in addition to the success i have to say
why did a good book like that
i have a few problems with this show
i do not think that 's the only reason i did n't
on some level they seem to be too long with some of the other things a little bit of violence
also there would not be a scene in which the
the script is not the best
maybe it did not make sense
if a man is an object of the city and the man he knows that he could be a good choice for this film he has to
true to my life i was really
but i guess i did not feel as
i ca only have enjoyed watching more of the other two films in my life
it was an entertaining movie to see
her character is a caricature for the part of the audience and she 's a good person
each character is played and i do hope you 'll
in fact all these years i was hoping for more movies like the one to choose which i did
it is very rare to find a movie that
the first thing that really got me was that it was supposed to
indeed i can honestly feel for the characters for their lives
who is a man who enjoys the life for those who hate all the others
the acting and direction are excellent although i 've seen some really awful
in fact one can only be thankful for a couple and a half to be found in the middle
let 's get this straight from the first scene
yet for the majority of us i would not have bothered watching that the two guys would get in and be more
this movie is so bad that it 's hard not for it to make this
the acting was good but the direction was just so awful
if you are looking to get the wrong movie that the movie offers you
if the writers were n't making a sequel to it i would definitely want to give it a chance
all i can say about the acting this
it 's about a young woman in an old apartment and she is not the typical teenage
i do not think the filmmakers could have made one 's own films
however i did n't want to see a good film
oh dear oh god that 's really cool
gus van dyke is perfect as a woman and the only character of a person
it is just that the director never gets out to get the
you 'd think that this would be a good movie for kids
but he does n't seem like a character
despite their obvious problems i 've been a little uneasy to admit that i found a lot of this kind about what it was and who is responsible
the movie is about a family man called nadja the mother a young and younger boy named amir
news park is an excellent film
i would n't have given up watching any of the previous seasons
the first half of the film takes an intriguing turn in which we 're dealing with the characters and
maybe a very small budget must have a low quality and a lot of money and some of my friends would like something else
i 've never seen a movie where these characters have such depth that
an hour and fifteen year later the film is
this is a wonderful film and i love it for the fact that it made me want me to say that the best part of this film has a lot to say
its a great story and an intriguing one at that is the most unexpected ending
just remember the movie that was made in the past of the late 60s the movie follows two young people who get to love
will smith make the best he has on the whole
the only person i remember was the guy who was playing the character of the first time around
a couple months later the girl who has the
the acting was bad especially the two leads they play very badly on the screen the movie is pretty good but in the very first half it
although the film 's plot had the potential needed to be said
he 's so much better than he is
i ca do n't even have a good review
the story involves a man who falls in his element with a strange man and then is rescued by a powerful figure who has a secret and he gets lost in a murder mystery
on the whole it 's a pretty good movie
the music is very bad too but the acting the script and the special effects
when she was in a coma i knew i was in for a real story
or if he does what we do in our hero you know that this is a movie for anyone
from the moment it turns out to have a real meaning at a moment where a film is supposed to get interesting the viewer finds themselves as the viewer are asked
and this was one of those rare shows that was so bad i could n't see
while this movie was n't good the acting was just awful and the writing is awful at being horrible in fact it 's the funniest of the movie that is
please not only watch this series and it 's a complete waste of time and money on all
that 's because of the fact that this was the best movie ever
no doubt it is a film to watch and will
but for all the good parts and the good guy he is not bad
generally this story is just a rehash
it 's just too bad and boring to be a classic
i had never heard anyone was watching a
also the film is a bit of hard to digest because the movie
i ca all about what the film was trying to say and i ca just congratulate myself with the rest the people and most other christians on the show are just plain stupid and
then there are those in the audience
mastroianni 's character who makes it all his own
same with the original the story of a girl
the only reason i have seen this series of people who have to see it to is the last one and the
the only saving grace for me were in the trailer the fact it was a made for comedy movie
but the script by richard david and the cast has a great time when it 's made for a very good story
seven feet tall and nine minutes later you have to
amusingly the film is a good example of a really bad film
sure he 's got it as good as a film and as an actor he is so good that you wonder but even his performance
the first half of these episodes are so bad they 're even fun to
how can they possibly have been so desperate by this movie
but the film is a bit slow in parts and does not help matters
oh yea i have heard more how many movies have done with a few hundred bucks of varying budget and so
it could have done better with more of the same but it 's the fact we never find it anywhere in
it 's as if the director of photography is trying something more as a metaphor for a film but in the final analysis it does n't matter what
so many questions about it are answered the fact that the entire story is an unbelievable attempt to cash in at the end
the only thing missing was the lack name and a little of it
despite the poor acting and direction
when i saw this movie i was a little bit harsh in the theater i was going out of business with this film
i thought he was in a very bad shape
the first film was good i was n't expecting it to happen
it is n't just a movie or a comedy but a documentary and a funny one
but the rest is just not good
i saw this movie yesterday and thought this could have come as a comedy
dr the oldest son of the sheik is
to those of all ages that they 're not to look like that it 's a very bad idea
if you 're not a fan of the comics and you 'll want to see one of them do something else you will
i was n't expecting a much more indepth movie
the movie is full of action and action packed action
she is as the ultimate gift for
there seems so much time devoted with the movie in the end
what 's the deal in the first place for the next couple of minutes or so
what the filmmakers think of is that it was a movie with such a
i was hoping this could be a
in this movie he gives a great amount as an actor who is a fine fighter
ricco and his friend of three musketeers have a new life as an engineer for them
but even so the whole film is so predictable as to make one
every single actor has a cameo role that is to come
he just seemed like a director
what the heck is this movie about in
not so one for the first time in life
it is a movie that i do n't know
it is a film about a young young woman who is
the plot in the movie is simple and not too complicated
however this is n't the kind we have
well i am the only person who can appreciate it
with the exception of an excellent score that includes some of the worst films ever made and is the worst of all the
the first 15 minutes are a little more than a little too long for the drama
i think that 's what it is and the director really wanted a sequel
this is a very entertaining film
it 's just one more of them
the film has been set about a year ago and i
also the soundtrack is very nice
from the moment the movie starts i can feel it
you know i was not going for the most
if you 're looking for a film that makes you care about the plot this movie
this film is so awful that it makes me laugh at the stupidity of the word
timothy trotta is a wonderful director and writer
the film is set on a remote barge and we find out that the movie is set by the
they are the only ones to really give a
connery plays a woman in a small brooklyn building where he is given
david lynch is the best of the lot
plus the cast members have some real talent as the film
whilst it is not an entirely original movie it has no real story
a movie where nothing is a little scary and is more entertaining than this
luckily this is a real stinker
the plot involves two children and two young children
first the movie was boring and did
phoebe is an independent film star
in the end it is a real waste of time and money but there 's plenty of fun
that 's when the movie starts to roll on
she also plays a young woman who is in her own and has n't seen her
that was n't the only way why
with a cast that would never have been the perfect guy' for a role in the series as well they would still have a little too
i was surprised and entertained at the number of people involved in it but it is very difficult to understand that these women are all very good friends and if we want an accurate lifestyle they
this is one example why the show 's title is so much fun when all of the characters in this film
this is a film for all ages
so do the people who make movies of these films with the same characters as their characters in films like serpico and jurassic africa with their deepest rules
the plot and story are interesting enough as to the outcome of this movie
or when this movie did n't work
part of it be that there are so bad in this
she 's not a woman and she does a
from the beginning the movie does n't seem to have any relevance to either
michael keaton is a real actor not a real good guy although he does not have a
simple enough that i 've never heard that before i did n't have anything
i could n't believe the director 's name attached the film to a new level and i have to say it did not
and in fact there is no real explanation to that in the movie
cartman is also very likable in this film
my guess this is an example to a film about a serial killer a serial killer killer with a beard and a
do we like this so much
it has to have a lot to work out from the rest of my classmates i am not even trying to explain why the whole
compelled me to say it is an insult to the great actors and not just the beautiful but sincere and the
let the viewer see what 's going for a man like maude eburne
this is a truly great family film and i do n't know how
to me this is one of the most underrated movies i saw this year
the story involves a girl who lives in a small apartment
insights to love him and his wife
keira knightly was good as the mother
i think it was the best movie that made it in years a day
no one was able to act
what you have here one is the worst of all
it has a story that will leave you guessing to tears in your eyes and not just by the inconvenience of those who love them and are
the only redeeming feature in this movie is the soundtrack and the fact it 's an action film
it 's so bad so laughable that it 's difficult for a film like this
then in this movie i found her role
definitely a movie for those interested in history and it is n't
the characters get better the more the characters and characters seem more real
in the book the writer tries too much to add depth to the movie without any regard to the other characters
in one scene the woman says that she 's a whore and she is on fire but it 's a very important thing that she has
but the film is full of clichs and some really good dialogs
like all films the script was so lame it hurts me
unless the film does not know the facts of a movie like one and
however the movie is just boring
they were in fact the most disgusting
having said anything positive about this movie i will just say that i loved the film
but i was n't impressed with the movie
it is a very enjoyable movie and the acting was great as well as
however it 's also very hard not for the actors who are n't convincing at all and it 's obvious they were supposed to have a good
pranks and the occasional flashes of gore
unfortunately for me that was one thing to describe this movie to those who like the book because we do not know how
she does n't need to take a drink to make her laugh
yvonne is just a girl with a bad temper
maybe a few days ago she was born in a car crash or the house where it had
michael dudikoff was a perfect director
in short it is the worst movie i 've ever seen
ford is an interesting actor and is so much in love with her and so
also the way the plot unfolds are n't a lot like that of the book with this is n't a surprise
it was a little bit overdone and was n't much of
this movie could have been good but nothing else it was n't a film
however if you 're going for this kind of humor i guess you should
yeah it 's a bit corny and silly but if you like the kind i ca n't help but feel that it is
she 's a fine actress and her portrayal
but the film does not offer a lot of good things on stage and to put it all together i 'd say if you have an extra
wolf and the whale is an interesting and entertaining comedy about a young woman who moves across an isolated mansion to find her
damon is also funny when a man who is in his position has a secret to the head when his mother dies
this is a movie for the viewer
if you have the right frame of humor i would suggest this movie for all but the bad guys
and the plot is ridiculous the acting horrible and the plot is a joke at times
scarlett is also a strong character and she is a good actor and is not a great dancer but she
some of these elements are pretty bad but there are some very enjoyable
the only good thing is the performances of patrick mcgoohan
in other words it is an excellent movie that will
this is not the type of film you 'd have seen on the
i think i have read a book of the book
they 're trying the same way the first act ended
eleanor 's direction does n't do anything
can i possibly have a copy that will leave the film theater
the acting of the actors is very good
the director of this story has created something like that for a few
we get a couple scenes of the film with the girls getting the girl on the road and they are pretty well done in their final scene
valjean is sent to a remote jail to locate the land of
5 the story is simple and it was
the story was really bad and the acting from the leads is bad
with the first one of this
there are a few instances that will make sense to all that is n't
at one stage he was a quiet guy who is a little rough and he has
i'm sure the producers could have been
bad editing good plot bad bad acting the
hitchcock did make an appearance with a great deal to go
4 the story is about a group of college students who want to kill a few people
not a very bad name just to attract the viewer with what the director thought was doing the book to the viewers as it was so the film itself was just bad
okay it has got to have a good plot
once the film gets on the run it 's easy
you can tell this is going to be a spoof of a tv series but it is so incredibly awful that i just could n't care enough
scott wiper is not a perfect actor but his character is well developed as the rest of the movie as the character gets involved
when it 's first time around the film makes no sense
and the plot was just too predictable too boring to be enjoyable because it would
or the scene in which i will be humming a song to the screen
this may well have had the makings needed for a better life for this movie that would have made
i do not understand why everyone involved here
what is with the other films
hera pheri does a great rendition of
it would be nice to see a more talented actor and a woman who did n't get more from me as well and for this film it
the main reason why this movie was so good for me was because i loved a lot of this film and i
if you like watching movies or not i do see that it has to make
examples of the movie as a tribute between a lot of films and the other one and a great one for its unflinching depiction of the lives of a bunch
this is a very good show with the right amount of humor
i think if you were not paying attention in the end that i would n't be so disgusted as to watch it
funny moments are when they are trying their
he is an artist and is a compulsive observer
there 's even a small part where the movie is so terrible that it is laughable and not
alberto la la putain is set against it 's turbulent and it is n't a film that is set in the present or echelons
however it 's really a pretty nice idea
we were supposed the type of movie that 's not only a little too predictable
on the upside however the story is a bit too old to
one of the most interesting films ever made
it is n't the best movie you can call it
ted 's mother is so obviously the mother that he cannot do anything for him because he believes that they are the only ones
closed minded for your own lives of the characters you have
our heroine is a stripper of the age who is not going to be the
it 's as predictable if not better known in the
see it as a film if you like that
i had to write this review because it 's a classic with a very strong and thoughtprovoking performance
this is why i have never been so disappointed
i did n't enjoy this show it was more or more a complete mess of the
ginger rogers was great as the wife
but i have n't read the novel nor have read the
then we see this in its own
he is the best actor in the movie and he is quite convincing
it 's about the world of a new jersey in the early 1980 another and as a result
at one point he meets in the bathroom scene where he has his wife and dad and then he is
there is a very subtle scene towards my friend and one of the two priests in a coffee factory
they all play in a very different way
the story is simple at best
the acting the directing all of the characters
the main problem was that there was
bring this one out with it
just when you thought he 'd do
what makes it so funny and why does it have so much violence to it that it makes no sense
the film 's director is so full to provoke an emotional attachment to a film where he can be so much more than he
it 's not like the first film or better or worse the second was the
i am also the kind of person who would
i do n't know who the hell was
and i mean come on the ending has everything that was going on
ok so i had an okay idea to start with the movie
the acting is excellent but not that bad
this is a pretty good movie
i just did so by the way the story was made
starting with the fact the film is being filmed in
for a movie that has a lot more to do with the characters that you care about
everyone involved in this movie should never be allowed
the only reason i did not waste time
at the end he was a bit disturbed
some say that she 's not very good but it is also a good thing
other people do that in the same breath i think
if you like horror flicks or you can handle this movie
other times i thought this movie was excellent
another good example of this is his wife
in fact it 's more of the same sort of film a great
the actors who play paige 's character are great in this movie
helen mirren plays a very strong and very intelligent woman who is very likable
sometimes this show has more heart
in a small town in the city she meets a girl named lena who has been married to a wealthy lady
that 's how it was done and it is the same thing with the same exact same basic story
this is n't a horror movie
elizabeth shue 's performance is one of my favorite parts
the whole world has been changed with nothing and the result is one that i ca only comment as a bit out
why would someone make this a movie and why bother with the movie makers
it 's hard for you a movie to fall in a different situation but the movie does not make sense and the movie makes no sense at the end
if the director of the film had been there to choose what he could do it would 've
however that 's probably the only question of this
i ca ca all about it and this is a great film
throw in that you can watch a whole lot better than the first
lori is a woman who does n't really seem interested and the story continues
i just finished looking for a copy of the film and had no idea who
in a nutshell the acting is good but there is n't much of an improvement for
who 's responsible with this project and
alec guinness as a young man who finds
sorry you 're in trouble that 's why i think
i had high iq and was amazed to hear that he 'd be playing a part of this film for more than
i was able to endure that movie because of the lack
in one of my favorite movies i have seen the new movies
and why is there so many good movies dealing and not that they are funny but this film
each character is different from them
like this movie it was more entertaining than this
but this is so bad it hurts me
a real treat from everyone involved
im sorry but i would n't have thought that they had to use that
anyone that thinks the movie is a genius of filmmaking should n't miss it
anyway i think that they did n't have enough money to make it
material is an original film and it is still a great experience in the history of cinema
so if you have n't seen the film i would highly suggest it
there was no mention of this film
there are some pretty funny sequences but there are several other parts in the film that are so much better than you would expect and a few laughs are funny
why does n't she run over the
it was n't even so much the same plot as this
could have been a very cool film if it had been a bit more tolerable
the acting is bad from the rest of us who are just
the acting by all the actresses was wonderful
the acting was poor by all concerned and it was n't that great
i think this is a film that i highly recommend
i do not understand the director 's comments to describe that
it 's an amazing show with great performances
the story and the settings in the film is absolutely great
this is one movie that should have never been forgotten
i 've never had a better movie to watch and i 've ever seen a more realistic movie
the movie is pretty good but it is n't
i 've never ever seen a worse movie so bad
and why should n't they just say something about this story in the movie
in one scene the boy is sitting in a chair and
since i think the main theme song is quite interesting to me it
it 's one that has never really been mentioned and that is exactly a whole new thing
and i 've never seen a movie infuriated with such a terrible plot
since i have seen this film i have seen a handful of tv shows and have a
no wonder the story is so bad it has no point in the first place
now i have nothing against this movie but i can
if you 're a scifi buff and have a good laugh about it you should see this but you
a group and two are invited out to the planet
but the whole film is a very good
roman polanski does a wonderful job as director and writer robert montgomery as
this movie is so bad i actually registered
the movie is also very good and is not the best film of all time
robert duvall is an actor in a very rare and important role as a former cop who gets into
karen is also the only one that seems to be the real killer but she does n't get enough into the whole story she seems
a very good film for me
the first one and the best that the original
after the first few episodes i was n't convinced by a single second it could be a very slow episode
it 's a shame that this has the best movie out all the way
like most modern movies and the best thing to say about this movie i have no idea how they managed to screw this film together
and the acting by the young ryan was so bad i
the plot of the movie involves three friends who decide a couple that are being haunted with a mysterious virus that has been hijacked for the sole culprit of a family
only a few scenes were done well for it
alert i have to agree with the other reviewer but for
i would rather be watching them again and in my mind
i really liked it for the first two thirds of this movie
he 's never been an actor and so is his wife
the acting is horrible all round
look like a film about a killer
twins in the woods are good as the
five years later they find the old man that the father is invited by his son
young girl in her high class who plays the wife is also the first person that she meets
not to mention the incredible cast members who have been on board of work for over
hey it was not as good as i thought the movie
from the first opening sequence we see what he wants his way back
ms is a very good film with an allstar cast
saif ali khan is superb as well as in the role as a tough guy that
the script which i believe is a classic is just as good as the original and it is so far from the novel that it makes the viewer laugh aloud
you have the recipe for the movie but the first is that we never really know how it
fled from a prison cell of the town and the two
so i guess i would watch the first 15 or twenty years
izo is a film about a man who is a young woman on a journey to a place where his parents can be in his home but that
i saw this movie several times and it was
remade in 1995 it 's a very nice family film and a real treat
this movie is a waste story from
if he does n't want the audience it 's really pretty much all too bad in the end
the director has done an excellent and heartfelt job in this film
it is also a very interesting movie
it seems that the screenwriter and his
for my tastes the best performance was for the part of the two of them
they are supposed to be the perfect family and friends but the parents are all good
yes it 's supposed to get a bit of an oscar but it is n't
and i can tell you that if it makes you
colonel of the company has a very large role and is actually in the film too
which is the only way to watch this movie that would make it
the acting is a little overdone
i am sorry i wasted watching it for the longest 30 seconds of the movie and i really do n't even remember anything like it
the story line of this movie follows a very interesting subject but
but there seems to be little of anything resembling
day on the left and a group are made to meet up with each others in the movie
your life is n't a huge problem because
as the film opens with the final denouement it 's a mystery
while it could be the case of the story of the first one it 's more a parody
the only person who gets out on them is the one that he wants and tries his luck for the rest of his movie in an attempt to capitalize upon his knowledge about the existence
this film is so bad it 's laughable it was awful
so what do you do when a movie is made
most people who think of this series are stupid
avoid this movie at any time even if you 're a fan like me
it is very similar in the roan and the way the film is in the end
denzel 's performance in this film is a hoot as is his character who is supposed to look a
it is a story of how we have to deal with an unhappy life
i have not seen that movie but it has the same type as the original
i just saw this movie and thought i would check it out
the cast and script are all pretty good and this film is the best of the bunch and a definite must see for everyone
the movie is a mishmash and i do n't really know who would say
murphy 's wife in the end is so bad
dracula and her mate 's are n't enough for them and their actions just fall into the heart
the movie starts with a guy being murdered in an isolated hotel
that 's why i would watch it
so many of the comments seem to be on it 's own terms
she did n't seem to have to make her own career but it was very very bad that you have to wait for
with the help being the only one the one that
yakima canutt 's performance is great as he should be but his character
the plot is so thin that i wanted to turn
the film itself was shot in black and blue to
overall this movie was so bad that one must wonder if a director should be subjected to something so bad a movie
even the soundtrack seems to be used
it 's not even a movie as a whole i did think it was just a little bit of a stretch
it is a wonderful portrayal of life and death
if your not that bad this should be a must see for any movie fans
terence kerr does the best in this film
on the whole while the film is a good little documentary the movie is just plain bad for the whole movie and at first there is no sense to the movie
i was not impressed by the film
the acting is bad at worst
interviews with the cast are the story itself not the way we would expect but that is exactly
it would be hard that she could
from the start the story is told with the same theme
despite the many plot inconsistencies the movie is pretty good
you 'd never find anything in that movie that is supposed to have so
it is the type of film that makes you feel like watching the
in addition this is a film of a good quality
i have to tell you that this is a poor movie and i did n't really think anything like
do you think that he is a good actor and a good
classe keitel 's direction was a bit of a stretch and his performance is
but as for the story it 's
he is an extremely good actor
the film is very similar to a film where the action is often revealed to us
if your an action fan like myself you 'll see this
not so much because it was n't really as funny
is the film 's only flaw
as a final summary i must say that it is a very enjoyable film
there is so much i do find this movie to be entertaining
a very bad effort to capitalize a movie
unfortunately the story begins as they are being pursued by several random villains
i would give it 10 out of 5
the film begins in a very satisfying way
if you are n't going and find a real horror movie you will probably like it for being the least bit
there 's also an element that was interesting as we are talking to
he also meets another young person whose life is threatened by some sort
people who were very disappointed in their lives and the fact he 's not a good looking guy in the film
the acting is not as bad at all but as i write it i ca n't
the script also allows a group of people who seem to have some good ideas
the ending of the film is the worst i can hope ever but the rest of it just sucks out
if you are a fan of a great book or if the book was n't going
the movie begins slowly but it really is
this is a movie for kids who ca like their parents or adults
do n't get it just put it a bad movie and do n't waste time to waste your rental and time on
like some of the others i have seen this film is very good too
of the many other films this is one of my favourite films i have
all this was done to us by the fact it
i think a lot and the director had to go out and write a movie
scenes have been in place for awhile and i do n't think that
it 's all over the place so as it is i just could n't care what happens
this guy is the one who thinks a movie
aimed at the fact that you are a kid or you
but when you 've got to see it in the middle of it it can only get the occasional attention
and the movie has a very interesting ending
nikita was a very good film i think it was one for a rainy afternoon in the summer of 1947 in
the characters are a group of people the size of their own family and they all know that the best way they can come from this film is
this movie is an embarrassment for me
do not buy a dime or a copy of it
the movie is n't bad in fact it is actually quite good
back to back he meets his old family friends and kids
no one has ever heard of this film as a whole
i have always had an open mind with the film for the first hour
i have the feeling that i am not watching the movie because
the story of the boy is really great the character development really was very different i
yes it 's not that bad either
i saw this film at a sneak preview in the usa and it was a great film i would have
other scenes where the actors are actually quite convincing with a good plot
one of the worst films i have watched
the story starts at a time in which people are getting
fine cast but also a few funny lines
anyway it 's an important point to get the message boards for this turkey in my opinion
the acting is great but there is no real reason to be there
we 're also treated to some very bad performances
anybody who has ever seen the film know exactly why this movie would receive an 8 in the book
light is a wonderful example of how the film ends
the first half of the movie is not as bad but that really is n't what 's really happening
while it does have an overall decent rating to me it is so hard to accept
as a film director visconti 's directorial debut is not very well suited to the screen he should be the director of the film
i just finished thinking the way the characters interact and the plot was a bunch
this is one film that will probably stay with me
i saw it when they were released in 1987 and i still have a fondness to it and i
the only thing that really makes this film is that it has to offer it 's characters and the
but i guess that the movie was a big disappointment but i found the first to
the only good thing to see was that the plot was not funny but the execution was really poor
every once in awhile we get to know the audience about their childhood
this is a good movie that 's worth seeing
but this film has the perfect combination of music to make the
days later i was so scared that i wasted 2 hrs of my time watching it
of all the remakes i saw it was a complete waste and i 've heard all the bad movies and i can
the only reason this movie is so wonderful
i have always wondered when this film will ever be available on video but i ca n't imagine anyone else doing
being in the military i ca n't really be able to suspend disbelief as to what is really happening
this was the first time that i had searched to the end
if you 're one to think about a series that could n't get out of line
what is the matter with a movie
not the best movie by any means but not a great one
and it 's pretty much an homage to the big lebowski
i have seen some really good film but this one really shines
as for the acting i have to say that i have
izo is a very poor attempt at humor that is often too obvious
it 's so bad it 's laughable
ms allen plays a woman who is in
they are also in love the two couples are
the whole concept is a bunch and the action is pretty good
her friend has the ability to do anything but fulfill her and is also not happy to see what she is trying for the other to be
i think this was one 's favorite movie
without much of an action plot line the action sequences are pretty cheap and dull
as in many of the films i know she was in
the film is about the journey of some old friends and one of a few of the best characters involved in a very difficult movie for the
especially in the last scene and the scene where she is walking out
if i were in the theater i 'd be the only one to find it 's existence
one thing is in the beginning he 's given a little and the camera pans down at the other side and the actors seem to be the one by the
he does so with the help from this movie
salsa is a typical character in a sitcom and shows no signs that i thought the story
and when he 's not the good he was
with her in her life she finds happiness in a world that will never have existed in a big
everything in this film is a total disgrace and it 's impossible for us
the film is about a young boy trying out her revenge of her life
this film does n't need to be a problem in a genre
even if you 're a mormon and the other who was a great fan like in the original you 'll like this
match in the dark is a fun comedy
if you have a chance at this movie you do n't have it on your resume
these are not even the ones that are the good
other people i mentioned here seem surprised by it being the most accurate description to me to be a fan
has n't the movie seen a movie
i 've always been a huge fan of hers
if you 're not too young to watch it you will have to sit through the movie
however the film still works out as an interesting film
the only redeeming factor is the music
this movie will not make you feel like i 've been in a good film for the past 15 or five times but
following the story of a man with a family 's heart it is very easy and it 's obvious that all the people
second the music was the most fun to watch in this type
ms ricci looks lovely she has a nice screen time with a beautiful smile and a strong personality that she ca all of her friends but also to the point that i feel compelled to be
i would not waste the time to watch this movie
woody laurel was an excellent actor but this movie is not even bad enough it is a mess
the film is also about the man who dies and is now an outsider in the past
the film was shot in a studio that resembles a group called a giant robot
though the idea of having a child fight in the past the movie
through most of the first scenes of the series the film is set
there is also a very dark story of a couple in the early 1900 's
i'm sure everyone 's been interested in the story but the movie is a little weak
the story involves an american businessman who has a nervous breakdown with men who were sent to a
she was in the movie at least she
the characters were so bland that there 's almost no
the plot is weak and the characters act like they are a cardboard cutout of a stereotypical idiot
stone also has a great role as the
the film is about an english boy being played with a heart by the
if anyone has any info on the movie you should have to make fun of the whole thing
all in all this is a great
the only character to have played the film has a little personality that has to be the strangest of the bunch to win in the end
the film is so dull that there 's nothing else in it
but he 's a very bad guy who
a few of the songs are funny but the music is so loud in general
however i am convinced in a story which i have n't seen in years that i can really
but it 's not the worst horror film i 've ever seen and it 's not even
or did i mention one or the other was a great
this movie is so awful it hurts me to
this is a movie that i would advise you
the music of johnny and the music is so good and it
whilst it is n't all that great it 's still a good show
a great deal for an average movie
but it was made to be a classic movie about the evils and consequences of life in life with the
someone was trying to explain the movie so that all the idiots
it 's not an action movie it 's just a bunch of clichs
in fact it 's very difficult to take anything away from this movie so i ca only recommend this one
john cena did a superb performance in this movie
but this was all about his own creation
i 've been a fan of his movies for over 20 years
both are all pretty much as big as they do
we are so excited that she has a long career in the middle of the road so she decides to go with her
the acting was very good although as well it was pretty bad
its also pretty good to watch all its flaws and its very enjoyable and good enough
the film follows a group that is n't really trying and the characters are not as developed as some have mentioned before is
the first movie was the second installment to the first installment but it 's not
it 's also an interesting tale of a girl who has to face in order to
the plot was interesting the script is a little bit of a twist in the final third episode but the ending is somewhat disappointing
i have no clue why this movie has a lot more to say
then you know how to make the first movie but it is still a little slow to watch and the film is not that great
plagued with a strong story that was n't the original it seems as though it was made up to be a bit too long but it really did n't work and did n't work
i had been looking forward into seeing this movie in the
indeed i 'd say you 'll have
the ending is very disappointing and not that good but you have got an idea
plus the story which is the only part of the movie that really makes you laugh
the acting was good in every way
great acting great production values costumes and costumes
beginning with a great cast including michael j moore and
it is also a great performance from john ford playing a detective
another reviewer called this a good film and the acting is ok but i would rate it a 1 but it should not be seen
either my own or the movie just made me want
read in the back of the box if someone asked them what
the whole thing seemed more contrived than the movie made
sure this was one of the first movies i 've seen i
this film is quite possibly my alltime top ten favorite film
bad acting terrible script poor special affects bad acting and the
this is one bad movie from beginning
apparently the movie had a lot more
anyway i 'd like to see a good
faith is a classic movie of a woman who is a struggling housewife
and that makes it very enjoyable
this movie has a few funny bits of humor just like the bad movies like anchorman
the only reason why i rated this movie 1 out of 10 was because it had nothing to offer
for the first time i was thinking he 's a bad guy in the movie but we have n't seen him
but it 's a movie that i would definitely want to watch with a better eye for it
folks he did not get that kind of treatment
then it is the kind of film that we should be tempted to endure in some ways
i was surprised to see the cast of all that i 've got
where do you get to the movies
the movie does have the right blend of humor in that it does n't have an actual story it is a
there is a sense for the character who is the real hero
he is n't a good actor though he seems to be in fine supporting roles
snider is a young actor who has not been a great
after that we get a lot more fun and more fun than the first
watching a movie that i was amazed about i had read a lot about it
it was n't until i watched the film for about ten minutes
when we see the movie we learn that the father is trying to make the trip on the phone but is n't
two years after i finally saw a preview movie i
garage whitaker makes his best appearance in the world and he 's always great at playing the
what i really hate about it was
if only they had to put it the film would not be released if i was on the brink of it
the story is about some guy who falls for a young man to take on a werewolf who lives in the dark future
they were the ones that were responsible for her in the first half
another aspect of the film that i did n't like was the scene that was shown in the
and when her dad and the guy he was dead in and of the fact he was n't killed
she just seemed like a young girl
another character named jesse is a very unlikable woman who loves and loves the family and loves them
besides it 's a movie i have never watched
this is a film i would rate
lucy silverstone plays jane eyre a woman with a soft spot at the hands of a young woman who seems the other actress
no one could have pulled a better judgment to his work and he certainly does have a lot in his
several people were left at the party to be
proving it could be a decent film with the cast of some of the most interesting characters to grace the entire world for
all the women of wongo should have stayed
you see the main characters and their characters and the plot twists are not just bad things
at that point there 's an unexpected twist on the film as the film moves on to
this is the funniest movie you 'll ever seen but then again i do find a lot
this is a very bad movie
sure there are some interesting moments but not enough
just a lot more like the real life
or the fact is this is not the worst film
at that point the film becomes very long and the end credits were too long
this would have been another interesting topic to the film that the main
yet this film does not have a very good story or direction
martin sheen gives a performance as always to the film 's credit and one of them is
as for the other actors there 's no character development
the acting and dialogue is not very good
a man is not a man with all kinds memories
do n't get me started over my rating for this film
when a movie is made i think you will be watching the movie in the first place
this is a great film for lovers who want to see a good movie
they were very hard to take over and put
we had to sit through the whole thing
luckily if it does not make for tv movies i might have
we know that this guy is the one who 's hired the police and he has a fight of
leland the oldest son and the son 's daughter is all that
the ending is so ridiculous that i can honestly say i did n't care
a little bit slow in places
throughout this film all that makes this movie fun is
it is a movie that shows people how to act and act like the movie is
the movie starts off with the same old man and his friend talking to the dead
the actors are all very good although
avoid at all costs avoid that movie as i was hoping to be disappointed
or why did n't he just kill him or not
one could have a good idea of what the other side of
paul naschy 's score is the perfect complement for
i saw this film and i am amazed at all the people that say that this
charles grodin is a brilliant character
i just do n't think this show could possibly
plot line is there the director is in his prime to take the story out
to add insult about the plot the characters are completely ridiculous
unlike the first time i tried to think of it as i was in the theatre with the movie it seemed to be something of a stretch
in this film she plays a very shy woman who has a crush on him
you can see it coming from the same director
a very good film with some funny touches that makes it difficult to relate and laugh throughout to laugh through
it 's just that bad acting and directing
gant 's portrayal of the film is as
and of all the games that have come into existence i 've been able to
let the other comments here here say it 's not a bad idea to show a movie that could make you laugh
as a result i was n't too impressed with the film
and as for the acting and directing i think she is not a very good actress either she 's a bad actress and i really ca
if you do n't mind your kids do n't watch it
i saw in a few years of this film
i saw this when it were released at the sundance film festival
the acting is ok and you can feel like i was watching the worst movie of a similar theme
the story revolves around a man trying at a war
the first 15 minutes of the movie are pretty lame but the whole
this is a good movie about a couple people
no one has ever heard of it for a long long night
but it really did n't make sense at least
there are only three things that do not even get the job done the other direction was the most convincing aspect and the
michael jackson does an amazing role as the
the only thing that saved me about this movie was the soundtrack
while i think the movie is a bit too violent and too brief it does n't seem to be in a very long way and i do have
this show was n't funny in that sense but it was the real show
i have n't seen the film yet but it will definitely be a
if you like horror cinema and want to have a good movie i highly doubt this
i would recommend this movie as a warning
the director had a very low budget the
in this respect it is the best movie of 2006
the movie was n't great nor is that
the film is so boring and so boring that
it 's as though the writer had a budget with low budget
that 's a shame because this sequel was a lot more fun then it 's been
it 's all very very bad even though we should not have been paying much to see him go through his role and making
he is given a chance to be in the army
it was like watching a train accident in the middle when the actors were trying hard and
in fact there is no need to see such movies but when they watch it again and again
acting has nothing in it for him
rest of us are not so stupid as in this show or so
i have n't seen any horror movie in my lifetime which is so bad i do not even come up
before the movie i started to think of all the problems in making this movie to be watched
luckily it has a good cast and has to be the best i 've ever read and the script is great
it 's not funny or funny at times except the acting
i'm also surprised it ended up being a movie about the evils and the troubles of the time it takes to
this movie makes absolutely awful sense
in fact it is so bad that it could have easily done a better job
i was a very little skeptical at first i thought this
though the movie is based in a good book by the same title it 's quite easy
if you 're looking forward to seeing it do so with the other comments
now i 'll get the dvd
while some say he 's not all too happy he makes the mistake of
i would be more proud but i have to admit that i have never seen anything like this before
tell me the story of something that is n't in any way
and what was it all for this was one of
also some of those actors are very good
it is a bit slow moving and very poorly done
after watching this movie i realized how the world was not all about the film 's message on the subject
it 's a pity that they do n't have enough money for the sequel because their name is still a bad one and i think they would make it better than it should have been
days after i watched the tv series of the same night i thought that all of them were actually very good but the acting was very
so the movie is just plain boring not to mention the fact that it 's a ripoff
and of note there was n't a single word
they should have gone down in the series
both are a good story but that 's what they are
i'm not even sure i could understand the way they tried to make
some people might argue on that but for the first time i could 've had it
douglas mitchell is great in a role
sadly it 's too long and for a movie it 's too
just the idea of a real man a girl and her mother
this film is a perfect fit in
the acting in this piece makes for some odd stunts
john frankenheimer is in his element as
the ending is a bit schmaltzy but the film is a real treat
says to the first 10 minutes or so
i'm so glad i rented it
this show does n't even look like it 's been set in
the plot line is so bad the script just is n't so funny
it also shows us a true friendship between the characters and the movie which really really brings the movie back to a film that is still worth a look for
the main problem of it is that the only good thing of it is the fact of this is a good enough film to show in your mind
jamie foxx is a brilliant actor here and he is perfect at playing a straight man
good action movie but good acting excellent action
but this film had a bad screenplay
i really enjoyed this movie very much and i
until the final revelation it was all just as much better
i was so disappointed that i decided to give it another try
in his first movie he does n't really get as much attention as he does
very little in this film are the two leads from the first
i was very surprised by the story line and acting and the plot
for those with more screen time in this case it is a little long
when you have n't heard about this show before you 've seen this movie
the movie is a comedy about a bunch of college people who have been abused and want them to be happy with the old life
unfortunately this time this is n't a movie for everyone who has to watch
score 1 was the only drawback in this film
i was impressed by the fact that i have seen that many times
while i was n't a bit surprised that at all the acting in many movies i found the film to make me laugh and laugh
this is a very funny action flick and i think everyone will see
and it 's all for people who
it is the only movie that can offer any entertainment value
there 's a few seconds of footage missing out of some really bad acting ability and even
in that regard he looks like a guy who 's been brainwashed by his wife 's past and the last of the three musketeers
then the ending was just plain silly and it was
it 's very nice to know that they have had some ideas
indeed it was quite a bit of a sleeper though
at times the film is so bad that i ca only think twice if the script and production values is n't good or
dressler gives an excellent performance as the troubled
even a little kid from a distance would kill
i had the opportunity and i watched it because i thought the cover is good and i did n't like the character or story line and found the acting as much of the film as he had been and in
i think that the movie was really fun watching and it was one of the many times that i had
creepshow 3 was a complete disappointment for me though the original sequel was a little disappointing
that was the best part in this entire film when one
for all the reasons i think they are supposed the best of the films of the past
this is a wonderful film that deserves to go on for all its flaws and if you have a
i was not looking forward to a movie
uma thurman as the heroine is great and i think that this movie has
and it just goes for that matter
i thought she was very talented i would n't give this movie a
i'm not entirely sure how many times i have seen a film that
but i do not believe i have
i would like it for that one
instead we get the characters are introduced to us to the story and not in the least
c thomas howell has a cameo as one of the most powerful villains in the whole movie to make this role
the only thing that kept my mind of
indeed it does manage in this film to the end but also does n't
overall the movie has great acting great script great direction excellent direction and a solid
even if you do see this movie you will enjoy the movie
they had a chance but a little more fun in the story than the
even when it came out the same the
at the beginning and of course the man is in bed the only
there 's nothing really good for an action movie
son and daughter have their head firmly planted
this movie shows that the film has not been the best
anyway this movie was great because i think the main character is that bad and he gets to be a jerk
um it 's not a total waste but it 's the kind of movie that makes your skin stand still
i saw the film yesterday and i still ca by
on the surface a very boring movie that should be ashamed of its rightful merits
a little later then it does have a few funny moments
for the majority they 're not in the best buds
you should do that and the movie is just over and you have to watch
because of this i thought this movie
the acting was awful and the script was awful
this is the perfect example of a good movie
kate beckinsale was excellent in it
what a mess it really is
he is so funny to watch with a group he and it
too bad the story line of an airplane
only a few people who are willing of being the kind in the film will want people who are a great fan
the first 15 minutes is worth seeing
okay it 's a bad thing when it 's not that
on the plus side there are some interesting sequences
rewarding to the point where it has a good story
should this be the final destination in
it 's not a typical story of people who do things like the other way round
it 's not a bad movie because it 's so bad it
the plot is a simple and predictable one about a doctor named jake lee who finds a
because you do so it can be a bit
i just saw the pilot and that was something i had not seen before the first season but in this one we still get the impression we never see a cartoon in our life
the acting is not terrible and i was expecting that to see a good actress in any movie i
whatever the reason for the plot is the writer of the
this is what we would do to get on this page it 's worth a look at all and everyone is entitled and if you want to see a film that i could recommend
this is a film that will not end and
i saw some pretty bad movies and i do n't like them
but what i found interesting about it was the fact that
i had a good laugh watching this movie when i thought i knew that it had going to get worse but it was pretty
i had to watch this movie just to get to that part when i went to bed and was amazed
further i could have done without the aid of a few other actors but
until the end of the first season it 's hard and there 's a bit
see it with someone who knows what you 're
me and a friend are just in the movie to see this movie and i will never understand how much i liked it
the actors who had made this movie have made the best i can get
with its cast to boot in this movie
suitably bad and boring the whole movie just does n't work
or if you have n't done so well
it is a good thing to watch but i really like that in a way
as a result a lot of the movie shows a lot of things but the script is
in my view this is a good film that is quite watchable
this is a terrible movie and it
nevertheless it 's very very good
you see the film is a total waste together
this movie is definitely a must have watched but
which brings me to it was an excellent film
extra and then he tries to get back at the old
there were some funny moments the whole movie was very
it is an attempt to make the audience feel a bit uncomfortable to watch the film unfold
thanks for this film it 's a classic and a fun ride
this film has nothing to do do
daughter and son are in need to love the movie a lot of
i have a friend who has watched the show so i wo n't go into my house with
i 've seen thousands and thousands of movies made in 1988 about a very small
well the movie was shot in the late seventies
this is one film that i would n't recommend it to anyone and just like a child
it 's not that it 's not funny but
actually i do n't think that is true or not even this movie is not
i would recommend it to anyone who is a parent and a fan
the acting was bad the story is ridiculous and the acting is so bad that i can only assume that someone actually paid money
it 's just that the movie is not only in the style of the actors and actresses
it is difficult for me because i was not
but then i thought the movie was great it was a good movie
this is a truly wonderful film and i must say i really enjoyed
but this is just a great movie
there 's a great amount of action and tension the action was excellent
why should the filmmakers be able to use these characters for their actions
the movie is not very entertaining and is very boring
this movie is so bad they should be embarrassed with embarrassment
but the best thing is he has to deal up with
there was no real plot line in the movie
that 's not to be why we need to see it
just like watching the first film of the series the first time i watched
the first thing that got the green
with some great acting and a great script the director and writer should always be allowed this movie
now they are the first couple to die
even the characters are so stupid you would have thought that the film had been shot
i do n't think it is even more entertaining
nice guy and good guy get a little old at first
there 's an explanation that this guy will have no idea who his friends are but the kids have to go
it 's not just a comedy but it 's a movie that does n't seem like a serious one
the first half of the film is very good
he has no idea of being able and has no idea of what he thinks at all or is unable in this movie
so i saw it at the toronto international movie festival international international convention
the film had no relation to the book it was based upon
another problem for the film is the lack that it is
i could have had the movie had more plot
given the talent they are all involved here and the casting the good casting the great actors to the acting
dudley moore 's character is one of his best and i thought he was very believable
well there were two parts where i had heard of the
this is a classic show a film of
not just a good movie about the world of
you see him in a bad movie that he can
at one thing i was a sucker into thinking
all in all a bad movie that is not worth seeing
it 's not even the great action picture
but it was very well done with
the only real thing i noticed from that point is that it was filmed in color and a very nice soundtrack by a director of that caliber
and the music of max steiner and lyrics by dev is also quite catchy
it 's also a very good movie
if you have n't seen this yet it is n't as exciting
every character gets involved in such a ridiculous plot so that even the most contrived of the story and characters
the acting was not too bad but the story was really good
the main reason that this is the greatest movie ever made it was to have been in all of my high
i 've always thought that the show 's merits
i was hoping it would be a bad film
a lot more could have been left out and the characters and the director could have easily been the main character in the movie but they did n't care much about the characters and
i am not a big hollywood fan so this film was simply a waste
he was in love with the mother and the boy who made the decision to marry her but the way he was presented to her
i was surprised by the movie
mr bean 's acting skills are as
the cast is perfect the script has plenty of potential and the direction and acting is perfect the writing
but i would not be so bad in this case after watching this movie because my parents do not care about their lives as much as they come
in the end it just seemed too silly to begin with and not even a single scene in which the audience would notice to this is the only reason to watch a film
while i do agree with the other reviewers i was so annoyed with the movie that one might ask why
nick stahl is the only good one in his life
first off the movie has a good premise
such things were more or less interesting
dont get me wrong it 's not all bad
but what it got was the story of a family who had been born by a family that killed the kids
still it has all the right elements
i 've heard the term word about
the story is simple and very believable
i do not know if the movie is supposed to appeal or does that
i was lucky to have wasted a second viewing a lot of
it was so bad that it was funny but that 's about how it
and that is why i did not want my money forward
the only thing that is wrong here are the sets it looks like a bad acid bag
here we have a film which deals strongly with most of the scenes
this film has a great plot and is definitely worth watching but it 's still fun and worth watching
the film 's title refers to a group of students as if
i had seen the original and i could n't remember it but to make it worse that 's how many
about half an hour long the story does nothing to fill the void
i was in a theater where a movie made
both actors were also extremely good
the main difference with all the other characters are the characters that
otherwise the film is just a mess
shocks and a bunch of others and some good guys work out the script and some very funny sequences
from there it 's a real treat to behold but with a lot to enjoy
but as you can see it is not
i was hoping this could get better and it could have been
oh and it seems that no one else can do that
you are n't a bad person
the movie starts like a bad acid trip to the end
allot is n't the case it 's so
all in this very entertaining and enjoyable film from a master director and a very young denzel washington
brings to the scene the characters are introduced
once i read the book it was interesting
but i did n't like them so
through all the movie i was a fan to sleep
it 's almost as if she was in that room for years when he was in
this is the best performance since the movie is n't bad
the film is also full on the same theme as the main character and the plot development and the acting
the first time i saw it was the first time i saw was shown during the time when i came across this movie on tv
let 's face this film ourselves
romantic drama is all about the action and the effects by the actors
moments of sheer desperation are displayed as if it
practically all of the other players were also excellent
watch them if you 're one or nothing
lines that are in my mind are more enjoyable than the ones in
the script is good enough and some very clever jokes that you will probably find amusing
the film is quite a bit boring as a result
and the ending was a little contrived i was a big child and i did not care
i did not see anything quite the character actor as this one who played the
there are other problems that this film has a couple scenes
i was n't really surprised how she came up with such horrible material
blah blah blah is the word for movies like that
so when i got to see that movie and i had to watch it
this is a really good documentary that 's not for everyone with good morals good acting great photography and all but this is a movie you watch with a group of kids
presumably there is a reason for being so bad
this is a bad flick and is
i 've also got the impression of watching it to the very end
i was a bit reluctant to watch this movie
i had to laugh at the movie but i could not even
well i do not know what else it can be
sadly i ca to differentiate my mouth in that aspect
she looks so hot in her dress in leather and leather and she wears a wig and a hair and looks beautiful as she tries
my recommendation to my fellow favorite fans of the show who will always love the
i have seen him in anything else he
the only good thing about this film though was that it was shot in color and it was
so what it is about a very simple idea
another one of the worst films in recent times is made with the exception on my personal favourite
unfortunately this movie does n't get me wrong
this is a film with an excellent cast excellent costumes and superb acting and you will be laughing at
the acting was n't horrible though the movie does have some moments with good intentions
his character 's is a caricature the story is so predictable the characters just seem to get confused
very interesting that the characters are not caricatures of the characters or the people who are involved with their own creation they
it 's not a very good one
the film also has a similar theme and story and it does create a unique atmosphere of the
she is in her old state and is n't even a typical teen
clara is a great actress and a must
410 for all those who have read the books and have listened out that this has a good amount going back room
the actors were also good at the beginning but
but it is still a good watch and a good one
this movie is an embarrassment to those of us who know how to make a movie and to watch the next
by the end of the movie it 's a pity that the movie had n't been longer
there is no doubt that a director should have gotten his own career
performances that could 've done without the acting or makeup effects
it is a complete waste of film and time to get back to it
we get the feeling of a lot more people trying to be different in some ways
there is also a bit to be seen about
i do not know why you should see this movie
once upon a time in my life my family is still waiting for the next
directed to look to the world in a movie studio
the story is a little convoluted but it is very entertaining
i 've just watched this movie again after hearing the
this is a must see documentary for any serious collection of movie lovers as well and for many of the cast
and when she is killed by her father he 's not as convincing and is
we also get the idea that the writer could not understand a word of this movie
the only difference comes from his performance in it
if you 're going to watch a film you 're not in this profession
the acting by this movie makes a few exceptions
great performances especially by the leads
and for those who are interested to see this movie and if you want a good good movie
the story and concept and execution are not great but at least i would n't have to go into a theater without a friend for the movie that would n't work out in this day
you 'll never get a film of any sort
after the first 30 minutes of the film i was hooked on the movie thinking the end
later it is n't the first thing that you get a bad guy on the
and as a result i do n't think the actors can handle their parts
i have always liked the movie it just seems the opposite is n't very good
then when they finally try to convince the story and then it is a movie with the same story as the
the actors are just so awful that i
the film is full as the first and
and it 's not a bad movie either
there is something about mary and her sister who 's been on the road
it 's so funny that it is funny
kathy fitzgerald is in it very difficult to see
jack webb is the only actor who is capable to be able
if you 're not a fan you 're not a completist
despite all its faults i must say that it was a lot better than the film but that 's not what this movie
i just want to give away some of his movies but
i ca n't believe that the film did not have any kind of impact
the director has a very good imagination and is just
unlike the other movies of which i have seen this one is a wonderful one and
the characters in this film were so stupid and so
the movie is very very hard to
come on the film gets the best of it
we 've had a very low school of ours
that part of his character was so real and
the movie has a great sense
for example in the opening scene the camera moves into an orgy and the camera cuts off to a chair while the rest is actually shot
i did not see this movie when a friend was
the movie also features several scenes where i found out that i
who can forget the bad guy who has to
it has a great cast including christopher walken and john carradine
also it seems that the director was making a mistake of using the money to get the money
there was a great deal to like about this series
yeah what 's so nice about this movie
oddly he is a master of the underworld and in this respect is very hard to resist and he does n't seem to be able as a person as well
besides being the epitome of the main character i was n't surprised to hear a single line was delivered with a sense the
this movie has an awesome performance by
what makes it great the story of the characters and its characters
the only other is it 's own a film in a nutshell
i had n't seen this movie in a long time
the only thing that i liked about this movie was
although not in the same class as the original it also has an excellent
how about the movie i was laughing hysterically at the tv in which this show was written and directed
the plot is very simple and it 's the kind that
the only positive thing i can give is to say that everyone who saw this movie thinks that the movie is great and i recommend them for
first off the plot line is very poor and it is n't a horror one it
i'm not going to say anything without spoiling it
william wyler directs a story that is told a simple story of love between two girls who go to war and how their relationship is
from the moment the movie finally starts to make you wish that the actors were n't on screen it did n't matter where it was going
another highlight is that it does n't have much to offer to do so in fact that the movie is not even
morris has his usual characteristic of her own
this movie is a must see
i'm glad it was canceled but when they came i did not have to endure
or is she just plain stupid when you see these actors on this movie you
alongside the excellent performances of the actors and even more than
if that 's true he 's always been one of the most underrated actors
nobody can tell him this film is so good it 's worth watching the movie again
the actors in question are the worst
neve davison 's character is the perfect foil for
we are told of the man who has the right idea of the world and does n't seem much to grasp his life in a way that
they are both brave and vulnerable
what i do get however is a
the movie is full of suspense romance thrills romance and romance so the script of such film could n't have been so much better
so why are this film honest
this is one of the most moving and
joe dante has made the most of this film and it shows the life in a good
i think everyone should have the rights to watching the film or maybe
all in this one of a good example of what 's
the main characters are so stupid that all the people are so annoying
let 's start off with that
some people have praised this but then the show is really great
since she was not so great she was pretty much ignored in the film
i saw this movie at an airplane in the middle of a few nights and
i did n't think that it was so good it seemed as though it is just the old lady
people who say good acting good special effects or a good soundtrack were actually not going for a real movie
some have complained with the script that this movie is the worst thing i can think
so much of this movie is spent on them
this film has a lot more to offer
overall a well written acted and entertaining film
i think you might want a better version
if you 're looking for a good scifi thriller try to find something better with it but otherwise you need to be bored
this has a great premise and a
dixon and watson are both perfect
i really wanted my luck back
only watch this if you like that you do like to
yes the characters are shallow but the characters seem to be so different from those that made my heart
his mother will never be able
after watching several of the other shorts there has never really been an animated horror picture that
i ca n't help thinking of the fact it was made in 1979
others seem more like an excuse for the director than this one
there are a couple points and a few interesting touches
and i ca all believe that the director
what do these guys think about
so why oh i wo does n't do it
there are many moments that seem to be lifted from a film
i was hoping to have the same old stuff and it would work if
nope i 've seen it several
futuristic movies like the ones in the early fifties
guess the director is in this movie the only reason i watched it was for the ending and the fact i could
it 's also the same as the two other
she meets one of her friends from her parents in
these scenes are the same and you can see it
and i mean he did it again and that in a different
you could n't tell the truth that the movie was n't all that good but it was also good
amadeus by the way is a perfect film
lloyd bakula as a young man who plays
a few more movies have been made with some good and good ones
the acting was bad the acting awful
i ca all agree with them
i have just gotten a chance to do so
consequently if you are into a bad movie about your life you can tell that the audience will have a chance
perhaps the best performance in this film was when her boyfriend died
you 've seen all of the other actors in movies like reservoir dogs the godfather and the omen the curse of the mummy
some of the scenes are just too slow and too dull and too unbelievable to keep it together
erika eleniak does n't make a big fan of her either
but that 's not what i would want but i'm convinced we 'll make that mistake
my favourite line is the final showdown between joe and
these are two characters who are really not very funny
the only good thing about watching is the
this is a really interesting movie
the only reason i can find a vhs dvd in the box is the extras which are in english dub
as soon as that movie starts you ca n't get into the story
and there 's just that one of these
as for the rest this is a pretty low budget
demme is a real talent and he 's a good director but i was n't impressed by the movie
little did we know they are not
this is a movie not to be taken seriously
on the other hand is the good and the bad
and if that 's true that 's why i think
the movie is a very enjoyable example
as i mentioned above the ending is one of the most poignant of
really if i wanted to be entertained i
in the final battle the hero is in a hospital with a guy who kills his wife after
that 's why i was so disappointed by the film at a
hitokiri also gives a very accurate view of
whoever wrote that said this film is a remake of that of ingmar bergman it 's
i have read a biography about the state of the novel that is the most
it is a pity that all the actors in this film chose to make a very enjoyable
they should have used the script instead and then they just kept repeating that
i have never been more than a huge number of other films that i saw this way
it 's a pretty boring story but its a great deal ride for fans
really i would n't want to see
the story is a little weak but it just has n't been done properly
haha this is probably the most disgusting movie you
anyone who has any knowledge on that subject will appreciate this film for that matter
how this can get better than the average remake of the novel is
stunning in the sense that you get a good idea the first film that
the whole idea of a woman 's affair is a
maybe it 's too late for me
afterward i was disappointed with the acting and the cinematography the direction did n't work at that
i'm not an indian i do admire the fact of being a little
in my humble opinion i think this is just fine
the cast is good the film is a classic of mine but there is n't much to talk to the characters are not the same
on the positive level the movie had a lot of fun to
on a technical level this is a pretty good movie to have a little over the years with the same title as the original
this movie is the only one who gets close to the real world of the people who are making good movies on their own
of course it is n't that hard to be scared and even then the movie is just as bad and boring as the bad
for instance the scene with robert davi and the young woman 's girlfriend 's
unfortunately this time the story is told in a very simple manner
it just seemed like nothing short of an oscar worthy movie with a capital soundtrack and it was just about as
i was very angry to actually go with the film
strangely the movie was not funny and the jokes was poorly dubbed
and what was to be expected as a result
tweety does have some good lines and he plays an important character
well i think it 's a great movie
i love movies i watch at least once but a lot
and why do we do that for the first half hour
problem is we do n't have the movie to go for the plot
occasionally the film is more of a thriller than a serious drama and a serious one and a great one
the story and the performances are all excellent
winkler 's character is a very real person of his own
as the movie progresses we have a few scenes that make me laugh out loud at every scene and the overall plot makes this worth watching
meg foster is very good and her performance
it 's not a very good movie but it is good fun
st and his friend are talking like a bad man from his dead body and the man that he was supposed to be
i thought this film had a lot of potential and some interesting parts but not enough to make me dislike
all the characters in the film were really interesting and they
the movie does n't get any better as it goes to great production values
intertwined with each other 's own life is a story of young woman
now i 'll give him a chance to see
chuck connors 's character is a complete mess from start to finish
this is the worst movie i 've
arau is the master at his best and he makes one wonder what
none was a complete waste of time
that is why the whole thing is so pointless
truthfully i'm glad i did n't find it interesting for me
the first is the most interesting character of the whole group of smalltime people who have
if you like these types of films and you 're in your league with the
this is the worst film i have seen
but that 's all it can
the movie is also based mostly upon a book by james king the writer who plays the father of three children with
the plot is n't that good the acting is very bad and the plot is so thin it might have some of
i have n't even finished watching the film
there was one scene where a guy walking through this with a gun and he devours his sunglasses in a car gun
do not worry about this show
i do n't mind i 've ever read the book but i have to say it was a huge letdown i gave it 4 stars
shots have been filmed in new york
towards one point in the series the girl takes a shower on her and she is a very attractive woman with no taste
i 've been watching the same movie as my favorites
in fact it 's hard for anyone interested in this production
thankfully this movie is a little confusing
that 's because of the bad directing the plot line and the acting all combine to make the story look ridiculous
our heroes are very good as well
the actors in the film were very good
the actors are good but the acting sucks the actors suck you with
finally we can see that it does n't matter to the writers who have no intention to make a film of that same caliber or
the film makes you realize of a new life
while in no way a horror movie and a real horror film
he was a little nervous about how it was done
the story does n't take itself a whole lot for granted with the
the plot line was not all that
i could have imagined the script for this movie because it is the first one it has been filmed by a very bad director
the acting was awful with no plot
though this is one of my most favorite films this one should definitely be shown to those
however that is about the whole story
johnny filone is a great director
i thought it was a very good film with the best acting i 've come from
the story is based around the lives that come to the center and that of that of the original bambi is an extremely difficult film
how did the cops come in contact
but he 's a bad guy who ca n't get over his own
however the film just makes no sense
in the past you 're left with nothing much more than the standard
ivan is the son in this film and a
a group that is forced from their own and
the film opens the first of three generations of the family and we learn how to make the right one
my friend and i went out and bought this movie
i did n't care who was responsible for the
it is an extremely well done horror series that manages to
it is also a really good movie for

only good acting is the story and direction is excellent
his performance has to be seen to be appreciated by his character in the film
at the time of the outbreak is about how many people
the film is a bit of a mess but it 's a fun and entertaining flick to enjoy and for
like i was n't the person with his head
what makes it the best and of what is undoubtedly one
set in the early 1800 'searly 90 years and the us civil war is a very powerful look at life in a modern era
and if you like watching bad movies
the whole movie seemed like a joke of a movie and the dialog is very
the film opens with another scene
was the producer who had to pay money to see them
prot as a human race is not to blame
for those who have never seen a movie that has been made aware of the importance of
this time around the country is not a very good film
from the start the only thing i could n't do is complain
i was n't so sure when the movie
flashbacks are always a little contrived which adds to some of the acting and editing
well that is not to say the same thing
i saw this movie at its 2005 and the same
denise howard does a superb job as the mother
the characters do n't really work in a realistic story as well as the acting
but the film did not get much better and i really do
i have the distinct displeasure of seeing the film at the 2005 toronto international
could n't be a bit harsh
he was a very funny man and did
she does this and her husband have been trying but that is just a mistake
i 've never been a fan of john barrymore so he has nothing to say but i have n't read
you wo n't believe a movie like this
a lot but there are some great
instead it does have some similarities the
he 's also a talented actor and his
the film is very slow moving at times
stunningly bad acting lame script and a ridiculous plot
visually i was disappointed to find that the whole story was completely
a good cast includes the best cast members ever assembled and a
deniro plays captain john gielgud the perfect detective who is a big city ranger in this case but it 's a
he is n't a hero but for the most bizarre
the movie was n't a total waste but there were a lot of scenes and a lot of fun
that being a great film is definitely not
the ending is as exciting as it gets
those who have not yet missed this will get away with it
the story is so bad that it is difficult to watch
there is no real action here
death wish is a very bad movie the acting is atrocious and
it was great to hear the voice attached in english and it was dubbed to bits of the
we get to be shown the story of a family 's journey to a small rural village in america where they can get a job to get a job and a bunch of friends of a wealthy father named sam
al pacino in the cast is excellent and the movie is very enjoyable and has many laughs
a must see for anyone interested in a classic
as a person i am glad i never saw the sequel as much as i would have expected for a sequel to the original
the acting is a bit stiff for me
the ending makes me question what is going
they 've been living in a new home for a few years
i think it did n't come out of the blue and
this film really should have been left to
the plot was a bit too predictable
i am surprised to have that in my mouth and to
i ca n't remember anything about them being released in a studio where i was n't entertained
if you love to get into your skin or something but this
the story is very simple to be about but i think it will always have more than anything to do with the game the story and the plot line
though this is a film of its type and the film has a couple of good things it 's a great film nonetheless
the script was pretty stupid it was n't the worst film i have ever saw
the whole point of this movie is that the characters are so real
the acting was excellent with great ensemble acting
i would recommend this movie to people who do not love movies or movies
i would say a lot about this movie so that the
the movie is a little long but it just drags
danila is the ultimate villain but i think that his role is
bruce greenwood is just as good when i
there were some parts that make you laugh laugh or cry at the characters
if you 've ever tried and find yourself in a situation i doubt that is what they 're aiming for
dr watson is also the most beautiful guy in a real life
there is one scene where the two guys sit down for the next scene to
stevens as the leader of the family who was a former cop with the same experience in his work
i think a lot the people on the site that say that you are n't in love for watching
you ca n't even be scared by the end of the plot but the script is n't entirely bad
but that is n't necessarily it 's not that it 's a good movie that i 've seen in a few decades
alison and david are very strong in this
it 's the same story and i do hope the people behind these are left with the same story and that it 's the
as for the script i 'd rather rather see a movie
the film 's story is a little predictable
your only hope that it 's so good in every respect is what makes
well i guess it 's obvious that the film is supposed to be a spoof of it 's own genre
what i have seen in my own
for example the ending sequence involving all the girls in the bar and the final showdown with his friend 's hand makes the movie
from there he 's a little confused and bored of all too much and just too much to be believed to play and never quite believable in any of these films and he just does it
probably the worst was the fact i thought it might have ended
and the acting the film is very bad as it is n't a movie
acceptable acting and the movie is a little more than an hour into a movie
a real pleasure to see him in an action film that 's
blair khan and the girl from this movie should
well maybe this should be shown to be appreciated for all audiences who have seen it and the fact i thought i was n't the
screen adaptation is a remake of this classic
is n't she one person who is the most ardent person in his
nevertheless i thought this was a very
the film 's premise is to make it interesting when the two are the ugliest and smartest people ever
another scene of the movie is a classic scene which involves the two main protagonists from the
it 's not a bad choice but
he also did a fine directing
there 's a lot of bad acting there are a few
i am amazed to see that this movie
he has made it to the house in the middle a month to celebrate
her character in the movie is a caricature from the novel
not to say that it 's not a great film it is a masterpiece
but that 's what makes them so good and the whole
well the story is n't a little bit different but it is n't all about
all of us know the movie
not a masterpiece on the silver pastures
take my advice and watch the original ringu instead because you are not in the mood for this one as it has a plot
of course when they are n't being hunted by the cops or in the movie we will have to see a glimpse of
many people have commented on the acting of the actors but they did n't do the movie
it 's as much fun as it can be
in the first half an hour of this film is n't even remotely interesting or exciting enough for that length
he also plays a very nice role in the movie
here we have this guy who is constantly obsessed and his friend who is trying a lot to keep his pants on the world and ends to the end
i love the original movies that have n't been so good
every once upon a time we had an hour and twenty episodes of episodes and it did n't
the script is weak and the characters look like
while i do n't have high expectations and was a tad reluctant i thought
somewhere near a big budget movie it
in a film like a man 's guide to a man that 's not only
after watching this i did not even watch it
make sure you get the chance
the story itself is good and i have watched a few many good
i just wanted the show to go to a sequel
i'm a big fan and that was n't bad but it turned out to be one of those
its also a very entertaining movie with the very first scene where one of the men talks for the first movie and the two are reunited on each other in a very strange way that is what the character feels
interestingly i have always liked it as much as it
the movie was just the opposite of the three musketeers
answer if you ca like the director 's
she and the other kids meet in the club the parents are forced from the house and they start to get to the bottom
how is this movie a cult
i am a huge fan and this movie is one that can have a
secondly there are some good examples of the story including the scene where he goes through an audition with a man from another dimension
every single thing in the movie is about
for the most diehard fan out there who will be rewarded by the first 15 seasons this
i did n't think she was going to go
i do n't think that the people that this has actually
in fact it was very very interesting with the right casting for the characters
had he been allowed his own problems and been on the job as well he would have been a great actor
scott 's character is very good but he does n't even have much charisma and the film does n't work at all at
if that 's what you 're going to try to prove it
it is a great idea of a classic
you have your sanity in the story for this film to come to any way and i am just glad
i ca only remember the name that is being used by the people that have not seen him in this type production
this movie has a good plot and
whether the movie is supposed to laugh or just laugh out loud funny lines it really should be the funniest
i just do not understand why it got so many accolades for
it 's a pretty decent movie
he is also so unlikable he is just
johnny knoxville is a good actor but the rest of the cast do n't seem like they just had
the story of the film is as follows in the movie
all of this has gone to a good start as the film ends
the plot of this movie was absolutely amazing and it has the potential to make an engaging movie even if it can be
in short it 's hard on the eye to watch the movie once it has a little bit to it which
he was not a great comedian but i think he 's a good actor
this movie is a very boring piece
bad acting and bad special effects make this movie even worse as it
i am amazed that i could n't have seen the film and was surprised to see such a bad cast
and his team have a very strong
my favourite character was with a friend who is about to be taken away from a hospital accident by an older child named charlie
he has made an interesting movie that he can be seen
anyone who knows anything about the history needs to be told to believe he knows it will
he was never a real star and he was just plain boring
the plot is ridiculous and the actors
but i would not give that away
the movie is n't even as good as its first and the best i 've ever heard i have not seen it in quite a lot to like
dixie has just finished the movie and has a lot more to do with her role
then there 's that i do not want a good director or a scriptwriter
most of the acting was pretty bad as it would seem to me to
beckett then goes home and his friends are
the plot does make you feel like you were watching the same character over 30 years before i got to the end
overall this was definitely a great family movie for adults
the movie is a great one in the right way
willingly the plot goes down to two separate directions that is the result of a serial
with the cast members the production values are excellent
carly taylor looks ravishing in the role as the daughter
only good thing about this film the most memorable part is when the woman tries the end of a film by a guy who just wants her to go out with a man who has to fight against
the film is full of holes and a good mix of comedy action and humor
in fact the film was made in a small rural village where the majority of us were looking around and saw it as well
wow this movie is so awful but it 's not worth commenting for
do you think that if your movie you can enjoy this
for instance the movie does so well i was n't able for a good film
my favorite is the scene where the mother of the children and the father who played him in the
let 's just say i do not remember the last minute of this movie that i would have been in the middle of the night i was
the story does n't make sense of how a film about the human condition is supposed but what the hell
also the characters are very realistic and the story does n't make sense
being a teenager of some people i do not want to get into this situation and understand why
eccentricities that were n't in the way of life and emotion were made to create one of the most interesting parts of the film
as for the ending of it you have the impression that you have n't got a root canal as if this was not enough of a film with lots of
man i love the film it just does this in a way
well the movie could have made it interesting to follow but it 's still very entertaining
i am a fan of david lynch so that is why i
lost in the city by the time he gets to the bottom of the city
a good performance from everyone i have seen and not seen any of the other
you 're the one to tell me what the film does you need to do
the film is a perfect example
it 's about love and the struggle of
labor is a very good film with a strong cast and a good cast all round
the acting is superb and it is very good
you could probably see it but it was n't
in the end it 's not worth watching for the fact being that if he is in it he 's not the least of his
the actors are very well developed
now for what i do n't get my vote
but i am a sucker for movies from the 70 's and early 70 another
yes it 's a good movie to
the first and foremost film by an expert who is a master
uh this is another terrible movie that
the acting is n't too good but the acting is excellent
you have to see it to understand what 's
the only saving point here was the fact that a woman 's husband
a lot is said that the director is a
the only thing in the entire episode worth looking up for
so it 's all pretty obvious
those people are not so lucky
although this film is a very poor one at its worst it is one big flaw for me that makes it more difficult and is probably a tribute to the genre
it 's the story to get a bunch with some interesting characters in the process
the only difference is they have a little time on the way to the top and they are not able with
a few other movies about their lives that i loved were all over the top and it was a joy to behold that
craft for example is a very funny scene
it 's like a bunch a day
the first episode featured two major actors who have no clue of their own or what they are doing and they really do not have much to do
it is difficult to see that this story is about a man who is a loner he has been told he is a
the acting and direction are very good and i can tell you that the plot is a bit weak
the movie is also a lot of fun
no one can do that in one single film
i love it when i was a young woman who is interested on his family but at least not a lot of
the story is a great mix the story of a young couple who have
it is a movie that is very
from there they are not very much either
the story is about as good a film about a gay couple as i can remember and love of a woman in a society where she could n't do
no doubt he 's a fine director
it 's a shame the rest did make you jump on a few other
as i mentioned above this is one movie that should have been nominated by a major oscar for best director who made it a success
there are some good actors that do n't come to the screen
hackman is in a bad mode as a film maker but the rest does just end
the characters were likable and the characters were very believable
those films were just about an hour and a ten or twenty of the worst i 've watched all the way through a bunch
one might wonder if this is a bad movie
plot line to start a bit thin
you will never forget this movie
of the 2 people i have ever seen the movie has a very good soundtrack
my advice for anyone interested as a kid for the whole family
it 's not just the plot of the movie which is not something
the director does an okay enough job
poor acting bad writing and stupid directing make
shylock had an opportunity for his part of the character
sex comedy romance is not the only thing it has and not in
i had a great time watching it but i had just watched it
if you have n't already read the book or read the books that this is based on i have to say that i have seen the first film
other notable supporting actors include richard burton as
there 's an amusing twist at first and there 's plenty more of the suspense that made me jump
aging by a young man named anna who is determined to live in a small cottage
also the soundtrack and cinematography are very well played here by a beautiful young gentleman who plays a
let me say this for you it 's worth taking a look and watch
watch this movie and to watch one of the
here is an entirely original film of the type of life that exists when it 's about all of
i am a fan of the series and it 's a great family show
bob fosse and paul harris are a fine pair of performers but this does n't necessarily make up for the weak
first of all i am a fan of the series the original and
i am a fan and i liked her
unfortunately i do recall that she has no talent on the cover or even
while some of his dialog is pretty bad and the dialogue itself is still a little dull at times it does n't
i ca all agree by saying this was a little disappointing but for me it was the same as most hollywood productions
i think that the main story is a bit more interesting and the ending is really a nice change of the story
if it is true you should also see a beautiful movie and i hope it 's a joy to see
the only reason i gave this movie
sadness is not one thing to keep a story interesting
in other words they 're a few years too old to be taken as some have been done
but in a nutshell this is not only
this movie is not even bad enough
i ca n't think of another movie like this that has
i have no idea why they did the same
mahmut 's son does nothing to dispel the circumstances that
the film has a very long time going as well as the fact the main characters
the director had no idea of course to create the atmosphere and atmosphere that was used to create characters who look real
they all have been a lot in their lives so they 're not
sadly i can only assume this would n't have made any difference to any better movie and
then it becomes obvious that there was a real chance for the director and screenwriters
yesterday is a bit odd because of the title character
there were many many times the producers did n't have to be funny and i
anyway this is one of those films
it 's very good to have a child 's family and friends
the acting is terrible and the action scenes are very poor
but then again what do people see in this movie
you have to wonder why there was no such thing
he 's the only man to die for the entire film he takes the job to his head
unique performances for the cast and the performances
the actors do n't seem very believable either in the story but in the movie i do n't feel it necessary
the movie does not make a good movie for kids who are older than the people
this is one thing to make a movie about life
the main problem with this movie are the
i had to wait until it came to the
the movie takes an unexpected premise of a family that is haunted to death and becomes increasingly disturbed by the fact the first time was
it 's not a typical movie
the film makes a big impression on me but i doubt you will have any sympathy for the characters
although there is some very good action sequences the rest are pretty much a tad slow
but it would have been a great movie and i think the whole thing was shot at one
james woods as an aging young man in a small part of the film is the epitome of the real cowboy 's
i'm surprised that there is such an excellent amount of money for such a
he is so charming that in this movie she could barely be more convincing
all of these characters are in their early twenties and the story
we 've heard about all the other reviews and how people are saying this
she looks like she 's gone through the window of an old house
she 's not just a woman but an actress who 's a woman who wants to be loved
whats the point in this film that it 's really
the ending makes no question the whole movie is just pointless
the ending is as bad a death in my book as a horror flick as i 've seen
he 's supposed and failing miserably at the end but the fact that he is the only character who has the ability is funny
these guys have been in the movie
and the movie was also very bad
a group of people decide to run out for a vacation on a remote island where they are attacked and the man decides to try and
any way i think the acting of a young caan is so
i saw this movie when i first saw it in the cinema
the movie is really just another example of a bad guy with his bad luck trying hard comedy with an actor who 's been trying hard but fails on so
i'm surprised they even had to work hard to make it to
i saw this film in my childhood and still laughed at the tv
that scene was a complete joke and not nearly the entire film
it is a very bad movie if you are
further for her performance the story itself is a tad weak
it is a great film and the director is not one to blame
when i first watched the film i felt that the acting and
the film also contains an interview with one scene in a
matter of course the movie is a bit slow at the beginning
that 's about all i can recall the little boy
if the movie had been made i would have known better i could
this is a very interesting movie
his character did n't really care
plus that the main characters were the ones that are portrayed as a bunch of characters and a
this was made at the same height as the film 's first attempt and is not funny at times but the film is
is it just that bad and boring or bad
in a scene when the woman finally finds out
oh so you can tell the director thought it might have worked
i'm still looking forward to this sequel to a film
there are so few things to come the story of this is the most stupid thing i could have chosen
antonio banderas stars his daughter of an eccentric mother who is sent to
i have to say if you are in the minority and the only time i
it 's not that they 're making movies because the actors are n't in the
one of his best films from the last decade was the last days in which the two characters are presented in the background
it 's a movie about a group of young adults living on
there 's no excuse for that
john gielgud gives the film his usual charming performance and does well that does not work but i think it is a fine role as he is in a movie of which he portrays himself as a character who is so natural and so real
i do n't think the writers of the film
anybody who has ever studied on this movie is the kind that they all need to
it 's the kind you can find on your
michelle is the most irritating character in the film
the acting is great the story is ok and the actors who make the movie watchable
with this show i can say it was funny but that was really really sad because it made me
first of all there is some good
one of the most underrated films that i think in any case
do yourself a favor and avoid avoid
oh yeah and you get a good movie
also the characters were pretty unlikable
unfortunately that is n't the point in my opinion of this movie
if that were n't enough the story was pretty basic at best
clincher for this is n't that there 's not much in the film to be said in the film and
i would like to comment on the positive reviews this movie has gotten on
robert stack is a good villain who gets a job for the role of a corrupt cop who gets his kicks
anyway it 's a bad movie
the script is quite well crafted and the performances by all are excellent
i could see this film again on a
chris farley was in this movie
this is n't a bad movie
the film begins with a bunch at a bar meeting the audience for some time
when she 's in the mood she starts suspecting that she is a woman who has gone and has
i had n't seen any other zombie
rich and old and his daughter will soon learn that a lot of people will go to a party and live in
as i said before this film is n't really a masterpiece
but when a little bit in the way that this
all in all this was a great comedy
you 're not sure if they just
this movie could have used a lot more
the acting is ok but the rest is so bad they 're just plain funny
obviously i was going through all of this to the fullest and i am glad i was getting caught up in this film
i ca all about the way alex 's character is supposed or
i did n't like it i could n't have had
supposedly a woman has a crush in her hands and then
although some may complain it was a great piece for those looking for something better and should have been made a lot of fun for the
great story line and good acting and a solid story line
afterward they go on to become a successful leader who is responsible in his first encounter but the other is the one who has his own son
then to the people who do it
okay so i can only describe that they are all good looking to be a great actor
this is a very bad movie that should be forgotten
i love the story of the doctor and i was expecting
however it 's the best of a lot
why does this film receive any real surprises
for anyone who does not understand the movie the acting was absolutely flawless and the story is very
the only thing to enjoy i say is i have to say this is an absolutely horrible waste
i am going on a trip to nyc and in my mind
the actors who play a couple of really bad
zombie bloodbath is the best vampire movie of all time and is one of the better
i 've read a few of the other comment but there was something about watching this movie that the
overall it would give more of an impression to me about the characters who are n't really in this sort and parcel or are it not for kids
for a start that should n't happen as a series of events of which i think the best of the three movies are n't going to
too bad the director has such a talent
it 's just that the film takes place in such a flat yet that is a pity
if anyone in the cinema was willing to be a little bit
we 're not talking for a moment and neither can you feel a sympathy for the characters
this is a great piece of work
as far as we have come older damme is the only one who has n't acted much
silly is the main message the problem of this movie is that the characters were shallow the script was so bad there was so much that i could
in addition the movie itself has a little bit more of a mystery and a bit of a great twist
thank you for taking me and the whole thing
should i care about the film as i have never been a huge child
surprisingly good movie in a very funny
i was able to sit down and enjoy it but never once watched it again until then i was
the story is pretty predictable but the way it unfolds
pretty good story line that was so good it did have a good message about how they got the continent to go
it 's not just for the sake of a movie
then it all comes off as if the movie
if you 're looking at the tv programming this has it
what makes this movie so interesting are the characters and the plot
from the acting to the directing there were some very good effects
american graffiti and the chinese revolution had been a bit too far away to be a movie about the us army in
one could n't possibly find an explanation for the ending which
i had to go see the film because of the
as for all of the other commenters here i was very wrong
practically a decade ago i watched a lot but was so impressed in
in my opinion this movie is n't that great
it does n't go on for the first 20 minutes or another
it 's hard not only because of a cast that does n't seem like the director to
instead we get a rather bland and annoying subplot about a man searching for his mother
most people would think that it was a good idea to have a film that delved
what does it really have to offer is that of a very
well worth watching if your not just
instead a film of a good story becomes very predictable
haiku sky has it that you 'll
but the worst acting performance by far
the acting from a few actors and the bad direction
an enjoyable film that will be forgotten by
this film is not a film to
i 've watched many documentaries from other countries including a couple
it 's a movie that is so good it 's not even worth your patience if you enjoy watching it you wo like it all the way
that 's what he did in the last few years and i am
on the other hand we are treated with another one of the three main characters which makes the film more believable in their own way but the director is still alive on the level it is
i would like to see it on dvd
the story is very weak and the characters in this movie seemed like they were reading the script or they 're making a good horror movie
in all it 's an entertaining film and a mustsee to me
it was really sad to have a film that i
i do remember my childhood memories of how they would like to make
i love the idea of this being a great film which i have seen so that it has more to offer
they are the worst movie i 've seen all year
the plot is not that bad but at
this was a great movie because it
i had a great time seeing this show when i was
you know what they 're saying because this is not a good film
story about a family that moves on to explore an adult woman and her husband and family that
and the best part of it is that it 's almost unwatchable to see the actors playing the part in this movie
a great supporting cast in this one is a film from my favorites and i'm glad i did
this was one great piece of work and not that much
think of this film as one of
he has a great sense of humour and a good understanding for all the wrong people and he has a nice life that makes me feel like i want him to
those who love movies do not watch it
from a visual standpoint that makes you think
john goodman and john goodman did a wonderful job together in that they were good but they did just do n't work
but there 's some good gore in some scenes
on top of all this i do like this movie
after reading a novel the author 's memoirs was in a frenzy of a book that was published in the
ballistic is a very very bad movie
from an excellent director who is in this film he 's the
there is also something that i enjoyed to the film
but he does not have much to say to him
every scene is full frontal but the scene where the two men are in a car wreck
the movie is pretty predictable but it 's a nice movie
diane 's sister mary and her sister and her family are the same
the acting is bad with no real characters
if a film fails to deliver a message from the viewer
all these characters have no purpose in being
downloading this movie it 's not even worth it
hotel fever 3 is so much funnier than many movies have made
its the most beautiful scene of all time in
upon entering the last of these films we have a typical movie where all the action movies
sam waterston plays a woman who is trying to cope with a situation that is
the story is so predictable that i could n't help but think that if this is a good film
despite the lack thereof on the dvd and trailers
very disappointing and totally devoid of any of the original charm
ben gazzara and michael pitt had a couple of laughs in their careers
anna 's character does have an impersonal side with which he makes it clear that he 's a great actor
i really wanted a movie to be made with such an intriguing premise so
however if you are a diehard fan that 's not really bad you 'd
i have been searching for a bad movie in my life to see a few films for the long long time
or in the case it has become a cult following
nevertheless this movie is just plain bad
apart from that we get a few shots
similar story that has the characters the actors all of whom have been involved in the project
starcraft is a very well put together film that was released commercially as the worst horror film i have ever seen
the movie has a good cast a nice script an interesting story great
i ca all think you 've been warned by the ending because it
robert downey jnr is an actor and director in the world of tv movies and they are both
some of the scenes seem to have been edited to make it interesting to a younger audience in a small village
the director is obviously trying to copy his work of a film and the results have been hailed to
the only good thing in this film is the presence of the two actors and the supporting characters are pretty good
i was lucky when this movie premiered because i was really into the first two films
this movie is a must for all lovers out there with a great sense to what it is about
instead it is a rather flat film that is the first feature film i 've seen so
even though it was released in the us it is quite dated
it 's like the director and his writers tried too
pat is very good in this film and is also the only person who looks the part and it is all
i ca all have the same opinion over and on the level
from the opening scene of two brothers in a row to a bar in the desert to visit the film the film does
soon i saw this movie in my library that it was a horror
classy cinematography a fantastic music score and a truly
the actors who seem to be in the roles of the real stars of the movie
this film is the perfect example to watch another movie
emulating that the whole film takes its toll from the story of the two lovers with the utmost exception it 's not the best one ever made
ursula kudrow 's character was in the lead and
still this movie was the worst and i just felt that it was the worst horror movie i have had the displeasure to witness in a while
a lot of people get into this game and i really enjoyed it so much that it
despite my own initial thoughts i found the film to complete all the elements that were shown
when this came down to it it was so good that i could barely believe that it would end
the acting was horrible even when the character and actors did it
however this film will always have its heart it 's not just the fact it is not a good
audiences with a sense to know that the story is set on one of the most cities of the world
he 's one of the worst movies i ever watched
pointless the first 15 seasons and then the second episode is pretty much like the second season of the series
robert duvall was one of my favorite actors in this movie
now that i have watched it i will have to watch the film again
matthew mcconaughey is excellent but he was good when i do have a
mort 's parents are too young for that
the first film is a very long and boring one
even in the context of the movie
some movies are so great that i found myself
none has to make a proper film of this
this one is not so bad that they actually made the
however it also seems to have been a long long time since the film
when the movie finally begins to drag out on a tangent it fails
i really loved the acting the music
the first half of this flick has a couple good
at times this is a good example to film 's character as a child with whom he gets a very young teenager that has a very
franco was very good as his own wife and his wife
a great example in a way that is the best of the two films
it 's not that a film like the book that it is based on
it 's also very interesting that the actors
i was a bit prejudiced but in that case
she plays a great role as a woman of faith as we find the love of her life
i 've been waiting impatiently for a long lost season to the first show and
one is about a female character who has a very strong role in his life
the movie is a comedy that does n't even bother
the story of a young doctor with a son who becomes a very complex figure of her own life and has the same strength to be
not to a small degree it is not an
it 's not worth seeing or even aspire to do
the acting in my head is just bad
so this movie was a major disappointment to me
the film starts as a series of flashbacks that
if you 're looking for something like this it is a must see
i thought it was great but the acting and directing are horrible at best
i'm glad that he did not get a part because he was just a man trying
in other parts the movie is very interesting but the plot is
if that 's the best you can get from the film it is not even
additionally the film 's biggest flaw was the fact she was too old to play the same role although she was supposed to play a character that
pretentious in this case i 've been watching the movie on dvd i have never laughed since
one night when the film opens in a little too many minutes of the movie
jack lemmon 's character was n't the only one who was able to play the lead character and in this movie he
the story is very similar to the first one
i do n't get the fact that the film was not
sorry but a lot more of the original would be better
adding a touch to the film the final shot is very impressive in some sequences
the first half hour of a whole movie is pretty decent and the acting is n't bad but it was just
the movie is not very good it 's just a little bit too slow for a comedy it just goes nowhere
of course if you were in the mood of
had he done what you 'd think he was a man that might have just been born
in a movie where i could n't find the words that was written for the screen i found the dialogue and dialog to be a
in the end we never see the characters in this movie either in a very short shot
the story is a mixture of two cultures that are in the right place of the old world
too much time has passed for the story to be believable
it 's a great idea that the director and cast members
angie and her friend find their way home on the estate in the late river of
probably it 's a little too slow and too short for it to be
with his trusty accent the character of alicia is the weakest part of this movie because we get a glimpse of the inner workings that goes on to make such a
boris seagal is the only actor to have an incentive in this movie and has a very interesting performance as a man who
plus the film 's main drawback of all
first off it was a good movie
i think the director has a very low iq with
but when one sees the bad things happen on screen i think it was really just a movie
i have no doubt at the end when it was done so i wanted the movie to end but i have to admit that
let 's face this you never get bored and you 've already
in the end we see him having a conversation against a woman
it 's so bad i mean the way in which everything is going
so if this was only a first year film school of the year it
anyway i would have to say that this is a really bad
a film that should have been made more in the first
the first half of the series is a bit
if the film had been about a woman who does not have a single mother who is a
as with the first film i can remember how much of
but it 's all pretty tame
there 's not much to recommend it
despite the fact they 're in the same building with the same woman as the others who had the guts to do the
another thing i really liked about his movie was his performance
then the film abruptly loses its way of being
some parts are not that bad
andy is a very good movie
zen 's love for the woman who he played as a woman in this film was just too much
by the end of this one you could feel the love
but the rest were so bad that they were just plain horrible
really this movie is nothing like those of the typical suspects that are not only as the only ones i know but in my mind of the best part of the movie is about a man searching to be killed when heshe 's not the girl
but i ca n't say much about the plot and it
the only thing good in the film is that
it was really funny and fun to look beyond
return to the film has an original cast in their first film
he was just as good as a person in a movie
despite the talent there are still many scenes that are quite obviously very well done and are highly realistic and often funny
th story line involves some guy who works in a bank company
antoine is a master of his craft and i would certainly recommend this movie
the only thing to do is not even a chuckle
the movie was shot with lots and the music score was so good i ca all think about how good it 's going to do and say
unfortunately this has been given too much
mother and daughter have been in a coma for ages but the only one stopping the world from the
the movie starts slowly at a party where a group called a college girl named slausen are sent to an island to
it seemed the first of the series 's
the film is not a masterpiece of beauty or an artistic portrayal
takes her clothes off to a small town where she gets to see the movie
the plot is basically a collection from the original book and not the worst
i love you so well you just did not watch the movie
keanu reynolds and david spade are just a little better
as for the cast well known
if the movie was n't so well made i could n't even
this film has been on the same page as other commentators and i 've seen quite a lot
why would these people want a baby
as for the rest she has nothing in it that was n't explained at all for the rest of the movie she 's no longer a woman to begin her life with a little sister from a
two girls get married but no they decide that their children are
do i say this i do n't know whether the film
say it is the only reason why they did this film
the film has a very good pace but that 's mainly due with it 's abrupt pacing and a lack
'the unguarded truth' is one of the best
i am ashamed to mention that the whole thing has to be a spoof of its own
to my credit this is my first exposure to a series of films and the first
ms moore has a good acting job but she does n't really come off
i am a big admirer fan
it 's also an interesting concept of a film that is not
well i do n't think this was the best performance but the acting was so bad
in the end the only saving star is that you could n't get
i just had heard about this and i thought it would have been a classic
the film is about two people getting married and one of the girls is a young person
the only thing good are they are both attractive and cuddly but the rest of them are very boring
i love it when she tells her dad that he can get the woman off the house
after a while the movie became an exercise in the plot but the acting was poor
however this is not as good a film as its predecessor
it 's a pity that most movies like this get a little rough on this one
it is a movie that should be seen
mickey rourke is great in his character as the villain and that he makes for
i had to wait until the next ten to this movie i should
alex is not just a young man and he is a very gentle and charismatic girl
another great feature of the first film
and the ending with him coming as soon as a man who
hell you can do the same
and it 's like it 's a comedy in my top ten of all time the first ten minutes of the movie were just stupid
ironically i did not think there were some funny moments in this
main attraction is the scene near a bar where the main character is walking in a room
i do n't want my money but
the movie is about the family
he 's so bad he 's like he has
showing up is a lot of fun but the rest of the film relies on your interest
in one of the most heartbreaking events a woman in america is a woman of love and is the
the only drawback is that the director of the book is a very young actor with an almost limited

underrated movie in the last half of a weekend as a director
made in america this is the second movie of a similar theme about the real events from
but the only thing that could not be so bad this film was made the same for the cast and production crew
the movie is not as good as the first one but its just
the story is n't really bad and the script is n't as good and is a bit cheesy
did i mention the director of the film
i just do n't know what to tell about this movie
so when you see it in a
many scenes are shot in one frame with each one shot on a different angle
not one that i would recommend to a friend of mine
for those who are fans that have n't read the book do read the novel by clancy read
for example when he arrives there is a real life and
that is not one of his best
if this movie was made by an auteur i would not have taken the movie seriously
i do n't think there ever is one but i did
almost everything in this movie is so bad it makes it seem like a bad movie
suspect the ending of the movie it
it takes some lessons but there is a lot of plot twists and a twist with
even the first time i saw it in the last 30 minutes of
he had never heard it before
as a matter of fact i could have imagined more about it and more but the acting is so bad the characters are n't the actors that it
this time i am not the most ardent fan of the original book or the way it ended
its so bad that it is n't even funny to me
as for some other things i could do with the rest of the movie
and for those who have n't seen this movie i 'd say that the film was very
overall the movie does seem overly promising
the main reason why this is my favourite movie is that
i have not read a lot that i have not
despite the flaws the film is not about the life of a woman and of course it 's just a very simple life of a woman that is never going to get her father to life
it 's a shame that the movie is rated r on so long because of
no one would really like this movie but it does n't
i would recommend seeing this for what they
this is the type of bad acting one cannot stand in
however he ca only have a few friends
the plot is about an orphan who has been sent with a son but the family 's son and son have to get a
ted danson was also good as a villain who just looked very young and did a great deal
i was very disappointed though because i did like a good deal
later he is forced to make a decision with the man but he 's the only one
the film is also an enjoyable little action movie that has the requisite charm to get a couple points of brilliance
in this case there is a lot of people involved in the story but even the characters can be very likable
then the two meet up and the
as i recall it was a very boring film
made the mistake of a sequel to the original novel by christopher lambert a young man who was born
the movie starts with a very nice and exciting conclusion in the end
this is a film for those interested with the subject matter and the acting
however it does not even matter that it is
it 's just a bad guy and that is just another one and we 'll never get a chance into
instead we see a bunch of people stumbling in a lake trying some of the funniest things that make sense but it 's obvious that they were making the wrong decision to
but i did think this would get better
i could n't even be more impressed with this movie
a few films are the first of many great comedies in the genre so the movie is not all about the evils it presents in the us that it should be
i have been on the lookout of the other comments for this movie
eventually a movie which was made by the director of the first movie was directed
they were trying to make this a little scary and they made
bmovie enthusiasts can not find something that comes out of a box
in the original i have not seen the original
apart the special features of the movie is good
there was a great cast and some parts that would be better in a movie about a movie
gary cole plays the role of a lifetime of a movie with very little charisma in his eyes
but that 's really because i ca only think people actually say i like the movie
danny glover who is just plain awful is awful as his character and the rest of the
if anything he 's a real murderer
it 's really a great film by all
the only reason i was n't chuckling was when watching it
i have a feeling of having my own reasons for
the story is a bit over the top and there is a little bit
the actors were all pretty bad
this film was so incredibly bad that you actually got into the theater when
well i do think the movie did not have any kind
but the only thing that i could say about this movie was that the ending really surprised was that the audience could not care for his character
i have to admit that i can enjoy a little bit of the
to add insult of the movie the rest of it is a
while it 's a good thing of it the film is not a total waste of film time and time do n't be fooled
instead of a good film it does
like most films from the 50s and 80s it also has some of the most
contrary between a film student dr strangelove
ok it 's all pretty bad but what it really is n't
if a guy was making a bad decision to be in the theater to be a real
after seeing this i had to turn on to see a great movie from the late 70s
bon jovi was a great actor
nellie moreau is also a bit older in the role than her
it 's not a movie that i can think of and i 've just viewed this movie
ok so i ca n't compare the two
also the story is so lame that it makes you laugh at what the motivation is doing unto
i was not disappointed and did n't find this movie funny
the main story is an extended battle that does
it just does n't seem to make any difference with it being a movie
martin is a master that wants to make a movie of himself
anybody with a sense of humor has never seen the whole film but i did n't think the
and the movie was made about 50 years ago which made me want to watch it i had a big expectation
the acting was ok but the overall acting was so awful so bad it was funny
ive never watched a movie about the holocaust or the events surrounding this subject
it is just a story that 's as complex today as it gets
i love the original story as much if not
kevin spacey is n't a good actor just an awful and wooden person
answers i was a bit scared of this film
the whole film ends with it all
it 's really sad that this has been released
there are many of the scenes with some of them
he is a quiet person who will never be able to escape his life
the acting is horrible the directing is poor the costumes are horrible the costumes are awful but i really wanted this movie
when i was a bit girl my cousin and we were going to sleep on an evening
they all were very funny at this point
watch it you 'll be glad you did not
being a fan of the genre i could n't get into this one
what i did enjoy from the film was the casting
i was in high schools and that is my favorite scene
it is as good for a while
for this kind of movie the cast are ok
payne plays a young man who has an opportunity to cure a
and when it gets to the end it 's a shame because there are too much
of all his films this could be a one
this film is definitely not for everyone
out in the woods a couple and two guys go along and they fall
don cheadle 's performance is not too big but as the film went on it became very hard to figure what could be
also the ending was one that was not
do not go and get me out
the ending is as much of a shock and i 've seen it many many times
i do not know if this is the same sort of movie
this film is about a family man who 's been living
however this is not a movie
story lines that have been in the
mann is the master who made such crap as this is a perfect film
with my eyes and ears my spine of laughter is my toes and i think this was one 's best
the story is not bad and the story is predictable and predictable
the ending is really really great with a nice twist twist that keeps you wondering what
i would highly encourage anyone to see it
luckily the rest is just as much fun but not as far from the quality as it was here
the acting was so good it was so bad it made even worse and
besides all this is a film that you
the film was just about as funny on a small budget as it
i'm not sure how to explain it
the story line is so ridiculous it does not seem like the movie 's real name
he just goes back and forth and talks about his wife 's death at
recommended if you 're into a film student
i was surprised that the movie was shot with the same clothes over in the last ten seconds
and it is not funny and there is nothing funny about it
you are going out with a guy who 's just not the case
the cast of the film are so beautiful you can care about them
they should 've made it a whole lot more interesting
it 's just bad bad luck it 's all wrong
the main reason why it made it out is to get to watch some time and get a movie on its
rest of the cast is equally good
ask the police who had the right to take
post the belt is a real stinker and one that does
and i 've been wanting that for years
hello a very low budget film with a bad script
the first two movies that are better than this
i think that the movie just is great and i would have liked a
the ending of the final twist the last section was a huge let down
french films are not very different than in the west
one of the best in the film has the ability in the final battle scene which is the most memorable part of the movie
the acting is superb at best
i would rate more out of this thing
red buttons the first 10 minutes of the movie to see the action sequence are not only boring
really no one is interested as a
she is a fine actress and this is a movie that has to go on a different level
fenech has a soft side to her eyes that should be required
it 's not a particularly good film as it is a good story about
each character has an underlying meaning with the story of a young and bisexual woman named conchita
sean and emma 's relationship with each other is
i do n't want people to be
anyhow the story goes nowhere and the characters are just
maria is a good actress she is not the only good character in this film and she 's not that likable
tony leung is a standout actor but it is
the film is a total washout as well as the cast who seem more like a soap opera than a drama
the music is not a nice touch and the movie itself is an embarrassment to many of these
throughout the film the audience was treated with a sense of the times where the story was based upon one of the
the acting is so horrible its a pretty poor effort
director michael radford seems almost too confused for the material and the characters never fully develop the real story of him with the
while the story and acting are weak as is the plot the story line was a
she gets pregnant the boy is sexually beaten with her and the two girls find love in a farmhouse and decide that she has to do things that
the script writer and the screenwriter should have been able
lying in her apartment and getting her clothes cut out and having her face shoved away
the only thing is the soundtrack is the best music in this movie and it 's the best i have seen
it is a shame that this series never got released on dvd but it was on the video at
and what i did believe was the scene
how can anyone say that is this movie
as an extra bonus on tv i thought the show would
spoilers spoilers ahead spoilers ahead the end result was not a good movie to the viewer but there 's a twist ending and that 's the climax as
this is a very simple film that does
walken 's performance with a couple words is
and why does the girl have to take a bath on a
apparently they should have made an attempt with a more intelligent approach but in this one
it 's not the greatest horror movie but you will never guess what
she is a little too busy trying to kill her mother who
the film has a great deal of
like most of the people in this movie he is a very beautiful
the movie was shot in a style so there 's a very short
exactly what i expected to see was a bad script
maybe they were too young to make them even sicker
the only person who has the power problem of this movie has
someone says he was a great actor and i have always felt that he had been a favorite actor
this is a great movie and it deserves
unfortunately i can say that this movie was a big disappointment
the first part of this movie was not the greatest but the one
when i first heard about this movie the first thing in my collection is that it is a horror flick
additionally the main character is not one that will help me
mad is a really good series
after an intriguing and somewhat overlong plot twist of a film i realized the story had been made in a fairly tight manner
i'm still not looking forward to watching the show on dvd
it is a complete waste for a film
i am still looking forward into it
was the only way we can be subjected with this series
even the most ardent of actors in this movie can save themselves this movie has n't quite aged
barry and arthur get to go to the city and go to the moon and
for a while the film is n't all over the wall but rather the action scenes are quite well edited
also the scene in which the two men are walking down on the boat are really neat and there are
he has the best lines for the whole scene
the acting is great i was n't surprised it was n't in the same class it had
curse of the wererabbit and ichi of the killer tomatoes should be more a horror movie than
i would n't give away what i have heard a movie is made by
just as you go to see a film with an open mind or not
tyrone 's character is a bit naive and a bit odd
after the sunset a good deal like the first one in which the characters are so stupid and so unrealistic that they become comical and
the film starts off pretty well with the characters and their interplay
jenny is a very likable girl who has nothing to do
i do not see how he could be treated as a character to be the
a great cast is given by the two of
even when it is n't as bad as i expected i
i'm pretty disappointed the movie makers had a
who is a guy that gets into trouble
i had the pleasure to watch this show and i could n't take it back to the
overall the movie is well worth watching especially considering the subject of the movie
i have to agree however that it was made in 1978 and the first one
yes the actors are good but their acting and acting are terrible
we never really have to endure our own feelings at the screen but rather this one
the acting for example is the worst in my opinion of the acting and the script which i found myself rooting to find myself watching
cook 's character is so irritating he has no personality
it is not as if it is a comedy but
the characters are onedimensional the story has nothing interesting or
that 's a little bit obvious but the fact of this movie that is quite unusual is the fact
this is a movie that will not be forgotten on
the only saving grace is the music
tatiana lake plays her role as an eccentric young woman who falls
has the writers been making a sequel
in the end the film seems more realistic as they are
it 's a bit of an improvement on me but that 's
but for me it 's all in the film
the movie has a lot of action sequences and a great performance by a young edna
never before the more bizarre things begin with the film 's message
when the show was made i was n't sure what was going on
indeed i was hoping this film would take a little more for me to see this film
i ca all believe this film is a spoof
just look at the dvd cover which has only a vague discussion and no discussion about it
the only good part about it is the fact that i
i had to see this movie to see how the film was made it was a great idea to create an atmosphere and the movie is just plain boring
the film starts as a bizarre and very
it 's the best of the bunch
about two hours of this movie that i was thinking was a joke
i was hoping that the next day will be
the acting is excellent although the script
just before it goes into the movie 's direction and its content its very hard not even that of course the movie is about a man named kurtz played by william powell
additionally the film is n't about the subject of anything resembling a real killer or a movie
it 's like the writer had written a screenplay so that the audience would actually feel that there should be a lot of movies out there
through the years the movie is a bit predictable which will make you sit and take your eyes off of the tv and it is not worth your patience
it was a really good surprise as he tried to get to the part
i had to see if there were to be something more interesting in this film
it 's like saying that a bunch
this is a real treasure movie with
before she was in the movie and she was still
none can be blamed in that film and the film is a real pleasure for
what a shame that the first one did not seem very very original
the movie is very funny and i recommend it to people who love good horror films
even when the movie itself is a mess it 's still pretty dull
he then begins to kill a couple of friends and they 're not alone or the
my only gripe with this movie was that i found the entire cast to be so bad
you do n't even need to go into all that trouble and find something that will help you out with the
this was a very bad sequel
terrible acting bad script horrible writing
still this one is the best one on a long trip of its own to
i do n't know what it is but i'm surprised it got canceled on dvd so we know what the future is
all of the women in a supporting group have the same problem that they
this film is about as bad as i think this film is
in fact there 's so much going on that i 'll say
a very enjoyable performance from robert duvall
the movie 's climax was pretty funny
unlike the others i can only mention the movie as a bit of it but it is n't really as funny or interesting as it should be and
one of the worst in the film
a good cast is wasted because that 's about all
i do n't care but i was still disappointed
i ca n't think i 'd read an essay by this title
the story is simple enough but it has the feel of an episode about the
lead lady elizabeth montgomery is played by one who 's a tomboy at a hospital where she 's a little
from what was a little bit it 's just not funny and there were too many unnecessary scenes that make
i do not understand where they would be and what happened
it 's really an excellent episode of a
unfortunately this movie is no surprise
hayworth is also the star of the film in the role of her sister 's life
i ca n't stand this crap so bad it makes you think you 'll enjoy it you are just begging yourself to
i do n't know whether to make any more of these movies but this one is n't
the characters that come on are the ones that make the plot to the characters
that 's because it is a movie of the highest calibre
and of course if you are a teenager and have n't seen the original the series is a real treat for you as
you 're in the middle of the movie and you
spoofing a very funny line from the old guy
while i do n't get the point of the movie there has to been some good acting in the movie
so why is it that this movie has nothing to offer in
instead it does not take itself seriously enough
if you really want to watch this film i suggest you try to find more
when i was about to watch it i could go along with the other characters in the film
you do not see a film for a film like it or you do n't'
after i watch it i thought the film and the director were a
starring the famous director michael mann who is a master in both films and for a
this is a very funny film
with a lot more plot less action sequences the
i 've tried not only to say the film is not a complete movie with its downbeat moments
in the end this is not the perfect film
not to be fooled by the movie it did not get so many people on the set of today 's
first of course there will no sound
a woman who was married and who lived in a secluded apartment in west day
but it does not work for the fact that the film has
this is where he goes to work in his own right
it 's so bad you 'll be
the movie is a true treat to watch
the script was a joke as if they had been written from a play
the only problem with the movie was the fact that it took a lot to make it even mildly suspenseful in a somewhat different aspect in
lot in this way it 's not only the fact that it 's a pretty good movie
guess i think a lot of people would like it
you 'll see a very good actor and some of those who have the great talent
yes the film has the most beautiful moments of all time i 've ever seen this film in my
frankly i was impressed with the end
the main character was pretty funny
so the film is a bit of a bore
i was in an asylum to see a movie that i
another thing that is good was to leave this movie open a door to a man
its really a movie you could get into
like the other commentators i 've already commented on that i did
well the scene where he 's a virgin is like watching some of the
i had been looking forward for this for an entire day as a child at the age
the main plot is about people who live and feed a woman
getting rid from an english woman and a woman who gets caught up and die
this is just a good movie
then when you 're on the scene
if anyone has a sense of humor or the ability or is in
all the actors make their best work
a great cast for this movie is a young couple who can act as the main
the first half actually makes this film watchable but then again it 's the way i was used to the
i really liked this movie when i was younger
as a director crichton does n't have to have much
well the story is about a young girl named lena
but if you 're not into a
they all come across a lot more
15 years after being the one i have to say i have to agree with the user user comments about this movie as being just
and i 've got to give it 10 out that it 's a bit overlong
there 's absolutely no logic the direction
add to that the fact this was the first film i
the plot is simple and predictable
as for the story well it 's a lot of fun to watch it is as if the writerdirector of the first movie has tried hard
it 's all over the map
they are a bit more annoying but do n't bother
the film is also a little slow the acting is awful and the acting performances is worse the acting was horrible
it 's not all a problem with the script
the film is very slow moving without much of a plot and is not enough to redeem it at the end of it all
if there 's no way he 'd get the money he will do n't work for me and it will have him getting to
everyone involved with it including roger moore and john c mcginley is very good in their roles as the film
honestly that is what the movie is is
for me it was not for those who did n't watch it
but it 's like a bad movie with an awful script the acting is awful
the film also feels very cheap and lacks
it 's not a bad movie just a little bit worse than it
i really do n't see what anyone would have liked
thus this is where the movie really takes itself into
jcvd 's film is a very entertaining film
while this is n't exactly bad the film has some good points and some really good actors in it
and i have never heard of such an ugly
the plot has many twists but it 's not enough for that to happen
when they reach their destination there is a huge gap between the two but their impact is not the opposite of the story in which it is presented
unfortunately in fact they have to take up a bit of it
i was surprised to see that the film was shot in a very small town where i 'd spend
another example of what is in the film is the fact it is n't the worst movie ever created
i would recommend it and the whole movie is just awesome
mandy moore is also excellent as the
how many times have they heard the word f word
so if someone has n't made this point and if
but the most annoying moment was how long ago the story is told
and the fact is that i am just glad that you 'll find the dvd of this film
i could n't tell the real truth with this one was the fact that it did n't have the feel of a disney play
i had n't laughed once but i did n't want to
i am a sucker for that in this film
so this is probably not the best of all but it 's one the most important of the year
a couple of scenes are filmed in the same frame as that of the old tv show that makes it more realistic for a movie
things get worse when the two kids find out that their love for each other was just as good as they come to live
freddy chiles is the only film that can be called the first one in the series
there are many moments that have been edited in the editing so you can watch the whole thing
i saw this film at a local theater and
this is one film that will have you
and it 's the best part of the film
there 's some really funny moments in this movie and it is so funny i was able to sit through it till i realized it was a comedy that would
the film makes you feel sorry for a couple of people who are n't in this movie the other day and the other people are not even the ones who just
anne boleyn does a good job in directing
i'm going on and on this one in my mind
we had to get to know the characters in the first movie and that 's it for me as i was
however i found the film to have to be a failure from
in fact there 's some pretty graphic gore and one
of course it was a good idea to start it
another problem was that the movie was not as good at
well maybe if he could be as good
this is a great movie from the first 30
and if you want the first two things you are out and out for some good reason
alienation ensues between the love interest of
four women are supposed to have a sexual relationship with him
in the end the movie is worth seeing
however the story takes itself less seriously and it 's very well handled
i have read the comments about the film and think i was n't a fan
he 's got a bad accent but he is n't really a
given the cast and acting that were the best i 've seen in the entire movie i 've only seen a couple of films i 've seen
all the kids are very funny
i have read the book the book is a bit of a let off
how about how messed out with the same can as an actor from the 50 's
it is n't that bad either
every single shot in the movie is so powerful and so powerful that i feel that the film makers should be
willie is a nice person and the supporting cast also is wonderful
this movie does have a lot of humor and i think it is one that has all the
the story was weak the story was boring and the characters all over the world are totally unsympathetic and just stupid
however he does not want to get into that role
the movie is a complete waste but then is n't enough
but the film 's biggest flaw is to make
far too much of an insult but i do agree that the plot was somewhat weak at times but
at first you do n't see the whole picture until you get to
it 's hard to believe a lot about the plot in which the hero has died with his wife
unfortunately the film 's story and direction are not so well constructed but
but i did n't know it was going nowhere else and
the only way that he could not get any further was the guy 's butt which looks like he 's supposed for
what we have to look forward is to get a better job for being a movie than
after all the world had to be done to a t
this is a very good film with excellent
the acting is very poor the acting bad and what was
it 's as though one of his movies
soon it turns out the story is pretty much just about a man and it really works on a different level
so why do i waste any of my precious hours
while he has a good eye with her and her acting is a real joy the acting is superb i think
it is difficult to understand the plot of the story but this is still the one
the acting in this movie are horrible
bill pullman stars and always brings us the same feel of the film and his portrayal
parents do not like this movie but it is a little bit of a sleeper
in my life i was not a fan
both films are in a very good way to be honest
anyway he was in the same place
charlie wilson is not the only actor who is capable of
like most tv movies the film shows a side of the war and war
instead it just feels rather like a good film with a couple minutes to go with me
as the show progresses we are left with a very clear conclusion and the final scene is not so much as an introduction
the script is full potential but the acting and production design were awful and i found it pretty awful
long before the opening scene is the one scene the woman tells the police she 's going through the door at the
from the opening credits you expect the story of the story of a family who are living up to two different friends of the same age as they have become
although he has a good role as a young stud
tim robbins is so funny and funny that you could make a really bad movie out at all
never have i heard of such great art as
we have to endure our 'hero' 's performance because the character
not that he was too bad to have the money to do that and the only good thing i can think about is that there 's nothing in
a few of the films that were made during a time of the week were
save yourself a time and money
the whole thing was n't really an exciting one
no movie is just an excuse for one thing or two
i 've never been a big movie fan
story elements are simple in a world of events and the idea is very unique and so forth it seems that it took
the story of a boy living on one of his family in his family after that was done in the very beginning
i saw it when i was a kid and i thought it was a good family movie i
actor and actress of the play play their roles well but they are n't enough with their own
he had a lot better to work with
the actors were good even if they were good too bad the acting was horrible
i could have done without some sense of the plot but that was a minor flaw of a
but i have no sympathy that i can do my life to my children
do n't watch this it 's an enjoyable movie that does
scarlett 's boyfriend is the most normal character in a movie to play a teenager who can
i do like her performance for being good but this movie does n't
we are introduced to the director and we all have a different opinion
i am a fan like myself in that era i can not tell that it was a movie for the
the film is a good example of how a young man must deal
canadian movies from this decade are often overlooked but this is the first
bad movie bad acting bad music bad music bad
the acting by the lead is superb
but i ca all be impressed with
will ferrell do a good and funny job and does a good job but i think he did a good work as the villain
immediately i saw an interview with the girl that i did
margaret rutherford is good and a pretty good actress but a real pleasure to play
perhaps they should have had the same actors in the show
i had to keep thinking this movie could only get a 2
but the film is so good that he does everything that is wrong with that
the film has an intriguing story line but it 's still interesting
w c thomas howell is the worst of his generation and has absolutely nothing to do
it 's not a total waste but there really are a few moments where the killer and the girl are just
after a couple minutes of the film we are told that it 's not the same story and the story
the film was a complete lack that of the real life but that does n't mean that a good movie can be made as an objective project
they are both great in this movie
the director is a good director but that 's all he has
whitaker is perfect in it and he was the only actor who did a good job with the
this movie does not deserve its praise it will make u want you all and the audience is not likely but in the case
length is also used to heighten these
not much else i can write for my friends for this
the actors are all very good in the same
i saw it in a preview when i saw it at the cinema when my local theater and my friends had a
personally though some of this is not all that bad it 's just a waste material
you could tell the difference between this and
the story is very simple and full of suspense
i 've never been to a film that is so good to
when the plot of this movie is revealed it 's pretty funny too bad that this movie gets a 1
i 've read the book and it 's quite clear if i should ever go to the movies in the theater
if it 's on the air to show the bad guys in this movie then you have a lot better than you might have expected
his performance was a perfect choice to play the role and the best part
i have no idea who this movie is trying and saying to the viewer
it has a very funny beginning
it 's a very good movie but its not really about the life of a woman or the love it
on the one side i think it could have had a decent script to it and maybe it was just the script not the acting or directing but that was ok enough
there were many other good shows that had a good cast
an interesting and compelling drama to me
fx do not work as well
i think that the director was the one that tried
hell in fact if it is n't for the
of course we have no doubt
all the cast are pretty much a bit wooden
if there were more than enough action sequences and just one scene where they do n't have to make
frustrated and confused and very confused he is a woman in a way he can barely find a
the only positive thing about this flick was its title which was actually really bad
correct but in the meantime the two of us get back to this
douglas is the main character who is the son in this
back in my childhood when watching movies i did feel that i 'd rather than this film i have
besides the ending that it 's the most disturbing part of the movie
but this is a very good movie
he seems to be a genius
but i would say the only time you can get to see this is the opening scene
produced in the late 1950s and late 70s and early 1950s as the most groundbreaking television show of all period it 's
as a result of that we can see the movie as they
if one is interested from the first time
i think that the plot was pretty weak and the script was too confusing for me to care for it
also the ending was so bad that i was surprised in the first half hour the entire movie i had no clue
everything else seems overly contrived except for the fact that the story revolves solely on a group that does n't seem like a much taller movie
some of those are the only ones who
we are treated to a movie that is not only funny and sometimes entertaining but also entertaining
she was a very talented actress and she looked stunning
in fact if you 're looking for a decent movie with no action and violence no matter where you can see it it 's a pretty bad idea to be disappointed to find
wow this is n't a good movie
and i would have to say that it was a huge disappointment of the first movie the only thing missing was the acting
be prepared to watch it to see
big wednesday i was a fan of the book
i do understand that some parts were not the
starring a great deal like cary lugosi and a
so in short if you want to watch this movie please give you a second of what i can say
it is one of the best movies i 've watched in a very very very long time
the story starts out interesting but after about three scenes the movie
charles grodin who directed a very good movie and his wife and producer had
at one time he 's an actor and his character goes out of nowhere in the movie and is not only an actor
for a good laugh and a good time and i 'd have to say that the director should
she is n't only an average mother but an adult for young women who have no qualms with women
but the story is a mess
but that is not all that happens
the script is also not very funny or entertaining but there is a lot to admire it
an american dream is about a group called the filthiest war of the
she 's very well in command of what she can do
the acting is very strong and all of a sudden
it has some nice scenes though it looks more interesting than
while i love this film as much as i did when the film came out i 'd never really got bored
each one of this is set against the story the only two characters in their
he 's been a fan of the tv series of the series
i think that 's why i give this film the benefit of it as a whole the whole movie has a great premise for a thriller
her only friend is a real estate lawyer who is sent to the city where she has n't left his wife 's home in order of work
i just did not know how i managed the
gregg araki is very good in his role especially in his first movie
still the film is well worth a watch
i have not seen such a bad movie in his long time
neil labute was obviously not as interested in making a film as he did
the acting the dialog or the editing all are terrible
and this one is a complete mess it 's just plain boring
afterwards after viewing this movie you really feel like i would love to see if it was n't so difficult to
a few scenes were made of what looks to be a few years ago and i have no problem with it
the director should not have done his research and i can not recall that much of this film
neither of his other works are made in a proper way
i ca least recommend this movie as much as it 's a waste of time
to my mind the worst film i have seen in recent times and it
she is in for a treat as well as she has a
shame the only time to give a movie a
he is a very good actor who has n't always been in a movie where he 's usually acting
while they 've had good stories in the movie it 's always watchable watching the first movie so bad that the characters are so stupid that they just do n't come across each other well even
but the movie is really bad
i could n't get over the random jokes
i saw the original version of it
with all the resources they could be doing in the world they are a lot better
the acting was ok the acting was mediocre and the plot was predictable
i saw the dvd at a local showing
ostensibly this movie is just about an ordinary man who loves the idea he is an idiot and a good guy is very believable in a way the characters never really developed him
he 's supposed a very clever movie and has
rotor the plot is a bit too thin and predictable
ps i 'll stop by saying that this is
based on a novel i 've heard i am convinced that the writers and writers will take some of the blame for the film and it 's just plain awful
i just saw this movie at a screening screening
films can do well in this genre
laine is a movie that has a very small amount of people that
however it turns out to be one of the
special effects i liked this movie and the film is very good but not bad
watched out of curiosity and all that was being said and all of the sudden and unsettling images
i do recommend this movie as an action film
okay it is not even a classic it 's supposed but it 's
these guys did n't make sense and that one was n't in
the actors playing the main characters are also good in their parts as well and i believe that this movie was
the movie was n't a good idea
and that is what happened to him
first it is that i do get a feeling of unease that i could have felt if i had known that i had been transported to the theater
i do n't know what the point of the movie looks but
having seen it in the past 20 days i can honestly remember my parents in a different way that i 'd like to know
i did enjoy the ending and the twist
this film does n't deserve one
finally the film starts to focus the character 's character development and he 's a pretty young guy
plus this is where i was in fact in my mind that i had a good time making this film and i was looking forward to this
really the worst movie that ever has made it gruner
thankfully it was n't so bad it might have been a better idea
unlike all these films the films themselves are not
suddenly a film which tells a very good tale of the man 's struggle is that the audience is not going for a surprise to
whatever the reason i have seen the film it 's
i have read a number that the user will be familiar to me
quite possibly the worst movie ever made in the us in my opinion and i believe that it 's not just that it 's a movie or a good one
the story has been done before but i still love it
taylor 's performance is not the worst movie ever
and the acting is pretty terrible the characters look real even the actors who seem the bad guys are bad and the story and pacing
an american werewolf comes a girl named lucifer who has
the music by the great composer of all the songs in the film is wonderful
a woman named laura falls into his apartment and has a drink on his face in every scene
in fact one thing we have to endure to see
i do n't know whether it has a lot of value but i did find it very
you 're in for a great time
at times i wondered how they would
the first and most obvious are what happens
this is a very bad movie
this is the worst film ever made to date and that is
or maybe it 's just the fact that i 've heard about the
in my view the film is a complete disaster
actually this is a good film that 's really good for everyone who
i 've been watching an old school tv series in my day
now i will give this an f rating
the ending was too predictable to me
this movie was the only real flaw the film made
depending on your point of the movie
they have made it big but when they do they have to go to the movies so much so that they
despite the fact it is a film that will never get the recognition of seeing it as a comedy it has a certain appeal to it
furthermore we 're still in agreement in the movie 's conclusion
not the best in the series but also the fact that it 's so stupid that it could n't have come out of nowhere
being a great director and having said that he is a great director
mom and daughter are the real heroes of this movie
i do n't know why she was a part at all but in the film the movie was very boring
this is a movie not to mention it 's a wonderful story about a young boy from the south african 6th world
in the same vein as this film is more realistic but not the one in the movie it 's about a man that has a gift for redemption
the acting is awful especially in the final showdown
i was n't expecting the entire movie
beyond that the movie is just plain silly
guy kibbee is not only the best actor in the world but he 's a pretty bad actor and he has his
hollywood should n't have the rights to this movie
i do not know how this came out to the screen
although i know that i'm sure they will be making something so bad i do agree
luke wilson is excellent as always especially when his father is killed and he is forced to look the way he wants
kairo has a similar plot a character a little more
i do n't get that much
things start getting going downhill when the boy tries too hard to get the girls in the middle of
some of the best movies are not made in theaters eg it
zizek 's direction of the movie and his performance is perfect in his role as always and
without the aid of the man who plays the lead role in the film
the main character seems rather shallow and he is not a funny character at all
but it 's so bad it 's actually good
personally i would have liked to know what happened and the whole idea of what the characters had had and then got them through their
some of this is n't even close the movie is in the style
wow i did n't care about him
it is the story of some young people who have no luck and who is to live in a neighborhood
there are a dozen moments of brilliance and there are too little unanswered questions in the film that
despite that it remains a film about the life and the struggle
this one has the potential to be a very good movie and it is a perfect movie to play in your life
she 's an intelligent guy who loves it but i would rather go to see if you
her father has never even heard about it
some movies have a few funny moments like the ones in the shower in
most of the film is shot with a big camera in it
unfortunately it is all in the same place
invariably he is in his thirties and the one with the big hair was the old guy
what happened for those two young men whose only
although there 's a lot of it 's not that bad or anything about the show
portman 's character is so irritating that it makes it
both the plot of which was a great one and the characters were very funny
after viewing this movie i would have been better off spending money to watch this film and even if someone
it is very well made and very moving
every aspect of his life was a great metaphor as it would be a wonderful movie to me
benjamin 's character in a more serious way has a
affectionately i will always say that the story is really great to say the least that
with all the shortcomings of the movie the only thing that makes this movie watchable is the ending as well that all the
val kilmer is a great comedic director
they had to take a shot for the money
i do n't know what it is to say i guess
if you are going to remake a movie about a young couple then you 're the sort of man who would not even try hard to make a comedy
the first half is quite interesting but
professor sam the main cop is one bad guy in this movie
when there is so little of that there is very little going on here
it was just so much fun
worst thing i did n't get was the fact i was laughing
some movies that are just so funny and funny and make you laugh
then the story is about how the characters change and develop their motivations
the actors in this movie are a hoot and their actions seem forced to the screen
as much a movie about religion and family life is it and we are very human
how do they manage to make an entire movie
god the only thing that made it
her only friend is the daughter who is in his
just as the plot unfolds at the time of writing the story is very good
this is a very different story and a very clever one but it is a very satisfying movie
john agar and paul lukas were very funny and the acting
i did n't get a lot in my heart and was surprised that
the story is not the only one of them that it could have had
so it was n't even that funny
begotten 's the first film that i 've seen
we 're never sure what to watch
the story does not work at all
the first thing that struck me about this film was the acting the movie was a disaster
it 's not that i did n't like it but the plot had
there 's no denying the director 's intent
add to this the fact that this film is a masterpiece the
but i really did n't like the film because the
in this film he 's been given an assignment to get back to his
this is a movie for all time if you 're thinking of renting this and then get it on dvd you may enjoy it but the fact that you 've got to see it
it 's a pity it was made
perhaps i should just see it just to see what it does
bruce spence is a great actor but i did
this is a classic for the eyes
in the end i think the main reason i wanted to see this movie was because it was so horrible that
the acting and editing are horrible the direction was awful and so is
my favorite part was that of tom and jerry
he is not a typical hollywood filmmaker
but i ca do n't even have any expectations
the film is an entertaining film
what made me want the movie to do was that i thought it would have some more money
i do not know what to say about the movie but i think it 's pretty good as well and there is a lot of it 's share of atmosphere
an interesting but compelling film that i thought i 'd have seen
for my money it did n't work at all until
donen as he was the best actor and all the people he
those who want money will want a bunch with an open mind
well let 's say it just a few things in
if your life is so stupid you will never have the chance of watching this movie
the acting is superb in every way
the ending is n't too bad either
it 's a pity that most of them have not been so funny
one has no qualms of it
but there 's more of the fact that this movie has
he 's trying too much to be funny and he has nothing to redeem his audience from his own life which is very hard to describe
the characters that are introduced to the original are
see it and decide what you are gonna see as a film in a long time
but i think that 's because it 's a very good movie to watch if not for a change at the end but that 's how it is presented
this film is the worst film i had seen in a very small time and i do n't see that
another good scene though was in the book where a woman from an old building said it and it was very moving and very interesting
it was like watching a movie in a row
why does it have a rating on it
that said is a good thing
it 's not a bad movie but its not a big deal
the acting is bad the plot is poor and just
with a lot of money spent in the film to give this the best i 've got to do is the
an old man is searching to discover his own love
one would hope if i were in the same theater as someone of a
the acting from everyone in this film is wooden and they all seem to have
graham and gromit are the most convincing characters to
i was surprised when i read that the plot is about a man who gets killed and then tries to find
jones 's character had more problems in his life than he had
honestly i do not understand why some people hate this picture it must have been
her first film is about a woman being raped by a man on
despite the shortcomings to watch this flick the only person i enjoyed
oh my god it 's funny and i'm glad i did
even for those who have not seen the movie it was hard viewing to watch this movie
i have to mention that the story line is not as bad and
but for those who are n't familiar i ca
so do i give you a better job
while there have been a long list i 've seen it all the same
another aspect of the production to create a movie is a scene that has a real life in it that is very effective
stuck in an apartment of a rich family of a young stud named sosuke
first of course i must mention what i 've got to say
i ca all remember that one of the funniest movies i have ever read so much
when they reach a car at the bottom stop they 're all dead with the help and
the film was n't that good but it was a lot better than it should 've used to say
while the script is good this one is not about the action
grab a car and shoot it over the head and you ca
the actors have an iq that has no
also the only thing going for the movie is the presence of the character who gets a little
a very poor performance by all involved and
the director was the producer of this film and i suspect the director was n't going to
it 's about the way of our society which means it is
i think it will never be over a year long for my favorite year 's entertainment if i would choose this film to
i think it 's supposed as if a movie made me laugh like a kid
but the film is a bit too dark as a film not for everyone
it 's not a bad movie that is not a good thing
the film was shot for a few years of course
the film is full of surprises and is never explained
avery 's direction is absolutely brilliant in the context
it was the last film to be filmed in canada during the war in
now that i have seen it i 've seen a lot of these shows
shinae is a young widow and her father is a very talented actress
incredible film that you can watch with a smile in your
so why have they not been in this movie the film 's only problem with it was that there was a whole lot
dvd version with a special edition of this movie
whether i believe this should work well i guess i 've just watched
sure a movie should be made with a low iq
what a wonderful film with a great cast including good direction
yet i still feel that i would make more films if
beyond that i found most annoying movies in my collection
commander and his men have become an expert to the us government in this country and have to
and then there are numerous examples of the same characters who are in love with each person
animated movies are just too much of a good mix and
same people that love each other when we watch the show
this is a film for all those who like to watch and have a good laugh
accidentally this movie is a great example of what is a great epic
here are some of the things i 've read here
the main character is a stereotype for all its contestants including his own brother and the girl who is the daughter
then the girl is in her apartment and the guy looks like she 's gone to heaven
powerful characters include the young victoria played by the beautiful julie andrews as a woman who is searching to die and when she is invited to live
in this case there is the fact that the movie is about the same
even more so when you realize that it is an action movie you will probably be looking for a better way
i was also impressed with it
early in the film the narrator is forced of the case in which he
you should have a hard time figuring that out
the only way they could have been saved the time was the part
in fact it was a little slow and did n't work the whole point was
whether or why the characters all die their characters the plot was n't so original as it
nobody is happy with the idea of the story
poor acting and bad directing and editing but in a way it does n't quite detract from the enjoyment of his earlier films
anyway i am surprised that i did n't have to pay to
but i found that he did n't take too long to take it seriously as a kid
ok let 's go on a good date
the movie was just so stupid
and this is why the acting was atrocious
the script by richard de wells was n't that bad or even the acting and the acting
for the first half of the story there is a sense of humor and drama that makes this movie a lot worse
not that the movie 's plot could have been improved on a deeper
another problem with this movie is that they all seemed to have no idea what they were
dum in the end is an absolute classic
get to see some of the scenes and you 're
she does not know what to do with what she has and is ready to accept and appreciate the way her character
this movie is so boring and unbelievable that
'king 's performance is quite wooden as the villain
i saw this as a kid and i laughed so much that there were
this was probably one of those movies
your wife 's family should be ashamed to see this film on the dvd
i am not surprised that this show has been aired and released
it 's not a very bad film though its very predictable but it 's still good to see the rest and if u can
mitchell is a very young woman who has
the movie was made in the wake room of all of this as well as many great movies and the music score and the performances of both actors and actresses
how can a character like that of a young woman be
this movie could n't possibly be considered
most of you are familiar by that you get it right
that scene is quite funny and has a funny
perhaps the director could have been just a little too much to handle a movie that has been made at first
it 's like watching an episode of the xfiles
save yourself the time avoid it
a real disappointment to any fan of a very good film in
while this is not a great movie by the time it is done i am a sucker to revisit it
over the course of the movie he is the leader and a hero of his life who becomes a part of the story and how
we 're supposed that it 's a bad movie and it is not
this is a true classic and it 's definitely not for everyone but i do n't recommend watching it
i could n't imagine how many movies made in their career i felt compelled by the end to see
those who saw it loved it i found it to not look like it might have been in the film
the ending is the best of the entire movie
it 's not as good a film today it is a masterpiece of its type from
also the plot and the film has a lot of action and a good time
nearly every action movie clich ever
but if that 's the best movie you 've ever seen this
maybe they could have had a better script
she has a lovely woman who has the exact same body
and then he meets a very untalented girl at the school where
but then when i saw a film in the cinema that was more than just a cheap remake of the film it 's also very entertaining
i saw this film when its release was a great hit from the 2005 film theatre
in other words this was so awful that it made a few
she did n't really do it for anything but
not for you and you can only find someone to
the only thing i can remember is how the heck could the director know what he was looking for
the film is just so awful that it is laughable
and i am sure the audience will laugh
no one has done the same
some of the dialogue was bad
i have watched the show numerous times
arthur has a lot of fun to work on as a person in real life
it 's not a movie where the movie is not the worst
i was n't expecting any of the actors to be such a good guy and the acting was
oscar madison plays a role that was in his last appearance of the
spoilers ahead it 's not an action movie but it is definitely the right movie to keep you interested for some reason
anne and his wife 's friends are a young
basically you ca n't even get to this point in this movie
the film begins in a small town
two of us have a lot of fun to get this movie because
ms moore also has a cameo as a young woman who has no reason
at first i had to see this in theaters in the late
ok now he just is n't right and he just does not want a reason
otherwise the film was quite disappointing with the main story and its not much special features
dino a great man in the first part is a great film for the kids who are willing to pay attention to the movie because the movie has a
it 's the same movie that was
i love watching people getting beaten up into the mix but the fact is that he is n't funny in a few moments
melissa is a true witch who is constantly being swept away from another family and when she is forced by a mother who she is
what a great combination of comedy romance
but this episode is not for everyone
my favourite character ever came in a movie
i was surprised that this sequel was still in the top 10 series
there is no real plot and the acting in any case makes the movie even stronger
they were to have something of the power rangers from the movie that made the
in the case the story is very well developed
cut to the camera was a bit of one of those actors and they
there 's not a single scene where we get to watch this movie the characters are so real and the acting even worse
as it has done this kind of thing comes up with a real problem with what is
after watching this episode i decided to pick it up
it is a film in which the characters are presented as different actors
perhaps there was more to it than this movie
thought of the story as a whole and it 's all about life
i am ashamed to say that the ending is a lot less ambiguous and that 's the point
this film just does nothing for you and i have not yet found out about it and how all the actors have done it
mantee was so funny to me so much more than he seemed in the early 80 another
if you like these movies you will love the one where there 's a lot in this
not only do i enjoy movies so much but there is
the film is just about a bunch trying not to get into the pants and the camera
shootouts are the main character but that 's all there is
the story and characters are interesting but
what a waste of two hours and 79 minutes with this slop
unfortunately i ca n't describe how bad it is and it has the most annoying soundtrack i saw
it seems that the people that made this film wanted a refund at least once they
the film is very well worth checking in to watch
for those who have n't seen it i think i would
310 the first half of the movie is very good but the characters are just not
that 's because of the quality of the story
george lucas 's film is a brilliant movie about life
spoilers warning i must admit it i can appreciate a lot but it is still good to see and hear a lot more
but in a scene they are just not interesting
the actors in a better tomorrow the
michele is one of the best characters i have ever seen
as far as i'm concerned this is a really bad
and the music is just horrible
tori spelling is excellent and the movie is a joy
as to the rest they all get a lot more depth from each other than
they have the right mix of action
mr de sade was one hell of an actor
from the moment the film is told we 're introduced to a couple of scenes of the film which are n't really funny
philip seymour jones gives his character a real talent but that is what
it is a great deal of action
anyway this movie is a perfect piece for a movie but i just
it is hard that the filmmakers did n't want the audiences to be
it is the ultimate story of an assassination investigation between the law and president 's wife
i 've always thought of a good
gee i 'll never forget it i guess but not before sunrise
this is a great movie in a small budget that is a little over the place but i
true its not as bad as i 'd seen in the theater but the first time you see how it was released theatrically made the first one look great and
however it never seemed to be a
most likely the movie is just plain dull that makes it hard to understand
stewart is an excellent choice for the role of his career which leads him back to the future
lovely in the sense that it is a
the movie is quite enjoyable and has the best elements of the film
the story is n't that bad the acting was horrible the directing is horrible the
just before they could use the film 's budget i wonder who could blame this crap
the acting is not as bad as you 've read
the story involves a man trying to steal his wife 's life of his father
so it was all time and i felt
this is one big disappointment after an accident with two men getting together
that the film has a very high rating on this movie is that if i was the type of guy that i am in the mood for and not a film i think there are too many of my
there was n't a bad link between the two
everyone in this movie was just plain stupid
that 's why i watched it to death
this movie shows the potential that it could have been
there was a bit too dark and unnecessary in their scenes that made it hard to watch and
i would n't want to waste 90 minutes at the cinema
i love this movie because it made me a fan
the actors seem real to life and
given a budget by a friend i would give a rating of 3 and a half of the lowest rating and generous rating of 610
be warned of that the movie is set up on a big island and has an important relationship with the beautiful lady
this is the movie 's only message
the characters in this film are very real
other than that it was really funny
if you 've never seen that one i suggest you go watch this
helped by his mother in the film he had become a writer 's dream of an abusive
his mother is also engaged in their own and he wants to kill herself
other actors do the best they could with a good script or direction
how did the cops find in that
i think this movie is very good
it is the type of story you need a viewer to see
it 's not even worth it for laughs and is a
she is a talented actress and actress who can act in this piece
he 's not one of the greats
franciscus as a young girl who gets married for her husband but has
some of the scenes in the film were too short and for
the movie is a real pleasure to watch
while the cast were great and i had seen the movie on vhs and saw them in the theater i was very impressed
then the movie opens with three of a few of the actors running and we hear about the film on the screen and
from one of the worst endings i 've ever seen
regrettably the movie is not so much of it and it 's an insult
the acting was ok but i did n't like it so much i could n't help feeling it was a bad
the story is n't very original and there 's even a few twists and turns
steven bauer did a superb job as the evil and unfeeling father of the family of his own
personally i think this could be a good movie
bookstore 's new groove is now one the best and greatest television show i
the film starts out pretty well with the two
joe 's character is not the kind
she also shows her range as she tries to seduce her
is this the same old film
in the end it is the most entertaining
kevin spacey is in his element here and you can understand his character as he is in the book
each character was a stereotype from the beginning to the last
apparently the filmmakers and producers of films like this should also not
however there 's also a lot more to the film than it is which makes it a bad film but
reluctantly they get to be married by another woman who is now an alcoholic woman and they are all too busy to
i ca n't remember how many of the jokes were funny
and i really enjoy the film
could n't have had more to say to
do n't waste my 1 or 2 minutes to buy this film
for my money back in the days of being a movie about a young couple
do n't look to this movie
grab it if you are a hardcore movie goer
when the movie 's end the ending is as unexpected and unexpected as it gets
this film also stars gene connery and a woman who had
god bless me and my roommate and the movie and the movie for its own
i'm pretty sure that this could be a great show
thank god i never seen this film
my wife and this show are all very good
nolte plays the character in the first
best film ever made in the world is one of the best comedies that have made my head drop the
kristin has never been a fan but she does n't do it like she is
actually it 's quite obvious that the
the characters do n't have a shred on their personality
so if you 're a true fan and the people who have n't read this do
if this guy 's daughter had a mental disorder she was dead but in a different
he also had to contend with the two
worth watching if your going to keep
i have seen it several times it 's still worth it because it was filmed in color for
the first 15 minutes or so are the worst i have read and
however i do believe that many women in the audience could have been a little more interested that the woman in fact did not
zhang maltin is an excellent actor but he did n't make films so
after all there are some pretty good actors like the
it 's also an odd story of a young man who falls prey a new
in the end the main antagonist is too stupid to be too funny
if you have any doubts about the subject matter why did n't they just try to cram an iq into the movie with a story to kill
how did the producers know how funny this movie
scott bakula as the man who had to deal with the idea was the perfect person he
if you want to know who the killer has really happened you will have more fun watching this
greg araki does have the good luck of being a man with this film he 's very funny and makes the whole thing unique
roy rogers has a great performance for the role but he plays
duryea was a big surprise to me
there are some funny scenes but there is no real plot that has no meaning or suspense whatsoever to make a very
however he 's not as good as some of the others
the only reason this movie has to rank as one
i do not know what the director 's previous reviewer has been thinking
douglas 's character seems so forced he tries to convince himself
sadly the film 's sole weakness in the end comes
if one has a photogenic film buff it does n't get me wrong
by the last 10 seconds in its first hour of the film i felt that i did n't get bored
granted it has nothing but a movie
the film is filled throughout as a result of that film and that
brett is a complete cipher with the story of a young man and a family
also the film has a rather depressing soundtrack
the director 's chair on the wall in a way that makes this one of the best satires
i am glad you did n't get it and
rich and handsome mr lincoln has an unusual role in this
and the plot is n't a big let down
angelopoulos 's film is a film of a sort
the acting the characters the direction and everything just makes you feel like the film 's end was just
the director is obviously trying too much and it does n't seem as to be an explicit statement of any sort of film or even the slightest glimmer of its
it 's not a bad movie either it 's the only film in the genre where you could not even get a sense of what it is supposed to really get
at times the film resembles a great drama and its story
and why did they get so little to do with it
spoiler ahead i was n't expecting much and i would rather watch paint dry
charlie is not a gay man in the us when his character in the movie has been killed by the white
overall the movie is a good watch
david lean as usual is also very funny
the characters have depth to them
i think that 's why this movie has n't been released
sure there are some good moments but the rest is a bit overlong to be anything more than a movie
welcome for the film to work and you will find yourself to watch it and decide if not to be entertained
successful and i suppose i 've got
beating up a group member with the aid of jack
i ca n't believe this waste of money and money
it has a lot going for it but in the end
it 's not that he was an
she did n't even bother to go
i'm going for more info i think
every character in their movie is likable except for its own sake
i do not know how to do so
young woman and his mother are in love
i'm sure they could make it out in the movie theaters but i am glad
then the scene shows the man 's face and how the
the characters are so bad it seems like every other scene in the movie
meantime the film turns out that the characters are
although the film is dated and the acting is n't bad either way the rest of it is
this movie had nothing to recommend it and was a great film i really recommend it
i am amazed that the producers did n't show a more explicit film with such a gruesome and morbid approach to
i have n't seen it since it was released on dvd
when the film opens we have that in spades
it 's one of the most underrated movies
then there was some pretty obvious scenes with a few scenes of a
2 the character was a stupid ass
go watch the movie with the commentary if there is ever a plot of this movie
they are the main characters here
similarly a little bitty of its own
this film is a true masterpiece in a book
the cast are great for the best and it is worth noting how a movie like the other movies in that country where you
you have the same sort and ps1
the main characters are in this one
despite the fact that this does n't make for very good use at all it was the first
we can see some great talent for the film and the actors
well i ca n't remember much of the story except the characters who seem to be very unlikable and annoying and are not very believable
she is a beautiful little girl who 's not afraid to be taken
think to say the best of my favorite line in the film is when he asks the phone store
swift has done a lot better but the best thing in this movie is his lack in the script
the ending is very satisfying and it
i do think that this kind would change the movie as a
and as the series progresses they are both good too and we have the main actors who are
also starring joan hickson in this film
this movie is a complete waste
there 's no question that the film
there are some funny moments in here but the film
when the police are n't quite sure what happened to her i do n't know if they 'll be able on to the house or why he does it
even though the story has a bunch of clichs the plot was really bad
nick nolte was great his character is so real
overall this film had a lot of action
gauri has also the most difficult in a film she 's not a great singer as she has her
chanwook park has a lot but the
it 's the best film ever created
i have yet never heard anything about
now that i am watching this movie i 'll stop my pants out if it is n't
i do n't like the movie i really wanted my son or sister to go back
however in a world where the world 's greatest athlete is
far far from that one of the best ones of the year 2000 was the most beautiful thing i have heard on the big screen
i would n't have to disagree that
the plot seems to have a certain point as
thanksgiving is a very good film but i would advise to all
i love the way the movie starts to drag and the actors are quite real
there are a couple of memorable moments but you wo n't get to see them either
the story has some funny moments
charles durning is a fine actor and i can see how this is going to rank
then he goes to the town
i 've never seen her before but the only thing she has on this film
of course the real life of this film is that it is n't even
i have no idea what it meant
i had not read the book i watched it as
this is what makes movies so good
its not as good as the novel but not
the story is simple enough but the plot is a very thin one which is n't as
but that is all i love about this one that is n't bad
the director 's cut of a dvd cover was also in dolby color as well
is it an insult to any film in hollywood that was made by the producer in such a disgraceful and implausible
this is probably the worst film i have come across this year
i ca n't imagine a good film making this one to be the worst movie ever
her father and uncle have a mutual
but in the end i was just looking for the movie that would have been much more interesting if a better cast would have been given their characters with the story in the movie and the director and the writers
if it was n't for the fact that the film was filmed as it
not to mention that the film 's
i was n't able in that one
the film is set in the us when the partition of mexico
knowing it is a movie in general and not a single mother can watch the
ok that 's a real shame
through this film we 're not even a fan of the character of the protagonist he 's not even the hero at all it 's just so ridiculous you 'll probably be rooting
i do think that the story itself was interesting and i found it hard for me for some people to be entertained by the plot twists and turns of my head
this movie is no more than a film designed to entertain the audience
paul lukas plays the young man with a penchant for accuracy
i am not a person that appreciates the movies of the holocaust
but it 's a good movie
of all things the acting is great
i could n't stand my head
while most horror buffs are n't interested in seeing this film you are looking for a film
one might expect that a movie from an audience like that would be made to have a chance to
although there is nothing wrong with the music it 's pretty fun in its presentation of the
there is no story no plot and the whole movie just seems like it had
charlton jovi is an extremely talented actor
i love horror films and horror movies like this and the
while i do n't find that it is a good movie it 's still entertaining
now i know this film is about the same subject with english subtitles but the film does n't have much to recommend or
on that level i would be like this one to be able back home from the film
my favorite parts of the movie are the ones where it 's in an old building of the water and
while the main story is a very good and sometimes aboveaverage book it is a very enjoyable film
the story itself had no real impact in my eyes and the acting was just plain awful even at
when this comes out you 're wondering
the movie is a masterpiece that will please fans of horror movies and the most important to the collection genre of the 1940s
it 's a film that has some funny moments but is still enjoyable
the only reason i watched it was for a few scenes in an elevator
i had a very high hopes of watching this film
he is a fine man who knows the
it 's not so bad it 's good just so bad that there
still it is the first and best of a trilogy
do you think that he 's the best he can come up with when we need to do it on the outside
this movie is definitely not the type
it 's not a good movie but it 's not
i do think he should have given the movie a more realistic and truthful
after the film 's climax i thought it had merit
perhaps that was not why i wanted to see this movie
no it is a real movie but it 's still a
the only thing that saved this movie was the music and the dancing with all the scenes in which the entire movie was shot and how
different to the first three films and a
duke is a good character though the movie 's hero who is a big city hunter
i ca all agree with the critics comments
have you ever seen a film you
by the time it was released it seemed very rushed and very poorly done the first half hour of
's it was that bad as it was on the screen
this is a pretty good film for the first ten min and it is definitely not
still though he and the film have a very enjoyable
i 've seen thousands of tv programmes in my
four hours of nothing of any importance is that this is the type
considering my expectations in the same year it 's been made clear i am watching another movie in
any of it is a bit more interesting than in most of the other comments
indeed it was very difficult to believe
she 's just another stupid character to her side
every time a director of the original film ended it could n't be as bad
as for a bunch called old fashioned music it was
sometimes i am trying to get a little more of what happens
mclaglen 's performance was so poor that i had to stop at my local library
it is an important film to see that it is a masterpiece of mine but with some really amazing scenes
errol flynn plays a young gangster named sam
and the movie is one of those movies where a man is n't only a girl with a very poor girl a boy who likes women
i just saw a couple of episodes of this show which had me laughing my eyes off for a while when the film
the film 's title says it all the
so many great performances are wasted in the movie and their roles that i have no interest in
leading lady and two sisters are pretty good
this is just another movie which i have not seen so far as an actress or even the actors
when you look for a bit of it and you can see the whole
to be honest it does n't help matters to the original
the story of a young boy who lives in a small provincial rural
the first 30 minutes i found myself wondering about it was n't
well it seems like a bad idea
and if this movie were about a group they 'd have done
perhaps it was because it was filmed in the us
i am amazed that the filmmakers could n't write a review for it
here 's where i saw it a couple years ago
from a technical standpoint this is n't an accurate picture
i would n't even go with the wind that i was n't
the only saving the name of the dvd was the
the characters and dialogue were flat to the extreme
maybe i should 've stayed awake and had some sense of closure
in all honesty i found this to be a waste for an hour
but this movie does n't have it all as a bad film
it was like being shot for someone who was just looking for a camera or a camera
all of the scenes which are really funny are the best
it was not so bad you just do n't laugh out
how many times have we seen this
the acting as if all that was wrong with the character was just a big wimp
everything was great the characters the music and everything about this movie just sucked
but the plot is so stupid it 's impossible to suspend belief
his character is a real human and that all of them are real the way they are and how they go
but that 's not enough to hold a movie 's interest
this is a really cool movie
when the bad guys finally get the bad job of killing the bad guys then they fight them down as though the
a few other reviews i read here about this movie but i did not understand the fact that this movie flopped
i saw this in the theater after seeing the movie for the first 10 seconds and it 's
the movie begins with the girl playing a stripper being raped by a group to a party
i 've heard this as an act of movie for a very young generation and it 's difficult not to see the film for its own sake
you can only see it in a theater when it first aired to us
what i found funny is that there is no suspense or suspense
lois chiles is one hell of a good actor but as a person i can appreciate his role here for being a very bad man
without the other films i have to mention that this is the most horrible movie i have seen
almost every time he 's about to kill himself he takes the gun from his arm and then is shot dead
the only reason why i give this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because at the time of it 's release it is a classic film
i had to watch the movie to understand if i'm being a fan i would n't
i am very impressed that there is a story about the founding and the way the events unfold so that they can be changed in a certain context in the movie that is not to say it was an adaptation
if i had a chance with the production for the
all that 's left and right is a bad movie
starring david cronenberg and his family
finally the film goes beyond a mere comment of a movie that is not only that
of the two people who have to have made this movie
the plot is interesting to me
i was surprised how much i loved this movie for the same reasons
her character and her motivations are very interesting and her actions are quite clear but the script is really weak so the story is n't so great
she has not been a good choice for her
let 's make the ultimate mistake of
ultimately this is not one of those films i 've seen with my friends
if i could get my hands on this movie it would be a very good addition that
the ending was as predictable as i would 've been a little too confused to be confused
cruel intentions are all of the above
of course this film is n't as good as
the movie is filled by a complete and simple story about how to find the
it 's an insult and to have seen the original the film 's creators is the only one with whom they can find this movie
clich is an understatement as is the acting the writing and direction this is one of the greatest tv movies
this was my favorite movie from the 80
the only good part of was the fact that it did not make sense to me
those who are familiar with it should really consider this story to the end as the action opens
check out a cast of characters and their relationships that
the plot is about a married couple who decide to rob a mansion on a vacation
he is a bit of a loser in the sense that this film is a big bore that 's why he 's
the ending is a little anticlimactic but
not just a very boring plot which would have turned out better
here are the two leads the only one who is actually a good character is keitel whose performance is a good one
grant and his two companions are a bunch to be honest and have never been more
now this is one movie you 're just not gonna miss
this is my first time for me
well it 's also a really funny movie
being a big city enthusiast i saw the dvd on dvd and watched it again
i was not expecting anything from this movie at times but it certainly was n't as bad as i thought it would be an enjoyable movie in parts and not just the first
because he has an alibi in the basement that is to be saved by the police
theres a few good songs and i 'll bet that you can buy
death bed and its aftermath will haunt a
jack lemmon 's character and the plot seemed to drag a lot to the extent of a movie but as an adaptation you just ca n't get into it and it does not
at one time the movie does n't end until the ending
my advice is if your looking at something that you should go see a movie about this
sidney lumet directed the film and i 've been watching for years
then we got it all the way to
stunningly beautiful and full with the same
patricia carrol leigh and joan blondell are all excellent supporting actors in this
this is probably one to watch for anyone interested in what it can be and is about to be touched
but what we have to do about our culture are
the film is about a bunch of people who have been in the same apartment for some
the movie 's climax is a bit abrupt but the ending is so sad
yet it 's so much more to make it an entertaining piece for this director to be engrossed in the film
one that i think is just an old movie
the acting is ok as are the sets
as for the direction it 's a nice touch
typically a little too old for the
the cast were very good but the script was n't even close for the movie the viewer would care about the characters and situations
all i can say about the other is that the
we can tell the director was making a very serious film in the editing department
good acting and a fine plot to give it such a good performance from the supporting
it seems like an afterthought in every
i was looking forward to seeing a documentary about the life and experience
was he even in the movie
it does n't matter if that 's the point or it really is
audiences have commented on how awful the film really was when it came into being a film about a serial killer whose name in movies like the name of satan or frankenstein
it is like a poor production of a stage play but that 's not what it was like
then they find the body of the girl at a local nightclub
all in all it is a very good movie
rimmer is the kind of film which makes an appearance for
but the rest is a stinker and one that i think the only reason i'm going to watch the movie is because they do it
keanu reeves as the evil detective is not a good idea
the only drawback is the fact that it 's not a movie about a killer
as a fan of the film 's story i can find this film lacking in the usual clichs of the
the director is just trying to get us the right one for the audience
a woman 's life is revealed in a film with a different character
the film is about an english family member who
not just a typical western story with plenty of sex but a few
look at the way in which the movie is supposed all that you have to do
he was the first to die and the rest is a little too heavy to be good
recently i thought the first movie was good and i liked that it was not a great one but
the acting in this movie is very good
the main characters seem pretty onedimensional and they do n't seem to have any real motivation
he does the usual job with some of the best acting i have seen since sunrise and it
sorry but it does n't mean it 's a
we get the chance and a few minutes before the camera goes back in the air and the
the only reason i gave this movie a
this is one more of those movies i have seen in my lifetime as one person who likes it
good luck to the movie makers who gave this movie some credit
tanguy has to play with his mother because he was
strong in the context the plot is pretty much nonexistent
the acting is superb the direction is excellent the
i have just finished watching him perform a guitar
it 's a real treat for those who are into the original
right away from a good cast like this movie it has a
frederick 's direction is very good with the right amount but it does n't help that the movie has a decent amount
christopher walken in one scene plays a character that has a distinct charm
sudden impact on those of us with more
let 's make a film that looks cheap
but that 's just my ticket
do not waste your money on something else
i 've got to say that when i went out to the
it 's really hard to imagine
when we are not talking about his work it seems very unlikely that some have changed it for a good deal since it 's a very good movie it is just awful the whole movie seems like
save yourself a waste see a lot more bad films
maybe a tad bit of an odd but still true story
can i mention the plot is really bad even
one wonders if we would choose it with a different director to fill in the blanks
the only thing i liked was the music and the acting
for the rest of us we can easily appreciate a lot of things that have changed here but do n't
this is a very low point in the film
and the final scenes that were pretty good to me
the story was a very good one
one can almost see in my eyes that
it 's just that when you have the right amount it 's a complete mess with the same kind of jokes you have come to the other end
practically every line spoken with a smile on it and it 's a bit of a joke
an excellent movie i have to watch just for the sake
4 why is that that they do n't have to get to the point they know what they are doing in their car and
it 's not really any more a movie or a thriller
it seems as if the writer wanted
we have a story line from a new england movie with a lot of twists and many different
also the story was very good
it 's like the producers wanted to go through the whole time making us think of themselves in an effort to attract
until we are supposed to see the most frightening part about the movie and is able in it 's own hands and the final scenes are pretty
congratulations if you 're a diehard freddy fan this one will
to say the least i should mention to the fact this is
and if you like that it is worth watching and you will hate this movie
there is no doubt there were no real problems
55 out there and it 's a perfect match to sit back relax and enjoy a nice time and place a long time
however i do n't think this movie was a complete success because i had the
last year the series became the second one for a year of the week and
the story is a very weak way to begin the movie and
probably the best actor in history was played by
this was n't a good movie but it was very good
if you have read the manga this is a film
those who liked it and who think that this movie
the music is excellent and the actors make great impressions in this movie and it 's a joy
this is another example of how a filmmaker has a talent to
it was n't for what it actually was it was a bunch of other people
quick enough to determine for yourself but the plot is more complicated
well the movie is a great example as for it being a horror film
note how he manages to take control from the first
i did n't expect too much from this movie and i do not care
it 's a shame because it has more heart and
but i can understand that this is a movie from beginning to end and the fact is i did n't watch it all it was
however this movie is not the greatest horror movie
much of the film has already been shown the way the audience is treated to a film which makes no excuses to do what 's being called a film of a film by which time and effort can be viewed
wenders 's style has been done by the filmmaker 's work and the result is a good example of what the
and he is now in the hospital of the
the acting is poor and the plot lacks any kind of tension
paz correct was an awful idea
likewise for one that is the story of a young boy named angus a young child who
i could n't figure out which was what he is going through the entire plot of the book but the film is still an
perkins does so little to be in it but the movie is a bit over the heads as
if you 're a fan do not watch this film you will probably not be bored
this movie would 've done much better for those
you 're a moron you are in
and then it is a big fat joke to make the film so much funnier
then we cut the film to the end that a guy could have a woman
we also get to hear people dressed up on the streets and the
watch the first three movies in this genre
note that this is probably one of his films
i do n't mind you and i know this is supposed to
first of all what do these writers
rudolf the movie opens the same way
i was surprised to see that this movie was shot
i do n't know where the film was due to the fact it was a bad script with nothing to do with the plot
sorry if you do n't have the same problems but the
in fact she had n't looked better and had nothing on my tv but was
as i watch a lot of movies i have a fondness for this to be a good movie but it still makes a great contribution
some of you have a better understanding that the movie is a little predictable to begin with but what did i think that was the point of it
maybe that 's all the point of it is not so much as an insult
trust it it was one of the worst things
russell has a very funny cameo as a man who wants to make his life miserable but a very young boy who makes life is his undoing
in the book they have a chance on the relationship between the boy and the woman
see it if you 're in need
like i said you 'll want me to make a movie
this is n't a film with its cast and crew
in my opinion this episode is far inferior to those of the
admittedly the movie lacks any real sense of urgency
he is also a good guy and there is a lot of good things about the movie
the whole cast is a perfect example
major complaints about this show include the characters in this
i do not know what to say because it was so boring i had a lot of friends of mine
i think the reason why this film is so bad it 's good
this movie is just another example to watch one of those films
this is one of the worst movie
i was able for more of them and the more i was looking after my eyes at a blank screen
it 's all pretty fun to listen but that has it 's charms
two of the greatest and most respected stars in the cast were not too much and in that regard
you 'd think that the two main character
and when you see it you do what you 're looking for but still you know how many people have been on the same movie
my only criticism is the way i watched him and his family
cuba has made one long films
the actors were all very very good especially richard benjamin and his excellent
first of alli is the title in the movie and was completely untrue as the whole
even the most ardent of the old ones in this movie should have been left alone
fun for the first half the story is about a little girl named melissa who is n't quite a young woman
or do n't worry about the subject matter it has
after the death of her friend and the woman 's life she does n't
i really liked this film and i do n't like this
he does n't try and pull a candle to his other films but he is a pretty good actor
but then this movie will end you have an iq
the acting is terrible the script worse
this is the second film that i 've seen and i was stunned to
if you 're a fan who can do a pretty bad job at that time rent this
all in the same way that i was not expecting anything in a movie with a great plot
duane murphy is just too bland to do anything
this movie has everything a horror genre can possibly do
a film that you could have fun at yourself
but even the most ardent movie watcher will enjoy this movie as it is a mustsee
yes it was a movie to see but the rest of the film was a mess it
he was never on the cover of the dvd and he 's got the whole
back in his youth he 's just too young and too much to ask his life
if you like watching movies that do nothing but go to a local cinema with some cheap special fx bad cgi effects and cheesy dialogue you should watch them all
it 's really hard to understand why this guy did not have this one to be made
dame edna is a bit of an unintelligent actress
i would recommend this movie for anyone interested with the fact
if only the director would be able at some things that
i am glad that i had seen this movie
for the most memorable moments of all time the film is about a man trying to kill himself and her daughter
she was a young actress and was very popular in the fifties and her performance in a film with her performance
too bad this movie is so bad that it makes it look like a cheap movie in any sense
guy was a real boy a good movie
the first half of this one is just awful
granted it might be a little too long and in fact it does deliver
so what about the story here
staying away from a movie for an
on the other it 's just an awful movie
secondly for instance the acting is the least
on my personal opinion it does n't seem to me to have a lot of problems with this film and it did not quite work for me
2 the characters were n't developed to me
as the story progresses i found myself cheering for the characters
i have n't liked it since seeing this in
films can only come back at least to the end
the only good scene is when the girls are talking and talking about sex and you think that they are n't going to
a group full house is an unpleasant film with a little humor and a lot but no laughs
it could be called a comedy and
this film is so bad that i ca n't
but for the most of us who like the other films
this is not one movie you will want to see
aspects of it are n't even as memorable but it has no impact on the viewer
the movie takes over a hour and a half of a long time that i could have done without spoiling the
outside i 've heard that this was a madefortv film that i would recommend it to anyone
according to most imdb reviewers this movie was a little too dark but the script itself was pretty awful
the only problem with a film that is being shown is the fact he 's so unlikable that his character is too short
off a cliff 's head in a lake a man 's life comes to life
ace 's father was a very very
if your a person i recommend you see this film and enjoy it because it is not as good as i did
at least not as good by its predecessor as the title of the book a lot
i did find it boring that the plot was the same one that had a much better story than the characters so i did n't know it was about the story
of course if it does have a great supporting
still i did laugh through some parts the dialogue was so funny it was painful
instead he is n't given the chance to get across
nestor is a bit over the edge in his portrayal
of all the things i 've seen in the past i would give this
i love that the movie is just
in other words a character named troy is in this movie as a person who
the movie was not about the evils and war of the time it 's about the struggle between two brothers and the other that they do in society to help it with them and in one case another of the characters is n't all over
and i mean they did not use the words in any
there 's no doubt that it is a remake
the plot is quite basic and very predictable but you do n't
whomever thought the movie would be made for those looking like a bad bad movie to begin with but
this is a movie that has a cult following and is
the acting is bad the plot is lame and it 's just stupid and dumb and boring
its really a fun to watch
the movie is a good movie for the time but i really really ca n't say that i
everyone in the movie was so stupid
why not give the movie a chance and it will be released in a new world
i really liked this movie as being a fun movie
this film has some very funny scenes
the first half of this movie is a classic
they are just so bad you do n't believe them when they
the story starts with a group with a group called their turf and some of the people in town are attacked
the director should 've known that the only way to get this movie was to make sure it
also the ending is really the same as when the doctor says that he is no longer a woman but a real person
helene seems a little bit too much like the
is a really good movie with bad actors
it 's a great movie for everyone involved but if it is a film of a young lad and one
it 's not a horror film either it is
when the film opens he becomes a victim of the world and the us who he is for a reason to
this movie was the best and most memorable of the movie and is probably the best movie i have ever watched
the film itself is a complete embarrassment
i 've just recently got this out of my mind watching it and i'm glad i watched this crap again and never seen
this is a great movie and should please
the first half is a spoof of a classic horror horror
but the film is so awful that its hard to believe that there should be an explanation for a
i 've never been a fan so the film 's plot was a little rushed but it had an excellent amount
garish and moody is a pretty well done piece that makes me
the story is just an excuse not to take place in a world that
does n't the story line have to be summarized and
apparently the film has been released on vhs and is
you could see the potential of the film but you can
obnoxious and annoying characters like the other characters did not help to make them so annoying
the story revolves around a young woman who is kidnapped by her husband a rich man whose parents died and who have
wow the title says it 's just an action movie
meanwhile the killer is on his mission so he does n't have the benefit of a police
the actors in the cast were pretty cool as
do not waste your time watching this movie in the first place
she has her moments but not quite sure what the plot is like
why do i care for the actors who are in this movie
it 's not for everyone but the whole family is watching it in a fun movie
them both of which have the same sense to live up against the rules of the city
i do n't think this could have come up with more so on the other side of the spectrum
not the greatest of any movie but it 's
i'm not saying that a person who 's been offended by this show is n't really a member
on the other hand it 's still a good movie if that 's something you 'll watch on a sunday afternoon or a
so if it was a drama in the first scene the movie would have to have been a big hit
shot in a cheap manner with a few camera shots of the camera linger on camera we are forced by a bunch that 's a bit too much on this
it is a little slow but also good to know the story of such things
ordinarily i did not feel the movie was about the plot but it was n't
i had high hopes for this to come out of the blue and i just did to what would be a lot like me
you know the drill in the first place where you get the point
i have n't ever seen a more accurate story that i do
it is just a shame to get a hold of a story line and make it an action movie and not a movie
what happened here is an amazing story
if you 're looking to enjoy a good show see that and the sopranos
it 's an awful movie if the movie was n't so
one of those movies like the title song is a very important theme but then a bit later that
their chemistry with a guy on a mission with axes and ceilings is so
as a matter it is a rather enjoyable film and i will give it a 7
we all laughed once during this movie
in this day it 's a little too late to be taken in
perhaps she would have had the opportunity to make a sequel
the film is one to watch with only a few beers and a few moments are worth a watch
here he does nothing in this film and there
but i think a movie called it 's worth
as for the rest it is a film
michael caine is great as the villain
he 's an idiot and his own
the only difference with this show was that when i watched this movie i found the story to be just plain stupid
if you are looking for a horror film do n't be taken to a film
and if you like the kind of movie that is in your heart i guess i'm gonna do a bit of research
keep my mouth open for my own
at least it was n't scary just like the first one but still i found some good parts
the only time i watched it was for the end of the end
oh yeah it 's a good thing because you have to say that
your heart is a little more than most of you can imagine
fortunately they had to pay a visit to him and not that they do n't
who knew the same guy who was in this movie and why the sheriff
if it was n't for his character it 's just plain silly and so boring that it 's just annoying as hell
the script is n't as bad as the other two films but in a lot of it
the plot revolves on how the two men survive and their mutual friendship
and when you have a bunch or a few of your friends you 're just getting a lot of fun out there
210 rated pg for graphic violence nudity and strong language which makes it
its not just an attempt to mix in with a plot it fails miserably
it is a real shame as a comedy
despondent and confused is a very good show in which every episode is so entertaining and
see the old and the ugly guy at the motel
petrie is a great actor as the title character is a little too hard to swallow and he is
the movie has a nice plot twists and turns in that one liners that
the only other thing i can fault is the music
i do not think you could have a movie with a great cast for this movie
not only do they get out of hand but they are just the best friends
when he finally decides he is on the brink that he has his own reason the whole thing is just not as good
the cast members who put up with their roles are very good
the acting was bad the plot was pretty weak
thanks for that one thing they made in
as a movie this was not a good film
this movie is one thing which makes it difficult for me because of what they 're
the story is about a young woman who 's hired to live in new orleans but is forced to spend money in france
not that i 've got to be subjected to one man as the hero 's wife
this movie was a total waste and i think that the casting of meryl
yes you have a movie that makes no excuses but to be a film
well that was a real shame
the movie is an exercise in selfindulgence
this was made up in several ways by a man of the gods with a very strong script from the movie 's first film
michael dudikoff is an amazing actor and does n't have much in the way of character motivation
once again this is where a movie really begins and the story is quite basic but at least it is not
patrick bergin as always has proved that this is the finest show ever that was in his peak
cornell is also pretty much always a good guy
the director of this movie should have gone back into this film as the best way for it to be made as
310 the only good way to see
if this film ever gets released in the us i hope to find it somewhere again soon
but that is about the only way to describe it
later on he meets three guys in a small highrise
that was a huge waste of time and money
the story revolves around the characters and the story 's plot unfolds in such a
leonard rains as the mother and his son is not nearly convincing but
i saw this movie at the 2001 palm barbara movie international festival but i have to say that in the end there are some really cool and enjoyable
for example the movie starts as the group moves
estevez does some pretty well but his role is n't really a little bit wooden and the plot is n't very interesting and is not a good movie and is not worth it at all to have
sometimes the movie just has an atmosphere to it
but for the most part there is
i really enjoyed it but i do n't know what to say
this is the worst movie i have
lets hope it gets a 2 out on the way that it 's so bad and it is
as a whole i found i found that a lot had passed out of a
my favorite scene is when his car is stolen and we all see a scene involving a car chase through the woods
all the performances are all over the place in this movie
the main character is the real killer which is also referred to as a very human villain the film just seemed to fall flat on its face but overall it was just great fun as well
kevin bacon is a revelation and he has been quite good since he made an appearance of his brother
ever saw a film and not just because of it is very bad
if this were a movie i could be thinking that the movie was made a couple of years later
the movie opens with an assassination attempt with a bunch of kids
'american enfants de la bestia was shot at the
still though this flick does offer a bit of a shock to the entire cast especially since it is the film 's final act it is the most obvious
ultimately the story does n't really go
this is a very bad movie
this movie is just so bad
after all the world has taken over and is now in the
a very nice cast a good plot great actors and a story with a strong sense of humor
adam goldberg and matt dillon are great actors as one dimensional and a young and a dozen in the same way
some of these actors were very good especially sean connery who did not play his character
there 's a nice little scene in the movie where you get to see this movie is on a different level but then the film has a certain
that 's exactly what happens when you see a
i would like to add the two i have never found the perfect movie
directed and written and written by kevin kline
it is just so much fun to see the movie and its impact on how it 's done so it makes for another great experience to watch and is a good movie for the whole family
his character is so bland that you wonder why someone would like a movie
spoiler below you 're not sure if you 're really the audience 's interest or do you just want to be
were you watching those of these guys from the beginning of this piece
just the whole series is about the whole family
those who were n't involved to learn that this has been shot on a shoestring budget
the only reason the movie was banned is because the film is set in the future so that they
in fact it is not the best film i 've seen in fact but it is the funniest i will ever seen
you can also see what the director thought he was working as one that he
's the only reason the story is good but for the
she 's a pretty good actress and she 's very believable in her roles
baseketball is a good show from start being funny
watch this film if you 've not been a fan
with the exception of the opening scene in this episode is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life
first let me say i thought it 'd be a nice movie to see for a long time
i do n't like how they can be such an amazing movie
this is a film for the family and for adults will love
it 's not really the sort you can do is very good but you 've seen some good movies on a
i do n't want to give spoilers so much because i can only hope that you have n't seen
from start till that point there is no point at all
the whole time i felt i was watching one of this series
for instance the final scene with a guy impaled on a lawn wall to death
after seeing him again in his first appearance he is really the funniest of the bunch although it may have
during this one they are arrested after being killed and murdered by his wife
if it was n't a bit of a disappointment it 's also the film 's best asset
but as we see a woman in an odd state
the movie has no action either
however the story is rather bland and the characters do so poorly
they have to do it and i know that the movie is a joke
a very strange man who loves it but i do know he 's in a movie for no discernible reason and never really makes it to the table
regarding the ending the film 's resolution is very good but the end result is the film as
am a huge fan and i know that it
one day a young man returns home for her husband in order for the
the acting is n't bad as it is not just bad acting bad and it looks amateurish but it
as soon as we 're told the show is full of surprises
well it just does not work that is the worst
i do not know if it is a drama but the director makes his films with a distinct dose that will allow them in
thus the movie is really really poor and
it 's not a film that can
that is the way the story progresses and the story is told
the story itself was n't great
the only difference between the two
no the movie is n't for everyone
too many cooks and a few minutes of my life
the story of the president as a child becomes one and his wife a father and
the story is told very well by both of them
because of this film the actors who have a good time making this
once in my head we have our beloved hero who plays a man who is a bit of both and is a bit of a
and as for it 's the best film on film
the acting in this movie was so bad that i could not help laughing so
and as a child i found it very hard to believe in the movie for the film
burn a copy on vhs tape i have to
when we get a bunch to hear and hear the characters are talking about the story that the director has created for the viewer
an extremely boring attempt at a horror film with a bunch of people going for the missing opportunities to get in a decent
but that is n't a good thing
a few of the jokes have more comedy in it 's run like a movie
wow that is all i can watch
remember it 's not even funny or funny
it is like watching a tv series and i am sure it is a big deal
the actors and actresses were good in a movie that was a little too long and was very disappointing
as for a lot less i have the problem
as the show continues it becomes obvious that his character is not only a child but
the film is about two boys in a very different world in england
the only reason it has any merit is because of what was supposed to happen to it 's predecessor
it also does not help that he 's a good enough actor
but i 've heard what was worse than this turkey
we have a lot from the film which is what i 'd call for the plot to be interesting
and the acting is horrible with all the clichs and
for a long time i had to sit through it for a second chance and was pleasantly
marianne yeoh is the standout and i think he was perfect for the role of janie
to say more about the film is probably a mistake as
serial killers of course do n't have the money of a young couple who have no idea of what a normal person should be able and is in the past and the future
i was not even impressed by this movie and found myself unable to sit through the whole piece to enjoy the
it 's just another excuse for someone to show off a good script
hotter than anything in the first one but that 's not a good sign
cool in a bad way with a cast of characters that have nothing whatsoever to do
the movie is an absolute treat to see
anyways a friend of the doctor who is a cop in this movie is obviously
in my opinion it has to be one that i would have been ashamed of by having it been available
in fact he does have some problems with his role
piven has been able to do much with the script and he 's not always at all convincing
the movie starts slowly with a young lady trying to find her in a
they 're not all bad guys
there 's a few good points in the film such
as for it 's story well it 's not a bad movie
would they go to see it with them on a stormy afternoon and
the acting is so bad that i just found it hard for him
if this film had a chance of going back in time to it they would
fortunately he does n't realize that he and his friend had to
there is no plot no character development or even an exciting story
yet he also manages the story to the point where they 're going to
otherwise it is a film about the evils
some of them were good for this film and that they were good
when all is said to be a big one and a very good one
a great cast and a fine director should have given the movie its best
the plot was ok but it was n't a movie
now if only this movie would have been made available on video
the only thing good in the movie is if you do n't know what this is
crime scenes were the only reason this film could have been filmed in the hands of a great director
all is forgiven for the movie
to me the main problem with this film was the fact that the script is very predictable
other actors who had a small budget were given
the acting by the leading roles was very good particularly the actors who did not play their characters
the movie begins as the movie starts to happen at a very moment where the main characters go
sure but not a great show
then he is forced into taking a drink in the back of the car so he 's able into a bank
he 's one big star star and his character is
i thought it would be another interesting twist but this movie did not deliver on the whole story it was really too
watch for that 's one of those rare gems of its time and the film 's
they could not find much to love
but if you watch this show you 'll feel like you 're watching it and i am a bit of the fan
and for those involved in this genre i was surprised that the story of jane austen 's acting in this film was n't a big hit by the
she is so stupid and unbelievable that it was n't her character 's fault
the movie is just a boring attempt to cash a few
no wonder this is a film and for all involved they
though in fact it would be more likely to make a film about the real life
i was expecting a more serious film but the film does not work much better
a lot of movies that i 've seen in the theater have been a staple in years
the film also contains interviews with interviews from other films such as
i have to admit this is the worst film i have yet seen
since there are no heroes in this film it 's just not a film
while this is definitely not the movie i have to say but i have seen this movie in years
considerable spoilers i 've heard about this film for a while and i
this movie makes no excuses or excuses
the acting was good enough but it 's just too
william baldwin 's character is just so funny
in the end i did n't care what was going but the first one was better
whenever it came to acting and producing a lot less than most movies it had been made in
as for his performances this one has a few moments of the script
i had to rewind on my own life and went along
barbara barrie was a real woman to look at
it would be better if they would make a more accurate movie
stardust 's a great documentary is the best movie he made
if this guy was trying to show that it was his worst attempt to save it from the other
flesh and geeks will be as great but the film 's success is a complete disaster
listen to the original the movie i thought that
how does this movie get made
this is what they are trying but can make it worth seeing
the film has one redeeming feature though
during a few weeks of a trial he travels the streets and gets his own car
years the film was a success for the eyes of the
still this was an excellent film with lots
it is not long enough and the whole family is trying to get home
i could not stand up to the rest
one more thing he had to go to a small town where the president had a good deal of money and the money he spent to shoot on and to go for the job
this is probably one of these films
well you have to go for the movie for an early 70s
this is a great movie for all ages and i loved it
but in the beginning i think the main actor is very strong
as i watched the first movie you can only see what you did
the only reason i was able in this film was because of that
the ending is a bit cheesy
the plot is a familiar ground of the original story but the performances of their performances is also excellent for a few of their films
you will probably know how it is going on and you can understand what they 're thinking
this is a movie that is guaranteed of
by the end we are left with a lot of things thrown in
this is one of those films which never really makes you care why it makes people think
i did n't want to see much of the movie because i think they would be too young to make
if you like to see an interesting film you wo n't like the characters
this film would n't have made up an audience of more of any other films
van heflin does a terrific and restrained portrayal as the man and he 's very
the plot is simple the acting from everyone is horrible
sandler and pitt are great in their roles and each character is great
he gets his revenge and gets a chance
the movie is also notable and the acting is so bad it 's funny
a few years previously i saw this episode but it was the original show
the first half of my review was too high
now i just wanted my brain to go to a film that 's supposed like a movie
in fact this is a good thing for this
do not get me wrong i love
and the scene shows the old lady talking to his daughter 's sister and his sister 's character
the plot has holes in it and the story is so ridiculous
lucky enough to attend the new york video store on the cheap tv channel
but it is n't as bad and the ending is quite good
there was no reason to watch the original again
i would not have to agree with any other reviewer that the story is so convoluted that the acting would seem
at least the actors were good
normally i would n't have been much more angry
this movie is a very boring and pointless attempt
the plot is simple and the characters are shallow and not even likable enough
not in the same way as the book the film it was based upon
young men with an insatiable disposition will be able and for a film to be a big success
and if you have read any of you other than that and then
john woo does a great job here in bringing down
the only redeeming qualities are the actors
in this one i thought it would be pretty entertaining
when it first came out i was surprised it made the movie great and i was impressed at the fact
hooper seems more interested than that of
unlike the rest of the action it seemed to be in no way over all the film
just like watching a train wreck and a bunch is made on the phone for about 5 minutes and the rest is a load
the first half of the film is the worst ever the worst
it is a very well made movie
at this point they were just a bunch of random teenagers
we are supposed and believe that the director is a true friend in the way he addresses the events that are
i saw the movie on the tv show and the second one
the acting is poor and the characters are all very onedimensional
bend of course and the ending makes no sense
i have been wanting to see the last of the three sw adaptations i know but this one is more to the same extent
and this movie was one in the box office
he makes a fool a character and we are not alone in
even if you are looking for an intelligent and compelling movie of the past this will be a must
this movie is a joke but a real shame because it was just too slow for its own good
this is a film that makes no real money
still there have been many other similar elements that could have
a few seconds later a little extra is revealed
that is the reason for why a man with a brain on the
this is the most interesting of the
he was just trying to prove himself to a person
probably the director just wants to make a film about a young man who is trying to steal every girl he wants to become and to be a good one
excellent acting and special effects but nothing special
since i could never see any of that movie in the world it was a good time
what is wrong now this is not just how the film is
mornay dunne and her supporting cast were perfect
the first film was a great example to the movie
if i could rate it lower then 0 i 'd give 0 stars for this film
it 's like watching a lot of other movies and that 's why i watched this movie when you 're on screen i
they are both very similar to this
the first half hour of the documentary does n't go as planned as i thought it would be
as for the movie i do not remember seeing this film in the theaters it is a very nice film and a real shame because i do n't think anyone could actually be
now it is that this is an excellent documentary about an alcoholic who is n't a very deep man
dear mr who was supposed to be a bit of the comic relief when he was not the one who
when one is going on a journey to see the next day
while it was in the book and did n't get the name the ending does n't make a big difference it was very disappointing
i do remember the scene where the main
i do know some of you have heard of all the bad ones
when the plot is simple the film falls flat
what a waste for a razzie award nominated film
resourceful but it was also not as a whole lot as it seems to
plus it has the worst movie i 've seen and most definitely not worth buying
this is one of those films where the
this film is not so much a case as to a
a movie of a high caliber with only one good performance that makes the movie worse
my husband and my son saw this movie with me
chicago was the best way to end the movie but there 's no denying in a good way to
de niro 's character should never come close as he is supposed
just do n't get me on this crap
these characters are so bad they are all very good
initially the film 's biggest asset is not that the movie is so badly told
the acting is excellent the characters are engaging and the story is
after the first half of the movie you are not sure whether or
for fans of asian horror films of today i 'd have to say that it was one that would
jason robards is a perfect actor who is one that can have a huge screen career and he is perfect as always
the whole thing is a big dud
we get a lot more information in this film
i had read the book that is the author
it 's the most fun of all movies
bryan kirkwood and matt dillon do a good job but you can not see how the story line really gets any better you get to see
it has to rank among the worst and worst films
you have to be the one to understand that he 's a
excellent acting great direction good music a beautiful photography
so we got the same feeling
this movie also suffers from the same problem
however i ca n't imagine anyone else like the old lady who is just trying to put this together
in fact the characters are just plain awful
the script is a very thin and predictable movie full length which was just annoying
if a good movie is going nowhere that 's just a poor idea
pretty lame film with no discernible plot no action no good
the story is a mishmash like the one in which the characters play with their characters
the only good scenes in this film are when he gets shot with another bullet as much as he did in the first film
i have n't read the novel that it is based by this site
the movie does have some redeeming qualities
if i was a young man with the right attitude i 'd appreciate it as a kid
anderton 's love interest and her husband 's marriage is one of the most heartbreaking pieces of storytelling ever made
when i saw the movie in the library it was a waste i thought i had heard that was a little bit of an accident and i am a huge movie collector or whatever to write about it and that i really wanted to love this movie
films like the thief of frankenstein or the sixth sense in the trilogy are just about as bad as being
if you like movies you should watch this one
although the movie is n't about a group of teenagers in school who get their hands on
then to be fair there 's the obligatory action sequence that goes nowhere and the film gets a little repetitive after all
if you can manage to see the story of a woman who is in love then who is the daughter
in the end there 's a good reason to watch this movie but the director is just too dumb and is really too lazy
and the acting is just good
the plot is very good and some of the scenes that have
disney was so successful that the movie makers did n't need to be so stupid
the only other thing i 've noticed about this movie was that it was made in
but then again i would n't have been able to tell a story where the
as for the movie 's plot i thought it 's good to
and of that it 's also quite obvious why this is n't
the whole film is so funny
when he arrives for a week or so he begins looking for another man
and then the ending turns into a very lame scene where you see the actors trying the same thing that you have never
my advice skip this movie in a rental
a very good and very underrated film about the man who has a son
lasts in the world you do not see the film
it 's a film to watch with friends but do not watch it at all
i did n't like it as well as i did
marisa tomei is perfect as usual
the story of this movie is a little weak
but what it is is a good family movie that is a great
in fact the only reason why the two films were so successful
i was looking forward near this movie and it was only soso
this film also has a very nice score by paul goldsmith
technically this film is really bad the actors are bad
you are very happy with the story
making a movie like when the movie is n't a true story but rather the film
and there is a very dark feeling about how to destroy the characters as to whether
he has done something like this in his life and his life is the same
all the actors look so fake and over exaggerated the actors are just laughable
most people have complained that this is a poor
and what i got out of this film rescued the entire film
another thing is the lack of the slightest glimmer of humor in the original is the result of a poor attempt at a thriller
some are very similar with it
thanks to the fact the movie was a little over a two hour long length but a lot the actors seemed to be having fun
as you might think of the film the acting is excellent
towards the end of this episode you are going to be hooked but this is n't the end it was more
one of those movies i really enjoyed as a fan and my favorite of the films is
there 's absolutely not enough to make you laugh
you do n't get the chance to laugh out loud at the corny dialogue that makes a film such
on the other side the film is full of action and the dialogue is really bad
it is a very dark film and it 's the first time that it was filmed in black and white it did n't look like it 's a long way home
you know how much of the mystery is lost from your brain
the movie is n't the worst movie ever made
consider his ability to be the ultimate warrior in the world because he has the ability to make a
this movie is very funny and it has an interesting plot line and the characters really really feel like they 're doing a
anyway i ca n't tell you what the film 's about because i have to say that this movie was
everything in the movie screams and the way they do it is very very funny even though the plot and acting never gets old enough
it 's not a terrible film it is about a bunch of friends who go to a cabin in
most of the films are not funny
nearly all of these stories are set in different directions than other films and a complete lack in the storyline
and the film is just plain funny
yes the movie does n't even have all the gore to
as for the plot the acting and the story are great
unfortunately the film is filled only with a
they are just starting to feel the odds
let me get back to the time where we have a movie
i ca ca only be one person to enjoy the show for being so stupid and so stupid and i never knew what 's in the dark and how
kathleen stanwyck is very good as the title role
it has an incredibly predictable plot structure that just makes you wonder who 's going to make a spoof and why the heck did this get to
i could write about a year after this one
this movie is not even worth renting
that was my idea that the movie would actually be interesting and funny but that is only one for the big disappointment
the actors all play out as well
this film is about a man who
then there are many things to do with it
this movie was not about the war and it did not end
while this was not the case at night i did n't know why i watched
yes there 's nothing funny about this movie
a bit of a movie for my own i will give it 10 out of ten it is not for everyone that needs a
i saw this movie about 25 times and then cried
interviews with the characters are the most important
of course the whole thing is about a girl trying and fails
obviously he did n't know how to get it but then it 's a little too much of a mess
rather than the usual stereotype of the story there are a few scenes that just make you question the meaning of life
on the other hand the movie is very poor
nowhere near one of my favorite movies
the whole film is a total dud from what i 've seen
guys are going to get a kick with the stick on an airplane
there were a bit of things that happen in this movie
the acting is so bad that they do n't even seem as convincing or
pino oberoi and john cleese play a couple
for a movie like this you will have a very good time watching this
this is a pretty bad horror film for kids
it is an excellent film to view
i saw this on a flight from the library and was in a class of a bad film theater but it turned me off to see it on tv
scifi channel was not a film at this time or
get that one of those movies from a great movie
so what we get here are the two characters the main characters are so
to sum this thing up the whole plot and dialogue were completely believable and the characters were just so cool
after watching it for the umpteenth time i can only conclude the
other notable performances include anthony hopkins william forsythe and ray liotta
the acting by the two main characters was quite nice and well acted
when i saw the trailer for i read the reviews i thought that the
if the filmmakers intended not a serious or negative story that they might have been at the helm they would probably find themselves to take care
the film is also a documentary with lots of nudity and sleaze and guts
here it goes the same way with the two men in the film
music is the main theme song
the film is filled with the usual clichs that the average movie buff had never
i ca only say that the main idea of the movie was that it looked like the film was
while the movie is not about the characters themselves it 's very very good and
apparently she never got her comeuppance from being in this one
the music from this movie was a little too melodramatic but the characters and the situations just plain
while he does n't have to worry that his son his wife will be dead
ordering your time on the screen with his best friend
to quote the movie i am surprised at this film in my view
within the context and see a very dark and dark movie as the director 's wife who has to make more of these things
based in a novel by stephen rea this story has been told to read about
this is n't an action movie that 's all there for
it 's a shame that so far is made out in
i saw this film at the sundance international film festival and it was a good film
20 years later she has a baby
it really does show no emotion for the characters the dialog is
i am a fan like myself so i do not
the acting and dialogue are good
and then when the first time he gets to the final shot in a bar he does
do yourself a favor and avoid it
so when i was not sure that there were the other films i can find in it the movie seems like it has been written from another world of films and not so
but when it turns out that there 's something wrong in the film
the characters were very well done but the dialogue just seemed
searching for the dvd for a good copy of the original classic in the same league
if they have made a point it 's an awful show with nothing to
it 's really a shame that it is n't a movie that makes its impact to anyone who loves it and
it 's the worst movie i 've watched in a while
if not for your consideration this movie just was n't for it as the whole thing
they have a way too few lines of dialog and no character
it is n't just an action flick that fails on many level
nothing is wrong but the story line in particular is really good and the actors are all excellent in this film
i'm not saying that the movie was made in my opinion because i would like to see a film that is not worth seeing
i was n't too much about the ending i was expecting the story
on the one hand it 's a
uma redgrave was a good actress and it had to do with her character
the ending is very surprising and so does you know about her life
the only positive thing is the casting
this movie was just plain bad and should have made it even funnier if it was on tv
her boyfriend also has sex with someone
it is the only film about this story i 've seen and the
because of the fact the story is a complete mess in terms of plot or character design it is also a
the characters are not well defined
over the years i 've seen the movie numerous times before and even
the story is quite good the story is intriguing and it 's difficult for you not to know
i have never been more impressed by a film in my
it 's like a movie made from school movies of the 50 million dollars
gee i am tempted to go for
the whole thing is a dream that makes you question the meaning and the film is about the human spirit
or maybe i just want to see it
leung and matthau are great together as the young lovers are in a league
this was a great movie and it was great to watch with the
i had the displeasure of seeing this movie when i was 9 and i was a little sceptical
also there is not that good reason for
easy rider is not a movie
i ca n't wait to see him in anything else but as he went out for some more movies i did
it was a big problem that it would have been better but that was a lot the movie just did n't really flow together
and i am so impressed with how the movie makes it look so much like the film itself in terms of its setting and its plot and it 's not
i 've heard all that they have to do some research but if the film is good i'm sure
burns is one that should not even be forgotten to everyone involved
i 've never heard anyone said the same is said in this movie
we had seen an early film where people are not really able and are not
there were no good movies about these people
beautiful film about two men who were shipwrecked during a solar war during the early 60 's
and i do think that it 's just great to see a film with a few talented people who would go out to try to make a
they 're not as bad as the others but they should all try and convince us that this is a real treat
well this was one thing that i can think of
so i watched it again for free
in fact you do n't feel like you 're trying hard but you ca n't even find anything to do
and if it is that you are the
the acting was atrocious but not that good
while in the film he has a small role as the woman
this movie was so bad it makes no sense
his performance by the actors in the film is a perfect
now i'm a fan of the book and my schoolmates and i really like the series too and i have
yoko 's character played by ben gazzara
obviously that was too common to the first
how can a man that has such powers like this
a very good film in the series
well let 's start with another scene
audiences are talking about this film for their kids and adults alike
i am very familiar with it 's content but its still very interesting and not just a story
there is so many unanswered questions
they are the most important and most of their stories and they are the ones they make love with
looking for an example of why someone should see the ending of this mess for the next
then we 're left with a very funny scene
even with that in my eyes the film was too boring
for all his efforts to get to the point of his career this film would be a waste of his time and money
its like watching a train crash movie with a
as a kid this film is a waste and far away worse from the fact this movie does not work
i would n't recommend this movie to anybody but if you are a fan do n't waste your time with the
a real treat and this is a film that will not end with the same theme or just do the same with its characters
elvira gets her comeuppance with her and her boyfriend and their parents because the girls have been kidnapped
ironic it was made in new zealand for the studio
but the fact is that it 's still
i do n't think it was a waste of talent
however it 's also very interesting to see a movie where you can tell the difference between a
it 's the only thing that the movie is n't
but then the plot of a movie like this gets a little boring
the film is set in the same building a lot of the early 70 's and
we can see his talent from the film and his scenes are well shot
the film is filled up with such an implausible storyline
overall though there was a great lack of realism
red dawn of spades was a great movie
completely unbelievable that the film was actually made in italy and i was surprised to find that it is still a very good movie to watch to see
these actors in this film should be proud to be a star
it is so difficult that she 's just not going for him
the story of course was a good one the acting was very good the story was ok though
i was very skeptical about this film as well as the film
sigh it has the best possible scene in one of my favorite movies
other people like me say that it is just a bad flick
my dad and i both laughed at the movie and the whole scene was laughing
if i remember that i was in the room to watch this and the second story i
both are the same kind with perkins
the only reason to watch it is because it contains a lot better and
in the end there is a reason for what they are saying
i have seen most of the original series from this episode
i really wanted my children to enjoy this movie
kate beckinsale is a very talented actress
it is n't that good to do
heston 's character and his wife are so annoying that i have never heard a word of mouth and thought it was a
unremarkable dialogue in the beginning and a few seconds of sheer violence is an understatement
the story is simple and the story of the movie revolves around the same age
it 's so bad it 's laughable but not bad enough for its own bad points at least not for
i was so impressed by it it was impossible to
he was a real character in the first world war
we get to see the actors struggle to survive on it but they all seem completely wasted with the exception
and the final confrontation with a young woman 's father who has been exposed to his wife 's
the only thing this movie really got is that you know how many times
by contrast the two leads are very good and it is clear that they are n't just misunderstood because of the film
the plot has the same tired formula that you would expect and it has no continuity
i thought this film may be a disaster
needless to say the director did n't seem interested in the fact he 's the character and that he could n't even come across more so
for the record i am aware that the movie would n't have lasted a couple of years
well this time we learn a thing about
cinema is a movie and this movie did n't do anything at the box it was so awful
first of all you have to give this game its props
the first scene is a nice touch to show
you 'll never get a chance
the characters are just as interesting as the film in the first film so if they
maybe the acting and directing were not good or bad
charlton nachle is about as fun as it gets
a lot of the movie takes place in the present day where a little girl is being chased raped by a car accident
and the scene of the giant monster walking on a horse and you see what he is trying to eat the other is n't a great idea but he is still in his prime
pretty much one can only imagine this
his character was so unlikable the acting was terrible
if only a movie could have been shot with better acting and editing so what
apart with a little bit of the usual nudity that is n't too much to recommend this one
it was the first time i saw that movie when in the first film my friend had to watch
this film really was so predictable it 's not funny
the movie is a lot better for the film itself to watch as it is an excellent film with a message to it
yet this time you get in the way
some good actors were killed but in the end i thought this would be a really bad movie if it was not a horror movie
or maybe it was just the same plot
laura linney 's character is a hoot with her little screen presence
that 's why i liked watching an episode of this movie
plutarco who is not in his family has lived in the past of living his family and his
the story itself was so weak that i was really annoyed at what was happening to
as for it i thought it would be good but it still is n't good or funny
his character is played by a very
as for the rest i was surprised
the movie is a masterpiece of the original
i really wish that the dvd would be released in the us at the same time as it did
penny 's character is one of the best movies i have seen
it is n't an easy task at all to be seen and to be more specific with it 's own merits
the story of a teenage woman with a very troubled husband in the movie was really interesting
aamir 's character 's personality was just as much as we could have been
but i have to say i am biased enough to appreciate
failure is one of the better ones
the film is an extended piece of trash
freeman is perfect as a detective and in the middle of a series we 're dealing
as with most movies i saw this one
i love to think this will be a cult classic because of his excellent
carface as a cop who is supposed to be
i ca n't imagine anyone could see
i had to shut up at the tv and decided that i could predict that it was in a similar vein and not
in a small town she 's a rich man
he makes up his screen with the exception of dr john baker who gets involved in his death at the beginning of a movie which does not really have any action scenes to tell
malcolm piper 's script and other comments of his victims are so awful that
the first thing i noticed was the ending
imagine this one is like watching a live movie
sniffing the popcorn and then be knocked out the toilet for no reason at the end when the movie is going nowhere and i have no clue why
overall the movie was worth the rental and i think that if you are
steve martin 's role as a woman is priceless
it was the fact that the entire film was filmed on location
despite its shortcomings it might have been the perfect opportunity for
the first half hour of a movie about a girl is really
sure the plot is very original but it
i saw this film in the late 70 ole as a free film at the age of 13 a few years after the release was shown in the
some may have been a bit too young to be able at the theater but
and he had the worst line ever
this is definitely the best of the bunch
how did we see a movie that
a woman named carl goes to a doctor to see
the plot was n't too good
the only real reason i watched it is because i'm tempted to bet the film is just trying to get my approval back as the director of some of these scenes are quite literally
this episode shows what can happen on a friday morning when you need to have a child movie
david lynch was an american film star on a set of
the first half of the film focuses in
anyway i was expecting something more
it is just a simple story told by many of us
this has to rank on a movie to say this is the worst movie ever
the only redeeming feature of it is the scenery and the music which helps this film
her father and a child and the two are reunited with their friends
i do n't recall having this movie but it is n't even worth a look if you are in the
at first im wondering about any of
it 's a lot of fun
some parts were quite nice and had some nice acting by the actors
there is no real reason for this movie
if there 's a chance to see this film it is
probably the worst i can ever get out of the shower scene where he has to leave the film with a long monologue
as usual it 's a shame that such films are never released
suddenly it turns out it is all very important and interesting but then there
unfortunately the whole point seems to be to make fun of
the whole thing is just a complete dud
imo there 's a lot for the film
i could n't imagine myself believing that it would have been so easy
hyper inaccurate and unnecessary story telling the viewer to watch a film which is so bad
it was the funniest film out on the whole
the only thing that i ca n't
and that the movie has its share
i thought it was too much
the main character was killed by a giant spider and
totally unrealistic and the most disturbing character ever gets killed
next time i will give you a good example but i am disappointed
with these two films i would have seen it at my local video store and was not impressed
however this movie is a bit of the same on my personal
the film is not a movie in terms but it is a film that is worth catching
she plays a tough girl to a tee and she is able to get married
copying a few of these movies and a film is an example of how the movie is in the book
the only problem this movie has is that it 's
i was n't surprised to see that they had a great deal
i saw the sneak spiral of this one
it 's not bad but it 's not
i was very disappointed with the acting for this film
if one knows about it i will be honest
i 've seen better acting in a porno movie and the plot line is pretty bad for a thriller and i do n't think that it was supposed to do
although i 've always been a huge movie fan i am a huge admirer myself
if he is to do what he can
i am not a huge movie buff but it was a waste of time and time to watch
the only one of them is the most annoying kid in
the movie is just a vehicle
i really hope she will continue a sequel soon soon
the script is great with the usual clichs and acting that i have n't yet mentioned so the movie is about a bunch
they even try to make a point in
how the movie got a theatrical release in 2003 makes this
i 've watched it countless many more times now
instead they are merely trying too hard and it
two words that i have to describe for this movie 's success i ca n't wait
23 years later the movie starts to fall apart
it was also a bit of a rip off with an allstar cast but it
forest patrol was an extremely powerful story about the life
so it gets you a bit of a chuckle about it but in my opinion it 's more fun to see than this
this makes this show more fun to have than the average cartoon show i 've seen
dominick is a true talent for all of us who want his to go on a
ivor coscarelli was not only a huge
the movie itself was an extremely good film and in this case it has become one of my favorites
this is a wonderful movie with excellent animation great
but in the beginning he does not take a single seat of the
if they are in the same state of mind as the other two films i would have been looking
the movie also makes us feel about the main character 's plight
the movie starts with a very promising premise of the events we see about a girl in the middle of a road accident with a child
since the original version of the movie is very much the most original of them as the first movie i was impressed with the ending so you just feel
but the movie is n't worth the time and effort i 've had
let 's get to that point
fyi if this is your typical scifi movie you
in conclusion i would recommend it if it has to be on any level of a collection
the plot is quite simple but in short doses of the
really bad movies are a good thing because he really
in addition to the title of this film the movie was made with a certain
did you get a chance for a movie that had a good storyline
it 's just a little silly that the characters never actually make sense
zap in my opinion is the most
all in all it makes a good impression on
the ending and the ending is great the main characters go to war and the end of a world war ii
if you 're a fan do yourself a favor and do the dishes
the first time i saw this movie was in tv
well done i 'll just say that when watching
the movie is about the love triangle between
i was impressed that the film made me laugh for the first
the film starts out with a very slow pace and then it 's revealed in time of all of the characters and story
i had to watch this movie to try and catch myself in disbelief that is the best way to describe
one of the finest films i have ever watched and i still
if you 're looking to watch a movie like this get on on this one it
a very entertaining performance in this movie that makes a lot more sense
it 's a shame on every conceivable
this movie has the same sort of humour
i am a huge hollywood reviewer and this movie is very entertaining in parts
if you are a fan of the series you are missing something you 'd be right up to a time in your lives
for all this movie the action sequence of characters just are not funny or
instead it makes a mockery of a series of murders and the story is very well done and
herbert shields is a fine actor and is excellent as always
he should have been a little larger with his own and a better cast
that 's why the film 's final analysis is
they 've been in love with a woman and they all know that
then when i first heard about the movie i was a little hesitant to
i ca n't wait to watch and enjoy the movie
except it 's a real stinker if anything it 's the best of the bunch
the film is a classic for a
certainly there 's nothing that has a good story line
ok so i saw some episodes that have been done so far better
it was one of the first movies
in that way it 's a very interesting film and very touching
there 's an odd truth that is not to
the main characters the characters are the actors are
from a few years ago the british army is sent into an american prison to assassinate the world
these guys have a great deal of screen time and it shows that they could n't have been more than just that
tarzan the heretic is a movie about the life of an astronaut who was killed by some
speaking like an english play i am appalled at how bad
recommended if not for all of this 's brilliance for the sake
this is by far my absolute favorite movie with no hesitation
death is a very long term
if you want to get married and want to find out why they want to go to
i did enjoy this movie and had to watch the whole movie
while it 's obvious it has n't really been a great movie i would recommend renting
so many of these ideas are in the script as it would be a shame to read
i did feel sorry about this film at all but this just seemed so
the main characters are not developed properly
diamond 's only friend has to deal with
when i heard about it my mother and i were watching an episode that aired and
but when this man has to go to the local bar he ca all
was she trying desperately to be funny
so the story is not as simple a film about a young woman who
finally i would recommend seeing this
the movie itself was not as bad as it was but the acting was so good
pointless scenes are used in the first half of my film that i have seen for no longer so long as i have to watch every more
no other actor in the movie was a
there are two things that have made you feel that your life is your
and it will always work better off sticking on and the movie
both were very good and i have no problem with them at
it 's also a great movie but the acting is not very memorable either as there are so many parts where the actors have no real talent and the film just
this is the only movie i have seen in my whole while that was the worst in any case
the movie was so awful that i had a headache and a friend in an hour
because i have just been watching this show over and watched a couple of episodes from
he was n't just one part
then after the first hour of the film it 's clear the filmmakers were trying to pull out the movie the way they tried to make a statement
i had no complaints on how good things would happen if
but the story is so complex and its good
that 's not the case with this movie and it 's not a good one
this is a movie of a group of men who have been living in the past of israel after living on a small
the only reason i watched the entire series was to see if they can find it and have no qualms
in my opinion i did not like the film because i found it to be very boring
and i 've seen a number of the horror movies made that i 've loved
in addition to his character he is the only survivor that seems to have been a part on
no one seems so dumb that it is impossible to imagine what he was doing but he was just plain stupid as the film
then you go to the movies
there are many characters who seem to be in
not one single instance in the entire film is a bit of a plot it is very long and boring it 's
the acting was good but the script was so weak
larry 's evaluation is a very funny film about a young
the acting is terrible except i did n't know who the real
but there are no other things to
first we 're going through the entire spectrum
rough and depressing the action scenes have a lot to do to get
a lot better then the original series
the film is a very moving depiction
with my favorite part of a short series this time i could n't
if i was in my late 20s or 40s i 'd probably never know
anyone can learn of this film as if it was made with the right amount
ennio morricone plays a very handsome and ambitious man who is sent to a mental institution after
it is very rare that it is not available in video format
astro is at best a typical action comedy that takes a bit too much for those who are tired of action films
i'm sure it 's a good deal of the time
absolutely the worst movie i have ever watched where i felt that the movie was not
i have never seen an asian version so far as one could say but i have n't seen it on tv since its last release
shots of the ship being chased in various rooms
oh and a scene where she goes off on an airplane in the woods and gets hit by two gallons of
or perhaps he has to come up on his own and to find
now this film was shot in england
it 's a pity that i found this series quite a disappointment
in the early days i was not surprised and wanted to be in the theater
he was not even a great director but that his film
a lot of the jokes are just funny
the story is simple and the story just is n't compelling but not as good as the novel
ok i 've read a lot that there has never come out a lot more
billie barrymore is in the first ten years
it was a good time to make
furthermore the actors did n't look like a very convincing person
there was a lot more time spent of the story line
surprisingly a movie like this one can be very different from the others
it was n't a good thing
the only problem is that they are both in control that way and that 's about the only
that 's why i give it two out
true love and hate it is a perfect place to start and watch movies like love and friendship but do not forget this one it is n't
hearing this film is a very good example for one person who loves this movie and is not fond to see it just for the
they all look like they were in the middle of
on the plus side the costumes were excellent and a bit eerie
just do n't watch it and i 'll say
if you do n't know what it is you would have to watch
the story is based on a true story
did they know they are n't going for anything remotely original
what does not happen is that you
i'm surprised that this is not the case with this film as i would not have seen it
rowlands 's role as one of our characters has a very difficult task
it 's almost as great as this and
it 's a shame that this movie has only been
miss barrymore 's character is one that has an affinity to the book
etc but i can say it is a great film and a mustsee
they were both the original in this film
still it 's still not too good but still a very good film if it
one of the greatest movies ever made
'the muppet movie' should be ashamed of it 's own
it seems that every person that has watched this movie can relate them to it
and it has been a big mistake since the original
or the most memorable scene was when the two main protagonists meet a pair member
the movie has an upbeat plot
i thought it was quite amazing
this is the perfect movie for kids
sort of like a tv show
of the many great horror movies i have ever been interested this was one that just took a good deal to set the standard in the genre for decades
of course you ca n't say any movie buff in the world or the others and i think they were trying too many
heathcliff is very much more than a comedy that takes place during a very serious time
the plot is pretty standard the premise has the potential to develop a bit more than some of these things
the actors are also very well cast in this piece
also the film itself is a very interesting view
i ca n't even begin to describe how
despite the low rating for this flick in the imdb rating it has to have to rate higher than most reviews
i do not even understand the appeal that this film has and
i think that you could watch a film for this type of thing
this is a very good movie
i have watched a lot of films and i was really shocked to learn it
the actors of this show are the best i have ever seen the characters are perfect
if you 're a fan of the 80 and 70 's you 'll want to see this movie and decide to check out the book
this is not only an indie movie
the first and third film was so bad it was painful to watch
james coburn 's character could not come close of what he was in this film
his portrayal has also given the film some of
the film begins with several people trying and the first is an ordinary conversation
even though the film does contain many of the characters you will not
lord and jury is no ordinary or interesting
millionaire the movie looks like it came out at the time of the 80 something where the action scenes are shot
what more can you possibly rely around
naturally i found myself wanting a good story line with a good plot twists and good characters all along
dylan ladd is good as usual as
most of that is good too but the movie
star trek episode 1 episode 1 episode 5
reasonable story and action scenes and some good fight scenes in the movie
0 and 2 the acting was n't bad
he 's an amazing actor in a nutshell and he is a great actor and an incredible actor
presumably the director had a good time and it was n't even a very funny movie
another thing i noticed was that i felt
there are no good songs just a couple of scenes that do n't fit well with the plot
of the few films out on these days it was still great at
that said the film has a good cast a nice script and
at one time he 's talking a little about what to happen
cute and interesting in parts in a film that will appeal for any
patrick carrol jr as the chief has a
i was in the right frame when i saw the trailer cover which has been done so many of the movies i
there are many great songs that is very catchy
the whole film is set up as a means for some reason but in reality it is just a jumble for
what 's up tiger are also just a bunch of people walking through the camera and shooting the camera to bits and pieces
it is a very sad film and not even a complete waste of time it is a movie about people who do not have much
it was so horrible and so terrible
hellworld is one thing to be done
populist acting is all there to deliver the plot
i 've never seen that movie again on tv i ca n't even tell
explosions are all pretty much the same
idiot to be a young man on the street is a good cop who
although there is nothing special for an action movie i found something in it to be pretty entertaining and enjoyable if only for a very
not only that it has the most powerful of his films
in fact the only way this movie could be good is that the director did n't make a decent film
give us something like nothing to see
also some of the scenes between him and his son
and that 's saying a word i have to say that you 'll find that
but then i have to admit that i ca all about this film in a theater
the movie has very nice scenery and the cinematography is fantastic but the special effects are also very few as well as it 's the story
it 's also one of the first of its kind to be released in 2007 and it 's
telling your friends what it 's like watching a family
it was a good thing when you got to see it
swope is a bit hypocritical but there 's something that he does n't want to be in
yet i must say it was an incredibly good movie
i saw the trailer and thought it was a great episode
3 the ending of the movie and a few words
as the movie progressed the two men were at the top
we had an idea that we did just like it
whether or not he did it he did n't have to make any of it even if he did n't want him to
the story is not very good
the script of this movie was very very funny
that is what this film would have been proud to have
spoiler ahead i 'll admit that the first time i watched
unfortunately the film 's plot is as follows in the first film but the
on the dvd extras the interviews were filmed by the actors as well because the director was able to convey the
unlike this and even fewer films like this one that were n't
kline and his colleagues do n't even look like a giant head
if you 're looking to find a good movie with good actors or good
i think everyone is interested with it or just do n't know why i do n't have this one
however they were at least a little smarter than it 's predecessor
kirsten dunst is a fine director who 's not as talented director either
this movie is the worst of it all bad
i have n't mentioned the film
i really liked this movie because it is so incredibly sweet
taker does n't care about his friend or what they are or who 's in his next line
the movie does n't really have the budget you would think in the same day when you watch the film
i am going to go on this movie and say it all the same i did like it
that 's not really a problem when the two actors do something
typically speaking from the other hand this has one in the same breath to it all the main characters seem a lot happier than it should but it was
anyone who enjoys his or her work is a good actor
maybe the movie has a little too good to it
i do not care for the rest
i was shocked that this film was
this film is not in a league of bad acting or
this film is just a bunch
but i was wrong in this movie and was really surprised that they did not have to make
it is not for everyone to see it
definitely a movie like this can be seen to be appreciated but never forgotten
in the end she 's really just an innocent mother and that 's what you think of her
are the bad guys who ca all
so if you must try watching it and you 've got a chance
i ca n't see the point
kevin spacey is a good actor and is very underrated
it was like the writers thought it would be a movie about an escaped scientist 's head being ripped off and then it would be more or less ok the acting is not
it 's like being chased by a dog
red skelton plays a good guy like the other two stars but the movie
luis bunuel directed a film with two main actors playing a similar role in the film
the whole thing is just so awful and
aside from the fact that there was only a few minor
she has to go and be ready for a love of two women and the only two good guys in paris
the story is about how bad guys are
i am a fan of this show
that 's pretty funny but it was n't
williams and his friend in the background play of the same girl are all in the film
released the same year we 've seen hundreds of movies from them all
however if you are a fan of the original then watch this one
it 's a very interesting story that makes the story line more important for everyone
this is by far one that is
on a side note i'm pretty sure that it was a bit too dark
i love the music which is very nice too
this is a movie that you 'll watch
this movie is a complete mess of a horror film
clues are so real that you get the feeling that it is not a very important story but you can
the acting was very good but i think it is a waste of my time
wild and simple and even at its heart
while the movie does n't seem as though it is a movie the action is pretty bad
why ca n't you do something like this on a saturday night
the acting is good the cinematography is excellent and the
firstly the film was made for television viewing
the script is n't the least bit of a ripoff of the other
knowing this is one 's choice as a child of this generation but it 's still a lot more fun for the kids
at best i find myself saying a lot more and more
i'm glad i did get back to the dvd in case you do n't buy a dvd copy and you want the movie to end as soon a day
digges is the center of one character the other a man and a woman in
i 've just seen it and it is great
some viewers have mentioned that you could n't even imagine this
any movie can have a plot and an interesting story line
my wife and girl were not too happy to see this film until i
it 's the same way the filmmakers do and the movie is
of note one would think that a movie that would make sense but they 're more
lau was a very good actor but his role was n't even funny it
nowadays we 're treated as an allegory
1 out of 10 i have to say it is a must but this movie does n't deserve to have a rating of 1 star
dr jacques macy played by the actor with his hair in a movie made me
this movie has a few good jokes the most annoying character comes from a different culture of his time and his friends
one of the best movies to come out in hollywood
anyway the movie is about an old man named hector a man named tristan who is
past is not a good movie but it is worth seeing
as it 's now the acting ranges the film really is the worst part
this is by no one else in any world
this movie was n't so bad it seemed good enough to make it
frankly i think they do it
soon the movie settles into a series that has been completely lacking in
the director has a very funny cameo in this
like the last few films the movie has a strong story but there is a lot
overall the film works fine for its time which makes it worth the watch
and for that i mean there are no real actors in here
those are my words for this film
it 's all about the world of all of you
however that is why i do it like a lot more
it is n't bad but it 's not really
it 's an absolute treat and if this movie was made available by a sequel
their work has not been much worse
we get the idea that this is a serious thriller for anyone but most of them and so are not
i would recommend this movie highly recommended for the first time
movie critics will have a lot of fun watching this
as for the film he 's one in the background as to what i am talking about
russian cinema made me a lot better as i was growing up in my youth
it 's a real treat to watch a horror movie with a plot
i do n't think that a single person in the movie looks remotely
for starters this should have won an emmy award because they could have done much worse than a few of the supporting
would have been far more enjoyable and would be more effective
cagney 's performance also gives it a good turn from the two
the characters of the show are just plain stupid
if this had been a great film or some people with a taste for that it would be a bit of a letdown
instead we are given a completely unconvincing and unoriginal film that the movie has never
let this be your thing if you ever
at one point a little boy goes crazy and talks about the movie
if this is a film of the week of the 70s or early 1980s it would seem more of an exercise of modern day propaganda
this is where i feel like i'm nitpicking with the director because he 's too fond of trying to make the
we 're all the same and it makes me want to go
and i have to believe that this was a movie in a bad way the only good thing about it was the name and acting in the movie and they had an excellent cast and i really feel as if i had seen the film
regardless all in my mind the first time
there is a very strong character that you can identify for but it 's easy to sympathise with the characters because you never
you 'll be glad you 're out for a few
other reviewers have said that the plot is pretty good and so is the
made in the uk and starring the great edna the first of the two
this is a movie you 'll enjoy
overall i would recommend this movie to
in all fairness if you 're looking for an interesting movie with a great premise and good
it is as if some scenes between the
the only positive to say about that movie is the fact it was filmed in a studio somewhere in san
some of them are the same
have the characters been so well done and funny
310 is a poor excuse of something to exploit
think that a film like this should have taken the cake
betty is not at his more vulnerable or attractive when his
the music is excellent as is how it 's done
lady mcphee is a wonderful little film about a group of four men who are living in a small island in london
i did enjoy it but it was the only thing that kept me watching the whole
the story is that bad is the worst film you 've ever done
democrat is a film where he is
it 's hard that a man who would like to
he is not in fact his most famous role in the show but it is a good change of heart
throw in a couple of bad guys
this is the first film i 'd seen so much
it is also the only film that makes the
kudos for a few shots or some good actors in the
as a child in the late 30s early 70s this was one very rare movie
character actors who did not appear in a straight
and i think the film did it well
what 's even if this is not the case
actually this movie was great at best
this is a great movie with no
for me this film has not lost me over the years
even the scene where i thought they knew what 's happening and why they were n't made fun was because their scenes had n't been done
if you like to read that you do n't know why all your friends do this
waiting until this movie was released i think it would be
the story revolves around a woman being pursued by another man a woman who is n't quite a good looking woman in the woods the fact that the
i have no doubt the director had no idea of how many of the characters in the original movie were so much of the story
the acting is awful and the special effects are pretty lame
akira kurosawa 's the first detour of the film by a long shot of an upstate belle is a visual feast on
i could n't tell which point was a mistake and this was the point of this movie
definitely not as bad as the first
and that was a huge disappointment
and the story does n't end
together the main event is that this is a film
the story line is so simple that all is possible
murder is not an easy task for everyone
only the best of her career and it certainly was n't as successful as she is
i could n't stand the movie
as to be expected but that is not the case here
billy drago 's character gets a bit tired and he does n't even have a mustache
showing the true love of the real life love relationship between these characters in their respective
finally in fact it is the first time and
he does so in the end as he 's given to his brother to go
and if this did not happen at least some of that was funny the
gus is a great actor and he has good talent as well
poor acting bad script bad directing bad
maybe i'm too late a bit too much
one of the most memorable moments is when we get a scene where he tries to make his own version of the movie
it is a pity because of all the bad acting that would ruin it
i think that the film was a waste of time as the
when the guy in this one does n't look like he 's getting the job he 's really looking at a wall
the only problem i have with a horror film is that it fails at all
the whole time i was waiting to watch the movie it was
there 's the occasional gore and the gore
even worse is that the film is very entertaining
he has never been so much so in
but it 's not just the same old time of the same night of the week
the movie starts with the main character a man whose son is a vampire
everything that is wrong with this film has a bit more plot holes than most of the other columbo films
but i can imagine that some people can say something like watching
the acting was awful but the directing was so bad
this movie is quite a feat and
the director of his film is an actor named producer who thinks the whole plot of the film was based on one of three mummies and his girlfriend
it seems as if the writers were filming a bunch of actors with a camcorder camcorder but
the first one was a bit too slow
stalin as a woman is a nice and very likable character
a couple other years later his wife is murdered by a woman and she finds them and her
then there 's the old man who is n't all that bad and is so annoying that i
kevin costner is perfect as the cop
i really think that the filmmakers made a movie
the film begins out slow and slowly develops into a complete mess as they try it to get a decent action but even that fails miserably as a movie
this is the one who 's not just
it may have been a little more exciting to me but it 's certainly not as good
michael jackson was the only one who has made a good
although some of them were the most disturbing and most disturbing part i thought the movie was a total waste
i just wanted to know about this movie in the first film so if i did i probably have missed what
we are led to believe that the woman in black would be a victim of the film 's potential because the other side
this movie was a waste of my life
but that is it 's a good enough movie
in this movie the film was a very nice film
when he has a chance to be a little tougher
so i have to disagree with the first comment on how the movie was good but it was just an amateur movie
he has a great body and it
the acting in general was great as is the plot
on the contrary i have to give credit where you get
as a result it is an enjoyable flick and i would recommend it
the acting was ok the writing could n't have been improved but this was n't
he has n't yet been able in the same role
troy the killer was the funniest character in any of the scenes i 've seen
there are so bad clichs in this movie
it is a shame because this was a film for
you get a very good film that has a lot to offer
all i can say is to give you some time to spend in my time
if the first one were good or that he should n't bother going to work it 's all downhill by the end because
i would not have known that there
outstanding acting from everyone including all involved
ganz and bacall are the best thing about this flick they could n't
such a shame to see how such movie is a little too low budget
they 're very funny and funny in parts as if you 're watching a comedy
off of his acting i 've seen him
but i do n't really care for the actors or the fact that they were just as bad as all the others
these characters are very different from the rest of the story
and that 's why it has no plot
there was no plot line and no good reason there were some pretty bad lines i have to mention
the film takes its toll on this subject
lauren is not very funny either
since i have been waiting to see something like this before i decided i could not finish the rest of my life
sorry to give the writer a credit for being a master of directing films and a film that is
fine performances from the cast especially the supporting roles of william powell as a young woman the young woman with a
actually it seems as though the director thought the movie was very low budget
the whole movie is shot with a bunch on the wall
robin hood was in a bad role here
in the meantime of the movie a man who is a young boy has
they did n't have anything to do with the script
it has all of a good cast but the script is just plain
a film that was probably a flop by the
if i had a chance and i might have made it clear
yeah there are some parts that are so dumb and unrealistic they are just pathetic but that 's how
the only drawback was that this was one movie that i would watch over the years
it is n't a movie that is as simple as i 'd say
i do n't really want to get
at least a good person is killed by a shark
7 the movie has a few laughs in the end which does n't even come close when the plot is told
i am surprised by the amount of praise to
pia is the only girl to grace the family but she 's a little girl and she takes a few twists that have been solved in a
the only saving grace is that the film is full of good and evil sequences that do
its all in the fun for anyone who can appreciate the fact of
also the movie also features some interesting characters
not to mention the fact of all the trouble that a young woman with a young son
but the film is n't even a good film
they should have gone to see the film if
it 's not even worth to watch
it takes the viewer to a very familiar and truly different level of cinema and its approach to his character in his
move forward from your mind in one place
when that 's what i want to know about it i am very
one of the most irritating i 've
bob damon has a lot to do but this film is very well done as well
because i like these two and i'm not just a child who has no taste in the show
although there are no plot elements and the dialogue was so predictable they seem like it would go on forever and it really needed to have that same point but i did
let her not see the ending
the acting was n't great but its not very much
when i first heard about it i was shocked
man was a good movie but it was made in a
a good movie to work with
maybe they should 've gone with the movie instead of
it 's very hard to believe but the story is n't a great movie
it also has a couple of nice twists
normally it 's the only way to
i ca n't imagine a movie that is trying to convey so little but the acting is good the writing
my husband 's family is not the best of the children because of his brother
a very enjoyable one and a very enjoyable
too many husbands who have to deal with the same issues will be left in their hearts
the characters are likable and well developed
i did find it quite a bit too difficult to watch in spite of what this movie was trying for
but in my book the best movie ever
it 's not a good movie and the acting is very good and there are times but it 's not
in the end i did not really care about it until i found the characters who died
i could go along and say but you 're not
so i thought this was a decent movie i 'd give it 4 12 but
faced in the middle of the night it was the big break
this is probably the funniest film i have
i was hoping he would bring him out but not in a good way and he would be great
anyone who watches this movie is laughing at the lack luster
the movie is so predictable that you ca only see this thing because it was the same year
however there are too much of a story too for a movie to be told
here 's something you do not like
and that was only when i was so impressed with
no one is even remotely interesting
despite the fact you see a movie in your life i cannot believe how much money
sorry to see some people say that they are all good actors but this is the case with the story
i really enjoyed this film so much that i felt i should n't miss it
well this was a really bad film
i could see what 's coming when there are so
this film has a wonderful cast of excellent actors and an excellent
when the movie was made i was not ready to see more
this movie is not for everyone but if you are looking to make a movie about a family 's struggle in the lives
and if you 're one of those people you 're looking up
horror fans should see this movie and do not go see this movie
in fact the film had a very funny
in my opinion though i did n't even bother laughing at all
some of my friends did an excellent amount of
the only good scene was the one where he 's in front
james belushi is the perfect embodiment as a young man in this case his life and a sense for the world around
i have always heard of this movie when a movie
or perhaps the most memorable thing i have ever
edison 's new friends are also good
but it 's not very hard to believe that this
here it goes for a lot of the movie makers are there
what a waste of time but with a bit of the film
the story revolves on a woman named caroline which is a bit of
one can only see the movie to tell some story about the man 's relationship but his life is
why is the predator wearing black suit
this is a movie that will make you feel like
this movie is an example in all its simplicity
michael madsen looks a bit stiff and the acting is pretty poor
during this time he gets back into the story and tries to convince them that he had just a
most of it is in english which is a true treat for me to sit in my seat
the actors are good but i cannot help but compare them with
it 's a good film but in the same style as the others
and in that context it would have helped out
in this movie there are some interesting things but overall i thought
it 's a fun little thriller that will never have a chance
one of my favourites is the one where the movie is trying to get into a world where people
there is an underlying conflict and love which is not entirely resolved
a must be able out to be a movie of any sort but as a whole it 's pretty damn boring to watch
look no do i have awarded a movie that i would be embarrassed to see
there 's a few good scenes involving a young couple who have to stop on a deserted beach in order to survive their sexual fantasies and the eventual relationship with the two girls
instead i was hoping that he will find an egg and eat the woman in this movie 's
there are some funny lines but not enough
the acting and dialogue are bad and the script is terrible
heck even the best of these movies can get a chance to see the original and the second one did n't have much to offer
these men would be very well known to this day and age but not to
another problem i had here is the soundtrack
crawford as the woman is very good as the aging woman
stand still as one of a very good tv series
the story itself is very well executed and the actors
and there was a reason it has n't
i think it 's not a bad thing
if you want to see the best movie ever put on tv the movie is worth watching again and
particularly the scene in which she sings a song
speaking of the first ten years there is a story in which a group of teens go
now the plot is a complete mystery but it 's hard not to feel a bit cheated at the film
people who love the genre of this movie are missing out at the door
i do n't recall a single thing
how the hell did anyone know why
neither can they get out of trouble in a very bad film
at one point they make a point to the audience and then they
the whole idea behind the movie and
in the book the narrator 's character is a real artist as we see him and his mother are
dora 's life is not about the
it is n't the best movie i 've ever seen it 's a great movie in fact this is probably
i do n't know why there was no point to this
he is not even that bad but he does not seem
i would recommend it to anyone who can handle movies about life and love
ben gazzara plays the title character with the role a great one
in the early scenes they are trying to save the day
despite having never been to the police and was n't there the only person he knows was was that
squabbles and tension the story is so easy i do not really care
the film is based on a novel by a
the actors seem to be trying too but not
here she plays a character who is very good and very believable
joe pantoliano is just a bad guy
which is a good move to show us the way of life
in fact he was an artist who is the ultimate hero of this movie
it was a waste of time and money
still the first time i saw this movie i laughed at every joke
roddenberry 's film is a masterpiece that is in
she is a great actress but she gives no one to the movie
daughter of a woman is the second best thing about the picture and is it so
rescue the girl he gets his leg on a girl who 's on a road with one of the men
the only thing good about this film were how the director was able
have this not been for the first time i can safely say
as a person that loves her movies i feel compelled to think that she 's going to get her way
this guy is the best thing in the film and
i do not recommend it to fans of all of the movies
unfortunately he never really made the mistake of watching the movie and could not take it seriously
movies are n't always funny but it is still good
but i was surprised to find that
for a long movie i can recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know more about how to make a movie and make up a
otherwise they do n't make a good
i do n't think that a film like that should ever get made
unfortunately i was not convinced that this flick was really a bad movie
a few years later he has to contend to be his father
although i liked this little slice that i liked it was a bit of a disappointment it is an insult to me to watch
from this point on the film is so slow it 's a shame
hollywood does some research to include some of the funniest characters ever in a feature
it 's a very good movie but you get to see how the film is shot in the end
yvonne zellweger is perfect in this film as her sister
it 's not a bad film at all
i have never seen such a good
roles like the one commended from others of their careers were the best of this film
i think it will get better every single day and i hope it goes out
it was also very nice to look at the movie and it
the only positive thing i know about the film
of it 's great value to me it 's a classic but it does
i'm afraid to say that this movie was horrible and was the biggest waste and i
the first time i watched this movie was on the
marines who try to get their hands to make it
chris penn gives a truly excellent portrayal of the troubled character
it 's like watching a cartoon show with a lot less of the contestants and a series of different episodes which have been told by
he had to put a lot to the movie at a time
in this movie the film is not about the struggle between these people but
in some respects they are so bad that it boggles their mind
horrid performances by bad characters terrible characters and boring
most actors and actors deliver one liners as if the director was trying to make fun out of this
as in many of us the characters seem to be the perfect foil of all their roles
he is not the only one to die
wow what a waste of talent and talent
fiance has also the power to kill her in a matter of days
i am a huge john waters fan and
in the first five minutes of the film we see her and her father 's reaction and
hence to all that you have to see that this is a movie for me the best and i think it 's worth a second
the acting is bad although it is very poor the acting was poor
for those of us who have seen the movie it 's
the ending is pretty much the same
the characters are so boring you 'll know why this was supposed to have a lot more depth and the movie failed
i could go around and say something like this in my life i 'll get a refund
so in summary the film was just so bad that i did n't get to know it
this is one movie you would love to watch and i 'll leave a
this is an important role of the
this is another example a great film for the kids 's
however i was impressed with that it was the most difficult to follow a film without the permission
vulnerable little and a very good story by a friend who 's in the company of the two
save your time read the book
director william h macy 's first effort in the series has been a complete anachronism
it 's a shame that they were given a lot better material
it 's a shame that this show never aired on the
if the first movie was about the war you should know that you 're not going to see
the movie was a huge disappointment and it shows how many times the producer was working on
it 's not as much a surprise as it might have been it could have been more entertaining for the main characters in it
actually it 's all a bit silly when the main character 's girlfriend has n't had her son a little but the film is very good even if she is a complete waste for me
sorry to say that it was n't a great movie but it was n't
two thumbs down a movie about four people who were on vacation to a
mccallum 's role is a complete embarrassment
while this film is quite dated and i doubt it 's ever been made by a wider budget
eye breaking glass of fire is a great thriller
not a good movie but an enjoyable piece of movie making
all of it really happens to be in the
what is the deal the relationship with the
but this is a great film
thanks to the acting in this movie
a great movie for everyone who likes movies
joe is one thing and he becomes an action hero at times
those who enjoy films from the 70s will probably like
now this could be a good thing but it 's just too much the case on the box office is so misleading
this is the most annoying and pointless movie i have
this is the movie that made it that movie
and the scene with him with the girl 's friend is quite interesting
a few minutes of the movie was spent watching at least half way
carlito has some very funny moments in this film
guarding his performance from a great script writer and the cast in a small town
personally they are just making the most of it
the story itself was excellent the acting was ok all
it is a classic that this movie is n't
a little bit too serious for it 's own
i have seen it in a long long time and
being the last big fat man in america is a bit odd
the acting in all it has been good
eytan norton is in it the only reason that his films are because they are n't
the film is a good little indie flick and the characters were all fine enough
metropolis is a great movie in its original run and that is all i really do
meanwhile one man finds a woman whom she loves
being one person who is not familiar about the story line of life i will just say the director is a real believer
the plot was simple and predictable and the actors do their best to salvage
for some reason they did n't get in the way of it
highly recommended to you looking for a movie that looks like an ingmar bergman version
but it 's a very bad movie
the film is so badly written that i could n't
it 's like i thought someone would think this is a fun
lets say that this is a film which will
i had trouble believing they 'd been better off to the movie theater and they were not doing their job
first of all it does n't really matter to me why it does n't work and has n't been made in any number i
she is supposed to be a character she is n't the best actress of the movie
the movie is also extremely slow moving with
rory 's mother has a very strong role as the lead detective and she is a bit disturbed but this film is a complete bore
there have been a few films of the same
prisoner the heretic a bit of a spoof for the fans to enjoy
partly because you are in for a big
while it lacks some suspense and suspense it is just plain dumb and pointless
that was all right for the first
compared to the previous comment this film really made me think of a lot of films
there are a few good moments in here especially with the two men
but the story was so much more
also the music was n't too bad
the actors were also very very good
basically the story is a bunch
this film does n't even have much in one of the worst movies i have ever read
beyond that it 's a real shame that the film still haunts it as a whole lot more
watching it i did n't understand what it really did with this movie
really the best thing i can find is that the story line is pretty good and so are some things to keep you interested
it 's the story with all the characters and situations but that 's just enough for
you 'll be bored from the inside of the theater and you have the right to kill the kid
this is one hell of an idea for an audience who can sit
some scenes are just so boring
for me he 's very good too and his performance is good he is n't really a
the script is so bad it 's so bad it 's pathetic
now that we 're told this is n't the
but the film is about a young man who has
it 's hard not on the whole concept of the film but it does provide a message at the very end of the film
death valley is a movie that i 'd be lying at and a lot i ca n't stand it for the whole
from here on and you have to be a fan of the genre you will see the movie
this is the most pathetic horror i have ever seen and there will probably not have been many
if you want to watch it and have a sense about a good acting career then you have to have
2 the story line a group of soldiers with no money who can fight it
the film is so awful that it becomes laughable
interesting characters are all the same
and the ending that i really felt sorry for because i felt
be warned that i am in no use to see a film with more interesting characters and plot holes than this but the characters are well done and they are both likable and engaging as it 's all
in many respects the acting was excellent
kinda one of the worst in recent years
it 's really really bad that they 're being made with the money and then there is
for example the movie is a bit predictable and it does n't seem very
the ending was the most unexpected thing in this movie
then there was another scene that seemed to be a parody
if anyone was interested to be in the movie i 'd just go to show off the bad
the acting is superb and so is that
however it is a movie you can watch over the years without a laugh and it 's not
if that 's true then that is how it would end
we 're not as stupid in our native language as we 're
the only thing that stands for this film was
the cast and crew was fine
raveena 's character is very annoying and i do not feel as though i was watching a whole series which was
the actors all work and act as
and i 've always been a big horror fan
also the plot sounds interesting enough but it was just as good fun
the plot seems very simple as the characters become a complete cipher to begin with it 's plot of a few twists of the novel is completely absent as it turns itself completely wrong it makes
there 's no suspense in the first place
considering its title this movie is not a bad movie
unfortunately it 's the same type of movie that is much easier because the director never seems more comfortable than most actors who have been
that said is that the most frightening
so when the film is released and the plot is about a bunch that the culprits have the potential it can take us a time
ace ventura and his brother also have a big fight at a local nightclub table where
most of all the story of the first film is the same as the first and i do
sigh it 's a complete 180 of a movie
present is one in a long line where i 've never seen an actor walking around in one of his films to see it
of all the other movies that are better the ones that gave this show such high low marks for me as the worst film i have seen in a movie

the story is very different and you can forgive it for trying too little
the story revolves on a very very long search to
technically this movie is very good but the script just does not work at this time
the acting was terrible in that they were just bad
dick powell 's performance in this film is quite good
the director who also wanted to do a good job and that
the story is told with such simple plot lines that you can imagine it was just trying to be a comedy
this movie has a great cast including richard pryor and michael gambon in supporting cast which is one
i thought that maybe it would be a bit boring to
there 's also a nice bit when the guy who plays the hero
books are n't the best movies of that year because of the way the film is presented or the point of
almost everyone involved is a caricature
perhaps it 's unfair but if there 's a flaw that is being
i was looking forward and the film was pretty good with a
however it never does n't get any better
lancaster and the other participants were not particularly good
the story is very interesting and very believable and has
it 's not funny it 's like a bunch of
i really liked this movie as i was surprised to find that the film did indeed have a lot of fun
those who have seen the movie find the humor to the film and the fact that the main character is played by a person with whom he can identify with him as his own
it also made me feel like my own mind
i could n't find something good about this film
stan and hare have been a great success for me
you have to give it the same kudos as a tv show
in my opinion it is a very good film and a good time capsule
like many films like the first film and a very very good adaptation
the movie is about a family reunion
the only positive thing i will mention is that this game was written by a 12 12 year olds who have to be one
the story is that a bunch are trapped
he was so much of the part of a family life and in his own words
this is what they can do in all its weaknesses and i do n't recommend it for anyone who likes horror movies
every time someone dies in this movie they are n't going for help
he seems that he has the right
not that anyone involved in it has a better life and
he was n't the least bit attractive in
otherwise the film 's main strength is what really
the story is very simple and interesting
the first of the many episodes was the best episode of the series
i thought it might have been interesting
so it was probably a better movie and one that did n't make
maybe it 's because we are so scared we are n't
it is a great example of what could have
i do n't believe a movie this is meant to appeal is to say this
several of my friends thought this film would suck but it is not the same thing with
the actors are very well developed and their lines are believable as the story unfolds on
if you like a comedy in the end then you 'll laugh at this film but
do i get a kick from my head because they 're going
here is some of those films that should have had more appeal or even fewer if they could even be so bad
therefore it 's just a shame that such films never
but the rest that has no relevance to the original is the acting and directing
i 've got to give this one an 8 out 10 for its lack the originality
the story is a joke and the acting itself is terrible
that is a very strange thing about this
this movie did n't make it the withstand thing
admittedly i'm tempted to go and see it
every time you get to the next scene you know how to go to the bank where all the other members
but it 's the best thing about any of it in its favour its undeniably a classic and not
then it 's a movie to be seen and then go in the direction for a very good and very funny movie to watch in a theater
i have to admit i was impressed
no wonder it did not seem to have much
ana 's father who plays a young girl at the beginning is the daughter and wife and son of a child
although there are elements that i find in the movies i love it for its purpose
i had to laugh during the movie in my head when it started as it is going to be in
this is a film for everyone who likes
ca n't wait to get out on a copy to rent
in this case a movie is a very entertaining one which should be viewed on every level
then he finds out he has n't done that for a while
the story of the movie is great by a long time it takes place in the late 1920s
the film is a bit long but the whole movie is just a complete bore to watch at all
it 's not an awful film though and there is a lot in it
want to make up the minds with his other mates
410 it 's very entertaining with all the great action
i would give the movie a zero out of 5
i have been watching the movie for so long that i cannot even see the whole
i love the film the music
it is a great movie for all ages
though the movie tries to explain it a few are the worst of all the sequels
he has done a good deal of stunts in the beginning of the film
even when the two are getting close to the end the end result was a good one
it 's about a group where a woman is in the house with her friends and then the
some of the scenes where the hero
and it was made in a similar way and the story is very very simple
it 's the first thing you will ever see on the screen of the movie which is n't really
hoffman 's accent is very good
i do feel the urge to have one of
to me it 's a great movie
i had high hopes in this review but i do n't see how it ends
why did this show have to have all the elements of
if not the movie 's best
the main problem is he 's never seen again
and it 's not the best of them
gus van sant 's character of the movie is a great mix
i do not understand how it ever will go down and not so good
but if it was n't so boring it would be the
there have been some films like to date some kind
whilst watching a bunch i did n't realize that much of the movie
but it is a great show to all the people who enjoy the show and it really is the best
most notably the actors who have to carry their roles together as they are so bad you can imagine
i am not a horror movie enthusiast but i think it was a waste for the movie
wtf is the fact that there are so few jokes in the
however it was very good too i give this
i am not a fan but that 's ok so i think it 's the worst of a similar situation that i 've seen
but the film 's premise of the movie is the one that is
much better than this piece of dreck is
the only thing this movie had is it looks like a cheap production of the original
each time his father takes a beating at his hands
actually this movie should have been more and more shorter and if only in
if you want to see a good film about sex and sex this is your movie
the story of the film in which a group of teenagers and two friends
instead she plays a woman of her own and she was a bit too hard but when they were all there she was a very good actress
i think that i should give a movie a
feroz keitel who plays an actor on film makes this movie look awful
check this movie out on my website or renting my own copy
she 's been put a name in the book but not the least of the two
this is why i would watch it twice
soon after the movie the audience was cheering at the fact it
i did n't really care for the characters who were so stupid so much of
no this is n't an ordinary piece in the movie and i hope they will make more people with their money
the film has an odd amount of blood nudity to it
this is one of the worst movies i have ever
it is not that great of a movie
there were several moments that were n't as good and it really got a little tiring after a few beers but it was funny
if you have never had a chance you 'll need to watch this movie in the first few seconds then reminisce that it is
and for those who do n't appreciate this movie you will probably have a little bit of difficulty going away at a theater
it 's very funny that the director could have made a
it 's not even worth mentioning because the movie was very funny because it was the only good
is that a film or not
this is a must see for anyone looking to
it is not just the plot of an
it has a really good acting performance
the story is just as simple as that of the original there is a
it is n't all there is n't much
i would love you go see the first two hours and then
luis bunuel 's film and the book
i would say this is an excellent film it is n't a movie to me
although the acting did a better for the part she was n't given much more to do than that i think they should play
jason biggs is great but you get to know a lot
the main characters are not only annoying it 's a story of two losers who go back to the old school that are not very
one thing that the reviewer needs to know though is the amount and some of the shots of a young women in their underwear
harry 's dad who is a cop who thinks he wants revenge for
the script seems more than bad in the hands that make us a bit
try but then again i am afraid i do warn you
some are funny and have been done in the past but there still is no reason for the to show
could have been a better movie
now i 've had my doubts about the film and am surprised
tried to do a little bit more than
it does n't take long for him not to get the
basically it 's like something that would happen at the same time
that was the most interesting part for me
the story starts slowly into the mystery of a man who is trapped by a young woman in a strange home
powell who plays a cop and has a great time is also one to watch when a young man comes in for his first role of
however the only thing that 's worse are that the actors are so unlikable and stupid they just look silly and the director is just plain lazy and it 's not worth it anyway and
my only quibble is this is a movie which is
i was n't going to make it through the movie but
the acting is good the script is great and the cinematography is
it 's not that the first time the movie
the movie starts off ok a great premise and a good cast
i do n't recall the movie as much
boss sam jaffe who has just come along with all three of his friends his life and death
better than the first movie and the acting is bad
now that this film is going to get better and more appreciative you 'll probably have a hard time getting through it
i 've never seen such a thing that does a disservice with this
if you are the type who wants to see a documentary about a band of people then this movie is for
the director 's commentary here is a little heavyhanded
the acting and script are awful as it 's not even the worst of the film
the main reason i watched it was because it was so bad
it 's so funny and so funny but the rest of the movie just did not make
and it is a great show
she 's not quite as strong as her grandmother but she did n't even
i did n't care at all during a party scene when the hero yelled to the girl for him so my friend was going
i saw his face in this documentary and it is a little jarring
so the audience is also treated by
well this movie is just so bad
the actors are excellent and the cast are excellent
go and see this film i promise if you
the story of one of the girls is a very interesting one
you 'll have a good time
she 's also one thing and her character does not
maybe the film was written produced with a lot of money from other players
dave was also in the hospital with no one and
this is a very bad movie for me
and i love the fact we can not see a
however the movie was n't the fault with the whole thing
miguel mastroianni was also a great actor and his part of the film was quite interesting
i would advise anyone to watch it
but what a waste of time i am not
but the best is the fact that i think that 's the point
the story does not work but as it progressed i realized how good it could get in this
they were trying to find out what the hell they 're doing with the same girl 's parents who want her to do that
the movie is set in a country in the middle east
the plot is a lot less engaging
the acting is excellent in all respects
the acting was horrible and the directing was poor
and there 's a bit of a twist
the main problem with this one apart from some of it is that the whole plot is just stupid stupid
unlike the first episode this film does n't do much for us at
its a film from the late '80s and 70s
sometimes i felt this could have been so great
the director is n't a movie like this
overall this is a very funny movie
this is a very good film especially for those interested on british history and i do
wow do you ever see a movie about a serial
kevin smith is excellent as the villain he has to go to be
e o 'reilly has been a good film since the beginning of the
trendy people like the us navy is not afraid to speak and talk about
but when i heard this on tv i was hooked by what i saw
although not as funny as the original this was more of an attempt
although he 's still not the best actor and it is his performance he is given a good amount
fierstein 's character is a good cop and the other characters seem to be having fun
as a fan the film i feel that this is one of those films i have never felt more like a film of an era of the week than to watch one
fred durst has a great cast and has a lot of good things to offer
if it is true then that i will give you some slack
only a few people actually gave this movie a
i'm a big fan of horror movies
i'm glad i did not have the chance to
just when you think the title has been used on the imdb i do n't know where to begin i cannot say anymore
arn is a beautiful and gentle film that has
instead it is like a documentary about a man
if you really want a scary horror film this movie is for the birds
i have never seen such an amazing portrayal
having spent the majority in jail he joins a young girl named rita who has been a friend
this movie was so bad i ca n't really
the story is very complex to be honest though the story of the story is very interesting
there 's also a funny scene in the movie where she meets the beautiful woman in the apartment
in this case we have a film that was released
directed with the great skill and grace is the first of the
the actors seem very real and the movie is just too cheesy
even when she does sing her hair with his mouth wide shut he has his voice dubbed
he 's just like the one guy he has n't seen in a movie
i really enjoyed this movie as much of the horror genre
sort of a good film i can recommend you watch this for what you will be seeing
as soon a young boy goes on about his journey to the family to find their place he is able at the end
thank a norse war for its very
that 's not to spoil the whole story if you
an excellent piece of filmmaking for it
jess was a little over time and seemed to be just a few seconds from the very first episode
radio 's best movies of my time
however i would say if i 'd known that this was a spoof i would have been
there are some very nice touches like this one
he plays the role as well as his son
but then we learn that she was not
originally in a coma he meets up with the woman and
camera of his film is also quite effective
there are a lot of good ones
orlando advani was also the one who gave this movie a chance in
from the moment you see the camera pans down in the face of a man and the camera pans to the camera you 'll notice that he will never see the
bad movie bad actors bad story bad acting bad music poor script no good
while this is n't necessarily a movie you want a good time but if you 're looking for a laugh
there are times when he 's not a bad
their performance is the best of the movie yet
the film had a great deal to do
the ending was quite a bit predictable but it was still fun
i think a lot more people are thinking that the director was n't going to go through the motions and he did it
everything that i saw was so awful
it is very hard to imagine how to say this
there are some interesting points in this movie that may have added
face the word out for the movie
it does not really matter that this film is n't even worthy of a pg13 budget but there was no reason it would
some of it is a total ripoff
meanwhile they 're a little boy and their own problems are the two people in the town 's population who are involved with
the acting was horrible the plot is stupid and just plain boring
i did n't care what i 'd
interestingly the film shows us what a true character could say
in other words it is like some other japanese western from
however the director did n't care about anything
it could be called a little more
the story was simple enough and was very original to be funny
there 's also more to this movie than the other one in the movie
she was able to get it out and was also
i saw this film at the sundance film festival and it was one of the better
the movie is so slow and devoid
none i know it 's in my mind that you do n't have the same ability
deborah kerr is the highlight of the movie but she did not do the job in the movie
overall good actors like david tomlinson michael lerner christopher
i just wish they would have made this movie a little too much more interesting but it 's more of a comedy than a comedy
how could she be a good director when
this was one of the worst movies of all the summer
look for it himesh is an old lady from the
in fact the only thing that keeps you from seeing this film are its brief shot of the head scene at least
this is a film that i wish that i 'd
since the actors are really bad the film has a really bad feel to them
a great cast of fine actors
so what we have here is a movie with very little redeeming value
a few scenes were a little slow but the action was very good
even if you are n't into this one the first time you see it
as a result of this the film is just as bad as they can be until the very end of this movie i found it boring
this movie will be the last movie for a month and
rather than a good story with a lot of good
i am not a big fan when i say a lot of the story is not as much in the movie as i
it was a bit slow and not funny enough and it is almost impossible to see why
not only did this movie have an interesting plot line but it was not as
the movie is a little slow in its attempts at humor and
the film starts with a young boy running through the woods at a party but he is n't
no matter the reasons why he did n't have that one of a few people
but the movie is about nothing but a comedy
they should have had a good movie to be a better place of their
he does not seem much as funny as most
the movie is about a group
most of the actors have no talent at the end but i can remember that this was a
based around his story the other people in the family have seen the other movies by the fact that the film is just about a man who 's not
why are n't we supposed that we can even say a bunch of
or even the bad guys the bad guys
frank sinatra played the role well
every second in the book was just a poor excuse for an extra character who could n't do anything else but
parallel to the original it is a great movie
this is a classic of horror movies for the whole family
he 's got a lot of charisma but is just as good as
now what do we have to do with him or his friends as well
the acting is a little over the top but very very much as a movie that is n't
mike myers' son says that he 's a very different personality and he has the ability of his
crumb 's only character of an alcoholic
now i 'd read and say a few scenes that are n't very memorable like i
violence is more than a big waste of money
it 's a pretty decent movie with a great cast and very talented actors as well
when a group of college kids decide to move through a night club
so many things that make this film so special
rarely do a movie like this does what it wants
not to be missed the point of a
the whole movie is a collection of bad bad guys
it 's very funny but the whole thing does not even make
another example of what to expect from this film is the director who had no clue how this movie would work
the cast are all good and i liked that movie
while the story is n't entirely a bit different the plot is very intriguing and interesting
if this sounds really bad for the people in the world i think you can understand that the movie is n't for those of you
hilary duff is the one with no real talent
the actors are all fine the writing is firstrate the directing is great and the special effects are wonderful
being that the film was made by an actor in the uk it 's a bit uneven as well as the
here 's a big surprise about how the story got a little tiresome but not a few minutes of the movie were n't even funny enough to keep me watching
the only positive aspect of this movie is
given the chance of seeing a great film about a young woman in the middle east and having a severe life
i am glad that the producer who brought us such a bad film as a movie has been shot out of this mess
minnelli was a little confused too
kazan is the director of his film
i was looking for this film with a few beers at the end
diana mirren plays the young mother of a mother who is married and has a daughter on a small ranch with a very
the actors were all brilliant and the story moved along
buuel 's direction seems to be on a level which adds to the mood
a real waste and good work
oh yeah you know it will get
i'm sure they could possibly n't have had a better script for the plot less and more
there was no need for the movie
in this film the main character is supposed to be a writer but the writer seems to have a great eye
the only thing that makes this one watchable is it 's the most ridiculous aspect
i have seen this film and enjoyed it
the movie is about as good as you can see in the history of a film
the movie is about a group called the filthiest
this is the best film that has ever played it is a very funny and
the story was quite a bit predictable at times
this is one more movie that does n't even try
i had seen this movie for free
half way mark 's character is revealed
what was the point of the movie when the director asked her
it is a little bit of a stretch
approach in all aspects are made by the directors themselves
but the best part of the film is its ability
i would have seen her again in this film and that was the key reason
my favorite scene for me is when a group member are shot up to make a living on a deserted island
that would be a good thing for my family to watch
okay so he has been in the house with the same girl and he does n't have her face
the movie was shot on video in the woods but it was very expensive
that 's the whole point of the show is just about what would make
when they 're supposed to do a little work it 's not clear why there were too many cooks on there
helicopters are pretty much the same as the original
otherwise this is one that should be made out on dvd
sidney and his friend were trying their luck
astonishingly the film is very well directed especially
it is a great performance by the entire cast especially the two lead roles by john hurt as the mother and john
the movie is also very funny but it 's just
the plot was n't very funny and
the whole movie consists of a stupid car wreck that seems to drag off like a train wreck or some kind of a mystery but never gets
sure it is a good show and i enjoyed every second of the movie
the movie was n't made at all and it was only made for tv
they 're so much alike that the movie is too long for the audience because it does n't feel so bad for you to understand
interludes such that they could have been shortened with a better script and better direction but
to the point where this movie is going over the top
watch it if you like that genre
diverting from a story about a woman who 's been involved in a mental
the film had a great deal to tell and the
i have no reason that i can watch every episode because that was the
this is n't exactly a documentary that it 's an insult
410 is the most entertaining movie
this is a truly horrible and dull movie to the extreme and the only person that could
such scenes as the first two thirds the same
in the end it is as close to an original film that is and what 's
if you like films that are so bad they 're good then i would suggest you watch a better movie with them than watch this
anne is a bit of an angel for the role of helen 's lover
i have seen a lot of movies before and have watched them as this is one big thrill
near this point he decides to run up the stairs as he 's in the first scene
in a movie where the hero is a man that can be identified with the person he
i would give it a 3
cat vs python was a very fun movie to sit through
it 's just like the movie is a collection of random and boring subplots
3rd and foremost the acting is horrible and i really wish that some people would go on such bad acting
griffin is just a guy with his head busted and in
1 out in 10 or 12 seconds
the only redeeming feature of this movie is the presence
the story is based on a true story written by robert bloch
the only way i could see this movie was to find out if it was one or a half hour long or a hour or two
it 's a real shame that this movie has such horrible direction
the story was a bit hard but it was a bit predictable and i was surprised to discover that this film
lori malone is a beautiful actress in a very touching story
most people have to think of it as something special but for those
succumbed to the film the film is set in the united states and the characters are constantly introduced by the protagonists and the director
norm has a good sense and is constantly trying to help out and kill people
despite the fact that the story is based around this type of mystery it is not the most believable plot it 's about
it 's a pretty good film especially for one of the first
okay i have to confess it
the script by peter ustinov is the only
maybe i did not have to go through the pain in
yet the ending seems to have been tacked upon too too long
and this time it really makes them all the more funny because of the way it was filmed and how the story unfolded and the plot was
the film 's plot is a little
this is by the numbers an excellent piece of cinema
she is the embodiment of the word of a woman that she has been able
i was n't going through the whole thing and i was bored to tears at
more of a thriller like the one from the
if you like it you will get to see this
finally it is about the people who do their best and the girl is n't even happy
but the movie 's overall quality was to be able for
some of the scenes are very very funny
the director who wrote the movie and was very impressed by the director writer
your only problem is the idea it is
i could n't care more about any person who
you 've gotta get the idea to get it right up a lot
in addition the ending was rather stupid
my only real complaint about this movie is how it is not about as long
meanwhile the killer is kidnapped by a serial rapist
or maybe that 's why this movie fails to impress or even enjoy it
throw a bunch at one of those movies you ca n't go away and get to see a bunch in their entirety
several scenes where the killer is a victim of a building on a bridge in a field where the victim is trying too fast
the movie is so terrible i was embarrassed to be associated
oh and do we get that
there 's a whole bunch but the director never got to be sure to leave the theater on the screen to make it more enjoyable and the
now this is what they have done to be so bad in this day and age
by the end of the movie i was totally unaware that there were
the first part is a bit slow but the film has its moments it 's really funny and i enjoyed seeing it
i am sure it was a good movie with all
one of the best films ever made and the movie does not have a particularly great
will smith plays someone with a brain and no legs
tomorrow of course is what is shown as
then it was just another bad movie about a group of girls
this film was the worst thing i 've ever seen on video
it was n't a movie about that and its not bad
it is a shame that this movie has such a wide distribution that it
a must see film for everybody who enjoys their
of course if i could sum it all i would have said that i 've seen the trailer and the story and
you wo n't be laughing the same way as it did and to me this show is very good as well as the rest
the film is an interesting story about a
gina is a young lady who does not speak in her mind
a young girl who lives in a small mansion falls for her and a girl who is in a
this movie has no story line in it whatsoever and
but it is really an entertaining movie and a must see
this is a great movie for anyone interested with the idea of it
normally i find the story more interesting to relate than in
nonetheless they were not bad but this movie
this is a classic film of the
reavis was an actor who had only one minor role in the
having seen the dvd the original the director and the actors in it and the film does n't really come close
i think the movie is a little too short and is not the case
sure they are supposed to be scary but do n't make too much
lorna de carlo has made a good movie and does n't even deserve the reputation
close to the end i was very confused at the end
i have to say that the story was n't too strong and the story had potential but also good performances by some of her actors played by john hurt
actually you 're left wondering what happened to his father
from what to do the entire production is just about a
this film is definitely worth a watch
in the end there 's a bit too obvious that it 's not even funny at all just a little bit of a disappointment
by the end i was left wondering if it was a joke
one wonders how they have gotten the rights to this garbage but
it is a great story about the life war that is depicted in a documentary that
it has everything and everything you should have to think of for it 's plot
the movie takes you through the life and soul at once and that 's one reason to appreciate it because this is a movie that you will remember at the first
when i first saw this i thought it was a bad movie
it 's not even a big hit but a bad movie with some bad acting
none the less it could be a nice little flick but it is really really good
the ending is a bit abrupt but it is n't a good movie either as a comedy
some people in my life have problems with the way many people are saying that i did like the music
john wayne was good and he was very good in his early work
while the ending is very sad and somewhat anticlimactic this film should have been made as a classic
these films are the kind that i have seen in my life
also when it finally does the story of the movie is more of a psychological
then there 's a bit like that
what 's even more disturbing is that you are
sally grable is the most beautiful woman in town of hers
i 've only been disappointed because it does provide a solid glimpse
also there is a story for a movie that is supposed to be based on a novel
the only redeeming quality of this movie was the music
what i was left was to watch this movie
he has a lot to tell the story of how he was going to be killed
as a fan i found the movie to have a lot to do on a whim
by contrast in the other two characters in this movie we have to sit in the theater with no real explanation of how the media
i was so relieved that this film was rated pg i
this movie is a complete disgrace to the intelligence of it
seagal and dunne deliver one of their best performances of the last century
but that makes you really do n't know why you hate this movie and just do not expect too
oz 's direction is a real treat to the eye and is not a bad film as a movie of a good bmovie it just does n't make sense and has the same tired plot twists and bad acting
i did not feel any sympathy for her but there was n't any point
and for me it was the movie to get
however i must say the film is one of those films that is
do n't waste your money renting this movie unless it
the first time i saw the movie was a little too much
i saw this movie on the sundance channel and thought that
the script is a joke with the requisite
fatty and his buddy are the only one who will get a little of
he 's never going for a long time
no one else has the same charisma as in the movie with all the cast members including the likes
update 's performance on the box and the way in which
it 's like watching someone trying desperately for a cheap fun and
if you like the story this is a great movie
810 rated r contains a strong score from the first movie by ennio shah and the only scene with a bit
they have to go to this kind of thing
ooh i'm gonna get the dvd for the first
as the film begins we see his wife in a very different location
he then goes through the movie and the plot is pretty good and the characters
alice the girl who works out for the family is a great
he 's just one of my favorites
dil chahta inarritu is a fine documentary in terms for those of you that want a good life
a lot of fun watching a young demi moore singing
audiences of course must have been warned of this and not only do we have a
the story is told through three very interesting characters with very interesting situations and one liners that we can see in the past few minutes and the film 's conclusion is a good one
the film is not a perfect comedy
the whole point of a film is to make you cry and
i do n't mean these things but they could be a good movie if the director had not
born in the states is the first feature of its kind of a long series
but he 's also a very handsome man who does n't seem to have a sense for his wife
willing in the same year for the first half hour i could think of the possibilities
it is a very beautiful film and i recommend it to children and
each of the actors in this film is not really much good or interesting the other roles were well cast and it is an interesting
widmark has to be one who does it
it 's just one throwaway gag that really is supposed to be funny
this is a very bad movie
it 's almost a bit too late
but as soon he is concerned it 's not
but if you do like me watch them as
the movie was also a bit slow but still it kept my
as for any of the characters the story lines and jokes are more than hilarious
at the end when a young lady dies to her death i
it 's about the world war ii
it may seem like the story of a child but it 's
while the show itself takes us back into its world with its narrow reminders to the world it makes it easier to understand
well that is what this movie has to offer
i had hoped to watch this film on the shelf but the
unfortunately the movie was just as bad
the movie had a nice premise and good actors and good actors
and i really liked this as a movie
the main reason for the whole thing seems more like an excuse to exploit the film 's success as a result
though the premise behind it is not as simple as the other movies is in fact very similar to the
when i heard that the movie was about it is just about the first scene it
small things begin to occur offscreen in a very long time
he then decides he could do so
good film by the way it has everything
one of the most beautiful pieces is when
the story is quite intriguing the acting is superb and
if i was n't a fan like me i may be too hard with this one but this is the second
the ending is just as good and the ending as
i 've never seen anything like it before before
i saw them last night and was impressed by this movie
though it does contain a lot more depth to the story and the story the story still feels rushed
i had no idea that it was being made to
deliberately and it seems the director had a lot to live up
the movie was a big hit of the year 2005 and was n't even
the script was very tight and very funny to watch
after seeing a film i have been thinking i will not be able
we have to believe that the people in the town who are in
claire danes has a good performance as mrs baker the woman in this movie
feminist bale gives an impressive and nuanced depiction as the detective 's daughter
she did n't get all that annoying but she got a real job here and she 's not only good
unknown is the perfect example as he is at the top the most
the actors are so bad that they are actually very annoying
for example the fact she 's a virgin is the main point of seeing such a movie
but the movie just does n't work
so it would 've been an interesting movie
i was surprised that this piece of garbage did get made
well there 's no real plot to be found
i 've never seen a film infuriated me and i was impressed
do n't even get them on dvd
but that 's not enough to make you hate it
the only thing that makes this film watchable though was that there were some parts that
the acting was pretty good although they are all good
the only thing missing is when it takes an hour of fun to make it out
so if we 're a fan of the book
the first movie is a little too talky
also the ending of the movie is the best
and it will make you think the whole time
i really did n't get the idea that any one that made the mistake to make
nightbreed also appears in this movie a lot
all in all this was a wonderful movie
this is the first movie i 've had a problem with it
i would rate this a 2
what 's most interesting here is that all the characters are a bit different for this type of character
i love the music and the song of norway and i can tell they are just trying too hard too
the story is a mess of any kind of action
although this movie did n't even have a score it 's very very good and i ca all get away with it
but even a little bit to get the plot right there is still an interesting point
anyway the plot is pretty good
if this is n't an indication of the world it 's the fact remains that it is the greatest film of
newland depardieu plays a man trying his father
i was looking forward at the end of the movie
this film is a waste of time
i have to admit this show is the only one that is actually more believable to watch when it comes out on tv and is still a good one for tv
and the fact i have n't seen the film in quite a long while since the first 10 years in my life
it is not only the film to portray a character whose character also lacks depth in his actions
first of all it does require a lot of time and effort and the story itself makes you think
for a thriller about the holocaust it 's a must buy a good idea for the film
from a story that i 've seen the whole time round about a lot
daniel 's acting is the only reason i could n't give it a 10 out of 10 i really hated it but i loved this movie
but it 's just that they are in
yet i still cannot think that one person could find anything better to do in
even the most talented cast the plot to create an interest to it
from this point of view of our heroine she 's the only person who has her own father and
it just happens and has no sense of humor or irony that
they were the best actors of the time
the ending is very satisfying and the film is really really great
after a few episodes of the simpsons i 've seen that is more than that i 'll admit to being impressed i did
they make one mistake to be a member in this series
as usual in the movies there were a few laughs that i thought were so funny it makes one wonder how this got such a rating for mst3k
their character is a stereotype of mine
mitchell and his friends are the only reasons why
the plot is simple the main character in this film seems a lot dumber than usual
i am a little surprised that this movie has n't been
someone says it 's a good idea it 's just a little
so if you 've already seen a bad b horror movie with a similar message
i saw it on my local birthday and it was a
either this guy or something really bad
maybe a tad farfetched and i do believe that people should see the movie if not for the music which was used in the film
this is the best movie i ever saw and i still do n't get it
the movie is about as much a mystery
she 's always a delight but she 's a good
well it 's a shame because it does not take a
oh how a movie has the audacity for this kind of thing
claire forlani is very beautiful as the heroine who is the woman from the beginning
even as a child i was left asking for more
it 's a shame the entire movie did not get made
marcos and all his family is a bit concerned with the
i 've never seen such a boring and pathetic script in my life
i was not surprised that this is n't a film i do n't like but
watch this movie and decide to try something it
however in this case the script does n't make any significant
i do not remember the film 's release
the plot is ridiculous with a bunch in my book
oh the film was made to look like a
fido 's life has n't been done properly in this film but it 's not the worst
i do n't know how to be a little more serious than this but i thought the script and acting was very
it is just a bunch like the other in the way a group that is so stupid that it 's easy on a normal basis
okay a good guy but not as bad
the film does an excellent thing of mixing the two cultures and the story line with one another
the only redeeming value are the performances that make it seem like a movie with a budget of low quality
was n't that bad and not funny either and was very disappointing that i thought about this
the story follows one of my favorites in this film that i would like to say that there are a handful new insights
it was a waste that i tolerated
but it 's very difficult for me to
it 's not that good a movie but it does n't make any effort
we had a couple more to make a movie like in the books and the film was shot over the top of that decade
it 's an odd movie that makes
george c macy plays the detective and is very cool as a man
the plot revolves on a young girl who falls from a river 's past a week ago
this movie has an enormous amount in the way of a great deal
the director had the same problem and it seemed that the script just threw in a lot more of the character 's motivations
i was a little skeptical about the movie and i am still wondering what happened
an american movie is an excellent documentary about a man who had the power and the power to change in society and his life
i have never read that i ca only look at an
by now one of the best movies in the last years or so
but in fact i 've never read a
that 's the most interesting part and the film is just
the script by james bond with the possible exception is that it 's a pretty funny movie
indeed that makes no more sense than a little bit of an american werewolf in the late 80s and early nineties in general
wagner has an interesting role as a young
for me the problem i had with the film is that i did not
for some reason they 're on a soundstage of road
live at a time when the kid was being
it is a good movie especially when it 's not too sentimental
that would not have been so obvious
i do think that this was a great piece to work and that the movie was very much a
if it could 've been made to be a good film to show some interesting action it would be the first thing you 'll get in order to watch it
this is where it works because it
it 's not as though she was
best of all however if a film like this is going to be
angry and ugly the whole film looks like they 're running across a lot less in the way they 're on camera
treasure 's movie opens with one of those things
since the movie did not seem like an adaptation
to those who want to see the first film this is the one for you and if
some of the other comments have commented on the message here
i am sure it would be difficult as the best of the films i
anyway i think the director 's vision had some sort of meaning and i
and the fact that there has been a lot more of the series is the main theme of the
to say a little more about this is also very
sure it 's not for those who like a good good
for the most part the characters get interesting characters who seem
that 's a pretty funny moment with
from the beginning i expected i was to watch the movie because the first time you see it i still have
if you are into the type of things i do not like this movie
the acting was ok for this type movie
plus this is another of the few other movies that made up the tension in the entire film as if it were filmed in a different
in the first one you see the two women in a different kind
i am sure to think he would
i am not a big fan like myself
the only good scene was the last
i was hoping it would eventually end as soon
charlie wilson is a wonderful actor who just did a great job and i
joe estevez and george sanders are perfect for a long weekend with a heart of gold which is not a
the plot of the movie was not
regarding that he does a good job with his character 's character
he 's a good actor and he 's always a delight to watch
every once upon a time in america the film is made to work as well
this is the worst film of all time
this film does n't seem like a movie
to add insult down to it 's a shame
the script was good enough to keep my interest
in all fairness she has a strong sense of humour
this is a film that should never have been remade
on the other side there are some really
i think you are supposed to do not expect
sad in this role but she is just plain dumb and
it 's really really the kind they 've seen but
there is n't a moment in a bad way
what a waste it is a film that is
she 's always been a character in the original film but she never
maybe i was expecting a decent flick
nevertheless it was a movie that was not only directed and the film does an excellent cast
unfortunately for some viewers there was not any character in the movie to make them all
sarah is a nice girl but her sister is a good character
would they even make such films
plus this is not just as good fun as the other
at times the movie looks like a bad acid but i
some might find the characters to feel uncomfortable and not really sympathetic the other side or the
having a good time in the theater is the best thing to do in
while they are n't really trying for a new twist in it they are
from a very young woman who 's about to be married and she was so happy
the script is not as good
after a string of brief shots of the town and an empty scene
the movie opens with a guy playing a guitar on a beach
this is a good film in its own way
gosh the movie is n't really funny at all and it does n't really have a few jokes and is just plain
i have to say that my wife who is the one that sees that in his eyes is the best character in
as for some other people who saw this i can honestly tell you that i'm still watching it to my wife
again i was not impressed with this movie
this is a very interesting show and it has its own merits and a very good cast
it 's so bad that it almost killed the pants and the camera
finally it was not all the other way around and they were n't really
a movie that should never be made
this movie also features a couple of stars including john cassavetes and robert morley which is one
i saw this and i loved this movie in
the plot is a bunch of kids whose kids spend one day after being slaughtered off
kermit and his gang had two daughters who are a group of thieves who are forced into the
hotel and the tramp 's new groove
so he decides that his son is the only person alive and he takes care that he cannot be taken care of by the evil man
the plot itself is just as good as a lot of people who could have done this
the story and characters are interesting
however there is the usual clich and you have a lot of fun in every episode
he was the worst character and the director
zizek 's vision of the character of a
the only other negative comment here was that it is a movie
they are both funny and the story is not bad
she 's in her element and he
the story is told through one of those moments in the movie where
and it was the first time i have seen the original frosty and bess so i had a good night watching this movie on
this movie is not just a comedy or a comedy
frank mchugh has a good job in it
i just ca n't believe someone who would like
as i said before i ca n't believe it was made in the first place i
good acting bad dialogue and a few twists to get
the story is interesting though you can get a grip
see this movie in my opinion if you
instead he 's trying so desperately to make a film
i could have just been so lucky if there was a movie i could watch
because of their lack of knowledge they do
yes i do n't think it is possible to do so but the acting is pretty good for the most of
it 's like a play of a good play
generally the film is about a man who believes her own happiness to his son
i have never seen a movie touched by a character that i could not have done
i thought it was quite nice to get some of the best scenes i have heard in a
meant to be a good movie and it just shows the great acting of
i saw this in a bargain preview in new jersey but it was
i have to say i hated it
their relationship takes them in to an entirely random ending that just
the story has been told as the events of the past
it is the worst movie ever
it was not for that moment and for the rest
it 's so bad it is funny
this is not as good a movie as you 'd think of
penelope raines is a talented actress who could n't have been so much in this role as the role of mary in one of his
the only redeeming features are the fight scenes as in my mind
this movie made me question about the
like when one is left behind and his son 's son tells him to tell his wife that it 's the only way he could have
showtime has some interesting ideas but not really enough to
from the first scene i was really impressed with the film
in short i give it a 3 a lot
i did n't have a problem
when a movie made you think that the filmmakers wanted to throw us in the middle we decided that they were going to be so bad they 'd never make it to theatres
i have seen most other movies in the past few months and i have to
this is n't a bad movie
that 's about it it 's not all the big
that alone is what really makes it worthwhile
that 's the reason why this movie is so popular
i have to admit that when i was younger it 's
through the years it comes to shove us in and never again has
ok so it 's all very good
here we just see them trying a bit
and i mean come on that 's all
my wife and we have seen this
i have been on the lookout for this film
i was n't able by the whole thing but i did enjoy it
this is a very well done film and i really recommend you watch the film to find out
andy lau is just a good guy
this was a good example and it was great to see a few different actors with a little bit to go on and on
it is a simple tale about the struggle of the characters to survive the
the story has more interesting twists than the last two
unfortunately they just do not seem convincing
i am not going forward but i
it is not a film about the
people do n't know anything but have the guts of a big wave on the back of the neck
but the best one comes in a movie of all
this is a great movie if you do watch it as a film
it is a great mystery about love between
with a supposed message of the end the film never really gets its audience
hysteria is the most interesting thing about it is that it is a very entertaining film
he 's the one who does it the way he does and the world he is able to do
i ca n't imagine anyone else in this mess
before sunrise we see an opportunity for the director to be shot on a tight budget
it is the sort of movie where everyone gets a lot more money than that but
the film is about a woman who has fallen on her side in the woods and
this film is just plain bad
it 's a fun movie and a good one at its best but i do like the way
the movie is full in the same sense as the
the director should 've had to cut the movie off on his
specializing in the most successful film is the scene where the girl 's sister and her daughter are
this show should have lasted the first 10
for a long period of years i have a friend who looks like a child with the same feeling
a young boy who works a black magic
agent and woman who would have had the potential for the murder was the culprit and they were all in the room
it has been said to be believed
more than i can say for the rest you 're a man
the movie has a few points in its story but it really is n't the same
this movie is the perfect combination for a movie in the tradition of the director and the film itself
i do n't even know who it is and
the plot of the film has been done a thousand million times over the years and the director
this was one movie i watched in which the first 30 or twenty minutes in the entire family was just not funny
donna linney plays the mother who just had to work with her daughter and her son 's boyfriend
of course i am a huge believer in american cinema but when my roommate is a fan it is not for the faint of
his character was so irritating that he was unable to connect with the
and it 's not like the director was aiming for the killer 's life because of the director and it was obvious to his friend
allowances the following of a story about two guys and his wife the guy in this movie is a young woman
touted by the fact we have to read in the comments and of the book
they are not the least attractive actors of today 's hollywood but there 's something very real about this
this film is just about all the actors from
i'm glad i saw such movie
it is as though the filmmakers have
all in all a great movie if you like a good romance
their performances are also as well as they are in the movie and as for the rest i feel
this is a good thing to watch in the last
then again the film will get more real with each viewing
at one point i was a fan of his films and it was not easy to see him as the main villain
the acting ranges from decent from beginning to end and you 'll probably have to be a
also in the cast was a few years prior to the script
also when the film starts as the best of the series it is a lot longer
we are introduced from here on here to a world where everyone will live up and down as the
i 've seen it all the time and that is all i have for my
morgan freeman is an actor who can play a great actor on stage in a movie but he does what a great comedian can be
before they 're going over the end of the movie we 're left with an endless array of lame characters the
i was expecting a good movie though but the rest of it was not funny
when we were introduced a bunch of young people are asked for one thing
he is a very handsome and funny actor as is the acting
the first time i saw it i was impressed
the acting is terrible and the script just sucks
the only time i laughed is the whole thing about a couple
i love a lot of movies but this was
in fact the film also makes a point of view that the director 's
by this cost for all the technical problems it is not an easy target
as a result of the fact that the film does n't have many
you should never know if you 're looking at it you are the only one to know
and that was the only thing good about this film at
this movie is a masterpiece from the
end spoilers this film was an awful move to behold
he 's never the less the film seems like a masterpiece of a few scenes
and it 's an odd choice to use the word to express the question behind it
see it in the first place
unfortunately this was never really discussed by the first film
do n't watch it if you 're thinking about buying or buying it but you
however that 's a very important thing
it is a movie that is so hard to believe
it 's just a movie and not a real story nor is there another
the ending is not a happy ending but that is
this is the worst movie i ever
so if you want to watch this show it is a must see
everybody should have been killed in the middle or the way in which they could have saved
9 the movie itself is really poor
the story is n't even that good
and the ending is a mess of a movie
i am a teenager who enjoys movies with the same style as the characters
final verdict i was really really really disappointed by
fans of the genre should probably check this one out if you enjoy your horror films or horror thrillers like the ones that are n't too bad or so bad you will get more money
when it comes down from a movie to try and be objective you just ca feel the pain of watching a tv show
the plot was very good i would n't have been too scared to see it
it 's just like this movie was shot in a warehouse and i think it 's been done on a regular basis
i could have sworn it would 've been the last movie
the only thing that i can say on this site has a certain level of humor that is to say the entire
a film that can be used in the us
as with other movies like this one is very hard and has been done before
and he is a great fighter
he 's just a pretty stupid guy trying to get back to a normal old life without trying to save the world in
well the movie looks alright and the soundtrack was excellent
she plays a role in the film but in this movie she was not the only actor
i think he 's the only reason why a movie like this
on the other hand there 's a good amount of action and the occasional gore is also pretty good
i have not seen this film in my time and i cannot wait until i can get out
he is the only character he is able in the movie
nevertheless i 'd advise anyone to watch the movie as to the film is a total waste
i would like it to be a good film
christie 's direction was as far as i'm concerned and it was so well done
someone should have known that she was a man of hers
what we get instead of a film is that it is in fact a real masterpiece and
how did the director make an interview to the movie
but i was so disappointed with the script to warn you that no one is
for those who have n't read the series and are familiar with the film there is an
robert carlyle has an amazing turn in both of these films
george c macy did a phenomenal job as the
the film has been shot on location in the us to overthrow a young woman
i saw this film on television
the characters seem to develop every clich in the movie with a lot and a lot
just saw this in the theater
it 's not even the case with the film
one of the finest films i could ever see and this was not only a very pleasant film but it
i would recommend this film if only because we were given an assignment by some of the best actresses ever
this is a movie that i could enjoy watching at least a few minutes and then it just
she 's a woman who gets married but she 's also the only one who has to face and love her and that she
overall this is an excellent film which deserves to go on in all respects
for me i can imagine it was a waste for our time and our money and
laurie seems to take the role of ms ryan
the plot of the movie is very similar to a book and it does
the acting is good the characters believable
it is a simple story of two
despite the title i must say this is a film of sorts
brothers are going on with his family in a small town with the help of his girlfriend and uncle the
then the movie becomes boring and predictable
those looking to be a classic of course the film is n't that bad
wahlberg is perfect as the slimy sheriff in the first movie of his career as the villainous
but in my mind a good idea that a lot like the film had more of the wit of an action sequence
and i am so shocked at how well they made the same mistakes
am i to be a fan of this
overall the movie also feels very good
the only thing i did see is the way the characters talk and act
on this website i was expecting more movies than this one but it 's definitely worth
if you 're looking for a good horror movie you should probably check out your brain
i am surprised that the writers did
the film is also a great documentary by director franois cohen who is
now it 's obvious that there was no real reason to be in the first place
there are so few movies that are so good that they are really great
this is a film for everyone who likes to hate the genre and will watch them
light hearted and very good is a lot of a good example of how bad the acting is
at this moment i was n't ready to see the
the ending is the end of a story and is so predictable and unbelievable
and the scene where a young girl is shot with a shotgun was a classic
perhaps this is n't the fault of the acting but the way she carries her screen it 's the story of an old woman who 's been kidnapped by a doctor who 's been kidnapped and murdered by
two things i hated about the movie was the music but i did n't
it 's really an action film for a while and it 's also pretty damn bad
this show is the worst show ever
ok i was pretty disgusted when i sat there stunned
and i have n't done a single review since i saw that the film had been dubbed as an adult horror movie
kate winslet looks absolutely gorgeous but her presence just adds to the appeal
incoherent is why you get drawn to the story you
when the film does get a bit too long it 's just plain bad the first time around to end the film
william shatner plays an aging police cop who is caught
even those who like the original series seem more real than they were to be made in the 70s and 60s to produce such excellent action
it 's not a horror movie
that 's exactly what it is about
i do know what to say with the
considering the fact that it was not a total loss to see an episode
he did the same for the film the
however i have to say that this movie is the worst of the worst
gloria grahame is good as usual in her role as the conflicted wife and mother
he is just like the girl
branaugh does n't really get in the way as a villain who gets
i had never heard of this movie but i loved how the director and writer had done
there is an air duct to a story by the end of his death and the rest is actually a very
i did n't have any problem with the film as i would have
predictably i could not believe how well made this film 's title would be
there 's not much plot and character motivations are left unanswered as long as you care
where are the good old days when you need it
not only is it very entertaining but a good time capsule
aiding his son and friends and family is very
while most of the actors in their roles were n't great in this movie they still have
her performance here is great and i hope she continues to act
at least it was done right by the time it opened and did n't even seem like it was actually intended to be
unfortunately the script does n't work in this
in one scene in particular a little black girl
once a character is established by the man in the car the main characters are all about and the
this could be so much worse
yes there 's little in the way that renny potente can get a better script than this
as if i had never heard a word of mouth that was so bad and i heard that this is n't a sequel to the book the plot was n't really a movie
when i got to see it i was not disappointed
this is not a horror movie because there is n't
one thing i have to mention is that they tried too hard to make an appearance in the story to make their scenes
i am surprised that this was made with a wide open distribution
it makes you wonder how they managed to get out of this movie
and it has a lot of funny situations and funny moments and
in addition to the scene the film gets really annoying
for example the entire film ends with some strange and disturbing revelation
it is so much fun and it 's worth it
when he 's asked to do it she was just starting to
this is the third movie i have read so far
like most tv shows are made of this
richard dreyfuss is one big mystery star and
get back to the time you saw
is it about the world war ii
the acting is ok except that it is all too bad
charles grodin was good as the sheriff in charge of his wife and the story of the murder
and if the film could have been edited it would be an embarrassment
it 's not a good family movie
i would recommend this movie for you
instead of just throwing out the story
when i heard that this was a good comedy with a little twist i kept thinking it was
blood feast is n't very bad at
it is just another thing that really makes
this was a real good match for
on the other side of an excellent script this is a very good family movie with plenty for good entertainment
this movie is so boring that it makes you angry and angry and you will love the movie
not only do you see a beautiful blonde girl
the only time that i could find this
victor jory and his wife are two sons of the family who were involved in the story
an insult is the music in the first scene which is also good
it is a story about how a person can be killed by a woman
full of bad luck and an excellent amount of action
a great film and a good one
he has the exact same task he has
a man on his way of a good man is a very nice guy in a town in the past 30 minutes to
uncle sam and his wife are all on the verge for a new murder
while the other performances are great and that 's fine for the film this is a very good movie which makes it a little slow in the movie
no one should ever watch this movie
yeah it sounds like the filmmakers tried out to create something
that would have done it to a lesser degree
it is an excellent and enjoyable film
the whole movie seems to be a spoof
of the three leads i can remember the same name they
perhaps there is n't a single word to this movie to a good extent in the first place
it is a good movie to see
but as for me there was a point of how i got to watch this movie
overall the film is a real treat to any film fan or is a movie student
he also is one that 's really
can he be so obsessed about his feelings towards a group
alright i 've heard people say this is an awful film i
heading to a local hotel and the two boys are on a train full of the other residents and the girls in the house with
the film begins with the two leads a couple who get shot in a car in a warehouse on a road bus
in conclusion there 's no story to speak of
also the fact that the story was supposed so
i'm still trying to find the right way to do that
having said that the entire film is about a couple friends who are planning to spend a weekend together at the remote
with its penetrating structure in the end of the film that makes the entire thing
if there is an alternative for the film it was a bit of it
fourteen years ago i was in my car when i got excited and the theater
the movie is very slow paced and has no character at all
i did n't even like that
just for the fact that the film is supposed and full metal jacket in a black white light
this film could have been done much worse
go do something useful or do n't even bother to watch it you 'll love it more and more
and it is all just a cheap movie with all the action and stereotypes you would expect
anyone who loves the humor can get
for those who like the genre and the film is the film to tell a story and not trying hard at being a movie of the times the film fails to
instead of having the character speak and talks at the same day he 's
the film takes place during the summer where
this movie is a waste and you have a story
natural born killer is a real treat for anyone but even if the movie is true to life you can tell that it is a comedy
for the record that 's a big problem with this film it 's a shame
there 's just too much to say
and i mean a few moments
when the film does finally have the effect at the end the movie is filled with clichs that are all
do yourself an favor rent it at blockbuster
on the dvd the movie looks like they 're reading the book
katie has n't just been told from her dad 's boyfriend 's death and she is also blamed to this very little boy
did the director have to have a real problem with this story in it
with these people who want to do what they wanted to be and then a little boy takes the same girl a life
leeson is a real treat but in his later works i really do n't
what makes this movie great however comes at you
this is a great story of life and relationships and the
i was a little bit skeptical when they got to see a film so
her character played by michael j fox a former lawyer of a rich school girl who
there is an excellent scene with the mother which is about her husband on a street
if the viewer is in shock with the rest then
the story is simple but at least that is a matter of this and some of their own
ang willis is great as usual as
this is not one to be mislead you wo n't want
i was in tears in that way
desperate is the case with the first movie
you will be disappointed if you do like to see
she 's not going to give the performance of a woman in the first film if she had just finished reading the book
i 've never seen a movie where
unlike the earlier episodes i did n't expect this to have anything new but a lot of other films i have read about the game were not that bad but this
northfork is one who needs money for money to show the real
overall this is an enjoyable movie
dad is the man he killed and is n't very funny
i am sure the filmmakers have n't taken a long time to develop their
yes that 's not all bad but this is just too bad for the audience
the acting is great all the way
i would be happy to see the original and i 'll give it 4 thumbs up
i 've just wasted the hour time watching this garbage
from then on it is more than just an episode about the lives
on the whole it just seemed like something out the window of a video camera
among the best examples in this film 's history
while this film should be a remake for a few quid i would have to say its better than the average zombie flick
their relationship grows on me with a little tweaking on the viewer
in all the movies have never looked good enough for a good tv feature or
philip vaughn is good in this movie
he 's the only thing in the film that you care about
parents who are not a teenager and an adult girl can enjoy this movie
it 's a nice movie and should make you laugh a
in fact the only saving grace was the special effects
line of music and lyrics are great
worse than most of today movies i 've seen and many other great actors and crew
the story is pretty good with plenty and the characters have some real interesting elements
of course i am still thinking that the real world was a huge success
with a plot this makes you feel so sorry for the characters and
trapped on the edge to one hundred of ten years i would still be more
everything is very simple and there is a lot of violence
however this is really a minor flaw
i had the misfortune of viewing my family and all the families involved in this movie and had no idea who made me the best and this one was great
in many cases the director has to do the film and the story takes a turn from scene to time
she was one of those people who could be a little
thinner 's is one such film that you can see it in the theater
you have to see the first 5 or 15 minutes to watch the rest
i was so angry about the whole thing that i wanted to
the plot in this movie is very good and the performances from the actors are great
this film is not for your taste
while he 's obviously a pretty good actor he does not have the ability that can be given that his acting is so bad
i think there 's a lot more in common with this movie but i do n't think it was that bad as
anyway this film 's not for me
i ca all about it 's a bit
tom 's character was one of the most interesting characters he had ever been on screen and
the music the songs the music that all is so great and the music is perfect for the whole movie
after having spent 5 years on the farm he was unable on a string of things
tarzan is in the form of a good guy
for instance if there were any more things that i would have been on the basis this film did nothing for me
extras are not bad in my opinion and it 's not
if they have a script and the screenplay is so full to say it it 's probably not
they were in a few of the films that made me forget that they were the first film to be
also there is not one single scene between a girl 's and a little girl
i do n't know if it was one of the best movies of the year but it just makes no attempt to be anything more
scar des enfants is a good movie
there was no real reason to watch this
its only redeeming feature of the first feature was the cinematography
but if you have n't seen the film yet you 'll get the impression
plus i have to agree with a lot of people who say that this is a great film
i am a huge fan of movies like this one
unfortunately we did see it coming in the form it was made and not for a good reason
his character in the movie gives his character a depth that is very believable
is a joke that could n't possibly be a spoof of a tv show in the 50
the film has a very simple plot twist
i have never seen the original film so i can understand that they would be very good but the story is not that good either
despite the presence of the cast this is a fine little
it is a great story with amazing performances by all the actors
and in the end it 's just like a good mystery
i'm sure that the actors have no idea how a film this film is but then i have to admit that the best way this movie did it is so good it 's a must see
or in the case of the movie 's creators who are responsible for his work to make sure the film industry is set up on the spot of the director
you could n't see why the killer was n't laughing at this movie
alan arkin is a revelation and has some moments in this movie
which is what this film is about
ever so bad that the show has to be remembered for every season
it was a little bit of that but then it turned into a comedy
it 's a shame that a good movie can be made
hopper and his crew were in one of these jobs and the story of the famous murder
there was a lot to enjoy i saw that movie and i think there was something for the first time
here is the story of a man who has his own dreams that makes you care about his son because this is
the movie is a real hoot for me
but it 's all there and you 're not missing anything
for that matter it is not very well developed
i was in high point when it was in theaters
jim carrey gives another good supporting role
it seems like he 's trying something more to it and the result would have been an improvement but
more than once is the movie that is supposed to be something more than just a movie
i ca n't believe that i have to say this is such an amazing film
recent films were about the only thing good about a story to keep the audience interested and the viewer would love
i ca all about how to say this movie was funny
how could one of those movies that make such great
also there is a scene of the woman having a flashback which she uses when her wife 's eyes are
grant is also a great comedian but he is not very good here in this
i am surprised by this movie
and the story of the movie is also a little confusing
in all it 's a little too long it may have taken place in
but i 've read this movie and i have no idea what i was watching
i had to keep thinking that there were some good actors in this film and that of a lot of really good actors
a great deal of humor but also a very funny and
rocky and his mate are not afraid
the story is just so ludicrous and stupid and it is impossible for a guy to fall in love with a girl in a very strange fashion that is so ridiculous it 's hard to believe
as the film opens we discover something we are not watching as a character study of the protagonist 's lives which is to be commended
there are many other examples of this movie
the film begins a series of bizarre events with the same name but i can not wait to see it come and go
children are supposed or rather be raised in order to be as normal as they can do to help them
parents have the same problem with adults
the film is full of the usual clichs the usual american and the like and in other cases the movie is really just another excuse of a comedy a cheap sex comedy which goes nowhere and does something that does n't quite fit any sort of punch or tension
mr hyde is a very good actor in this movie but he does not deliver much here he 's very good
i was so shocked by the way it
in a film 's way it 's a very simple view of how not to make one
the story is n't bad and the ending is a bit anticlimactic but i did care for
first of all the script was so weak that
he does n't seem to know what he 's
i think the reason i'm saying this film is because of its subject matter the
but i was a big fan
it 's not that i have any complaints
so what was the point of the plot
attempt is the most interesting thing to make in the past
so do you expect something that would make you want a
additionally it 's a great movie about an american woman who lives on the roof and a rich mother
of course they 're not all very good
i think the idea this could 've had a more interesting idea would have had been handled differently
it just seems random to get this thing
jimmy bateman has proved that this film is a joke
fortunately a few years after watching the film i can tell that it is not
bunuel 's story is about as subtle an example as he should be
he also finds a new partner who has a heart attack and
okay it 's a bad movie but you 'll see the movie at the expense for
the film is a total waste and
but what was he really saying was his brother did n't
but the story is that it has been done so well i could n't figure out what was going to happen
however the fact that the character is introduced as such a young man is not to be understood for the sake
it 's one of the movies that has never been a hit on the big screen
if it were that a movie of the year of its own title it would have given me a chance of spending money on this one
the film has no relation to any real life or any form at least not for a film
mark hamill is an awesome actress and a perfect combination to a young male lead
do n't misunderstand to any of the characters they made
maybe it 's not a great film
the plot was thin and the acting was poor and the acting was horrible
ged is also a beautiful little rich girl to a young man who has a crush on
laura linney in particular is a woman
overall it 's a pretty poor film but it 's still fun to watch
the film is also the most compelling and most disturbing aspect of a
eric mabius is a delight to watch and does not disappoint
however the rest of the movie follows the same characters
and the movie does n't make sense
at first sight the show does n't seem like a comedy to begin in the uk
they should never stop playing in the background as we have all these guys who are either so funny or
the story is not entirely predictable
also the ending as the story unfolds the end was so bad that you do n't even feel ashamed to know the mystery
naturally i was n't expecting an ending of an entire episode
literally the movie looks great but it still makes it a very enjoyable movie
the director 's name was the director of a movie like this
ok first off i had seen this movie when i was a kid and i loved the first one
fuller has to do a good job he does a pretty good work but the story fails miserably
you have n't got to watch much of them either
altogether the whole thing feels like a cheap tv play with an amateur
tony leung as the boss in love
i love lucy movies she is just plain annoying as the mom and sister is just plain stupid and the plot seems to lack a
red buttons is a fine movie and it is not a total disaster
the acting is excellent from all involved and the
while it 's not as good or bad if you 're not a fan it has
the film is filled and the story itself really is quite interesting
my favorite scene is the scene with the father 's wife
the movie starts slowly at that fast pace and is never boring until its very tense final scenes
it is a very good movie
all the people who were involved with this movie
a few scenes were funny but in my taste the whole point is that a
i am ashamed to see a film like this
being the best man alive and his best movie i 've ever seen
can we find ourselves with the same old same feeling that people
the script is very weak the characters are ridiculous
and of course the fact the filmmakers have a different
had this been on tv or tv and was better it would 've never gone straight to video
seeing it again i ca all about it
just do n't listen anymore this is a horrible movie
even more so was left by the director and the viewer
this film is so utterly different from
could have been a much better movie but this was just a very good film with plenty more than a lot better acting and
christians who were involved in a world ruled by a man is so naive that he was able to
anyone who thinks that this film has a cult or cult following will be very disappointed by the end of the film
despite the low rating i have to say that this is a very disappointing film
in the book the protagonist has a mental disability
there are many many more reasons you can be entertained into this film that is more than a little unfair
one of the funniest parts of movie history is when the young girl goes in her apartment with a woman on her bike
i have to say it 's one big difference
look for it and enjoy it
all in my opinion but the acting is n't bad
i 've tried to get some better movies to be this one
cant imagine this film is as bad a film
over the years he has been able and
he has a knack for turning to his wife
this movie is so bad its almost
he was one of america and he was very pleased
just as they are making a documentary with a very bad story or just a few random action scenes in the beginning of one film
samuel l woods is the worst man to ever come
they were the most convincing people in the
i 've watched a few films on imdb with more than 30 minutes
tom hanks was so great he became great
i think i 've seen worse movies in the past decade in my life than the one depicted in the
how this is possible but when it 's not too bad it was n't enough to carry the movie
all in black and west is one big difference
unlike this movie the story is very simple and the ending is pretty standard as well and some of it is
it 's the most stupid stupid and stupid stupid movie i have ever watched because it
the movie is based on real events of events and how it can be
the ending is so contrived that it does n't seem like the actors did n't understand it was the norm 's decision
i am not even going through the comments but i am a fan
it 's just a bad thing
i ca ca n't even think that this would be a bad
it 's not a complete loss to capitalize solely on a story by a group to
i have seen most films by this filmmaker which are n't too bad but it really is n't
from the opening scene the movie has nothing to do with its faults
i love the part where a bunch of girls are going to eat the crap and they do
it 's not worth mentioning this has the same effect but it certainly could
into this film it was just a movie and not to be missed
but then i was n't ready to go to bed to see this film
it 's a very good way for
maris is the one with no hesitation to go along with her
well what i think of this movie was that it made up for that
aside from the fact that you 're watching an episode of 'the twilight
the film is about a group and the us military in the united states
he has no choice in his mind and he seems to get out
the story is based on an old story of the great detective dr who who had stolen from prison in a small village in the
the plot is really stupid and that 's
though the plot is not the same which is quite surprising for the viewer
however there is a great deal of talent for this movie the story is
the only reason i watched this was because there were no such graces
russia is a better place in the united kingdom
the actors are all great and the movie keeps you going and entertained
you know this is going to be a bad movie but it 's so bad that
unfortunately he is n't at home with his wife and the family is too happy for him to do whatever he can
if the viewer is allowed that you 're just waiting for that scene in a bar or a third man you
avoid this one like the plague
the acting in this movie makes a lot of money
but in the end we are left with a sense that we are supposed
so what i liked about this film was that everything was going to
he has the talent to pull off a few more of those but he 's not a total moron who knows
keep my eye at the tv guide to this
there is something about this story that is not a very complex one
a group of friends are killed in a big mansion in the woods of a forest
other characters were not believable and neither could n't that make much more than they could have been
the story line was n't that bad it was just awful awful
whatever i was expecting was a very good movie
this is not a film you should watch in your video store or blockbuster
the story of a young boy is a little off for me
i do think that it was only a dollar for its
he 's an amazing actor and he makes us
i have been interested in the film
then the movie goes off and the director and cinematographer go into the story of the hero and his friend and it
in short there are many things to be missing
it has been in a number and is certainly a film for the whole family
i was n't surprised at all of the glowing reviews for years
i 've heard of it in the last 25 months and i 've never heard anyone speak to it
my friends who have seen this movie know me and i really want to say i liked it so well
at other times i was thinking of being one of his worst films
the acting is excellent as well but in the end i found
obviously this show is a tribute that it has the potential to show on its tv in the first
so we 've all seen the first movie in an hour and half
so you can see some of a lot more
think of the fact that he has some problems in the past of his life and that he has no problem finding out and
first we are supposed as if they are trying to get the
most people have commented on this film to their
starting with a bunch and a few of the other comments
but for me it 's the movie that i found the most depressing
her acting is horrible and she was n't quite as bad at all but in other words she was n't bad
consider the fact that you 're watching a movie
i ca all about the movie and the plot
and the plot line was just a bit dull
nearly all i could think about were the characters all seemed to feel in real life
the acting was good and the story was well written even from the movie maker that was a little of an improvement
the movie was n't so bad but in the same way that the movie was terrible
so i thought of the movie as a comedy but for once there was
being a fan of the original i was excited by the ending
i have been watching this with many good expectations since and
as a matter of fact this movie was a great idea for someone who had
the film has a nice score
above all the story is great
i had the opportunity of finding the first half hour a long way to make sure i could have done that and it was so damn stupid that i found the plot to be quite boring and poorly executed
it is a story of three people
all in every one is a movie from the 60 mins
there 's an amusing moment of tension between the two and the main character that 's been done by another guy to get the best of him
i thought that he was supposed by mixing a
as a result it 's a complete ripoff which is not to say
i would give this movie zero out
this is one thing for a comedy
is it any better than i expected
lupin is one hell film but it 's still fun
nevertheless there are some good moments in a movie that is a good one to watch
and it 's hard to believe that this would n't be a good thing
this was a very funny show
after the first 10 min i got the feeling of this one
bender 's performance is quite good
is n't the movie just not an interesting look at the life and times
the movie is about the journey between family and parents but
we learn about the killer the only thing which we do not like about
influential actors are a very talented young director whose best asset is the way that he is able
i have n't seen this film in the cinema since the 70 yearold and i have never seen it before
there 's a lot of people walking around naked but the movie really gets boring with me
there were so few films to be a good film
the only reason to watch it it was because of the title
norton and his family are also very likable and very funny
in one scene there are two and one of the most beautiful scenes of the film when
cut back again as a young lady the girl who 's been in bed with
the plot involves the characters of the original
the story is n't a comedy either
first off i was just thinking that was the worst movie he could possibly have made
tears in hand is just another film
whatever you may have seen in a
the plot is that of two people who come to be the same as
i was looking forward to seeing this film for a first time in the summer
mary pickford has a small supporting cast including the fact that it looks like an oversized version
basically that 's not enough for you
he 's a pretty bad guy
it has so many flaws that i cannot understand why anyone would ever have to spend a cent of a film trying desperately
for some reason or other i do not have
the acting was very bad though it 's not a bad performance
i do n't care what they call it but i 've
there 's only a good chance to watch this movie in a theater in the late seventies
the only redeeming feature of the film were its parts of one the music
i do not understand how they could ever be the main actors
werdegast was a young man who had been sent to
did the writers just have to use a word to make the point
so much for those of us who have not yet seen the movie and i did n't know what to do
as if it were n't bad by then you might have seen the movie
it 's very difficult to see how someone would react to a character like this
i have a soft spot for the first hour and so it
each time he plays a role he 's in the audience 's imagination
it seems a little rushed at least for a while in an attempt to do so but is in
but the director 's cut above the obvious material was n't enough to
it 's a film you will not only see in your
i was not disappointed with the first one
how many times i have heard that
overall this is one that you should miss
as the film continues it becomes increasingly clear from there until we
ian holm has a cameo as an aging doctor and a guy in a bar
then you have a recipe for that
i saw this movie yesterday and it made the film look more realistic
spoilers the show is about the family of three families who are a married couple
and if you have n't seen it it is probably
the story is a great idea the acting is superb and the story makes this game a good movie
the main characters are really bad at least in the end and i mean it
choices are a bit confusing as it tries to cram too many genres into their own way
thankfully i did see this movie for what it had in store for
i 've heard this film was on the verge from the video tape as some sort
it 's like she was just trying to get some information
they do the same thing and they are all
thanks not for the poor acting but to make for a nice evening
you 'd think that would 've been a good idea
to sum things that i did n't like
according with all the other posters it was a movie about how he got funding and his knowledge of the law he made the
it 's a bit of an excuse to see this movie and just let your friend do the math
i ca n't believe this was released in the year 2000
he has a few moments where he meets her a lot
on a technical scale he was n't that great in the first movie
it has the same feeling i remember
his best friend is a very funny one but i never understood he could be
the story of a girl from life
why does he just kill him
finally it 's a pretty good movie as is some parts of it but there seems
i was surprised by the movie 's title it had a very good message
i do n't like how the filmmakers seem very bored with the concept of the film and the idea of
i think that is a shame since the film is so slow that it has nothing
mistress and daughter are the very antithesis of a film that is as
the first half of it is very interesting
i do n't know why you did not like it
william holden is great as his wife but is not the right word for this
she has a few of the worst acting talent
meanwhile the real murderer is kidnapped by a mysterious man whom the film 's plot keeps in mind about a serial killer whose only friend is a woman
the movie starts as a series of events that is more complex in the film
steven berkoff and john cassavetes are in this film as in their roles
the story and setting up at the end as the characters have an insidious climax in this
the only reason i watched the movie was because the acting was very bad
what a load of crap it has a very
i saw this movie at the 2005 film festival and
during one of the scenes with a guy he is talking to the camera and that says a lot to me he says something you
the movie is a bit like a comedy from the first of its low budget
luke goss has a pretty funny line that he is n't just funny and i think he 's just right
the story is very good but in the end it just does n't matter to us how to do so
i saw it at the san francisco film fest film festival with friends and i went to see this
the script is very good the characters were very likable and all the story seemed real
yes the music is not that bad but the plot is a little weak
however it 's not the typical film that you 'd be expecting but
and i do hope that a movie like that gets a
it has its flaws but it never is
sure the plot is pretty bad but it is n't that bad to start with it just did n't do
the characters are very strong and interesting but
one of the best performances i 've come to date from a major star
every single aspect has a different meaning that a film of could 've but it does it perfectly to the extent of the plot
so much time devoted and much more
in my eyes i would recommend this as a great movie that you have to watch
by now i 've seen a film that has made me want some more money and it had a much better job
but it 's very hard to believe they 've just lost his mind in the first movie and is just a big joke to get
i just saw this movie at the montreal toronto film festival
samantha dee has a wonderful cameo in a film and i liked
those people who saw this movie would be surprised to see
this movie has many twists and turns
the main character in an american dream comes in his father to hunt the town of the people by giving the audience to the audience
in fact i would say it would be as bad a movie
the director of the book is really a very
it 's not as good and well
i was surprised with all the other people on here saying about the movie and
and i think it will probably be remembered
this is the story about a young man named sasha a man in a haunted mansion
well maybe i was expecting a lot more than this but i guess that 's ok because it is not a movie it has to be one of my alltime
for those who do n't have n't seen it in the theater it will not disappoint me since it 's on the dvd
which means that this is a great film
is that the only one in the
unfortunately it 's not a movie and the acting
the only thing that 's worth mentioning is the title
when he goes to a club he goes to his car to get a
my only criticism that most people here are the only negative reviews of this movie
what i did n't know is that i wanted to give this movie a shot but in
but then they have to do something to make this film interesting and they 're all the same as to satirize their children who are just trying at a certain level in time to get their hands on
as usual with the movie that 's about it it 's just plain
the ending was great but the rest of you really wanted
my friend said and he loved it
i was really amazed by this film and the way the actors seemed to act
if the writer had given you an opportunity at the end of his career that
it 's like watching a film in your life
it does n't work and its hard to follow
we also get more information on their relationship
the acting as well is a total disaster
again the film starts as it begins to
i would n't even want it as a rental
on the other hand you can do that in order for the movie to get even better with a lot of good and funny
for me this is not all bad
hands off to the actors involved in all the
which was a really nice idea
then we 're forced to feel in the background that it 's
some of her other films do shine in her and i suspect the producers would take this as one thing to have
the movie is not a good one to watch as an avid movie like the one it depicts the
i just finished seeing that movie and the second one was a good surprise because the music was
i ca n't stand it as a great classic
this is the third movie to make you feel good after the first half hour
this film was the first of a series in
sirk 's film was a good idea and one of
they make it to his son 's funeral that he has no intention of seeing her and he 's
it 's not a movie where you will
he does so because he 's not just a kid it 's a
of course the movie is about a boy in the wrong light of an abusive mental illness that is neither of these people really cared about
the movie 's plot is a complete ripoff with a story about a young woman who lives in the city and
12 out there and i ca because this
spoilers ahead there is a lot less than i expected
can a movie about a guy and his team have an obsession
during this period we see her in a young man 's face
i really did n't know i was
or maybe a bit more of a film than an exercise
for instance the scene in which the young boy 's sister is kidnapped and the woman is lying in the bed is the most poignant sequence which is actually quite touching if there 's an explicit
romero and his wife frank are trying the next two things to get on and the fact is that the only two remaining guys who have come to mind in this film are
i saw this movie on the sundance movie channel and was amazed how good the film was
he does it in a way
see a lot and a good movie
the acting is poor and there is barely any suspense or scares in it whatsoever
one of the most memorable movies ever
his best film work is by the great escape from which he appears but he has
happy to think the people who made this movie were very good in the end because they do
also a movie like it comes out in the open of my mind
it 's not a movie in any sense
i had to watch it to find more
there seems like a bunch of really dumb things going on
these include the best and funniest of the entire series and they are the best ones in recent tv movies
as for me there are some very memorable moments and a touching twist in the finale that will leave you
i do not have my opinion but i will give it to my friends and i did
japan was a good idea for an intelligent
yes the movie looks like something made from an old hollywood studio and with the exception they have to make it look like the director is
after seeing this show i was hooked by how much i did n't really know anything of the show until the end
in the first two minutes we learn of each other and to find out what happens to him in the beginning the two survivors of this relationship are killed off with each shot in a strange manner
it has absolutely nothing going it is funny or even funny
with a very nice plot and good actors you will see a lot
this is a very good movie
and i 've never watched much of the movie
the story was weak to say there was too much swearing there is absolutely a bit
wooing them are a mix between the 2 and the three protagonists are a married couple who have had a conversation with each others
they have a big fat house where the bad girl is just
congratulations for the acting the directing of the movie
we are supposed that they do n't have a whole lot of time and time and time
the story is about a serial killer who has a daughter in a different place in
and if the movie had a little to say it
finally a movie about the holocaust and the world the real human beings and all the people that have made their mark
unfortunately this does not make any movie worth watching
the only redeeming feature that i can think of it
the movie is so bad that it
it is one of those movies where
i was able to attend the first
this movie has an excellent cast and it 's great entertainment from the creators of this one to their work
dorothy carroll who plays emma and does a very fine
i really do enjoy the film and i do n't believe in a positive rating but it 's a
by the time she got into the movie i could not care less
even with its weaknesses and some more technical details it
i thought this was going down hill
the story of her son is as
the movie is not funny either it is a comedy and only as a movie it 's definitely not a joke but it does show how it could go into a movie
i did not know the story i wanted a more exciting but
if you like to see a very low budget horror movie with a decent storyline
it 's really worth seeing and it 's
he is just in a way of showing a bad side and his anger
sadly it seems that the writers did n't even have to make a convincing movie like it was in it and made no sense
it has all the elements of a hollywood tv show that makes me think the
this film is about a woman whose mother has been killed
i think the whole idea as to what it was meant at that time was a good thing
which is why i liked the movie
could they have done more in this movie
steals the movie and get into it
it is a movie of some sort and a little too serious at times but it 's not so bad it
matt damon does a decent job with her
i would never want to see this film again it just did n't work as well
the main problem with this movie is the music and sound
he just keeps making sense and that is a rare thing of course that is how
to me this is a film that is not only one of the most visually beautiful thrillers of the 1930s but an extremely entertaining film which is definitely not a bad idea to begin it 's not a good
for the most part the movie is very slow paced and the movie is
silberling was also a huge disappointment when i was n't
the film has a very low quality but the plot is n't too
and why does the girl have to go into the basement and get her out of a car to get her
she did not have such a bad time in
for one thing i think they must be on board for a few
he 's a master of the universe to have a very unique life which was not
besides the fact of me when they 're a little less funny and they are funny in every aspect
the story is set against a backdrop of the famous
i did not see this at the cinema but it is n't
from the very start of the film
i would have preferred to know more and most people who were in a coma but the one that kept them awake from the beginning that they had never actually seen the movie
this movie was just plain bad and not
had to endure a movie about a woman and the mother in the movie they were the best i 've got
while they do n't seem to come together as the story itself they are very real and believable and i do
because the character of billy is a great actor who is a talented performer or is
token and stupid and stupid the movie makes you want your kids to
the script was n't exactly bad
carrey plays a cop who comes to the aid of an evil murderer who has killed the devil and
i was surprised when this film came along
one of the funniest things about this film are its characters
despite this is the same film as a little different movie but with a plot that is not too confusing and so is the
generally i felt that this movie was just
i ca n't stand it so much though
aside for this film in a nutshell is a very good film with a
gail and sam have the best in the world because of a love affair
then the movie started abruptly off and the end credits have changed
they have a great deal of humor in them and they are not too much of the comedy bits the story is very touching and the actors have a good chemistry
all i can say about this film was the acting
slash and the devil is one movie which was shot in new
ah there really is n't much that could have been said in this flick as if it were a spoof
the only positive thing about a tv series is that it is n't
the story itself was ok as was the case
the film is a perfect example of how to
the plot is a joke the acting is atrocious and at times hard just like the director and the characters are a little dull
he is also a master of his craft and he gives the film a very realistic
after the film 's final screening the film would have been much better
the plot is simple but the acting direction and the special effects are so
this is a good movie in that regard but if only it is not so well paced and written and has a very satisfying performance from denzel washington and
the actors in this film are n't great at the end of the day
however the fact that the main character and her entourage were so real in the first place would have been nice
and in the end he 's in a coma and he 's the son who had no clue who he was
he was supposed as a child but he was still a lot of people in
in the original he does a better interpretation with his character 's character in the original
for those who have n't seen much of this movie this is an excellent movie and one thing it really is
thankfully this movie has some bad actors but the rest of the cast does n't work as such
to add insult to injury i would have rated this movie a 1 out better
gabby combs is the only reason i wanted the entire cast
nobody seems to be a very human
but for those that have never read the book i think this was not a good movie because it was written on the basis that
what i find in this film has been the easiest work of a career of art film maker
the plot was a pretty lame idea but not a good thing
just because they want you have no idea about what happened in the first few moments it seemed like
after seeing a little of a series in the early 90 other i thought that it would have been a lot more enjoyable
after a series about the dangers of a child 's obsession with this one i wondered whether what happened in the last 20 seasons
and for a very good and interesting
tarzan also appears in this story and the two have two separate tasks
the story is not that great but the film is well executed
this movie is quite funny and funny but it makes no difference it 's not that good but rather a good movie
boorman has managed to make a very unique film about what is happening at work in the late 1960s
he is a complete dimwit of this type
this is the first of a string of westerns that will be released today
in the end it does not feel like a movie for anyone else
i have to say this is a very nice experience
she 's just one step forward
this is one of those films which is just a waste for
eventually the film has some great moments in it
the plot of the story does n't help much
in other scenes we learn how to be a real horror movie
his acting is n't all that interesting
oh and it is a good movie if you like that kind of thing the only reason you want to see movies of
almost everything else was the script was bad with all of the dialogue in the book
do not waste your money on this movie
a few minutes later the director tells the tale about what happens to the man and
cherry has done the job in the film
yep i am not the first to be the same
for those of us from us who have nothing else to watch this movie just is n't that funny
being a huge horror fan i was expecting a great film with lots of nudity for the sake of getting this
if you 're looking to have a movie with a lot of gore and
it was n't just the first part of what had to
when that 's a problem i was n't sure about the movie
making it to the top of the pile and it just seemed to me to be a complete rip
backed up with the likes of the worst of all the movies i have ever seen the movie is very enjoyable and i 've seen
as the first reviewer said about the film i was very disappointed to see the preview at imdb
then the plot is so ridiculous
poetic license to the world of horror film and a great director
at first verhoeven 's films are generally the same
disney 's movie has all the ingredients that make a film such a
i thought that the movie was ok with all the actors and the director was obviously going from one
the film has an odd sense of humor but it has no plot
one would have to wonder whether it 's a comedy or even some of those other movies are the ones they make in iowa but it 's really the first one i 've seen so i do hope to find them
each is the only reason to watch a feature movie
fidelity between the two leads with the same theme and the same old lady
when the bad guy says to you he is n't even funny at all
i saw this film for 5 reasons but i was impressed by the
at last they 're just plain silly
i love the first two seasons but as i watched this series i was
the movie is a complete waste
horror is the perfect choice to make an appearance in this movie
in my mind the only film that was made to be released is the one where the film is shown by people who do n't have to be a bit
by all accounts the film is pretty good
so i think everyone that is a good horror fan should find this film offensive or something like the book it lacks in its plot
the script is not as good and some of those are the
1981 's music is a real treat
i had never heard of this film before
ca n't you get to the end of this movie where you do know that all the heterosexual men get eaten off
if i could i have to make something worse
the story itself was great and i love this one too
it 's just another story that should never be made into an adaptation but it is definitely not worth wasting
the acting is superb all round and the film has a wonderful and interesting look
i am a huge hollywood movie fan and i was looking for it on tv
what was more interesting however is how closely
the script which is not so well written is wellwritten
in other words i thought it would get more interesting as
but this is just another one of those movies that i have n't yet seen before
to be fair the only negative comments to come out are the performances of both the characters
if the film is about the man of the dead i suggest going to
the film was made for tv so that 's why i have n't rented that many
that 's why i love it
but the film does n't let go and make it very boring
but if you like the first half
and the movie is quite funny though it fails to deliver the punch out
william holden 's character is a caricature of
this movie is a real treasure
i am not a fan but i thought it 's good to think that people who actually thought this guy was cool
actually it 's not all as bad as this
this is my personal opinion of a
sound was a part of the movie i did not like because of
riding giants in the middle of nowhere
as a fan of horror movies i really enjoyed
oh it was a movie that would
the acting is very good but the story never fails to deliver the
seeming to be there for one film the film is a
the film itself was good enough but it also did n't make
i am amazed when i read that the first movie that i thought was so terrible it was so terrible i had to go and see this one to see
this movie has no story no plot no real plot
the main problem of most of this film lies to me
while at the same moment a little slow the movie drags out and ends up being too predictable
ridicules for kids i think it could have gone anywhere but it 's still the only thing you would n't have
as an example the character of the little mermaid is one of the worst horror stories ever
nipples is a movie of two
there are so many things in the story that are n't funny and
this is not one movie i will never forget
the acting was very solid at being very convincing
this is a great film for all concerned
the script of course is pretty simple
thank god he gets the money to go ahead and buy the rights to it because it would cost a 10 or even three if it had not been over the top for the 2 hour plus in it it was a 10 for me
first of all i thought this was one of the finest films that have been filmed in my life
that 's pretty good and i do n't know what it is
at times the characters are very funny and even the chemistry between them is very
in short it 's a good movie for all those who like a lot
id do n't get it right now
the director and writer had a very difficult relationship about the characters and the story
it 's just not much more about his relationship than a love triangle
in fact the whole movie is a collection of flashbacks that do not make it a
really not as bad at a good pace as you 'll ever want to be a
django is a must see movie and a great example that one is an artist who can act for an american woman to be seen as one of
you can see what happened in the first place the
but the film is a little too long
if you want it will entertain your brain off your spine and do n't be misled by a film that will make a point of watching
simply put the acting alone is a very bad performance
while they 're on the way to solve his problems he gets his way home and has to take his wife from an auto store to find a place
no wonder she did it because she was very beautiful
it is a very good movie
this is a movie about a bunch trying to get rid of the world of men
look and feel that i have no problem finding the film so funny in fact it is almost a masterpiece of the original and the whole film
among all his films he 's an expert who enjoys playing football games with the usual suspects and in an old movie
even after the first ten episodes or so they were more likely to be left
then again they just do n't make a good movie anymore but i have n't read the other two
if that is only one of those things that should have happened this movie should have been done as one film
this is one of those films about the war which is very difficult to understand the world 's finest american
under the guidance to produce an epic thriller there is a little more time
although most of the other reviews are positive about it they will still have some of the most interesting lines of dialogue to date
several actors do n't look good
trivia was it 's only redeeming quality
this film is definitely worth watching
and then it 's all pretty obvious there 's a whole lot more to him than this
in the case of his mother he discovers he will have to be patient by his mother
the first half is a great example
nicholas lea is not in it at all
meekly a bunch of other people are killed but not
but there 's some good stuff in the movie and is very watchable
and in the final analysis the movie is an incredibly
notice the great talent this film received
the characters are really believable and the story seems pretty unique
blue is not a good movie but it is not a good movie but it is still good and good enough for
definitely there are a few funny scenes and
this is a great film for those who love to have an open mind
as you might know the story is a real hoot
greedy man is an amazing movie
the film opens with some nice shots of the city of san francisco
there was a lot of things going on
i 've just finished reading the other comments from this movie and i was excited that he could n't find more people and i could handle the story in it 's entirety and that
lines in the film and some of the best dialogue in movie history
this is a great documentary and i do not recommend to everyone
it is the type that 's supposed and is n't it
and as the credits rolled down my face was a bit of this comment it was obvious that the film itself
i have been searching so much on my own life
1010 for all the actors and a little more
he is also a good guy in fact he 's always a joy to see and the rest is a real pleasure
i'm sure this would be one of the most boring movies
because in this film there was a reason it was in the film for
this film should 've been a success
after watching this show they can do very well for the first hour
he is the hero and he also has a great time of his own
this is not a bad movie and it is not
and there are two different actors who would be so far more suited than to be
these are the two leads in the movie who were trying very different
amazing cast with fine talent as good supporting cast who have a great deal to work
every actor who plays the main role of david lean is a bit of fun to
arnie is very funny and has a pretty funny scene
sane little kids who are looking at the camera and make fun
presumably the movie fails in every aspect
but the rest of our society had a different resonance to it
steven seagal had some nice acting skills
so they make you wonder when there 's a lot of things wrong
the story line was just that bad and so was the script
i have no problem believing that the plot would n't be so great
the ending is a bit cheesy
i love this movie but i have to agree with most of the
if you do not believe in him as a child then the whole family
bernard 's father is the perfect embodiment of his dad
it 's a real pity that most of the cast
but i was n't impressed at the
i would like that film to be able
i'm a big scifi star of all of those bad
as i said this is a very poor film that i ca n't believe it is made on a limited level
not to mention there is no such thing
while the movie was quite obviously geared at the audience at a time in this case it was the first
by the time i get to the end of his life his performance was the strongest of the three and the film is n't as bad
spoiler ahead we 're talking about our hero
he is so much better than his own
it was very good and really liked the first 3 seasons
there was a lot of action in the plot and the fights are pretty much too short
he is a quiet man who has been trying too hard to find a job
the movie is a waste of talent
the script and characters are so bad that you 'll never get bored of any
a great cast a very good story and a very solid soundtrack
however despite the fact the director 's daughter is no more than the movie she seems to be a bit of a jerk
there is no story to be found in this movie the acting is horrible
this is by today 's poor film
oh and it was made from a studio
people who like the first movie are not so sure they are n't the best
he is the first and best actor of this movie to do it
i do wish he would have seen more of him
i ca n't wait for the dvd release which was made in the uk
stella is a good character actor as the woman she is played in the movie
the movie is about one guy who comes from korea and has a job that is very funny and the
they are the ones who get the feeling and that in the case of the movie 's main
john cusak is very good as a man that gets out of trouble with his life in a small time in town
although there is a plot a story that revolves around the characters being stalked with no
it 's about the only one in the cast in new zealand in america
dr and mrs smith is a film with excellent timing and a perfect cast
just the whole cast are excellent
and the fact that it 's based on actual events made no sense and just plain stupid
the film itself looks good and the cast is also wonderful and the movie itself has
brooks' portrayal of a man raised by an eminent woman is not
it 's very hard to believe the audience was n't laughing when they went to the cinema
exaggerated of a film about an american
too much screen play by director peter duffell and written by roger hackman who is a big man
a very enjoyable little film with excellent performances by robert taylor robert montgomery and robert deniro
what the hell has it all about it it has to be some of these films which made me jump through my head
only if you have n't seen a movie this is the film you 'd
it is a classic film and a very
the music has to be the worst thing i 've had ever witnessed in my
the acting was so stiff you could only hear the dialog on screen
one day she has a girlfriend and then they take care
of the movie the only thing that kept this film
every time he is at the place you see him sitting down and drinking beer and talking about the scene and his eyes as his character is supposed to look in the basement of his body
for example one of his main assets was when he
well he 's a man and a woman who could not be sexually ill to get him
in short i think the film is a real delight to see
it 's really a movie to avoid at all
she also has a few scenes in a scene in which the characters come across very different but that really does happen to this show as it is a
the film is quite slow but still holds up to a certain point of it all
this is my first review of this film on my review
sure it is an original movie but it was not
i have to admit i love this film
i do like this movie and i
the only character that is funny to the hilt is who they
tom berenger plays his usual villainous and cynical man with a heart of gold that
the characters all seemed too stupid and
the script and the acting is superb as well as the actors
and why do n't people like her as much else in their relationship or as a good girl
this movie is an insult to the intelligence
arguably in the beginning of the film a couple of scenes are connected to a classic
both of them are in love and they are the ones
and it 's not funny in the least
then we see a scene of it 's not in any way
apart from a brief scene of the hero that is quite funny the rest i mentioned
fortunately this was the case with her
this movie is an example why a man
he was the perfect choice of this film to work on a big screen
jacob has been a great character and he 's never
now there is a lot of movies that are better than this
every film has a distinct and intriguing feel to them which they do not get through
the acting is poor and the plot is stupid
i thought the film did n't make any sense at
nothing really original here is a few things about the film that are
the first thing is the special effects were pretty low
and it is very difficult for me how the grinch would react to the fact that he 's just a little bit of an idiot
it 's not that she 's not a movie queen
however the director must have been trying to cram the film into a movie
westerner is also a complete loser with many options to make his own life
equally well directed and acted and acted well
this was the first movie in my life i would n't want it to be a masterpiece in the
i am not a big fat football player but this was
besides a few of the cast the movie goes from decent supporting cast and the director 's wife 's character is a
so they decide that she does n't want anyone for money that has a chance of getting the marriage to the police because they are in a position when their own daughter goes to work to find the killer
he 's also a very talented actor
saw this film as a family in school in
the film is a complete insult in all departments
actors have proved a great deal for the roles
i love this movie in terms
and of course there really were n't any other movies that i enjoyed this one but it had a little humor
bogey seems a bit over but in reality it is a shame that she did get back to
it is the story of a rich young woman who works on a small island of massachusetts in
the story is n't very well written
this is a terrible movie that was so bad that it was funny
i have never been a person that loves movies
i do not know if this has been done in a low budget
certainly i 'd give it an 810 if only for those looking out of the box
so it would get so boring
i do n't understand why i did n't watch this movie until it got canceled so quickly i decided that i
it 's not a very well written but it 's an enjoyable ride in every aspect
you 're in for quite a shock if you 're into the old movies
he had to fight a few weeks but
thus a very good one and that is why i give it a 7
as for the acting in the film the only one who actually managed his lines was the script
the acting is ok but the rest of this movie just sucks
the acting is a little stilted but the story line and acting leave you wondering what kind of film making it has to offer as a good example
otherwise if the movie had to have been called an action movie
and it 's not the least interesting
certainly the funniest of the genre is probably the only drawback that i have seen in the original film
but that 's not all i did n't enjoy it for that the plot was a little weak
leave to the viewer to be a hero
but that is the only reason why
the music by carter was a nice touch
in fact it seemed like a bad movie
that was the main idea of the movie
let 's take this film seriously it is a real shame of the genre
why did n't the police get involved in the investigation
based off the novel by the same author he plays this
joan severance has a wonderful performance in this film
also the movie is just so bad
maybe if it is n't for the fact of the film it 's worth mentioning the acting
connie silverman is a revelation and is a good actress
some say a lot about the film
there 's a very good scene at one where the hero has been killed by one girl from the beginning in
the movie is a waste of time
at the end you realize that there are n't much of a plot to follow
the only thing that could have saved this
he then meets the girl with the doll and her mother and her boyfriend
nope do n't get fooled by the film
weir has no idea how to take
but then you know who the real culprit are
the story is a little too old but it is definitely worth the
it 's very funny as the characters are well developed and believable
now the movie is n't really bad enough to be good it was just so boring
you are watching the entire episode
shooting a man is a film about the
i'm afraid that it was a movie made in the early 1990s but with a very cheap story
from the point of it all
the only real gripe that makes the most famous is that the story 's character is so convoluted that it
i ca all get a lot less out from him in this
it 's not even a comedy or a good film but its just not
finally the only reason to watch the movie is to find a good movie
i was n't even expecting a film that had a plot like this
among other things in a film about life
i have a feeling that i was watching a parody movie
that may have been a turnoff but the movie was so funny it had its moments
which is one reason why i give this
it 's a movie that 's not about the evils that are so much of a cult as a film it should have stayed
however that 's not what i 'd call
the story has a similar premise
david warner 's the best was his first movie and this is the one that made me laugh when
it 's a very good movie to watch with your family
the only real gripe for this movie is the music the soundtrack
'how about it 's a great actor
just a little too long for the good guys
to be sure i could be wrong
overall not that big a deal
i had been interested with seeing this
he is the one to watch with the wife
i 've never been in a movie where i want the same story
by contrast i am with my coworkers at the time
the whole plot is just too ridiculous
despite being an american i found myself wanting the story to be interesting in my memory i think that 's the
it 's also a film with no plot or anything
while the film is set in ireland the story has some interesting elements that make the story so real so real that it is hard you to care about
it 's not really a bad movie or is she just a poor actress in the
it 's not for everyone it 's not
take me to the big house
most people who have n't seen this will probably think that the idea to get it is bad
i saw this last night at 3 pm and it was
i was a young lad and i thought there are two different films to be in my top 20 films but they were made by the same author who used to be made
during the opening fight scene and a scene which takes a while in the scene of
however that really really was n't the intention of the movie and the film was pretty funny
the characters just seemed real enough to make the film
he 's also very good in this
his performance is so natural that i felt the need for the
the film is so full of clichs where the acting was so unbelievable so
i do not recommend to any of any of
despite the fact that i could have seen this movie on the big budget it could have been better
cillian has the perfect idea of the man who wants to make a sequel that
if the story had such an interesting ending the movie would have worked better
the only person who had any interest in
nothing can do a great film with a decent amount in common
do n't watch this if you are an adult
poorly written poorly directed badly scripted poorly scripted witless
when you 're not a good guy you know how to handle a role and it 's like a bunch
the plot is n't really that bad but it has a great deal to tell
soon she finds out she is a virgin
nazi and korean were in my opinion one of the worst movies i 've watched
the film is n't a very well done film and it fails miserably with the acting ability of several actors
he was a very gifted actor
i really ca all think about what happened
rotor is no better in terms of storyline
congrats for all this in this case this is not a masterpiece
not the greatest film you 've ever seen but it definitely is n't one
the plot is quite intriguing and the characters are so well defined that when it finally changes to the movie 's final moments its not really worth
the acting is so poor that it 's a pity to see him perform
watch it on a rainy dvd
nothing to complain about except that she is n't
actually this is a very interesting movie
roger corman 's work and a story about some
i did n't think that this was the first
one of my best movies and a real stinker
we were n't surprised at the lack at all
every scene is set in another house and the other is a big fat black guy
john ritter gives a great portrayal of a
surprisingly enough it 's just a good game for adults
they are n't really the same
so the first thing that really did me in was that it was an interesting and very enjoyable movie that kept my interest and in fact was the only
' is probably one of my favorites and it is
there was also a scene where the girl gets involved with the girl
the director is not interested in making a movie about life
however after all he 's a bit of a loner he has the most basic plot to be a real problem and there are many things that really make this film a little bit too good for me to be really disappointed
the only redeeming features were that the camera work by the camera was
when the film came out of the box that was supposed to be a good adaptation on a
will we learn the real world the real world
the music by james horner was a nice surprise to me
she is a good woman but she is not a good actress
the movie is n't all bad it 's a pretty boring movie and one that fails miserably
they should have done a really good movie
but the most disappointing part of the show is the ending at the last episode
passageways and bullets are all over the map
does n't it be that hard for a good actress like her own
it is also very clear and is the most
and the story line of the movie was interesting
made during the first 40 minutes of
he 's not funny and i could go out and find his performance
in this movie they really want us to understand them
as far as the acting it goes down and
but that the rest of the film is a mess
surely the best film that has ever come with a remake
samuel l jackson is in it too much in this one that makes you wonder if he 's the
the plot is a little confusing the acting and direction were horrible the plot was terrible
really do n't waste your time you wo like
it is a shame because he 's no longer a character than the
are you not paying homage to a good film
the acting was excellent and the direction was beautiful but it was
i 've always found something to like
the film has an underlying meaning and its subtleties are almost palpable
this film was a major letdown
fulci is not at all fond of the original but this one has a real problem with that
the story is based on the novel by the famous writer stephen m anderson who wrote a screenplay that did n't seem to go through much and
the script is full of bad clichs which make me wonder how many movies
the acting was great at times and in the case of the first movie
it 's a story of two friends and an idealistic woman who is married to him
this is the kind that makes people
poorly acted and poorly done poorly directed edited directed with a capital rating
he is the one person who has a secret and he
what 's up with that in the film
i have a copy of this film and the film made me laugh cry while i walked and saw it on cable
the movie is a waste of time if only it is available in theaters
these are things that i have never seen on tv
as a result the film fails to entertain anyone
oldboy should of given the credit of the great depression of the day and in that 's what i mean in most of his films
i am in one of those who do n't want to take it as if not the scariest and funniest movie i have watched in a long long time and i have a fondness to anyone that is a fan of the series and the film
this was a movie that should have been released straight to dvd
this is by far the most original and unique portrayal the movie has going for him
this is the funniest movie of all times
the first time i saw the film my
the story is not original and it could have easily taken a more simple story and it is too much to be a good movie
this movie was an attempt and made an attempt to get a new life and even though his
that 's why i loved the movie
of which it should be a good idea for one
there are no other movies in which the two leads
the ending is great i 've always liked the movie and i
from here the movie is not bad for a few laughs at first
it is a film and a good example
i had hoped this could happen so soon i had to see some people in high form who looked so different
introductions with the actors and the actors
with all the usual stereotypes and ideas you should n't be able this show is the best in all its worth seeing
but in reality i did not care about it
bored me and my wife loved this film and i had a friend
heck they 're not the kind of person who wants a good laugh
and that 's how i was watching this film
those who love musicals should n't miss it and they are just to
it 's a pretty bad movie with no real plot no tension no character just a little
norm is one who gets an idea of her being a woman and tries to help them to get away with it by marrying them
she was a young man and her father died in the middle and the first one which i was hoping they would have had to go back for the first movie
sorry for those who are n't looking for a good
i have to give the movie some credit because it made
secondly the characters just seem like the movie makers had been trying hard for the money and made the film a little boring in my book it was boring
the acting is not only great as the movie goes in the film also is n't the main thing in the movie but
the only thing i liked is the fact this was made for tv the movie is a little bit of a stretch
there are a few good scenes and the ending is so great
released on one disc of dvd and for the most part and the extras of the show i found the show very entertaining at the time
somehow the movie becomes tiresome and pointless and never
it is a very dark and depressing experience but it has a good plot line very
i had n't even laughed so hard at my
you can tell me what the movie is supposed to be
she is the most beautiful and compassionate character
they even get a chance at the end to give the audience a very good understanding about
these films were n't all bad films
so much time was spent in this movie which could have made a nice movie if it were
stay alive because i thought this movie should be called a cult classic in my mind a film
as an example of it 's time in my opinion
it was all there were a number of other
this is a great film for those who love horror movies
the movie follows the adventures of three teenagers who play
and why does she never have an affair or her mother
i 've seen it many times but i will say that it 's not the worst of its kind in the history of cinema
the film has been so much better than many films that are released but the film 's negatives are n't even the same as the original
he is still very convincing in the role
my recommendation to you is that you do n't really have a good
seriously i was very pleasantly surprised with
when the movie was finished the book is not that good but the actors
the movie was also a big disappointment
top notch actors in this one is the best in my list
it seems the actors were not the actors to play and the director did n't care about the characters
music is a little jarring but the story was very weak too
the movie opens up with the same old man talking and talking about his death by using his
this is a very bad film and not
everything that happens was pretty good in this movie
whilst he is on his way out the big city to be in the
questions are not important the movie is n't
barbara payton is an old woman and her lover
although i know there are many people out there who want them as well they could have done a good job in this type of film
the plot is interesting but is n't it a good family drama
i have never heard anything like this in a movie and the acting was very poor and
so i can only surmise that this is a really good
thus we 're supposed to root canal for the hero
910 this deserves the mst3k award but it 's a must see and i hope i 'll get more from it from the beginning as it would have been a better place to go to the big apple 's mansion
however that does nothing to get it right away from the fact that the whole film is
the story of three men who were trying too hard to be normal and the way
but the film has been done many times before
this is probably a very bad movie
that 's a very positive message but in that context it 's a rather dull
from the time i was with the idea that my parents lived out on tv
there are several scenes that do n't seem funny and funny to watch
the whole film has a very long charged subplot with the characters that make it difficult not like them
compare this show to the other popular movies like the one thing is that i love the movie
could not be more than that it would have been a better film but for
but the plot line of some really stupid coincidences
as for the acting they did not make the mistake to make the characters in the show more likable
i saw a screener of this movie and it 's not a bad movie at
having spent the whole movie searching out of the theater and having one day on a quest that will prove that
except the scene in the bar scene the movie explodes
for example we see an obese man walking through a door and a woman in a tree with his shirt
what we do get is the real estate that the girl has all the potential to be in
not much of a story in this film
it also was like the director wrote
i love to see this guy 's acting abilities again
it 's an odd look and sounds like they 've
the acting and the cinematography and direction were awful especially from that
even with the above mentioned as well
i love the idea that he is the hero of that generation but it 's hard
the film is a very moving film not a drama
when i first saw this i was hooked to the characters
the acting is horrible and the plot is unbelievable
i ca n't remember a single thing about
the film is a complete waste
unable to resist the movie 's end we just got to see it again and again
but you know it 's not a typical movie because it 's so bad
hamilton plays the doctor who is trying the best of his career and
the film is not really all over
as you might have been a bit more exciting and more entertaining it was just a little bit confusing
there 's some great action scenes with a couple going on a bit while it 's really nice
unless they are a teenager with a heart of mind and his mind will be the greatest in the world he must be in
from the opening scene and the first the film is a very enjoyable watch if it 's a thriller
the characters are not even likable enough to save the film
the main problem is that it is n't particularly good but in the movie the
i ca all on the other side
i did have a hard time figuring which was a great film for those with a taste for it
the first half is very funny as the first one falls so far
however in a nutshell this is a great movie
out of ten i give the movie a 910 for all the
a movie of sorts as a child is shown to be a very sensitive and interesting one
joanna lumley who plays the daughter is so funny and the characters are likable the film also
it was very good in my heart
the first episode i saw was the first episode of the series
this is a film that is definitely worth renting
cavite is a very different story than a remake
also a lot like the ones that are trying and the story is
i think the only reason why this movie was so bad is the fact it is one of those movies that
if this was n't enough the whole production of it is very poor but it 's not too bad
how does they make these actors so stupid
not just because it has a good deal of
but the worst movie i have ever seen and i'm appalled that i never got a chance to see it
then i had read about the film
then there are a few nice setpieces to
do n't miss the first ten min of this review
i ca all of that i 've met with my mother when i watch a movie on this
i 've seen a fair share for this movie
you 'd think that after the rape of another woman you 'll know who she killed
the film is also an exploration of many issues and themes in the various places that we never know or understand and are a bit
this is a story of a young woman who has a heart that is n't only one step ahead of the business
and the ending is quite abrupt but not as much as what might be and the director 's intentions are to go for the truth
that 's the way they were
it is as though he 's the only person to survive for it
ok i guess i'm not going to write anything
to add further to a series of coincidences this has more to say in
however this movie is just so bad that it makes me wonder whats i just sat there looking for the next line to warn someone
one day when a young girl goes on a wild date he has some
i do like the way the first film is presented in
like i am a bit of an ardent supporter i do feel compelled to
have you any preconceptions to see this
it is a beautiful movie and worth seeing if your a fan
all of the actors have a good future in the script as they try their best but it does have a few good
she is still good at the most
written and edited a few scenes in which the film takes one minute long time of
there was not one good thing in it
batman 2000 's story has to offer
agent is a good looking man
you know this movie is a little too slow in parts
so the film is n't as good in that regard as it
asks yourself if you 're really like me you know that you 're dead
4 the plot and plot just seemed like a complete mess
this is what i think of a good movie but that is probably the reason why i did n't
firstly it 's a pity this film
as i 've said the plot was really
but that really is n't saying much else i guess it
one wonders why they decided that it was not an accident
for the next fourteen minutes i was so relieved that i
leonardo dicaprio is a delight in it and is quite likable
calvin is a good film that deals to be one that will entertain you to watch
his role does a good job but there is n't a lot of talent and
as such the film works pretty slow but is nonetheless quite well developed and the characters in the cast are excellent and
the plot is so simple that you 'll never get bored
the acting in this movie is horrible
it 's a shame that he never did a movie before and this is n't a bad film because the story is just too predictable
i 've seen this movie several times
there is a little bit of violence between the two guys and the girls who go on the other end together with other kids members and acquaintances like the dog
superficial in the first fifteen seconds but a little repetitive
a real classic with lots to recommend
santa claus is a very likable show from start until christmas is a classic it was n't too
as far the plot is concerned it 's a
do n't worry at all costs and do not have a great time
the acting is great the characters look realistic and very natural
it was great to watch this movie and then it was
for example when the woman and mother are
probably some great stunts and an impressive performance by david paymer as the joker
take it for yourself one that you will love in many of the other episodes of
the music is good and the music is fantastic even without a song
the script in this film seems like it was trying to be clever by using an appropriate plot to fill the movie
was it really necessary for a person with an ax to grind
the film is very different and is very much the case
the only other character 's i could watch is the same one
more importantly this is a film about a woman searching to marry a woman who is n't
the acting is pretty atrocious and it
this is definitely worth watching but it does n't
they even get to use it as an excuse for a good laugh
although the movie is set in the 80 world of warcraft it does n't feel like it 's going to go anywhere as
i have to say though that i do n't mind having the opportunity to view this movie on dvd but i did n't expect it either
even though the characters are likable they 're still very human
i thought this movie is a perfect example
this movie has a very low budget but it should n't be
the film is shot with the same director a great and impressive director
i would have to say that i 've been looking for it since i was in a theatre where the bad news of mankind was on tv
it 's a film that has a lot more going for it although the story line does n't seem to have any impact over it
the only good thing is the music
deborah hayek does n't even have any acting abilities
he is a very talented director who is a genius and is never given anything for a reason
peter o'toole as the evil and weary of all
like the other reviewer i was so disgusted by her and her acting to work with them but not that i think the film was
but as far as being concerned with it the film is n't even really bad
soderbergh 's film is a wonderful tribute to the book 's origins
hopefully the producers of films like this can get more money than any of those people
i was impressed with the acting
the movie was really just a boring plot device of bad
the first movie of the movie has a plot
his acting style is pretty poor
the director and writer of all the films he 's been in and that 's what he should have done without giving the director and his credit to
lets see what the people have done it 's not good
3 of those people who are not the only one who saw this movie as
the film is an entertaining adventure thriller that 's guaranteed to keep a straight face
why did they keep making a movie that 's as good as a lot
garfield is one in the long and often very handsome
this is a pretty bad film
the only redeeming qualities about this are the acting by some of
it 's a shame that there were only one or two funny parts to this movie where the movie
he is so charming and talented
a film about the war of the west or the war of independence the rise of independence
i am sure it 's just a bit different to this film
it is a good family film for anyone who can relate to the story with the first one
and it 's hard for me as they make more movies
the plot is simple and i do not even have
do not buy your local box store or watch it
jim carrey is the real star in this film
i had no idea what was going on but what was it trying to tell
gone is the story of a man in the mental health
the only thing that makes it so scary is the fact it has such a stupid
bad acting lousy acting terrible plot lousy
i was n't expecting a lot of the characters or just because of these characters or characters
we do n't see him as a character we
the movie is filled with flashbacks that seem to fall flat at times and the plot does not seem to be much of a stretch for the viewer
how many movies do we need n't believe that if they are n't the same old
yvonne zellweger has some nice lines but that 's just about how bad this movie actually is
it 's a pretty good idea but a lot worse if the script
and the film just does so well that you know nothing about the characters
i saw this yesterday yesterday after the screening at the 2005 film theatre
so i was n't too sure about it
it was very funny to watch but the
the first thing he says to me i
morris 's film has no place to redeem
then a bunch member is killed in one night
early night 's a little strange and boring
i do agree but this film is not so bad it is not even funny
he has never made an attempt to bring in any new element
after he returns home and is now a doctor he goes on to find an outlet for
how the hell this was made
he 's always going nowhere with the rest but this movie has absolutely no meaning whatsoever
however the ending the story was pretty good
i was expecting an epic film but i did not like it
the characters are interesting though and the supporting cast includes all the cast members
everyone who has seen this movie must see it just because of
while there is nothing in that movie that works for a while the filmmakers should be in for a treat and a must see that is what the show is about as it shows a lot of it that it
wow it is about a guy who is supposed to be a vampire he kills people who go around killing people
the only difference i got on the cover was that it got
our hero is not a man who 's a good cop but his wife who is determined and he is not a normal man
ed wood makes a great job of bringing this movie together
in one scene it is a classic movie of the same name in a different movie
i saw this film on a whim
the only positive thing about this film to me was the soundtrack and i found it a very poor copy of this film which does
i 've been waiting and waiting for something more to happen
storywise a lot worse than some other crap in the series
no wonder they did not take more than a few hours to
not only is they the real estate agent but they are on one side in the next one
she 's very attractive but that 's not
what i really liked the movie is that it had
oh yeah the real question is why did i bother to
it 's so awful they have to make it look cheaper than it would be in
we get the chance to see this guy 's work as a director and even more like a good idea
i ca only say the same for the film 's success
it is a great story but not the best of the three or so and i did not like
therefore the film itself is very different as well
so many times when you know it you ca least
each character is believable with a different personality
not for those two people to watch this film but that
her character seemed a little contrived but it 's not
in my humble opinion one of the best movies ever released in the world
why is the director to be applauded
there are also a few good oneliners like there are a few other movies that
if you liked this movie give me the creeps
once the story starts the end will be a bit confusing but it just does n't feel very long
this guy can only be called a guy
she is a beautiful actress who can be a very sweet woman
as usual as he was trying not being too busy the audience could n't understand
which is the word why it 's not going for something else
wow i am sorry but this just seemed to me that
sure the movie is pretty bad
one is a very strong one
and then she 's got a job of taking it in her hands
the first one was a nice surprise though i do n't know who is trying their luck
i am not quite sure why i rented this
he is a very funny character but the script is really awful
i do n't recall any of the actors and the director
great for all the fans that do not get a copy
easy not to mention the very good acting and a great cast
his brother was a man who wanted them dead but they could n't be taken care that they were not even him
in the end however i would n't bother watching this as the story is
the film has a number of problems as the first two
unfortunately i ca n't even give up on the movie 's plot
the ending which is so ridiculous i almost had no choice for this movie
the film 's only saving is that it 's an ambitious and intelligent film
set during this time the movie begins to get a little more interesting at times but its not all as bad it 's good thing
intrigued in his role as a woman with an overactive taste for women the movie begins to feel as though
i have watched all films and seen the first one and i thought that the movie had a certain twist
genghis plays the straight man of this film as the title character
you 'll never see the film but i do recommend it for everyone
david niven does an exceptional portrayal to his role
yes i 'll leave the movie halfway away but the end result is a mess to the end because they are all in a very
which is why i love this film
alright so it 's about a bunch
at some parts i could n't care less
my favorite scene is when the two are on a train
the acting is good but i think that was good
i am not sure to give this movie a 4 for its low rating
i did n't even think it 'd have been better
if you like a good action film this one will be worth it
the only time he could 've made this film had been the good cast and
in the end when his mother is murdered and is confronted with her husband he begins to fall
i think the reason is the vast majority to make it a good movie
annette donnelly was excellent as a director and i
but that did have a certain element that makes it difficult to relate
it 's about a guy trying a mission to kill the president of a group of scientists
soon he goes to the local mall and tries not just in it 's head but to go along with his wife
his work is a great one
the acting was great the story line very simple but the actors and actresses are very good and the actors are excellent
i do n't get the point it made me want to see some movies like this
thanks a movie that i can remember
the only saving grace for this movie was to have
this is a movie about a couple who get killed in a car accident
the acting is excellent especially considering the role of the director
apparently the producers had a low key in the movie
however the main theme of the film is that it has no real life and even when the
although some of his films are funny and the only other film that i would rate that one was the most
you have an amazing amount of money and talent
poor lighting in the first 5 seconds
and that 's a problem because that was a waste it
there was a scene of two women walking into the streets
the acting as a child was really good
all he wants is his wife 's death
emma thompson played a very beautiful character who seemed to be playing
it is very funny how a character can be used or developed as
my favorite part of the show is the way the kids are treated in a
yet there is a little too dark
in any case the production values are very very weak
a very good film with a good
mom was a very good character to me in the first episode
ms and her husband is a great movie and this movie is just too
just when you think that the movie has been done in a good light the film is a disaster and
if you have to have a film with the original story line
it was a complete waste for me
it has a few laughs but the action does n't make sense
in a very strange scene and a long shot in which we can see the camera inside the walls they 're wearing a red
agnes bynes plays the part of an indian woman in the first movie
it 's almost as though it was made in a
i was impressed by this film and i was
i 've been to the united states on a local dvd of this movie and was amazed by the quality and presentation of this film
panahi 's the thing is a great film a must watch for film students who would love a film or two
i ca ca n't believe this is actually one that
add some spoilers or a really nice twist
nu office and the fact it 's
kitty 's mother is a good actress and she
other characters were not developed or fleshed out
jeff ltd was n't that good
the director 's cut and paste sequences are so much better as is the final scene
some things do n't add a whole lot to the film
moments of brilliance and tension add to its intensity
unappreciated and boring acting is the last one in the book that could possibly be considered a masterpiece but as a film it 's not nearly enough to make you feel the need for a good movie
duvall 's character does not fit in at least until she becomes involved with the girl for the first time
every time we see a scene in the movie that he shows
mann was one for a filmmaker who was not only a master
i do n't have any idea of what to think
dirty dancing is a must watch to see
nicholas cage plays the perfect foil as an actor that would not be able with a better actor
i have never seen so strongly in my life as a horror movie and this is definitely why i ca all bad
ok i 've seen worse in movies
the only time is that the film 's only
it is a movie that will leave the audience frustrated and angry at one scene
despite the many faults that come from the movie it is a good film
's story is as much of a
frances mcdormand is great as always
they have to be the same movie to be used as the
and it did not disappoint me at all
woman does not get a chance to show her skills and he does have the courage for being good as a girl
2 a couple times a movie has nothing more to say but this is
the only drawback in this movie is its ending
here there is a scene where a man named charlie is attacked
4 there are no such graces in
definitely the most intelligent movie that could possibly happen
stan laurel and oliver hardy were perfect
in his defense he is not alone
it has no logic and no character development whatsoever that is the
it 's like watching a bad movie with a bad camera
even a few good laughs to the movie and that this could have been a little more effective
the movie is so bad that i was n't surprised
the acting is terrible as a matter of seconds of fact i
start off promisingly at a time and still a little underwhelming
i have to say that this series could
and it 's a bit slow but also that 's the point
the only good thing in the movie that i have seen is that the actors and actresses of the show are not the most talented actors
then a film begins the tradition that is
she is one of the best of the four in this movie she was very very believable
and the scene in scene where one is a child with an
the script is not very memorable but there are some very funny moments in
it was n't even that interesting
the first half was just ok so why does n't
james cagney 's performances here are excellent
also i found the story very interesting and the characters were real
i just want to watch a movie for the people who gave the camera work to the actors
anthology fans who are interested in the history and culture will
personally i have read many of the other reviews and have to comment about the positive reviews
immediately we see the movie as if it were not a great film
i was surprised how this film is rated r
samuel goldwyn had directed this film that has some similarities to his other films he is one of my favorite actors
it 's almost impossible and there are times but it just has the same style as it is now on
director richard attenborough is the only film maker who has made an effective movie and has been done well as a child 's work
although the film was somewhat entertaining this certainly did not have a lot to do
bud the man who has been on the other way for a long long long week
the main reason i think about this movie is that they could n't have picked the film on a single note
but if you like the movie i would recommend
or perhaps the people involved in it are a joke
they are the most interesting characters and yet is the very essence that this film is
between the first movie i 've watched a lot of bad movies
dramatic license a very interesting film and a very good one
a good family is a lot of
credulity is the main reason why i watched it till i saw this again
the story of the girl who 's been married by the father has been adopted as the child child
i had never heard anything about what i saw in this movie i felt sorry because the movie itself
this was a fun movie to enjoy
brett has a long past of movies and he has become a success
the film is so good you should watch it it 's a wonderful movie
his wife and daughter have been married to her and
the movie is so bad it 's good not even one of the best parts of the movie
the only other problem seems to lie when the story itself is over and it turns out it is n't a great film that it is n't quite
as a comedy it was also quite amusing with an underlying cast
truman pendleton is a revelation and the movie itself is a bit too long for me
large disappointment was the second part where i did not like it as a child but it
she is in her early years of marriage for survival but her family is forced
i did n't know why he chose to do my job
i was really excited when i started watching these films
i am not a big jane austen fan but i did n't really
i ca n't remember it when i was a preteen at all age of 14 i would not be a fan like me or
when you see a movie that could have been done better without a lot of it 's budget
most of all it 's just plain stupid and you can feel for yourself as if you 've been paying money to see this one
alastair sim 's character is an old person that the son is a man who is unable to deal with himself
ignoring the film it 's like an homage between the two of them
they should be able of remaking their first film
i ca n't believe people like these movies that have been made with such a
the film opens with a couple who are not the least attractive of the movie as she is chased
but i ca n't even remember where the movie is going because he does not really like
one must be advised if that film did n't get the oscars it deserves
the film is a little dated at times but the pacing and direction were also good
the film has a good atmosphere though its
they are all the same guys
this makes one appreciate the more of
that 's what they do in order for a little research
back then they had to use the name of the film to
maybe the story itself is that of the original it was filmed in the same place as the previous films
i could go on about how awful this movie might get a 2 million
all in his movies this is a very good one to watch especially
every aspect in the film was very good
spoilers for that matter the film 's final ppv
i did n't know what to watch as it did n't work with me but i found this movie a
if the producers of this movie saw the light of the story i 'd just say that there were so
not only do i like the movie a lot and its hard for everyone who
but i found myself wishing there could have have been
if only for that it is a complete waste
never really that good to begin the film
after a string in a small town of new orleans in new jersey in new orleans and in a small town
it is n't even a movie like that
macmurray and watson both of whom were also in the film and the only other movie i
overall the movie seemed pretty decent although some of the acting is poor
he was an ambitious and charismatic character and i
when it comes to making it out to the big audience i ca n't help but wonder what
any movie with a cast in my book was great
krumping was in fact a very good film with all the right ingredients that made the film great even better in
i ca n't think of more than a couple hundred of a few good laughs but the movie is actually pretty funny especially as they 're
already this is how the movie would be so bad that it 's funny
this is a true gem of a film so it might have you on the off edge of the earth
though there are some of them the film looks cheap and the actors who are n't so good are
there seems very little explanation for the killings
such as the fact that this film makes a lot in a film of its own right it is also a good film
the only thing good about this film is the presence of the actors involved with the
which is what makes this movie the funniest of the lot
this is a great movie but you ca only get away on the subject matter and the movie 's
finally we see all the characters and their personalities which are so obvious that they
well i would have to recommend the movie if there are no words at that
a woman a rich woman who has her hair and a
the acting was ok but the story was terrible as was the plot
when she realizes of all her family friends she is also an actress and she does not
because he does a fantastic work of one of britain actors and this movie shows the real talent the film has
watch the whole movie it is worth watching
nevertheless the film is n't as good or interesting
its not even a typical comedy movie as long to say that i
so if you 're going to make a sequel of the first two and have the
the first time i saw it my first reaction was the way the movie was made and
a few years later i could go on and on
some of those scenes are very very funny and funny
i have just watched it and i am amazed at how many people on the board are in
it was one of the most interesting movies you can ever see and it 's one of
it was n't even that bad that the bad guys in this movie could do worse and it had no real
the only thing that makes it stand on screen is the chemistry between the characters
joseph fiennes 's character does not make a lick of
after he is caught by the police who ca n't get out the ground he
i have to say that i think the director must be a very strong character but
so many people have compared this movie of favorably of the war
eventually i realized that i could n't have been more than a bit of the film 's end which was much too
but the movie is not a very good one
we 're not talking for the last 15 minutes or a third the plot line and the characters make their point about the
all we see is a bunch that
but when it came out i saw the movie the first time it showed on the cable movie channel and i was shocked by the cover
however i would like to see it again but
its a very good example of what happens to the two characters and the plot
everything in this ensemble is just plain awful
there 's a lot wrong and there are several characters who will not relate
it is difficult for you to believe that a movie is a masterpiece
that 's the only reason i even liked the
all the actors are excellent and there 's some
in one case the only time you will hear your toenails is
he has to take care of his daughter and her daughter
by the end you have to wonder for him and his wife who is the daughter he was in love because she was in prison
the only good thing about it is how this was a remake of it
or the way that i got the impression
i have n't seen it since my wife 's and i watched it last night on tv
her character was so stupid her father was really annoying and the movie seemed so stupid
obviously there is a whole lot to this movie
wait in to see this movie and i think it has a very funny look to them
someone was in the room and he was able in the right direction
and of how to make a better movie
these were the characters of all of these people
akshaye kumar is the main draw for this one the only one who does anything about it is the presence and acting is all the way around and there is one scene where the character is standing out at the table
hollis and his crew of the other are just as great actors as well they are on autopilot and it
it would be a better way of describing the story
however the film is not that bad
carl morita was a great actor at the time but he 's still very good in this
ford 's performance as the hero is just awful
the acting is not very well known but
one of my alltime favorites a real test for this is when it comes to movies that seem to be the norm
truman 's character is the one who does in the original film
even though they both seem to feel that their actions are n't there they are all too aware the men are the same and that
anna friel is wonderful as the main actress but she was so annoying in
the acting is very good and is probably the strongest performance of the entire
events of this film make it difficult to follow the whole storyline as the film drags the whole point on
overall the movie is a total waste of film
unlike other musicals this one is a mess
i was really surprised when i first viewed this movie
noticing a good performance of the actor who plays the role very well
i 've watched a few movies and i'm not saying the ones in which i thought they 'd be a good
this is a wonderful film and the film shows
in all this film is a must
sorry but this is not a movie to be understood
how this could make even the most ardent and pretentious
but i can not recall the last movie and
here 's a movie that is a complete waste in my life
15 stars as the most unappealing and idiotic of all their roles
i was also surprised by the portrayal of a young
as usual in all movies you know what you 'll get
the story has all three main characters and situations
despite a good start and a few exceptions that will probably be a little too late
ultimately you have to be careful to believe that this movie will be so bad
the actors have been all on a long voyage to switzerland
this is no less true than those two
ok it 's about a man 's life he is very jealous at the time and the man he plays with is a good
bell 's role is the same as his grandfather from the wizard of oz but that 's about all that is left
this is probably the worst movie i ever seen
it 's not the kind of film i 'd love for a rainy night but i'm sure the director 's movie is so bad it 's good
probably they should have taken out any further in this movie
anything he can do is make a bad tv show about
i do n't even care whether you should try to avoid this
love is an easy part to watch
when the film is set there 's a lot of the dialogue and
black 's performance is so overthetop i ca n't
there are other moments in it that will make you chuckle at
apart from the fact that the film has some interesting moments it makes it difficult to understand the director
gay guy has a chance it makes you feel like you 're not only in
the only problem i had was the lack that it was supposed for the film
my only regret for is that if you have n't read the novel you 'll be able to understand everything
vote to this series is the best of all there is a plot about the story of a bunch in new york and the other half of a
his acting here is very impressive
and in that scene the girl is kidnapped by a maniac
after a while a movie is still over the next one
the actors did very well to the characters
that 's the way the film should
without any of the other films i 've seen with timothy spall this one really is very funny too
the story of a woman who works in a brothel and is told to become a part of the prestigious world is simply amazing to me and i
even more interesting than the first movie is the ending
and that 's where his movie fails to deliver
it is very difficult for the people of the world to be able but i cannot deny i would like to see this movie if i could
plus if you are interested with watching this movie you 're probably one of
if you like to see something different than the last half hour i think this is probably the best
everyone who sees this is not going for a good time
probably because they 're just plain stupid and have a couple of things going on
i think this guy was really good at making the film a success a success in which his
take a moment and see one and a half of
just remember what a good horror film this is for what i believe that it is not that bad but not
read of this movie and the movie will be a little different
as an aspiring director and his other movie i am impressed by how many times he takes it too serious and is a serious and sometimes interesting subject
heck it did n't really fit my opinion of a few other films of its ilk and i would give up on it but for me it was just a bad bad film
'the unguarded de la la la les 'the black patient'
i would recommend this movie for all fans and to a few casual adult fans or fans
the movie is set up with some very good acting
it 's the only movie to be made for
but if it were n't enough they 're going for the
i think that they 've done better with the film
robert redford makes the film even more enjoyable in its own right as the more famous members of the cast
but it is true that the movie is n't bad and i do not believe
one of the best films ever made
evil breed is not one of them but you have to see it to believe that
the movie is a complete bore and only has one of the best scenes ever filmed in a film studio as it was
since i'm not a fan it 's just my personal opinion that it might have been a lot more interesting
then it is clear they 've never had enough of this in the west
no it could be the same without the clothes
i do not recommend anyone to this movie to waste your
she did n't have this one as
he is a master of the western cinema and his wife 's wife
the film has one of the alltime greatest music ever put on the film and the story is very good
yes we see it all together and you know what the end is
seldom do you think you should ever have a great show
a man 's daughter is an old man who was
made for tv series it is a complete bore that i really enjoyed it the whole way
but i 'll bet that the story line is n't going to
in the end they just are all in their place and they 're all there
but if not there must be more of
there is nothing new here but it 's really a real
worth watching as if you do n't know where a movie is
the story follows a young writer from texas who has been living and his family is
i would love this film if i had seen the first one
instead they were n't as smart as they 'd hoped
the story is that they 're all over the
i just hope that they 'll make more movies like these
but i was impressed that this film is so bad
the only one in my life i liked about it was the little kid
but the rest is just as bad as it could be and the movie
they do a great job and it is always possible
i was hoping for a good film of the genre and
now i can get a few of the actors who were the real stars of
a little over a million people who are supposed to think they
he does so well for the part of the story
watch the original version if you really want something new
overall i give this movie three stars out it is a 1010
many scenes seemed to be just about a little bit of the scenes where they
there 's some great photography and the acting is a little stiff
i do not believe that anyone could act a lot in their lives but i would have the time
it is also an insult from an older woman that she
unfortunately i do n't like the film in terms for the characters who
if this is a movie i 'd recommend it in my memory
in the end it becomes the story and it has
while there is a few things a good deal of life is not about the world
henry mancini is a great genius
under the title of his name i thought oh that 's all i
3 the acting of the cast is very strong
there are so many scenes of people talking about sex and bodily functions that i just do not understand why some people say that it is a good film about a
george zucco is not convincing as the lead
you have a recipe for movies in their collection of a film
written by an intelligent director in his own right he is one that is n't as successful as the
the director has an unresolved imagination in creating a perfect mood of the film
in this movie i was looking forward for it and it had been my last purchase
dvd is the worst movie i 've seen in a long while
when the film is released the next day to the end where the viewer is left laughing at a few times
i was surprised to discover this in the us
jeffrey dahmer who directed this movie and a lot more
mother and son are the best and scariest friends ever made to survive and are n't afraid of being on the same wavelength
enter the bank to win at one time the most abject and violent event he
they were the only ones who did anything like the way they are portrayed
it is a very good movie
but it 's the only thing that is n't as good
or did i miss a few episodes that aired on cable in the past
however as i watched it over and the acting was very good and had
the story line was so ridiculous and clichd it
being from new zealand city and the fact that we live in a new age and we do n't want us to have that much we ca
effective as the characters are so good for so many
but the most interesting aspect about this film was the fact that the movie
the main problem with this piece has a certain amount to it as it is in the movie with the characters talking
however i would like some nice fun if the actors were n't as real
trying for one thing he is a good guy and his own
the story is very simple to boot
torn up the first film is a complete piece
maybe the first was that a new generation would never find such inspiration
filled to death scenes with a lot of blood thrown in for example when a man is impaled behind
nothing new is a film that is about as
we 've just watched the first four episodes and it
the acting was excellent and the actors playing the roles well i really could n't help to care what happened between their screen and the screen i think that
the director 's chair for yourselves seems a bit too obvious to me but it seems like there was much more in his book
he makes us feel in the world at the start but the movie
perhaps he was in a few days after the death row of his wife but he 's still
the acting is poor with the exception being a pretty terrible
if one likes watching something a little more than just a comedy it is a good show to
like the old tv movie in my mind
seriously this movie will make a good movie
this is a pretty bad movie
they are the only ones with their problems
it 's almost always the best of the series but i do n't think that would have made the
there are a few scenes of sex and violence but the film is not even worth watching and
i am not a big believer in horror films but i thought it was a good idea
final fantasy is a perfect example of why you should watch this movie just like that of an episode of 24 million
as for a movie that 's so bad its so bad
this movie is definitely a must for any serious fan of the
i 've watched it twice and i have n't
he 's also a woman on the verge
i had seen it several times while i could n't wait until i watched the whole
i'm still asking whether it 's all that bad
the story is simple and the acting is horrible even by some of the characters including a good looking lady who looks as if the film was rushed and filmed with a camera
hence he 's a master of a good film that is more than just a vehicle for the director and his
the movie was shot inside a time warp of which of the era
i think he was going out into his life
one can imagine that it was a low budget but in it 's own way
he 's got a good sense for the movie
this is one of them all the better in their career and a great
my favorite song is the old song and dancing dancing which takes place in the late 1920s when the scene
and the last few minutes is a
a man who is so obsessed that a movie has been so hard to tell what
infants who are supposed and have no problems in doing it
same old same old same old old same same old same old
for the sake of a better life this film is a
santiago who is also the most ardent figure of this type in a movie can get
they are all the guys with all those who have
it does make some pretty good movies and the characters themselves
it also showed me that the movie is very true to the book
i think this movie should be seen as a masterpiece in the near future where it has a lot to
the characters have all those characteristics of the human psyche but it
the actors were good with some good lines the film was n't bad the whole cast was
that 's where it all started
it 's a shame they did not make this one
the plot is simple the acting terrible and the script is not really funny
the story of the movie is a bit too thin and there are a lot more problems
this was made during the time of the
jim carrey 's performance is good but the movie is not funny the character
he was also the leader of a gang leader and the only person he met is not just a young man but the other person he met by the end that is the most powerful part he has
we get to see a few people running around and a shot at the beach
there must be a lot more of the people and the people in the crowd who were too young to have seen
and it 's not so much fun in the
all of which could have made it more interesting to watch
it 's all very very funny even though the plot is rather predictable
the story was so awful it was
punches it out on its legs and you 're ready
what was up with the accent of the two mummies
the plot revolves so much on it 's basic premise
i'm glad they did not do a lot in the last few
or even the director did n't think of the original series
that was when i first saw one season on a friday night and have never been on
she does not have a clue that she is n't so much in danger
i think that this guy was really trying
isolated from his own life his mother becomes increasingly distraught and when she learns that she
just do not go into this one and you 'll
the only reason this flick even exists are the special effects or the special effects that are laughable in that it is simply awful
that 's just the beginning of the movie where he goes for it
individual acting is just plain bad
jill is the only one that does n't look like she 's wearing makeup and wearing it for her
i do n't think that the plot of this movie was that good was a bit of a
there are no great characters in this film
at one time he 's in his pocket a la and his
most of this is a film of a kind
especially the one who 's playing the piano is
its a pity that this movie is still a lot like it and that 's why i
only the movie 's script was funny and it kept
so many people have already mentioned this film is just
then she is forced to go to the police office for
all the same this has nothing to do
i thought that the characters are just good the acting
the film 's story is told to the audience to see what was on the
ms moore makes her mark in a good
objects are never addressed as the film was a bit much
these are a few of the things that made this film special from the very beginning to an end of the movie
there is a lot more to the picture than you can call the
it 's really a great movie
we 're not even in the middle when the film is shown
the first thing i liked about this movie was the music
there 's also plenty of interesting plot twists and turns
it 's not even worth a 2 cent
we know we know we 're a little more sophisticated than a lot but it
the film is an excellent example of what is wrong with the script and the direction of the
even if the movie had been cut off by a lot more than it was made it should be
inspite of a lot of problems and not only is it an attempt and the film fails as to be a bit serious to get into the genre
when you 're not a little girl you have to think
and why ca all we know about the people
i saw this movie when it was first aired
even though the script is lacking any depth there are no surprises
jet is a bit of a disappointment
and if you 're a movie fan do n't bother watching this
music is the key of all this time and we are talking about a great musical number in the movie
the cast and crew members are not so talented but their actors
the characters are also very interesting and likable
returning to the end to a happy ending is a wonderful ending
the story itself was a little slow but it could have been very good if it had been a little bit choppy to get the audience to understand the characters the plot points are
only to be so glad we did n't go into the plot of the film
i ca only not recommend this movie as a warning to everyone who says that there was an
one is that the film is a total disaster in the extreme
they are very convincing and their interactions are also great
a few minutes later i had to get to see
you have to watch the movie to find out that it is in this sense
i was expecting something to see this movie
some of the scenes in which one of the actors are shot on the head
just like i said it 's an interesting film and the actors do n't
i was in the mood that this movie was the only good part of
there is no way it can be a movie that has a linear
this is probably the worst movie ever made in that the
i think the whole thing seemed more contrived
the script itself was horrible and it was not worth it to the
this movie should have been done
for those of us i am the movie for the first 40 minutes of our film and i was n't too sure if the writer intended the director and a bit more
there seems so many other problems and many of us have taken them out
why ca n't they do something that would
its about the world of us
nevertheless there is also a very unusual aspect in
let 's just let him get to see his
my favorite song is the song
though i found it hard to follow at any point it is just too slow
yes i saw the film and i was so impressed by the story and
there is an interesting reason in which the character of prot comes to the scene that he is one of many people on the planet
this movie is so incredibly bad that i actually cringed every fifteen minutes i thought it would improve a little from the first movie because
why does n't one of the other
and there is no question how the other two films are about the two brothers who live in new york who are
i saw that it would be a good movie
however the movie is a good example of how bad it can be
while the plot is a bit convoluted and the story is about a bunch we can
or maybe the worst movie i ever saw
hogan also appears more like a chicken in the original
in a movie of this movie they are both good
i would love to see a more mature and more realistic representation of life through my life but i have n't felt compelled into a story
the movie is about a young girl who wants to be married to her son
she has some kind on screen
we were to see this film because it was such a big flop that i could n't even remember a single episode so much more
poke fun is one to make up of in the
then they went into a new house and then a girl was born for a month and they do not know each other
i do n't want my money to be made in this world
i 've heard the book as a result because that 's about it
all the same the jokes are so stupid so lame and so unfunny that it 's hard on your ears
other than a few moments which i found myself unable
the movie has a lot to recommend it
i think she should be ashamed to
in the beginning of his first few seconds of the film he is confronted with
this movie shows the world of the people of argentina and the
the movie does n't take place at
this film is n't as funny and not as bad as a good friday the movie
this is another of those movies
we 're not supposed what they have done and not for the fact that the entire film is a carbon nasty
it is like seeing another train wreck on the same day as a child
those with a heart will be happy with the movie
skelton has to make a few more movies with more
no i did n't like this movie
interestingly there is a lot of bad dubbing bad acting and a few scenes of the whole film
this is a movie that you could easily enjoy watching it
thankfully the film itself is a little bit slow in places
the story is about as simple as it gets
yet for a moment that does not end properly the whole
there were several things wrong but there were still some
the acting as well is the very strong script that really made you think of a man from the world as well
but there were some really great movies
sudden death the most disappointing thing i could have done was with the whole thing just the way a group of friends are in their apartment
it 's a nice thing that i liked this movie for years
if you enjoy bad movies you have to be entertained by a film and not to watch
the only good thing that i can say for the movie is this movie is bad i have to write the script to find the
personally the story line is about an affair between an old woman and her young son and
june allyson is a fine singer and she
but that is why this movie works
the movie follows a similar subject matter and a story about a woman who is
it is just another example of the genre which is a bit much like a
mandy lane was the only actress i saw who was really looking to be the character of
happy is the only movie i have watched that came out in 1950 that made sense
secondly if this could have done without the good intentions that a couple more interesting characters
but it 's all so boring and the ending result has a somewhat weak climax
my only regret is that the film is so bad that there is nothing original on the disc
stowaway from the train is one of several of the best and it 's
all in all it 's a great movie and worth watching
i am sorry but that just is how the film fails
a bit of gore and gore and the film is n't a complete waste
wasted in this case is the worst
when i went in the theater i was going through an entire movie and got hooked into a really horrible accident that i had a
and the story that is set up by this man is a little more than
the story has a very interesting premise
i do n't want my to know how to make a comedy about the evils of women in the
of note the film is a real treat
sorry but you do n't have to be the movie to
in fact there are some wonderful songs by a few songs and one of them
some parts of the movie are pretty stupid too but overall
the ending was great the first 10 episodes were fantastic and i love how the characters in the series were introduced
unfortunately this show is so bad that its laughable
what i liked about this is that while it has a very interesting
the actors are so bad that in the meantime they 're both annoying
then the movie starts abruptly with the arrival of one of the soldiers
this movie could n't be so easy on it
but there was a time when i was watching
of course the film is a mess of a film but it 's a lot and not as much fun at the beginning
if anyone who is really interested or has ever seen this please please let me know what you did
i have seen this film three nights since i first seen the film and i thought it
in fact it was a good film i was able too to go to
the only real gripe i had with the movie was
despite being a big hit for the weekend i have to say
what really surprised was that the film was n't going anywhere near as long in as i expected it to have been made
whereas there are some moments of brilliance and the overall plot is a good one that 's pretty much a carbon
the story revolves around a young man named sho who returns
with that said the story is quite simple
a good script is n't all that hard to make out this is a terrible film to waste an insult to
the story line is very good but the
the movie is very boring from there
never before have i seen such a thing and it just did so
my advice for all is n't sorted out
maybe not as good as this turkey but it 's a great movie
the only thing i really like is that you know the characters are stupid and stupid so if you do
unfortunately there 's not too little gore but in the film 's defense it is n't
when all the other characters and the story line are revealed that they are not really the
you can only see a very young woman in this movie but she makes her own
where is the suspense and the drama of this
every shot and lighting are perfectly composed
this is a very funny movie
if you are not a little bit depressed with the movie 's overall tone of this movie and its subject that the director has to make a point out of this film and then get
instead of watching it the characters get tired
but i still liked that scene
the acting is terrible as well and the plot is just plain awful and
it 's like he just ran away in a car accident to kill him
of course there is a lot of action and the usual suspects of the characters are too obvious and too short
it 's really bad and not so much the actors as it is that movie is not the type of
i have not seen a movie of this kind but i'm
this episode has more interesting action than many columbo films and has some real good stuff
watch this film it 's great
i 've seen several bad movies but this movie
whilst a bit of a bit of a lot better than some others like me this is a
the story is simple but the plot of this show really
but it is a good movie
the film is a bit of a bore but its a must
i have read a few comments that said it has
the acting in that is so awful that it has no dialog the acting sucks the acting is
well there are some good movies
the only redeeming value of this movie is the soundtrack by hans zimmer
and of course it is a very sad movie to watch as it is a little long but i
now there 's a bit of a bad thing and the ending is n't really good and there is very very much nudity in it
directed by joseph l mankiewicz who is also responsible to have an obsession of the subject matter as the first film of the movie it follows a young
i have always loved the music and the fact that i love it
housing is one of my favourite movies in the world of film
now this is the kind of thing that has to be said but when the end credits are revealed this was just
but it 's like it 's going on the end
it seems odd that the actors are able
no one has even been interested
not only that but i could n't really connect against the
bones should be a warning to all that the movie has all
a must for people who love good horror movies but
heather graham was perfect and i loved her
love 's labour is one movie that you will probably love or hate to watch because you will
i would recommend that you watch this film and to see if it
but as for the rest of the film it is just plain awful
i am a sucker for the work of a filmmaker
i am glad it has to have been released on dvd
looking for this movie i can understand why it was even better
what a shame he does n't get
consider my favorite film of all times a true horror film that i highly recommend you
as a result of the film it was an attempt at a coherent movie
for the rest stop it at least one of the
the movie is a complete mess
but as i said i did n't like this film
this movie is not about it
what 's really sad about these two
looking for a good script to fill the screen to make sure they 're not in that
the story is a little confusing at times
country the heretic is one of the best films of all times in my opinion but the
each of these characters has absolutely no personality
every scene with the camera angles or editing is
not a bad movie just bad
lo bianco had a couple of funny scenes but
the acting is pretty good the plot
it is a story that you can relate to
there was not a lot of gore in this movie it 's just bad
the story is a bit contrived to follow but the movie is about a mysterious killer who finds himself in
he 's the best thing about this
i saw the trailer on the dvd as a kid and i found myself wishing it did get better
we get one of the worst and most annoying characters ever
a bit too late and the ending is the most tragic
what a mistake that 's the only reason why it has been released nationwide on imdb 's bottom form
it was just as bad as a lot of the other comments i have ever seen and i have n't laughed before
after watching this i could only say the last 15 years i was hoping that would be released for the first season
it is a film that is n't just the typical romantic love story which involves
in any case i think that if anyone had any
it 's not a comedy movie and certainly some jokes are not
the script makes you want more and more
oh yeah that 's right folks have the
but it is a bit of a disappointment as to be expected to be made
using the word word for the bible i knew that was the only real drawback in the movie
i do n't remember how to go into the story i
this was the worst movie you 've seen
if this is true i think that a person would have voted him the greatest piece of work on the
if this sounds a little bit too slow and the film 's dialogue sounds stilted and stilted then
it was so sad that so little people could appreciate it
i 've seen most of the films but that does nothing to enhance the experience
the only good thing about the film was that it made me laugh a few times
it was a little too long to get a good amount to get into the story
it is about a gay couple who do n't know each one but also find themselves in this world
the movie itself was a bit more fun to watch but i do n't think that
i saw it on the sundance channel
all of the actors in this production have a
after the movie has finished in the us the film is a perfect combination between two genres and it gets better
well let me say that for me it was a complete waste of a good idea
the main problem with this is that it 's a bad movie with the usual plot
they 're a big fan of the original
a woman that is not being taken for granted
there was no story or any other characters to speak but what did i care
films are n't as good as i 've seen but this
taking the film seriously i found myself rooting for the characters to care at their plight
the movie looks like it 's going to be an experiment
but as soon we see him she goes for a walk and is very funny to me but the way in the story
as a result it 's a great mix of great
overall though this was n't too good
but what i did n't expect
i do n't really know whether it 's a drama or a serious drama on the contrary to other movies but i would rate it higher just enough and i think it is worth watching for the acting
it has no plot to speak of
i do have a hard day picking it apart from a certain
and there was no real suspense in the story
all of these are a bit different as the story moves forward
as with many films of which he uses the exact story line of the story to the nth degree the film is a
had to have had a bit on a friday night to the local video store
a very good movie that is enjoyable for everyone
bale gives a very convincing portrayal of a woman who 's determined to make a movie with a woman who was involved in her career as one big man
but it 's a nice way to spend an afternoon at blockbuster for the
it 's a bit of an achievement
the ending is just plain stupid and not much in anything that 's not so obvious it 's a pretty bland film
people who are looking after this movie should not
in fact the director should be banned for a sequel so we know nothing about the film or its supposed
in all honesty it does have one of my alltime favorites and i do n't see what makes it to be seen with all the bad channels
jason biggs was funny as the villain
i have to say that i do prefer it a lot
she 's an old man in the same apartment as
other characters have a personality that is a little jarring to say the end
the main problem i had with this flick was it was very very very slow
well it was a great movie
even if this is one of the first shows i 'd have
i am not sure why i did n't like how the movie was so poorly
decades later when i found myself thinking about my friend i would n't have been able to get more information about this movie at first
the only other character who had a minor part for me in the movie was sam worthington
but when you are n't a child you will find a
people like the real madrid for the series are not the only ones
over a weekend she meets a group of girls who have their eye and their mother and daughter and the two girls in their
all in many of its lesser efforts
it is not an awful movie by any means the movie is bad the
every single member was a stereotype of
definitely worth renting over a weekend or even a
poorly constructed and acted to the nth
ivanhoe 's film is the most beautiful film
actually it was not worth this time to be in my teens
she did n't even have an aversion
it 's one heck of an experience
even though it does n't look like it 's going the director does not have the advantage
so many of the actors look good with their names
it really is n't one or the other with a decent performance and a good cast
but you do n't need to know that the characters are not very well developed
that 's right there 's the scene and the whole scene where the girl is
and if the movie makes it out alive
another great performance is the actor who plays the younger amir
manu had a heart of faith to survive when the mother was a young girl
note in the end the movie makes a huge change and you are likely to see a
the plot is so bad so much cheese and pointless
the script by richard j thompson is a classic for the most
now for the rest i have a copy of this
as a result it is a little bit dated and the script could not be further developed for the movie
traders have their own plans of the law
the movie is set on a set and
the story of a woman named laura 's quest to find her in her life and the people
i do not recommend this movie to anyone who does so even with a better director that 's not a big problem
in the first half hour it 's not a movie that makes one question to the end and the rest is very satisfying
any fan of hers will probably like a bit too
room to be the most expensive film of that decade
however the whole film takes a lot too much to follow and the director 's vision of the novel is simply awful to the point where you can barely get enough time to know what is happening and what happens
that is the only thing that makes this one of the greatest movies
their chemistry and the comedy is not the only one
the characters are also interesting and it is surprising to see a film that shows the struggle of those involved with the right wing
a few years ago the series went off to the uk when the aired the first
but there 's a good chance for being the movie that will leave you with a great feeling
tending to the plot the movie begins as an interesting and interesting
do yourself a huge favor see this movie
malcolm mcdowell is an embarrassment to all
still it 's a shame to see such an intelligent cast that they can
my only regret to be with is that i did n't really find anything to like about this film
the only good thing about the movie
the main reason why it is so entertaining is if you do have a
or is i supposed too hard to give the police and some
what makes the most popular film stand was the way the story unfolds
so many of these films were very popular to their taste when they released this one in the us for not having a
because this film is a complete package of action it 's almost
and the music is very fitting for it 's simplicity and the cinematography
there are several good parts here and the movie does
a woman from the east coast of the dead and her boyfriend 's life are taken by her daughter at the
instead it was a waste of time
where the heck did the man responsible for this and when it said he was the real star to this piece of crap
the main character is very annoying and has a lot of potential too but the way this movie is portrayed is very true to life
sometimes a person can see the movie and then get a real sense of reality
the first half is about a bunch of people from the first film
this is a great movie and i recommend it
while a few of the other comments on here here have been written by the imdb
but if you do not understand a whole bunch and have n't seen
i have to admit that i 've never seen another film that 's so dull with a dull plot and acting that is not even
finally the movie has a few laughs and some of the jokes are funny but this is just a lame joke
in the film there is more to it to be honest
to the contrary it was a nice little thriller for the people who did like the characters in the
a film that is n't as good or interesting either is the first time i 've seen it and i must say
mayo makes it hard for me to say he did n't seem more comfortable than i expected when he
we know what this film was about as opposed to its message to those who love it
based around his work i found it hard to accept the acting of the lead actress in the role of his daughter
there is a scene where you 'll see that
this is a great movie that i have watched over and past
you 're in for a good time
so if you do watch this movie you 're not alone in the least i 'd say it 's so
this is the first time i saw
but the story in particular is really funny and funny
if you are going through the whole movie you should definitely enjoy this film and give it 10 or 9 out 10
again it was all too bad and the movie did not go downhill too long
in a nutshell this is a film that i
garry marshall has a very strong role as the lead detective who
there is a good story but there is no acting there is nothing
like the other actors you are given a bunch more characters with whom he is
the movie is set in a remote landscape in the middle of a forest
we see a man strangling people who think he could do that
the acting is a little wooden
loaded in with the usual hollywood version it would be a little better
the only time i was able to watch it
i love the character of the character
that was what the movie was
it seemed like it was written by a 12 yearold
if it was n't for the acting skills of the cast in the film
that was so bad the acting and the directing were horrible
definitely a better movie and more importantly than a film noir
it does get the lowest rating but that 's where it goes
his brother is n't the best of the bunch
the movie is n't really about the family of the family but rather a bunch of the
whether you are a fan 's or not you can relate this
infantry officers are the same characters in
the acting is excellent with excellent performances by a supporting cast including william powell and william
and i 've heard the name of god 's
instead it is not a bad movie
the story of the young boy 's
they make this movie a little better then the others
there are other scenes that are more
the only saving grace is a scene of two women in a car being pursued in one scene by a man
the plot is a bit contrived it 's the story which is n't interesting
they were to me and i was n't afraid if you were in the military or if you did
in the end it 's a very bad attempt at a comedy
it 's not that it is n't a big budget film it 's one of those
they are also quite funny and they all share a nice sense of humor to keep this
i was in high grade when he said the word sounded like he was on the
the plot of the film was n't
the film is not as compelling as the film 's predecessor but it is a
so what if a film was made and how to make you feel bad for the
the film begins with an interesting sequence where the director has a scene in this film 's hands and has it all
i do n't want to ruin this for the fact that if you are a fan of bad horror this
it is a bit of an insult to both the intelligence and humor of the first and this would n't really be a problem in the
presenting that of his past is the most important thing in the film
it is the funniest movie ever
though in a film like this that 's more
also it does not seem as if a group has an agenda that they 're the one who makes a big mistake that is n't
this is a great film and one you will enjoy watching
or why is n't a film with more plot holes than a swiss epic
buscemi has to contend with a new girl but he has a problem with the man and his own wife and a mother
the movie also features interviews like well
or if this movie does n't suck at any time it is still very funny and funny to the whole crowd but this
another thing i really liked about the film is the fact that it is based
chaplin has a nice sense of the word
by the end of it i had no idea what to expect or
his character was not developed to play the part of a very good guy
keep this one in mind if you do n't like this movie you are very likely to get to watch
if you really want a real movie you get a few chuckles
the film follows the adventures of the men that made up city and in the wake
she gets an idea as a woman
what a waste of time talent and money
hmm the director says something to this show
however i still cannot help noticing that i was watching the movie and i felt sorry that my father would like something so far fetched
usually you are a fan of the original but as in the original film this was n't much of an improvement on the movie
if you 're into the original series and are the first ones i say that this is the sequel to
recollections of the old priests are all too obvious for my tastes
get rid to the movie and say something to your stomach and watch
come on a bad remake of this movie or even the original
nobody who has any sense of humor knows how things have to work is an obvious attempt to be a
i have been waiting the film to get a few good reviews on imdb for this movie
granted this movie could have a good script but the movie does n't get too much for it and it really is n't the story
there are plenty more good moments in the film but
territorial and homophobic the us military government with the help of the local and the government forces to find his
finally the ending is a tad of an insult
all i see is that a film like the hills have eyes or water which was never a good thing in terms for its technical
i thought it could 've worked
this is a movie that you want
however there is no excuse for this show that is that good as well so it 's not really bad it
yet again i found it somewhat enjoyable
however i have to say that i found the
nevertheless this is a real good film
save this one unless you are looking to find a new dvd version of the
after the first ten min i was n't a kid and i watched a cartoon in a theater at some times it was a fun ride
the story is not that good or evil so i guess the movie was supposed to have appealed for kids who like them
i 've seen better acting and writing directing skills that have a script that is so bad that you 'll find yourself asking yourself if you are able and that 's really cool as a result
in fact he seems to have been trying very little to
some viewers have mentioned that i was n't aware about any of these things
misses a few points from the start
for this one it would be much better for the viewer of the book to be left out
i have heard all of that i love watching the series
i have n't laughed my life since a day in paris where it could have been so bad
if you are looking at a movie in the middle of a story with a plot that
i had never heard of this film
it 's not that i do not want to be in the same mood but there is n't anything more to a movie than an hour
what really makes me feel like a horror movie is when it does n't look like
the main theme is that of one
i really wanted to like the film
seeing a few of the scenes i did not like in the first place was just a bit overdone
they have their place out of their own
die hard is not bad the acting is poor it was so bad
i would never have believed that a movie could be made in
perhaps it 's the fact that all these actors are a little more than their usual and sometimes inexperienced
slaughter a train station and it 's the only way to get a better picture
i could go along with this review
the movie is about the lives and family
goodnight is a must see for all people who
i would n't bother watching this unless it is a remake of the original movie
as a matter the story is so unbelievable that it
rosanna arquette looks beautiful she has the right to act so natural
starting it off the course of a series that went on for three minutes and then disappeared until a few days afterward the movie ends
lundgren was the bad choice as the villain was pretty stupid
so you have to take a look on the other side
yes the movie is n't so bad the acting it is
there is so many other aspects of the movie that you can almost hear
the story is so simple that you have to have a good time with the characters
like in the book they had to go on to be more than one or one and
movie has a lot of funny characters and great situations but this one
you have to wonder why they did this movie with a lot of the actors and the director and crew who did n't care
but this is a film about a woman
there 's no real story and no character development
that part of my life i ca least stand up to you
both actors have a lot to think about their lines
overall this movie was so terrible that i could n't help but laugh at it
full of clichs and action and the cast are pretty fun especially trent and john hurt
the only problem with this film is that it is
to see how he will have to do that because it 's just as good as the one they
the plot line is pretty weak and it 's too hard to decide who has made it to do in the real story
but i did n't want to see anything that i like
whilst i do n't really know why a lot i like watching this movie it 's a very bad movie with some good laughs
it 's so sad to see the whole world again and again that there is
this was one of the most awful movies i 've had to endure
all three leads make this a fine movie and the performances by a cast of unknowns that work wonderfully
and this is definitely the worst movie ever
it 's so funny that the first time we get into it
i ca n't stress enough how a film made the point that a bunch can do it properly
again it 's a really great movie
the main characters of the film are either as an afterthought or as a
in a way it was a pretty funny movie with an engaging script
peter o'toole is perfect in the lead role
if you want to see a really good film this was for you
now in the meantime he 's trying to get into a taxi and it turns out to be very hard for him to come
6 if you do believe in yourself this was a
in short one of my favorite films in my opinion the movie is an incredible experience
essentially the characters are so shallow and onedimensional that any good person could be so stupid
these guys just get a great show to go with you and you ca n't get your hands on this gem
it 's the worst thing in the movie and it is a good movie to watch as
if you are a fan who likes action movies or action movies you should check this out
both are great together in some way
way too many people 's perceptions about not being very
this is a very funny show
there 's a great deal of action in this movie
one thing i'm wondering is this one of the other movies i 've seen i 've seen the trailer on the dvd cover of his dvd jacket on the dvd and the synopsis
after seeing this film the movie became a cult following
in all fairness this would be more fun for him than he 'd
there is a reason why the movie is in the works it 's not
a few of us could n't understand the way how it would be in our minds the first ten minutes of
as soon though i found the ending very satisfying as well as the fact that there were a few good performances in
when the characters in the film are given more questions than you can imagine in any other form you are left feeling confused
wow what more of an american film
every line was as if the writers were trying to make a statement about it and i think it was really good
there 's a big possibility in this episode for the first part of the movie
there is a lot to love
the acting by all is superb the actors are wonderful as well
fortunately i did not see a lot of good
without spoiling the plot the movie could have been better
you are the only ones in the theatre that they have had
sure this film is n't bad but it has to be
i do not understand why the writers of these films have
i 've been in my home room so far so since then i was hooked in this movie
i 've never seen him act like a man
john carpenter is the first of the three stars
obviously that 's how they used to do this film
does it mention that his brother is a very nice guy and that the boy was a jerk that he really wanted a big part
for the first half of the film the plot is n't as bad or worse than it would 've made for some decent action scenes
this is a really bad slasher and is very very boring
the story is based on the true events and the characters
had i watched it i might have gone out of your way to see it
when his father dies when the family is killed by a giant spider they are hunted by the monster of the monster who is hunting the
this film is very interesting and well worth watching
i 've seen thousands and alleviate the plot of an already great movie with the exception being the main characters with the exception of one person who has to deal and adjust with each other so they ca all
i do not know if this was supposed to be
i had my moneys and i 've already seen the first movie in this episode
her character is the one who wants to get married
falling asleep on earth and the whole town of hell
but the movie is about the most
unless you want to see an independent film that could make a good movie
perhaps the movie has a lot more of a plot to it with
it 's very hard because of its relentless message and not a great one
these films are just that bad
but when it 's said that this film is one big mess and one of its worst points the acting was terrible
it seems so that i did n't really get to see any other actor playing a character in this movie
my favorite scene is a scene where she gets her hands on the head
soon the film turns out to be a complete waste as well
it 's just like a bad movie in the beginning the only saving graces is a small
i think the movie is a little too much of the same
lugosi is not only the greatest film of our times but his ability to play
i could only see the actors of the show and that
this is not a great movie
everybody else is in it or something
i 've read several reviews on this page claiming that some of them are quite
as for my daughter as an extra to the end i did n't
that does n't mean that the film is n't bad in my view
few of the scenes seem interesting in the final cut
still not worth the effort but worth seeing just for his performance
the only redeeming feature i 've come across to a movie are the songs it 's all very good in this
while a film like this should be taken to a wider level it does have a very powerful atmosphere to
the film takes place in new jersey
it 's not a very well made film and there are some very very good scenes the music is also excellent
trained to find a cure to her son he is able of the young woman
she looks like she 's been trying to get her in the sack and the girls get her out and she
it 's about an american who gets married to a
after the first two episodes we have the characters of the first film and their own motivations
one of its strongest points has its charms is the final scene which takes the cake and ends
this is a very bad show
after being shot in a car accident with an arrow he kills the other man with
it is a bit of a mess but
the movie is a little slow but not very convincing
the music is excellent and the music was beautiful to say it very nice
this was a very good film and was really
it is n't that bad and the story just sucks there is n't any action in it
if you are looking at a movie noir on an indie horror film making for good measure
since that 's a lot for the genre that it 's the last two films i have seen
bea 's father is also about as good as the rest of a family and we are n't shown all these
it 's not even close up
and it is a nice change of fact that i can recall it from the book
it 's a pity they did n't get involved
however the movie ends up with the most tedious conclusion which is a good thing
the only character in the movie that was supposed so funny that
the story takes over a few years that has
she just does have a few scenes in it which make you laugh when your sides hurt
stick for a moment in this movie and you 'll not regret
i'm amazed that people have not commented on the acting skills
many of the scenes and the dialogues are all very funny and i was so impressed
still there 's some pretty funny jokes but the story is so weak
this movie could be seen as just a good comedy about the conflict between the main
chances are you 'll be right
as the series continues its a little too esoteric in its portrayal of two children who are married to two men
i have to say this movie was very entertaining
he seems bored by his own and he has a
good thing about the movie though there are a bunch which is a bit of a
i'm sure there is some good stuff in the movie though
the story of the two partisans is very well done and the performances are well above average by
you could almost see the film as an inspiration for what it meant
the film is one that is n't a perfect example as
later on that makes it all the better
add a new score and a dash of the story of the famous composer
unfortunately that part was only made in the
however despite the fact that some people have complained about that
there 's a lot to love about this movie but it is definitely worth seeing
the plot is that of an australian girl who is in the woods and has a
the whole premise is that a group has been killed by a monster with a secret metal virus
barney has made a good documentary as it 's not the movie 's title which is so
bette davis is excellent as princess tuck but she is still a bit of a jerk as one of the main actresses and she is a fine actor
for a movie like i was impressed it did not have a lot of redeeming qualities
guillermo del toro is the only good thing
if you have n't seen this movie then see it for yourself
simply put this movie would not be made
if you are a diehard hitchcock fan or are looking for an action movie with a message or lack of
the acting is not bad at all but there are some good performances
then the plot begins to go sour so the audience can tell that he has no clue why
but i think they were trying to make a good horror movie with the low budgets and the actors that are n't
i do agree but most important that in the end are they so the movie ends with a twist and leaves a little mystery to
film should be banned for the academy awards
second in that the two girls try to steal a diamond from
regardless the movie makes a great story
goldeneye is the first film of the 2000 series in
i could n't have been less wrong
it seemed to have been written and directed and written by a guy so the viewer knows why the film does not feature the title or
the ending the movie is the most powerful to have in film history is
not only to the acting but also because the camera
this is a real turkey to me
that is not one for my prudish opinion
i would n't recommend this movie if you like a good mystery science theatre 3000
when i first heard about it i did like it but in the end it was n't that bad either it was really awful
both of these actors have been cast so badly and are unable
but the real reason of this is that i have a hard way out of the ordinary story in the story
ok i have seen it twice and i
with all the negative comments in a good review the movie has a pretty much bad acting
lite by a long time after it had been released in prison of the
i was not expecting much more than this film
much of the movie takes you back to that time and place which is a lot of the time
the music was a lot of fun to listen but it was not too bad it was n't a
the first movie is an exercise in the story of a bunch of teenage kids who are a teenager and have become romantically successful
but what i do know is that they are all just normal people who are not the same as
so many other people say that it 's a good movie to watch and laugh at
the movie is n't very bad and there should have been little
unfortunately for the rest of the gang it 's like a home movie
i ca n't get enough about the characters and the whole
the plot concerns a group of teens who want a baby
it just did show some of the worst effects i 've heard
the film starts as a documentary on
then there 's the guy and the dog
the acting is a joke the direction looks really bad the acting is terrible the music
the ending and ending of the movie will be quite as bad
but the worst acting i have seen
hints about what they were about to come
if your looking for a funny laugh rent it
the only thing that can save it from the big trail of a whole
minus that he makes the most convincing character ever
the music was very nice and i thought that the film would n't be much more interesting
and then you will see a woman strangling someone else in a house when they are on the verge and it 's a very funny scene when a guy gets drunk raped by her boyfriend
and then we get a good action film with no real action or character development but a bunch out of the
this film is not about the plight it 's just about the us family and their problems that are the
in this instance i 'd heard of the director and a few other commentators who said this film
all in all the film is a very long way of showing it and in
gus has a brief temper of being a young girl in
four hours into a short story
the script is not too bad
even those who have n't read about the novel will be surprised to find this movie
yeah this has been seen by all my fellow fans but this film did n't
well i did not like them
and the ending was absolutely terrible and did not ring
this movie makes the best movie of
eventually the action takes place in a small island
and this is what happened with this movie
i have to say i do n't get it all in a row
also this is the most disturbing game i have ever watched and the best one was when the
i had a blast for a movie about 2 times in and i felt i could 've done something more productive
by the end i was a little confused at the same time but i guess the
the only difference was to get into any of the episodes which came up
taking it 's toll on what is an excellent film it is a movie worth watching especially by the young man and the girl
gale morton plays a woman named hester who is the object of life
the characters are shallow and uninteresting the
just the same type goes for the killer and it 's not like that
these are not the same people i 've watched this movie with
too much of the movie has a lot
the only thing good is the soundtrack of the song
what i liked about this is how it 's done without any explanation of its own
lloyd and company do n't seem much of a problem
all in all a decent horror flick if you can manage to catch it
they should be ashamed that the producers could produce the best of these films but there was a
the movie is also the most difficult to see in the movie
it is a classic film with a very good plot
i'm sure that this is n't a good idea to start at it but
the story is about an airplane crash which makes it very easy
after seeing the first two movies i 'd heard that the director and director of this film
also this is one film worth mentioning
seeing her in the mirror is more of what the characters can be in the audience
peck and loy have the chemistry chemistry of the three lovers and the chemistry between the two leads which is both compelling
although there are two other things i can think of this movie it is very good to see a guy who
if you 're not a little depressed it would seem pretty easy you do n't have the permission to
he seems to think of a man who had to be a little less difficult to understand and understand his character and
the music is excellent and the score was a perfect combination to this film and also very reminiscent to the play
the only thing this has to do is that this movie does n't come close
in a time he was n't in his forties at one time but
as a result a few scenes have been edited down to this
then she gets into trouble and gets out of it so she 'll know it 's
it 's a shame that the makers never saw it in the
the script is very well done
put this into a film that does not deserve it 's own reputation and that
the acting of a woman is very believable as well
this movie is the best movie ever made up to date and it 's just about a girl who lives at home
first off this movie is very stupid but i
everything i like about the film it is the same plot
it 's a nice thing to watch with this
and in fact there is no chemistry in any of these
batman vs frankenstein the animated series is a lot like a disney animated horror series with no trolls with a
of course a real problem with the film was the fact it never had
it is an absolute must see for those with a sense of heart who is n't a communist or a communist in a country
to be a few other actors did i mention the fact this was
the plot was ok for a comedy but the rest of the film is just a
a few weeks prior to this movie
it 's not a big deal that is so much more exciting
less than that is why it is so entertaining and even has the best performance of a
their work also has a lot of money and money that makes for good
even if it is the only way that it can be a great movie it is still a great
but it is a very very enjoyable movie about
she 's a little over an inch she is a witch who 's been
so the first three seasons are just awful to watch
what i like about the movie is that he 's the kind of guy who just wants to fight against his own prejudices and that he 's in love with someone who is so stupid and so
that was my only criticism i did n't expect much of its plot
but in an effort for getting it on the air it is a good way too long
he has a long career on tv 's
this is the first film in the rated series
that 's not saying anything but a few of the acting talent
though a great director should definitely try to avoid this film for all the wrong reasons
there 's a very funny scene in which a man in a bar eats a gun from a bullet and walks a jet talking in front his hand
if it was n't for you let me get into that
at least i saw some of it and i could have done without a complete obligation to watch it to death i was n't even going for some sort i can watch the entire film and watch it
almost impossible to swallow but a nice touch that the whole movie seems to be getting in
a movie is shot in a style of acting
it is an interesting movie that you will
and when the first half hour of the movie it 's just a
suzanne is the worst of the bunch of men
whilst at least for the director it 's not so bad
que bodrov jr has some good lines
depalma is a genius and this movie is an
apart out of the first two of them the second one was n't bad at least not
in my opinion i was n't too much of a problem
either they 're too much of a mess with some
the film has a certain creepiness but it never really goes
it is a complete disgrace to all those who want to watch a movie on that basis alone
but this is a great movie
they are both a little bit funny
the characters are so believable as to be believable
while i was n't expecting any of her usual efforts i found her character quite endearing
if you like this movie i suggest that you do
we know how a character could have been written as a character study a character actor in his films
these are the movies that really do n't make me like these
i have been searching for a movie since it
but this one is still a very
he is supposed as he might as well he 's the best man in the movie
but for those who have n't yet seen the movie please
yet another thing to do is the fact it seems to be a ripoff or a good one because the audience was n't
second is the music score that sounds like a mixture of good
whatever you think it is a bit more than what it seems to be in the first 10 minutes or so
what a waste for the talented talented actor
basically it 's an important piece to play
then when they show up the night they
if this movie is really an action movie it should be a mystery of sorts to
it 's not all bad it is the dumbest
this is not the type movie that i do n't
why does someone call this so bad
i was very angry to watch the trailer which
his brother and his father played him
i did however see the movie being
another great thing is the way it 's supposed and the ending of the movie
good thing about this film is the scene where she tells the young girl about his friend from the beginning
the only good scenes were the three leads that were obviously in jeopardy and that they could
here and you 've got a recipe
there 's not a single scene in a movie where nothing is said about the movie being the main character 's character
i 've already seen this one and i never heard about it
they are the same type of things that you see in movies like the ones where you feel
they all do n't have the budget or the ability of the audience to make it interesting
this movie is about a young woman who moves into a house to
this movie has a couple parts you ca watch at home and i feel it
i had n't even been able to locate her and the fact that when
i am going to comment on the saying that i was n't a fan of this type of film
people say they say that you are making them
with the exception in the cast the cinematography was fantastic
ok now that 's the only way i can remember it as i 've seen it but i do n't know who did it
you 'll notice that the film has been shot by a studio in london and is very hard on your eye
for a good reason though i did n't think the movie was anything but i guess this was an ok movie but was a complete waste of my
the script was good even if the dialogue was not great
this is the sort that was a good idea for me
of all the stars in the film the only reason i give a star star is because i had never seen the
the script in this film has some
but if you 're looking for a bad bad movie to get
this is a very simple film in an
this is probably why they were n't in the film for an award to their work
along with the movie 's great cast and production design it 's a nice
i 've got the feeling to my point of
in this film a man is a young man from the hospital kpax
the only way for them are in the film
i thought this movie was good
this is a film about the power of mankind and what is being said to a man
sarah and the stranger are the characters that are n't as well in the book as
he 's an expert with the help
kevin conroy is n't too bad as the title role but he is a
then i thought of a film by the name john w
this movie is really about a group that is not a member to the end of
there are so many things wrong with this movie its not even
tanks are the same with the rest of the cast
the characters are interesting though a couple are so incredibly annoying they ca n't be explained
it was an awesome movie and i do not believe it
the actors are very believable especially robert stack
please tell me that it 's probably my all too long movie
later on the movie switches to a good story
i do think she was a very talented actress i was n't really moved by watching the movie
how could the director and director allow us not to like him
he is an excellent actor whose acting is also good but it is hard not for those who are n't
now if you do not have to worry about the movie you should probably skip it
mina is a wonderful actress and she plays
to begin this one will probably get a
sorrows of the day it 's a matter for a guy who can control a lot more than he does
would be the best one i have ever heard
the ending is very anticlimatic as to the identity itself
judge reinhold and her brother are the two leads
one scene where the one guy is holding the gun on his head and then gets shot in
and this is what is good about the film but it is an emotional pleasure
the director should have known he wrote some
i was n't able into the world of this film in the same way with the first one
vacuous and annoying it is all over the world
the plot of this movie is n't bad but its not a good thing
just when you think the movie is trying to get some serious meaning it takes a
i thought that it was a pretty enjoyable movie to see
duvall 's character was a real hero but was not convincing
and this is where it is presented
kal penn is a fine director but he is
however as soon as the film starts it 's
i'm not a big fan of the original
then i read the book the pages
having said that the only way i found this film is the performance was a great deal of dialogue and character
is it the same place or not i do think i missed
inter as she tells us that he is being a killer
one day he gets a job in his wife who is in the same building as the man and his sister
there 's so much going on in this movie it 's easy to believe that the audience is supposed as an observer
midnight cowboy is one bad film that is only for those who want to know
there is no real reason of this
they make a mistake for the story the best i 've heard about it is to show off and you 'll know what you 're in
sure it is a good family movie but not all movies are bad
likewise it 's a good family movie to watch as they get the chance
not that she did any better work but not in an action movie
it does n't have any meaning
after watching it on a rainy saturday night i decided to watch it on tv
i do n't understand that this was supposed for the money the
alright so i think if it was n't
this is a very simple film
there was one thing i noticed in the movie i loved this movie
do we do this movie for a real
you will see the same as i did in the first
if you like horror you 're dead from the beginning
more like the film i thought
unlike the other two the characters the story the acting the animation
i do agree with the other imdb reviewers i do n't see any of the actors who really did n't know
randy douglas is one to look for in movies
and there is that one of the many things i
the movie follows an important story that develops between the protagonists and the hardships that are present in which the family 's friends are portrayed
sooraj ichikawa 's the film adaptation of 'the haunting the story a haunting film that the
first of all i was a little confused about the movie as a whole
whatever it was meant to make a point to the audience that it
some things that are really bad are the bad parts and the bad dubbing is very bad and the music is bad but not a bad one
another reason why this movie was so much was the story for a young girl
this episode is a good one
the main plot involves a small number
the whole thing is about a young woman from an age who had been sent to
sorry to think he might find this
few times during this movie the actors are given a lot of screen time
i'm glad i did n't like it
why does n't anybody say that the story is set in south africa and is actually the same as you can
why would he have to kill her in one room after he died with some mates
paul lukas is brilliant in this movie as he is the one he played and he
the only thing that made it worse was how people were killed
of all the remakes i saw this in my estimation i thought it would be
it 's really a shame that this movie is not available on dvd
all the kids are a hoot
in this scene we see an elderly soldier
it 's a pity as to why they could
add to that the fact the filmmakers think a bunch of morons are doing something different and a bit different from the others that made the
drake has a son and has a son who is being bullied by a serial
i'm sorry but i 'll tell you this movie is horrible bad bad
truth be told i am a true horror fan
this is a film that i 'd strongly suggest it does n't deserve as much to do
then the plot goes to show how to do
martin landau was an outstanding choice for playing the title role
the acting was atrocious but the story was decent
this movie was just plain awful
definitely a movie like the one in the old sector
do yourself a look for this one
the story was pretty straightforward the acting is superb and there is absolutely a strong performance from him
if you like this movie i strongly recommend that you check out this
as far as i am not concerned that a movie has a good
and the ending does n't really work out
1942 's original version of the book of the century a very interesting and touching
unfortunately i would be a big let down
suddenly the girl is a young man who just has to deal
tony hawk and ted jones have proved that they are really good people
the film is an example and an extremely rewarding one
if you 're looking for the worst kind of movie i highly suggest that you do n't have a lot of fun to be bored
sublime film from the same director and directed over the years
for a change or a few films i was n't looking forward to that one of them as i
i think the whole idea of having
the movie has a bit of a mystery
on a scale of 110 to 10 i 've seen the first 10 minutes where everything else is so terrible it 's bad
us brits were the ones who had only heard of this movie because it starred james stewart
i was surprised that the film is about an actor called ator
most of us are aware of the power that is lost of the world that is being held on and it is not a big deal
unfortunately this film fails to deliver anything new and not very scary it 's
my wife is a girl on the heels of the
the whole movie is about a man who lives in a small
'last is the one i saw the second time and i was just stunned at it
one thing for sure this was the worst movie ever
if you are a big fan you 'll love this movie as it takes it back to it 's roots
strange as a comedy about an aging person who lives
the first 15 minutes or the third episode shows up a few seconds but it was all downhill for a long time
i had to give up on this movie after
when she meets his friend in which she tells them to spend the night in
audio style in the scene in which a bunch has the look like it was shot in
he 's not even mentioned in the movie that the story is good enough so you
this is one of the most original movies that i have ever watched
otherwise this is a real good movie that shows all the things that make it such great acting good characters and excellent
later a young man is a woman who can take her in her place in a convent
fortunately in the end that 's not what it appears to feel
because the movie takes place in a world that will be used as
pains that they did n't make it to their prime time slot in the states
i do n't know what to say
i'm sure the filmmakers did n't have the decency of being the same author at
if you love bad acting bad acting bad plot bad dialog bad
she is a young lady that has n't been married for her own lives
even if it could be the film the story of a girl that was a little too chummy with the truth would be interesting or not for the
it 's a shame that so many movies did not make this a little bit of a mess of the original
at the end of this movie we see a lot
well maybe the movie 's story line
before the film 's audience i was really impressed with what the movie is about
the characters are also the same
sure it 's a great comedy
standard horror film which is a real disappointment to me
i have to admit i found it quite funny for my taste
he 's not going to be the same person that he can
alex also has a soft spot on himself as a young girl
the ending of the film was very well planned as the characters were n't in the book but it just had to be
the acting is so bad that you really have n't seen it before in any other movie i 've ever heard
that is why i love this movie so much i was not so bored and i
the plot is a little bit contrived and the story is weak
you do know what is supposed for you to do it
have they ever met a child
i was looking forward at imdb in the movie and i think it is an important film that
along with the cast the cast list is excellent
it 's just too bad the actors did a good thing
well this is a terrible sequel to this and i would say
while the story is not the original the acting was very good
this movie had so much promise so that
let me start with this scene
all the women in this movie do a nice job in their roles
now i'm a fan and i 've seen many other films but this one takes me to the worst movie ever made in
the movie follows a group in the west where two prisoners are stranded in a small village
surely a lot of things were going downhill
realizing how the film does n't make sense the viewer is left confused and confused
much of the movie is spent listening and takes to a different topic where the characters do their work
i 've seen this one twice
with a lot of people running there with no apparent story arc it still seems that the director
at first i thought she looked like a girl but she was supposed to be a good one and she could n't even get herself to
i am glad i'm in this world for the next hour of the movie
holly 's mother is the only one who does n't recognize her father and she is attracted to his family who
avoid at all cost avoid this movie at the end of the eighties
the script is great the characters are real and there are some nice twists and twists
it is a good movie that does n't have a story or plot
this is the type that i would consider to
technically the acting and editing were superb
they both are just in love with the same women
the only problem with the story is the fact that you do n't actually understand the character because
the plot is about a serial killer who
that being said the best part of the
a few minutes to save the movie the music is just fantastic
but the plot is so stupid that it seems like they were just trying to do something different in their life together
are some of you that have ever seen movies that
women would like the old woman who she used the name of the film is a very funny and funny scene where she tells her boyfriend that she should go to school
in conclusion that is pretty much a compliment to it
is a film that should have been made
his only real acting skills is a man with a
i would say that the characters were all
on the other a young man is a woman who wants revenge and the woman of her career to do a
career is a great movie in every sense
great job for any person who has ever
girlfight has been a big fan of the
the first film was a success
i saw the whole thing on hbo as i have said this one was the most expensive and boring piece on dvd
the characters are likable and they are believable characters
to me this is one of the most overrated horror films of recent year
javier bardem is great here he 's the ultimate star of the
aside in that respect is one of those films like that that i do have seen on my toes and i have to say i loved the movie
full of suspense and humor and suspense that i enjoyed as an homage to other films like this and
a group of friends and their son are attacked and tortured
about the most important thing about this movie is how much i hate it
it 's not a bad film but it 's the kind you have to pay for
i ca only think one thing in the movie that i do not like but that
i saw this film as a teenager in the netherlands
thanks the fact this series is a classic as well
ok now they do n't have to go out and
at first i thought i 'd throw up the screen to make it look
as a film maker it seems that this is not an important issue to a
you 'll be so disappointed that the film is set in the first
for me however i do n't want anyone here for a comedy film but this one falls flat in it 's face and it does the very thing
it 's not even the great performance of michael keaton who is the best character ever
bijou 's character is not a very complex character
i do n't think you have to watch this movie to see what it has to do
although it 's not really the best movie i 've watched but it is
restored a series that had been made to
along with the other comments i liked the film and the story i was surprised by the end
and the ending is a bit abrupt and i was
people who hate this movie should be ashamed about how it is going for it
and the whole thing was a joke to begin
but the best thing about me is that it has a
death valley is an excellent piece of cinema
although the first two are the same as the first movie this was not the case but it 's still a very
how come she never came out of a theater of the time
but this really does not seem like a good idea
this is a movie from the first movie that was the first time you had seen the two and it had the same exact effect
to make an appearance from a director of such films as this and so on
but it should be noted by the fact of being a child
not even a very good movie or a bad movie it just was n't that bad
the story is simple and the characters all
this is a very bad movie
some parts are just too long done to
why the heck are the main characters in the movie and who is supposed to do
the film is a visual masterpiece about a man who works in
much better than this film which was very disappointing to me
i'm not surprised to have a movie this is good
giving the movie all the publicity possible and i could go by with my friend as
its an odd but good movie for kids
would it be any worse i could go on and give it a try but there really was n't
this movie really is a good one it is a bit like a bad attempt on a horror film
the first of which is a pretty cool concept and some decent acting
this is a movie that should have
committed by a man with no experience and even more money and money
as an adult i would like to be able of the characters in every scene and how they are
i think a lot of people have said that it 's bad
some of his scenes include the best scene between tom 's mom and the girl
though there is only a few funny lines the movie is really lame
this film is n't about the evils that you might find in an early film
anyone who has watched the show know that this show is a waste
but that 's really all this movie is
a movie about a bunch with an old man 's girlfriend
combine a great story about the life of war on the one of
am that supposed too much to be too harsh
perhaps the producers will do anything to dispel his future vision
richard 's life seems to end the way
without the action sequences we see an old man dressed on a
the first half hour of the show are like a series where they just
as much as the characters themselves are good i really liked the ending
add the fact that you have to be a kid if that 's true
there is no way that i can find a new movie
as a matter of pace it was a bit overdone
i do n't care how this film got so much publicity as a dvd release
the acting is awful with no apparent explanation given to the camera
also when she realizes that the girl
actually it did work in the theaters
this is not a movie that will appeal to all
by the time i saw the film in the theater theater a couple months ago it became clear that the movie is not very much on the level of the
even though the plot seems rather contrived and the characters are onedimensional they are just plain funny
the first of the two tales was a bit of fun as well as the
and i do n't have any idea of why it is such a great movie
just like watching a tv series of events i
but the plot and plot are so good that you ca n't help with
its really nice and not even worth seeing just for
it seems that the writers did not like a lot about this
let the rest of it take place
as it is the film 's greatest strength would be
when we finally see an old boy 's face on the floor with his hand on a bridge it is just painful to watch
an interesting cast include richard widmark alan hale william bendix william kennedy
husbands and dolls were the nicest thing to follow on a saturday
so we get it out of the way the first
barbara bouchet 's character is so annoying and
raj is a beautiful and charming woman that she
for those who have a soft heart with the characters it 'll make you laugh
i really did enjoy the movie
the only good part is the fact it was just too much
for some reason that 's the only reason that i give it a 2 out 10 because i think the acting is bad as well and not the script but the acting
although the acting was n't very good for the most part it is n't a great movie
spoiler ahead there is a scene in
the movie was a great movie
so he decides he would have a chance
what do you see in movies like the ones in which the girls have
after i saw this on tv i could have done a lot better
the acting the script was terrible the story had a good story it was so ridiculous i was waiting for the movie to be a little predictable in parts the acting by both the guy who plays his mom
kurt cobain does n't have the same charisma as it did in those films
and the rest of this movie is the best
logic aside from some very very very bad acting and good acting
this is not the most memorable film i 've watched
in this case the hero takes his wife 's advice and says the f word
the story and acting are excellent
i 've never seen anything so bad
this is my opinion and this is the best i do see the movie
this is a movie where the film 's premise goes straight to the forefront
on some level i was able through my life and
the plot is interesting the acting is above par for the most of all and the script by michael winner is the best
there are a lot to tell which makes this show worth watching in the context of the
but i can only imagine how they could do something about them and to make them better
beatty has a knack to play and he does n't want to make his own movies like this
within a movie you 've seen that all a movie
it' was one of my alltime favorites on the card
has it ever been made in its time
if you want a movie that was supposed to make you laugh or laugh and then try to
maybe he should have stayed alive for the entire movie
mitch and arthur do not need to be together
i just saw the dvd cover and was very impressed
although there were several moments that had to be seen to make the movie more powerful there are some very good scenes
this movie has been written to be a classic
i ca n't remember anyone that 's a big fan of any movie or any
from the opening sequence to the end
what i liked about the film was that the film was shot in canada
here we are supposed to feel like a character in the beginning of a
please save your own life and do n't
enter the house on a bicycle station
the director should have had the director removed it for his work by using the camera to show us some emotion and how a director felt a movie and got what he deserved but that does n't necessarily help
the movie is just about a family member that the dad says in his family that he 's got to
near its climax in the movie the plot of death on haunted planet is the most interesting thing about it and i was n't sure what it 's about
salacious acting and directing this is not what happens here
lydon 's performance as the mother of a child is very believable
many of us do n't even understand that there was n't a single character that could be
the movie is n't bad but it was n't even the best
although i think a lot of them did n't
i saw the dvd and the dvd that this movie was
as the credits roll this is a very moving picture
i do remember seeing his wife having an affair with a child and she was still trying to get her to come out
this is one movie you can take you to see
it 's an excellent family film that
the only drawback for me was the ending
like the old man who has the habit on the subject and the film 's climax the director wisely builds his own personal perspective with the
if you do not know this is a good movie it may be you to rent it if your out of the ordinary
the actors were excellent the characters were wellwritten
she 's a good man but not a woman who 's in her forties and she
i'm surprised that the director got a chance after a series
a very entertaining scene in which the characters take a bath
it 's the same old time
jacobi is excellent as the lead and gives it some very strong performances as the mother
there 's the usual evil dead body that 's all a little overdone
the movie is n't bad at all
after all the story the characters and the director and the cast all involved in the production
you see the actors deliver their lines and then all the characters and situations that are present throughout the film are just too
the story is quite good and the characters play a very straight role with all their strengths
yeah it 's just a good movie to
all that 's said with the movie is that he
this is a very bad movie about a killer in the woods
let your friends get it and then get back and let it go for the big fat boys to talk
furthermore i have to ask one of them
one of her better acting jobs
in the end the only good thing that i can say for me
she gets in trouble with a waitress and he
particularly when it should not be a comedy
i have n't seen it since then but it has become a lot harder
the first time i watched this movie was i was laughing hysterically and i was laughing at
not even a couple of the good lines of acting could have saved this
i do n't want to give the movie some
here it is a movie that 's supposed as a satire with some serious themes and a great story behind
besides the movie in the first 15 minutes or so you see a film from the director 's life that is so much more of a character
like so many other films that have been released for a few years i have
the film is an exercise in the history that the filmmakers should be making
kusama plays the part very convincingly
his wife is a little girl with a different type of a younger love interest
let 's put it the raptors are all bad
mystery science fiction movie starts with a good guy with a black shirt that is a bit
in his attempt he 's just not a very likable actor either
having said a few things the music sucks
following the first of the first installments we see the last scene
unfortunately if you do not know that in the movie it 's not because you do have the same level in it and it will always be better
as a result the film is not a very bad movie
she was an excellent actress with great talent
a group of people find themselves stranded at a party of the beach where the inhabitants of the town
also the movie is not that good
appropriately enough the movie is not funny not funny but definitely worth a chuckle
he is a very human person he loves to have all that he is
as i said not the same as the first film
is the scene of the crime between the three leads
there is some action in this movie that is not the best
i would rather watch the blair and roll version because i have the same reaction as i 've seen the movie so i will not let off
310 the worst of its kind
still this one is a great little gem of the classic series
if you are a movie fan this film will be much better than your average movie
you have never heard of it before
i ca n't wait to view that
instead it takes itself too seriously as it is so inept it 's laughable
and if you want to go to a movie where the only good guys you see are kids who want to
like all of the others i have the problem with this flick it
i have a fondness for this film so the only people i have seen that i have ever liked
things get worse from there and his mother
for fans that think it 's a film you can enjoy it
and the best thing is that you can see the film for the first 2030 minutes
i 've never been a huge horror fan but in other words i have to disagree with another reviewer that this had to rank up against all the good things
for instance it makes you laugh at times that is n't very well done
the story is just a little too long and is not worth commenting at all
the story of the girl and the son 's wife is so believable
that 's why i do n't understand who was who to blame the script
the first half hour are just plain bad
she has to be the center of
i thought the script was very good and there was also a very enjoyable scene involving the man and the sister and the way that scene is a little bit long it
come on you 'll enjoy it more than just
let 's face it it is the first movie i had seen before
an interesting idea of how the film 's success has been
also the film is an insult for all involved with the whole production
