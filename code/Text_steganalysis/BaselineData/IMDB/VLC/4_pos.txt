this is n't a movie about a man who is trying to
it 's not a movie for people who love movies that
i had to shut up in the first 5 minutes which
ethereal and witty this one is a must see for
nobody in it has ever had any sense what to do
unlike any other disney cartoon i have seen and many of those movies that make you want to
the story is simple and not very original but a great
and the plot was n't really bad as we have a story that i found funny
there are some truly stunning moments in the film and i think that is that the characters in the film are all real and the actors are great too
i saw this as part one to my knowledge of this
both of those scenes is just as
this movie is really about a bunch of people who go on a trip to the pacific to find out about the future being
it is a bit too simple and a tad slow but i really liked it so much that the
may i get this movie on video
what the hell is this film about
what is most striking is why the filmmakers have chosen to make these kinds of movies
i saw this when the film came out before
bottom line this is one of the worst films of all times
a man who is so old fashioned and a man that i want it to be a real world
one thing that was missing the point in this movie was how the producers
this is a very bad film
i 've never been a fan so i was looking into
i do n't believe i had even heard of this film at a
ming ming does a decent turn as a tough guy and he is quite likable and believable as the villain in this film too
the first time i saw this movie i loved it
it 's not a very good idea to put into the story
but the whole thing was so terrible so i do not even
this time it is a comedy it was supposed to appeal
if you can get that out of your mind you may like it you 'll want you to see it on its
this movie is really about a young man and the son who decide to leave it
rex ingram was just awful in it
it was n't bad it was good fun and i was pleasantly impressed by it
the only other film in which this was made for me was when the story was being told from a technical perspective in what would
as soon as the plot kicks into the film the characters seem more human than most of their films and there is n't really a point
angelina jolie and michael jayston should be ashamed of this
actually this is a pretty bad movie i ca all really say that it has absolutely no redeeming
and that would be the best reason to watch this crap
the ending of this movie will probably leave you wanting to be a part in a new movie but it will
that would be a very big mistake
watch it if you do n't know
all this is a major flaw
where did they get those from
but he does n't get a sense that he is no actor
one could argue that most of the actors had their own voices but no they were not used to convey some
an excellent cast led from the leads who were the real star of the film
although the movie could not really have had a story of this sort
thus we have a great ensemble of actors but this film is not in the same ballpark as you would think
i ca only assume he 's a fan of hers but this one takes more of his character
and i really wanted to see it because it was so bad
it 's hard for anyone who is not familiar with the movie
and the acting and editing is so good that you ca ca n't believe that someone else could do something that 's the least interesting
it 's not all a movie
the script has to rely on the ridiculous plot lines to develop an atmosphere
all in all it 's the best film i ever seen
but i guess we have an awful plot that
the film is not for all tastes but also in one way or so
and he seems to be a coward
james earl jones' the most successful character in the film
after a while it 's clear that the real actors was just reading this off cue
it is n't even a story about how they were all and how they were all in the family
and the ending i will just love it
her friend is a beautiful woman who is a man who wants revenge and
they 're pretty lame but the acting is pretty decent
the movie has a good mix between it and the story is pretty good but the acting was terrible
after the opening battle scenes we witness the various sides of the ship and how this movie
just because the main character is a woman is not a very bad idea about the movie
i have read several comments on imdb that say that this has a great cast of actors
movie mavens to recognize who they are doing
because i'm afraid that the movie was released in a time that i thought it was the
several of the actors are great and the actors are good
however the whole plot is just boring
it 's a very good film with many
i have to agree with the previous comment here that i have n't laughed a few times and will always be
i do not know what to call a film like this but it certainly is good in it 's purest form
this movie is the worst horror movie i have had the misfortune of watching
i had to give it a 1 out of 10
there is a certain amount of time to develop in the storyline with the character and story
he was also a lot of fun to see but that 's not saying it
i 've never seen such a complete waste together
the only good points are the ones with the main character 's mother and the fact she was the only person who was the main
we do get a few more glimpses of what we get when we watch him and we feel the pain of his death
mitchum 's role here is very funny but that 's it
if you do n't have the right choice of seeing a movie that should be a classic it is highly recommend it to all ages it 's
that does however be the case with most of
while the story is rather interesting it seems that the screenwriters had decided
paying attention and then when he meets his wife we find out the truth about the death
there are many things where you do have to say the director
also the only one of this is the one which is the real star
being his first two films he is a genius
in fact if that 's what we 're
it is an example of a truly wonderful and hilarious film
the characters in general are very interesting and believable
but the movie does n't work
a good story line with a great actor and a fine ensemble
peter falk played the part of the main character in a very short and interesting film which has always had some redeeming features for both actors
this is a pretty funny movie that was
there is n't a whole lot to like about this movie
the story involves a group of people led to believe that the only two people
one of those movies i really enjoyed and it was one of my favorites
all i could think is that this film is a real movie of the kind they would
in a nutshell you ca n't help noticing the similarities of these movies
one of his biggest disappointments and his movies are very different from the other films
les niro and his men are all fine
and when her character does n't seem to get to her acting her she is pretty much a woman
much of the movie revolves on the main plot but it is not as bad or bad at the
filmed with the intention that they would be on the right hand to see it in the theaters it 's still very good for the
i do not think he 's just a bad actor as
i could n't take it anymore but i did enjoy a good idea
american graffiti had to come from an excellent filmmaker and it could have done a lot more than it 's a perfect tribute
the only reason i did not give the movie a 1 are because of the plot
as soon i saw this film i was stunned at first time
so it 's no surprise to have this film
the story was that great and the acting was ok
different strokes from the original play
example it 's a pretty funny and entertaining story about a guy named satan
blackadder is a great fighter and a womanizer who is not
dan akroyd is a talented actor of the type and his performance is also good
the only thing that keeps me watching was the fact that the film just does a better job explaining why
the main idea in a nutshell about the first movie to the big
one of my favorite movies of all time
in the original a movie called it this is the first that was made in 1972 but they do just that
having seen his work i was able
seven out of ten stars is worth watching
and the whole idea of this
so much is put on the dvd cover i saw it on the big screen
but i was n't expecting to see him play the part
it is a movie about how people are in the same situation
with the exception of the last fifteen mins you 're not sure what it is a lot of things are going on but then why
yes it 's a nice little film
this movie just makes it worse than it should but it does nothing
blockbuster was a low quality movie
i would recommend this movie if it is to the point of buying it
few people can relate to the fact the director attended her or her family because that is how it 's about her son in law
it 's a shame why it is so funny
not to mention that the entire production of this movie is just plain stupid
i would not go for this movie but it 's really a bad film to me
it 's not really a bad remake
shah rukh is one fine movie
the only way that we can get
john ritter does an excellent performance as the villain in which he gets on screen
if this is a bad film it does have something to do
i was expecting a movie from a lot less but i was just not a good fan and i just felt bad for
if i could n't get to see this movie i would have been more impressed with my friends at least
a little later in his career
these are not all you want
the plot is not very interesting
followed as such the plot is the worst i all have ever seen and far too many of
i 've never heard such an interesting and thoughtprovoking portrayal
at least we 're still able to identify to the screen but as the movie progresses we 're told to leave the viewer for some confusion as
i do have a fondness on how they 're going
part of me giggle and cheered so fast that i just could n't
the ending was too obvious and the story line was too preachy for a sequel to this one
he 's just not in the same mode when he has a chance to kill people
his character was just stupid the only one who was so irritating in the first two parts was the one who had a bad time
the only thing i found interesting about this production are what
the story of the movie is simple and it is n't very clear
initially i would rather watch my instincts as a viewer than the last person who wrote this book
it is n't a bad movie but it really gets me interested in the story so i 'll give it the lowest possible
well it 's so sad and sad it is a real shame that this movie did a lot of things but that is a problem with this movie because if you
in fact it is a film that has a lot more to offer than the other one has it is
there is no story the characters and the relationships between the characters is really flat and predictable
i do recommend the book for the movie to read
but i still ca ca n't get my money out of
things like this are not in this film
unless you do not have the option to be able at the end of the day this film is a
as far has been concerned this movie had a great deal of
in short though they 're good actors as their characters are
demon and aliens do n't do this for a very long time
i would give this a zero out 10 and that 's what i think
very funny and a great movie
crawford 's performance is the most powerful
gary oldman looks suitably bored in this movie as is his role as the villain
a couple of times when i think the show was n't really
october 11 1992 there were some wonderful songs and i have not heard them since i was in a film that 's a great combination of
he had a knack it was because it was the best thing to show the whole
i was n't expecting much from this movie
derek is not a great villain to play the part as a character he does not show his true love for
but i really liked the first two
both have a similar role to play the characters who are in this film or they should have had a bigger time frame which would make one of the most interesting characters
i really ca all be wrong
if it were n't for the fact that you just had
not for those who have read about the age
need not apply to this film as one has a few more rewrites
contrary to that one of the most important parts in the movie is the part where the mother 's grandmother and sister have no trouble finding the woman who has lost his mind
there would be a lot better on the subject
heck if i had to pick the
my first question is who would ever say that in the book there was no
this movie had to be one the biggest disappointments
his only character is that he 's not only an everyman but also a mentally unstable man that wants her to get a life
have i even heard a good word at this
when that 's the only way a movie can be seen and the only film that can make it to the theaters is the best one
on the flip the movie is just so much fun and the music that it
this movie is not to be missed is the same old time we 're used as
in this case they are quite funny
perhaps this movie will make you wonder who will really die and if you have already watched the movie you will get more
without spoiling it for anyone who has watched any of the other movie and i can assure you why you should not watch this movie
this is a great movie about a group of men
this is a film that you have the rare experience of
the story itself revolves on two young lovers trying for a different experience and a group of students from
why could the film be so successful so
this is one of my favorites
he 's the best part in it
woeful plot that is so unbelievable you wo ca only
my only problem however are these types of scenes
you 'll feel very sorry for the guy
belafonte also stars in this film as well as joe mantegna
as a film it is a very beautiful and wonderful movie
it 's a pretty good movie i do not have anything against the
okay it 's like an extended version
however this is one movie that should have been avoided at the box office
the story line was a little too thin for my taste
how does the director make the first movie
why did they put it in this movie but the director chose to give it
the ending and the way it 's done is amazing and i recommend it to
the film is an utter waste of time money and money
their lives were to get out of control and get rid of the family from which they live for their lives
its like all of the actors did a better acting
despite the acting by the actors the plot was terrible
i 've never seen a more beautiful woman
every time they move around the camera they see something like the wind which makes you feel like they could
after watching i am convinced i 'd heard of it and have to admit the acting was
the only problem with this film was that we all agreed that they were going to win a competition
who 's responsible for her actions
beginning the story of a woman in
probably the most interesting aspect of this movie is
first i 'd like to see this film again
there 's a great cast the characterisations and a plot of two men who have been living in their country and having to endure their dreams to overcome their own life
i do have the problem with the way
i could never understand that so many people who are n't even interested are very well entertained
my recommendation and see my share of friends and myself in order
be it a comedy or a funny movie
i have never seen any of the other characters being
the script by george ford was a joke
she is a wonderful actress as she 's a real charmer
i did like the character development and his character but he has a small role
godzilla ii starts out with the evil man of a
however i do n't have much more to complain on except this is probably the best film that i have ever watched the film has a lot
that 's a little bit too hard to make and the story was interesting
i do hope it goes straight out on video and the next disc
if you think the film will appeal to all audiences of the 80 another and are interested in seeing the film this is definitely one to find out
give a good summary of the plot in the movie
well you have got to watch it to the next scene
i do n't know where to begin
even with the poor script and directing the whole movie has nothing
because i have never been the kind to go see the movie it 's not worth a look at
in this film it is not a matter as many as it is it 's a real good time capsule
soon i got to watch the movie which has some very good points in it that were so very difficult to follow
i really hope that it would help if this was the second
every aspect of it makes you want to get out with the characters and to make it more fun
where is that in the first
if you are going to watch any other columbo film the first one that takes us away is
dialogue has a plot of the movie that you do
it 's not a bad idea
if it would not be that way i could say this and all the rest of her life i was looking for
the characters are all well played
some may complain with the director or producer
this is an extremely funny movie that will leave much to be enjoyed and appreciated
jaguar khanna as a detective who is n't the hero
in the end if you are going to watch a movie with good acting it 's worth the rent if you are not an atheist fan but as a whole it 's not as bad as you might find
but in my mind this film was really good
basinger 's character is not just a young girl a girl and a young one
i do have some of the comments written by people on here who do
a few years later she is the girl in the hospital in the beginning of the film
the only good thing about the whole movie was the scene where the girls were trying for a baby
it may sound like a big step down from the tv series but the story is more of a drama than a
thus in the film we do n't get a problem or a plot line
i am in the minority and i will probably say to you
in any case you can see the film coming from another perspective
the film has no real plot
i ca all imagine the whole film
the only real gripe is the lack it a story to the story
the script is n't great the story is just plain silly
the plot is n't very interesting although at least the plot
ironically there was a few good actors to go around
in my opinion this is a great movie
the acting is awful but they are not terrible at all
i am not a fan of this type of movie but this has no real life
but the best part about a movie is that it 's a good thing
salvaging the first episode you will enjoy this one it 's just a fun game
i think it is a movie that 's funny
this film was just as bad
codirector william s burroughs and cinematographer paul r strayer do a good deal of exploring the events of the story of both of them
on the other hand it 's like a bad movie
i ca to decipher whether that is just me a good
though i think that the ending is a bit too long it is n't the kind of film where all
the acting is so good the dialogue is bad and it 's not really worth mentioning the fact that it 's a
in the end they are all so much fun to watch that you get to admire
undoubtedly the finest film of the year has made me laugh and i'm a big fan of ms allen
also there is some pretty creepy action sequences
later there 's a couple of random moments but not as much as you might
however the plot is n't very original or complex either to the plot or any of the twists or plot
this film had been released several years into the film and was considered
i do not mean that i like it
mighty is a man that was a little more popular than he ever got
it 's the same film as the original
uma farrow has a really funny cameo and plays a character that really is n't there for
the movie is set up with the usual bad guy bad dude that makes
for anyone else the show does n't really have to
one of my friends said i saw this movie for 2 hours and i was stunned at the sheer silliness it took to the extreme and in that sense i would not say that this movie is n't the worst movie i 've ever watched
however i ca only think about this film as well
it was funny to hear people saying something like that
seth macfarlane is a genius who could n't have been more
do n't be deceived by the comments on this page of a film
as the main attraction is the characters are very realistic
i had to sit through it in order of the first two to give it a try and i am afraid
he makes up the whole cast
this movie could 've made a great movie
the first thing that struck me was that the movie seemed to be trying too hard at times but failed to deliver the scares
to give it a shot this is what you 're looking to see and hear
after a long time i was still laughing at how bad this was going a good way at the
the only other good thing about me was the music
the characters were all likable and the cast was excellent
then you have the characters that are supposed to die and you ca all like them to have
this is what the producers wanted to do in this
i have seen several other movies that are made for tv
the film 's plot was n't interesting enough to save this 'movie' but i was really
the story is so weak and unbelievable that you can actually laugh out
there 's something good about it and the ending and it 's quite good
this film really has a very bad
however i am a fan so i am delighted to say it was n't a good movie just a few things
if you 've read this you might like this but you may
it has many funny moments and an amusing finale that was n't too well done
worse the worst in movie making
felix is as good as ever to appear in a movie but
do not rent this film if anyone
i ca n't understand this movie and that i will not forget it but i ca ca to recapture it
i saw the trailer for this film on the tv ads and saw it as a tv miniseries
so we have one film to be seen with two different people in a lot of situations that
one could not possibly compare the plot to the characters from the book and the
the story of the man who has to be the father 's son is the
it 's like one of the most stupid ones you might ever
the only saving grace in the entire movie is that it is a good movie about
the only problem i had between the two leads was the fact we were supposed to be a bit uneasy and not even
it is n't a great movie but is one of the best
she gets involved with the young man 's wife and they are given a
watch it again for yourself or just enjoy
there 's a reason for that
i do n't mind but the fact that he was not in the book was a very interesting move from his mother and not too much to be questioned
cary grant plays captain john anderton a former american cop from the united east in london
simply because his wife was killed but then he got to bed
probably the most enjoyable aspect of the film was its
it 's all in the same place as the old lady
confidence and death are just too bad to be true to us
there is a good balance between the two movies
each time this happens to be on screen and that is the only movie that is even remotely successful
but for those who love horror movies with a bit of fun in it this movie was a must see for anyone who wants something to enjoy in films and not a horror film or
ron perlman is a good choice for a character who is an actor
the plot of the movie is n't really good and i
ken russell has proved that he does n't have a good role
i think the director and writer of the film were trying to make the film realistic enough to create some of the worst acting
and then there is some weird looking scenes in which some women are murdered off from a tree
but the best is that it has an air force and
i was impressed with this film on the other hand
yeah i'm sorry but the acting the script everything
with it being a comedy it 's not all that bad
a group that just happens that a nuclear holocaust awaits
this is a movie that deserves to watch over 30 years ago
we were shown in the us when our freedoms in the united states of our culture in a new age
i 've seen many films but i ca all imagine them
the acting for this movie is so low i have to say that there 's a very
my advice you will be pleasantly rewarded by watching this series
stupid and ridiculous at the same turn
rich and dumber this is not a comedy to me a horror film but that 's a
on a positive side i do n't think we can be asked that the actors
lew rains plays an extremely well suited and complex portrayal of the president who loves to be able and
there are many films to tell the tales to be the most important and most
the plot was ok but the direction was pretty good too i guess
it 's not really the funniest comedy i
the story of the characters are also the same characters that are introduced in different ways to show the
oh yes the scene in the beginning with the boy being shot in the bed was
the movie is very similar to the first and the director seems not to have the connections to the book 's characters which they use for the first
meryl welles 's performance in the film is a joy to behold
that 's the way i would expect to see a decent
it 's not as good either
the only reason i rented this for me to rent was because i
it 's not a bad movie to make sure that it might get better and you get something you can do at an actual hour
he is a very good actress who should 've been a
i just love the scene where the guy has a gun in a bar and his mother is talking about
cagney plays detective who investigates a mysterious murder attempt
this movie has to start on dvd and dvd is on ebay
and it 's just that the plot has little or no direction
needless enough money to stop making a movie like that that is
the only thing that kept me in the theater were the fight scenes
and of course the whole world is a little
some of them are not so much
the movie is also filled with stereotypes of violence in every respect a lot the audience is subjected to the characters and characters are all very well developed and the overall
yet this is a great movie in my estimation a perfect film to see
that was enough for me it was not even made
a little more fun and more exciting
otherwise what the movie lacks is a complete sense of the supernatural and the story is n't all that good
the ending is a tad too long
i'm a diehard fan of movies and action movies but not at least one thing
if there were one i have to agree with you do n't go to this movie expecting a film
most of the movie is about the relationship that
every single person gets involved with his own
all that aside this was a pretty low budget flick
but the film is a total failure to sit well on the imdb
while this time capsule is in the same vein as a big budgeted movie this certainly is not one that can possibly hold up as one
i have not seen it in years because i think it would
this is n't exactly a bad comedy though it 's not as good or original either
i think that i would love this film to be done
walt and hardy are n't in the movie
but the story is that of a family and not a very ordinary one which makes it difficult for us to
if you do watch this film for free at its
at least there 's a good deal to enjoy
there are two great actors in the film
the only good thing that can be called about is the lack of any conceivable reason to
it is not only the film about two
this is one of those movies that you will never know
this film is just an exercise into the genre and its a must
from this point on that is a nice idea to put up some of those cheap and tacky films that make you
or did i mention the fact that there were too few people to die or died
giddy and insecure is a much more entertaining film than i expected
brat is the most interesting film in a long period
in this episode the main characters are the most powerful people ever
he does n't even know what to do with her life
the characters in the movie seemed rather unrealistic
i think that 's a problem with this movie
he was so convincing that in the end he was not even in that scene and in my eyes he was not menacing
it has a great cast and a good plot
in the first film the main problem is it 's a complete loss that one of them is n't able by the
center stage is an excellent documentary by the director and a
it is a movie that deserves a much better title
before this film is released and we see the young man
with its unique and powerful portrayal by the time it 's in the history of cinema you know you 've never seen
if i had to make the film of the english version it was not that bad at
today the film is a total waste
i would have liked it more
most of them seemed to be the same person
watching the story is a big mistake in my book because of that
colleen moore is a woman who 's trying to find something important in her life and what is the purpose of the mother
i was really excited i was n't disappointed
tarzan and his men try very well and in a
it was so much better than the last one and
that 's why the film is so bad and
for example when the film opens i was just looking forward to it i was n't really
however they do a pretty good job with the script and the
as i said the story was so predictable that i had a
i think that this movie would have been more
they were also made for movies so
it is not for everyone but if your still watching it you can get away in the same way that
matthew modine is excellent but i 've never had to wait for him for it for him for this
if you are looking for a good adventure movie about a killer that kills a group at a bar near a bar
this is a very poor and boring film about the same kind as one of the main characters of the book
while this show 's main focus on the other episodes at the time in which these people seem to take the audience into the lives of the characters that i am sure there are some
the film is a mess of the sort to be seen in a movie theater
at one point a group of men have an automatic conversation with their captors and they are trying to find the perfect
double crosses is an excellent film that shows that
the story is set up to create interesting tension but it never develops the plot and the characters
the story line was quite original and had a lot of good twists and turns
i think the movie could have been better
some of the other reviews say that i have n't seen a movie so many
finally they have an interesting story
but if the script was n't bad enough you ca
this film is not for everyone
expect a good movie about a family
in many ways a film that should stick
what really surprised us most was the way the scene in the first quarter of the movie shows the man walking around the train and the main characters and the car
anyway the movie was not a big budget success but it was a great movie
but the movie still makes you feel the urge
the only good part was the acting
a must see film for everyone to see
all in all it 's not the worst comedy
but the problem was i had the privilege to view this movie as a joke because it 's so
you could tell this was an early stage production or a movie but it was not
it 's a shame that so bad that the producers decided this story was n't bad
but if you really want an example for this genre it 's still one of my favourites
this could be as a good film that is
of all time movies this one is definitely a winner of mine
the film is filled up with a story which is told in
the film was about a teenager 's life in a small apartment where a young and
it 's as if she is enjoying a bad movie about a girl
i would have seen the two stooges in the theater in this movie
a real treat for the director as this one has
very good acting great story and a really catchy cast
this is a really great movie
the only reason i even gave the
having said all these things you should definitely not be surprised
take a peek into a new wave of horror movies where the characters are
4 the only real character in the
finally the movie gets too close and it gets better with it 's characters
it is the best of our times and that
there is an attempt by the director for making the point of a story to a man
finally i thought that there was a good idea that this film would be a
i have not seen him in a much less
it is difficult to pinpoint the plot and the settings
in fact it 's a pity because it 's not only because its plot has more to it with its flaws because it 's
they are the only thing that makes their presence believable or
this is a great movie for the long time
it is an interesting story that explores a
is the film more powerful than it is
after an hour of the story i thought i would give it an
melanie griffith as her mother who plays the role was a treat to watch
and of course there 's no denying that this is a real good movie
so in that sense that you 're not your
its almost a parody on the part
mason makes a brief and seemingly brief cameo appearance and a good cast
he 's the one who wants to be in this case
i love to watch more movies than these films but in
the story is about a young girl and his
oh yea i do n't like the other films that have
her performance was great and i felt the movie was a very real and wonderful film
the movie follows a group of people in a small village who had just begun to find their fathers
for anyone who is a fan this has a good idea and a great story for
it 's a shame because there was no need
i saw this at the tribeca cinema theater
that 's because it has a few good parts but i do agree
eventually the movie ends with the two sisters sitting in an upstairs building
they are not at the center to
there is nothing really bad or special about the acting and
heartbreak is one film that you can laugh at
even with the poor acting by peter o'toole and his wooden voice he makes the most of his career
the script is so stupid that even a small kid who thinks he was the good one and does
ll witch 's life is the first in the grips i 've ever seen
is he trying too much to save his soul
an american movie that was so bad you could not get a
i 've been waiting for an oscar of this film for
we are left with this movie with the ending of a good book
this movie could have been much better but then we got an idea of the real world of our society and its consequences
it is a little different to the film because that the characters are very different than other ones i have found
well it has a few redeeming features but it
it was a bit of a letdown but it was the first episode
its a real story of three boys who have to deal with issues
i would n't watch this as a comedy if i could find a copy that had just been edited and edited out with a soundtrack
film was shot on location in new zealand
i ca n't think of any more of the series and only one of
the characters are just plain stupid and are so flat you 'll wonder if the actors are not even the only ones on the screen
this is probably one thing i found in my video library
he is not a movie that 's not so funny that it will not reach your disbelief but
the story takes itself very slow and is so dull it 's so obvious it 's not funny
sometimes the music is a little jarring for the whole movie but also in the film 's opening credits and the ending that is just as great and memorable
to me this has to be the least convincing and enjoyable film i had ever watched
it 's a shame as being a great horror movie
with these two guys who would n't have survived their fate they would
i do n't think that it was ever so good for
i love this show and i do n't want a good movie to get so much fun
i was expecting a real thriller when this show was
both have some kind and the characters in this movie come
this is a film of all ages
sometimes the movie was a bit of what went on in the first movie
the acting was terrible the directing was
even if it was in its place on the video nasty list of its own merits would have made this a classic if i could have known
conclusion the only reason i watched it
the whole idea of how could someone in the audience just say hey the bad guys
this movie does not work because of how the director should have left
add a sense of fun the first two
take my advice and rent this film it 's a complete waste of your life or do not even think of renting this film
i was lucky enough to stumble across that
forget all these people and make them look like
the film has a very dark feel to my nostrils
imagine my surprise in this film
too bad the movie has no redeeming qualities in this case
listed as an american classic i have to admit that i am the first to comment on what was a better and good film for myself
i did not find it funny and did not quite convince anyone to like the ending of the film
watching the movie you would n't have to be a fan for movies to have an
sarah michelle gellar is great as she 's just not a bad guy she is pretty good
and i do n't know the exact reasons why the film never took me so long
the first was that we see the whole story as a joke and
it is a real classic and it 's very easy to watch a movie with such a great cast
i have to admit it was my favorite disney movie of all the batman movies but the
director john boorman and his cinematographer william
could have been a better movie in the hands
actually the fact that a film that could have been more entertaining is the result but the
i just do n't know how it got
in my opinion this film really should of gotten released theatrically
meanwhile she falls asleep and when one is killed by the guy 's friend and then she becomes pregnant and angry that she 's dead
another thing that is the most obvious are the songs
i ca all about this movie
if this movie were released in the first place the best way to explain it beforehand is
some say he should not be as good as the one in this film
this film is also a complete failure
despite the title of the movie the movie was based at a very good book with a very catchy story
think that they are the same people who
i ca n't believe the average film watcher would find the book to have a
this is one of many movies where i do not recommend it because it takes the movie too far too hard to be a good
after hearing about this movie you do n't have to be a movie fan to like the film because there is
the first thing is the good stuff in this film
i really do agree with those who commented that the film does not make
a lot happens and the movie is very funny but this is an awful movie
melvin 's performance was a bit over the edge when
a good example of how a film can
he also was in trouble with the new age
of this time period is the same
they are all for one thing
timon ford who is in his early career in this film is a very
she 's a talented actor here she is very convincing as the villain who is trying too much to be too serious and to be sexy to be
after the death it starts to feel sorry for her
i just watched a couple months ago
he is an idiot and an actor
one thing that bothered the movie to me are the characters and the story
boyd plays a character who just does not seem to have much to work with except
at one moment we see the face that is going on
it 's a good film to be loved
antonioni 's work is quite short with only one of those films
it was n't really that great at the time but i
the acting as for this is really bad
he did not take her to this movie
most of all the story is so contrived that you wo n't care
overall it seems a little too long for
it is a film that is full to wallow the viewer with laughter and is n't so much fun
this episode is definitely worth viewing
the film is a little too long
it is an attempt of comedy to bring us all into a very dark future which has an extremely dark feel
so the film starts to lose momentum and the film does n't
the acting and script are so bad that it 's almost embarrassing
then the story begins to drag downhill
i had high hopes of the end of the movie
the story is set around a high tech university building called the same name on the other
but the problem is that he does not get to make the film
i did n't like this film either as i did it really like the movie
on this film they are just so incredibly bad
orange is a classic and i think it 's a great idea of the movie
it 's like it 's just another movie with a different plot and more characters
i am a big admirer of james spader in particular but i 've never seen his wife
i think the best way for me to see this is the acting
she looks great too bad a character
i think that there 's a lot of good old actors who do it for
saw it as a comedy and as a whole the acting by robert montgomery was pretty good but this
it 's a pretty good film in a nutshell as it has been given to
elvira 's performance is just as good with its understated portrayal
it 's a very enjoyable movie and one of those movies that can be seen by all the time
ok first of all the ending
gwyneth paltrow was excellent as usual to the point where she was not really playing her
this movie is not to say the least
that 's a lot of the movie 's humor and it was all pretty stupid with the exception of the two leads
and the ending is a joke with a lot more plot holes than we 're supposed or just a few examples of a movie
night was another very good movie to show you a movie you have always been interested in the
the actors are all very good the plot
not all of them are really well developed
the movie is n't a complete waste
anyone who sees the movie will agree that it is the worst film ever put in the face of the film
it 's really about the way these people do n't react to the world
priyadarshan is the only one who gets up with some of their best work at the end in the next two of the scenes where a bunch of people go on a rampage
ronald colman and william katt play their parts perfectly
it 's just a bad bad movie with bad acting and bad dialogue
these are what 's wrong here i would have
the script of course had a bit of potential with many of the scenes which made the first 5 minutes of
she gets a hold of her own but never comes
like a lot of this movies i found the film very interesting
i do like the fact he 's so good
in the end i 'll give credit
as a result i would recommend this film because it features a lot more
but the story is so ridiculous
going on i have to say i have never been such dumber and yet as i have read the book the plot summary was so awful
he is not a very good director
these are movies of note in the past few months as well
this movie is just so good
these are some of the most interesting things you could imagine
many of them are just too good for the part
to me this is a movie that will give
she and her two coworkers travel to new york because
for a good film noir and an excellent film noir movie is about the difficulty with the human race
i would give this a 1 but it 's not that bad
honestly i ca least recommend it to anyone who enjoys a bad movie
it was like it had been produced by a committee
this is a film from the 50 of
add to the dvd a very good movie and you 'd think if
he is given to a very small and insignificant group
many of these movies that the director should not have made to watch the first
movie starts as a very good movie
just as you are supposed to be a fan like john woo the film is n't as bad as a cheap soap but it 's a great fun for the time period and will
the acting of this movie is pretty good
aside the book of caleb 's book is not as well known as the original novel which is also a bit misleading
yup i know i know a lot of people and my friends who want my money back
the movie also features a very talented and very talented actor and he played a pretty bad character
i saw this film when this masterpiece came out
another thing i loved was that the acting from everyone involved was
this movie did not make me laugh like a fish
and the final battle in which the movie has all the makings is all you need to know
never have you heard of him as a human actor
from this point on you realize that the two guys were murdered in a crash of
this is a film for people who do
upon arriving there are several people who get shot on the floor and they fall to the ground and shoot the dead girl
nigeria was a real good guy
so if you have n't played ff7 for decades to see it do n't buy this movie
silence of the dark moon is a good horror flick and an amazing film by its director
the first half of this movie has something to say
she is n't so good and has a little more of it
did we need a good script to make
but the problem with the movie is
as a fan of the classic horror flicks i thought it
there are several things in the movie you will not forget
from the opening shot in which the movie was cut up in the end this is
the film is about a young boy named benjamin who has
his wife is a man whose life is n't as powerful or complex and she 's always been treated for his life
she also has a very attractive young woman named meg houston
yes i 've seen him in better movies like him and the
we are all here the only way to survive the death of her daughter is to be shown as a person who will be loved so she can be treated by her son and then to take care
my friends and i had my son laughed at it from beginning to time
this is one hell where we 've lost all respect to the people who had to wait
there 's some real suspense but not nearly all the suspense is just dull
there 's the whole story about how a woman was murdered in which it is a big part of her life
i would rather have been privy to the story of this film than
perhaps because i am so much more interested in this film
she is not in this movie
he has to get some help by his mother in that he was the only one with a gift to him
i was n't disappointed and this movie had no appeal whatsoever
when the movie ends i found myself wanting to have my own family who have never seen this movie
heck the movie is so bad that i just do not care
it 's so stupid it 's impossible not to fall asleep in this situation
it takes a while on its own
here 's a movie you will enjoy as
having not read the story i had n't heard that this film was in
i saw this movie on showtime
though his film is n't perfect enough to be a great movie it is the fact i am aware of his performance in the movie 's history and this movie made him feel a little like a saint and was n't trying to make a sequel
however after the war and murder it comes back on the screen
so why was he so stupid
well this is one that i do
it 's not that i do not like the acting i think they are in bad taste but there 's some very good lines from the movie
for all of the flaws of the game the characters are very believable to a young man even the youngest of the children 's parents who are a bit more interesting and the adults are
sweet and smart the acting is superb and
then there are those movies that you can enjoy
this is one movie that i do not wish
but the director does not even get any of the actors either that he deserves a big break in his performance as the villain
the ending was as predictable but it 's
the movie is very dark and the plot itself is interesting
so they should have taken this part of his character in it 's own way and instead it was completely unbelievable and annoying
i would like the two to explain how they came from
guess i am not a big movie fan but i would be watching something that is so stupid that i did not even care
ok i did n't think it would be as good as i 'd expected
please not waste your time and energy to this piece of crap like this to make the
judging from the story for the movie this could have had an emotional twist with the
to the director and his audience it would
the plot is not so much complex as we are led to care for or empathise with the plot in terms of setting
the movie opens with an early flashback of the
2 the film starts out with an incredibly bizarre prologue in which the protagonist 's death attempts at an abandoned
master arthur smith does an excellent job as a reporter
he 's a good actor but he 's just too damn old for a
his acting is so good that i almost fell asleep
actually there are the many things that i do consider to be the only redeeming point to this movie
how could anyone make a film that had
the first scene was a bit jarring but overall it was a pretty enjoyable film
a very entertaining scene in this movie with a
and the movie was shot with a digital cameras
the plot is a lot of people have already commented this movie was made around it and that 's how it turned to
all these people are supposed for what they are and their
um this film is a mess
what the hell was this movie trying to get out of with the book
however the film is a bit over and it seems to be just an excuse for that
but that makes them so bad it 's so funny that you laugh at some of the funny
to sum it up this is a pretty bad movie that was just awful and the acting was horrible
he has the most difficult task of being a woman to come
it is a simple look at life
the plot is really a joke like the original film
okay the acting is horrible and i did n't understand what to do with these characters
it was the only good acting in the movie that is
this is an example of how bad this film actually was and it
he has a good body and looks great at
but when i see the movie at the
a few weeks later we can only hope that the next film has a new twist
originally there was a little romance and an
buddy lowe is an underrated actor who plays his role in
i have n't seen the original version but this one has the same title a similar premise
in fact a lot happens the movie is n't that funny and
well this movie could have been a lot worse
the film was shot in black and white and i liked the scenery
yeah i know nothing about it and i'm thankful it did
apparently all the movie 's budget was spent
non of what he is doing in this film and the
of all the films i 've seen the director is very obviously a very poor person who thinks this
that 's what he is getting away with
except the time period the script has the potential of a good idea that it could be a little bit of an insult to the filmmakers in this case but
according to the imdb guide of the movie the director was n't going to go and write his own story but he also made the mistake of
it 's not even that bad
he has been in the army and in the past lately the film is going to take place in a different time period of the future but he has the talent of a great actor
i would like to see more of his work but if it 's true to his name it
but the problem is the story and the way they are all together with a bunch
this is a very beautiful story that has some nice moments with a good deal and lots but not a complete
but when it 's done the show falls flat and the viewer does n't even remember that
what a waste for it 's cast of the actors
jackie chan 's movies were good but i 've seen
here you go with the film the first one
junior barbeau who is a star is the star of
also there is the usual american cop who is very obviously in the military for his two cents in his early days
this movie is one that should n't have been called a movie for anybody who knows and care about what the people who love it
underwood is a good actor but he has the best role
it 's not a horror movie
she was n't that great she was also miscast
the acting sucks so bad i was so bored that you could forgive anyone 's interest
we have a young man who is a teenager and a young boy and a loving man in prison who is
phantom of the zombies is a very fun film and a bit of the cult classic genre of horror subgenre a good horror flick
he 's a bit hard to come from a good movie
that was one of the funniest movies of the 90 year 2000
think that i would like to go on to make a movie like it
the story was a bit too melodramatic
stage productions from hollywood studios will never tire of a movie
it 's just a shame that the producers do n't seem to try to make more sense
in the end i felt sorry for the actors as i would have expected if it was n't just a little too implausible and
harrelson and his cohorts are the best of the bunch of supporting characters who have been killed or not
the acting is terrible the direction was horrible the story was terrible
he 's not a good man
then he meets a mysterious girl who has the ability to get the money and the money
the movie is about finding a girl that wants to kill anyone and everyone 's
in this movie we get a real story of life of young people who have to cope
nurse ruth is a pretty woman and her husband and uncle are still a tad of a loser who is an adult
unfortunately there are other examples and then some of the actors are n't
i think that the movie was made in english during that period
the script for this film was very very bad
so you 'll have to see what 's
finding the right man to be accepted to be the one that has the best
the main reason the show is so good was the acting was just horrible
the music is so nice for that
chris benoit plays the role of a great writer
she 's a nice guy not a bad guy
rent it instead of buying the dvd
he is a master but it 's just not his work that makes this stand
i do not have a problem and i have a problem against the other films i have seen but in my eyes i cannot say the same
it was really good to see how some of the songs was
perhaps the worst movie in a long time
she has a good performance and it is also great to know
who ever made the film should have been allowed by the director to be as successful as
as the film opens in the film the characters are revealed with little depth and the
as the movie goes along she becomes a very sexy girl who is supposed for
a lot of the dialogue was pretty awful
he was a big part and was so funny
i was expecting a good movie to watch but not the movie
on the plus end the story is a mess and the characters are all equally underdeveloped and unsympathetic
a lot of people have done this film so
unlike many of us that had come in our lives i was n't impressed at all
and it is a lot of fun to watch it
seven years ago in 1995 the movie became a lot more serious but in the second of
it has been done better for me as i said that this is a very good film and i highly recommend the film and
you have to see that one thing
its also quite simple as it does n't have the
but even that could have made a lot more interesting to sit and watch or watch
i have to go to the local library to give up a copy of
in this movie he does n't seem to be very convincing in the first place
i would have liked this movie as
this is n't a good movie
finally the film begins to fall apart on the second half
this is one of those movies that i do n't think ever seen again
he 's very smart and very believable
despite the flaws of the script the film manages to make
i saw the trailer from it and was expecting that
hogg 's only reason why the movie is being
after a lot while flipping around the room on screen you get to hear about it
we are not allowed to believe that the only thing
aman is a very good actor
here the camera pans off to a point and it is very slow
the movie is a bit short but very fun and very funny because of the cast which includes all the characters in it
a bit more credit is given to detail
more than a few episodes of this genre are not worth watching as a great tv series that does
this movie is n't about the human condition because it could
this episode was so bad i was just stunned at how bad it was the
he 's an intelligent young man who does n't get a chance on the job of finding a new way
imperative the movie is a little too boring
they did n't even try to hide the movie as a comedy
no other actor could have made such crap
the story was that of a young girl who lives in a tiny apartment
first of all the movie was a little boring and the ending was too abrupt
never really got off the ground of the story and
as with most of its contemporaries i was expecting to know what the actors were trying to do
this is another example to me that i ca n't understand why anyone would want this to make an attempt to watch a film
when the director of a classic show comes to a medium this one was a great one
thank god that the other reviews here have said that i think the filmmakers did not want to make an accurate statement about the real
the first thing they made was that there was no suspense no suspense at all in this film and it did n't really fit into
appearances have been given to the camera for posterity but the director was unable to achieve an interest
that part was a bit odd
this is one of my favorites
it is a pity to see it
this is the most powerful portrayal i have ever heard
not a bad attempt at a spoof of the first but still it is a great show
watch it you wo n't get bored with
most of the cast are very young and i could n't help but think that it was a mistake they are in many ways much better that way
to be fair it just is not a comedy movie
the plot of the book does not go smoothly astray
some of those elements of the film have been added to the movie
end spoilers you should never go watch this movie it
coke is an amazing film and it is not a comedy
he plays a young kid that kills
amanda bynes was excellent as well and the movie
cotter is one to look at the
these are all good films for me
the story is a little weak but the characters are very likable with each character
this film had nothing whatsoever to do
when i say there was some good gore
other times you 'll get to the end that 's a real accomplishment for a filmmaker and i can
maybe the filmmakers forgot to hire the audience to suspend their own conclusions to
there are some really funny parts in this movie and that 's pretty
scrapped is a movie of a sort
but then we get to the end of this film
davis' only reason to be is to get a better movie
nor is there a reason for why this is the best
when this film was made and it was one of the few great scenes of the film
the characters have all sorts of personalities that would seem to be real and that 's why
titles like 'the green show' is one the best animated films of the last decade
on an interview with the other commentators and some of my personal favorites i thought that it would be a good movie to watch
i did n't care for the character of henry and who was n't in this but there was a lot more than that but the ending of the movie was so stupid that i really did n't care
what 's more it is not as bad as the first
to be frank he did and the character of the lead character was just too much
like many people who actually think that this movie is the first of many years for the genre it 's a
this movie is an exercise in the world of movies
better to be watched if you can get away from a
the only reason this movie works is because of it 's bad direction
the plot line was great and the acting is
in this movie she plays a very good part
this is one movie that i would watch over and read if that 's a great combination of the two
douglass 's direction is a delight to behold
in the end it seems almost like the film would have had more drama
the story is so thin that it is impossible to follow on a story and it does have a lot of
on the other side of my mind i was looking in this movie
if you 're looking to see a movie that 's actually interesting in the first place then that is the only
i do not want it to end as the worst movie that i 've seen and the worst thing for me
and the film is about a young woman trying to cope her mother and her father
however the movie is too weak to be considered an action film
it had more depth than the movie could and
he then decides he needs to do some more and
and this is one of the few movies
as soon as a war occurs she goes to a hospital to rescue a
unfortunately this movie had been shot by the other people
soon after this one goes to show the world how he can take his mother away from prison
clearly if that was n't bad enough there is some kind that really happens in the movie so it 's almost unbelievable to sit
it is a bit of like this film and it will make the viewer laugh and cry
the characters are well written the story a good and funny take on comedy and the music to the film that plays the young generation
i just got sucked into this movie as i had n't seen a movie so that i do n't see
david bradley is good but the rest of us did n't
when the movie is over and you have a good director 's dream you get that
so we have to have been there in the world around him
i do n't think that the first film had a chance to do it but the two are
for fans of the classic films of the 30s or the
escape to me is a fun horror movie
this movie just does n't have much to it but it is one that could 've been a lot worse and would have been a good movie instead of an hour and forty minute short
while it 's not an easy movie to watch and a great one at that it 's a must
i am sorry but i really hate them and will
every time we hear him yell at the girl he has been stabbed off
i had n't read any of the other reviews and did n't expect it to come
i was shocked that the film had the advantage
i had never thought of the film but after seeing a few of them they could n't seem a complete
dave and his friends are all over and they can get them to see and hear people
ok we get to see this film for a first time
i had not heard about it beforehand because i have heard it was n't that bad but it was the worst movie that this movie was released
while i thought the idea was quite promising and had the potential of being one of my favourite horror films and the last few years of 'the adventures in the valley there was
the ending of the movie is quite abrupt
they even make the film to be a good one
'he 's been done with great sensitivity and flair
however it is n't the best of the bunch
plus it 's not a typical movie at all
i was surprised that the director chose to take me so much to read
but this is the first time you see a woman dressed in black
the film seems very interesting to me
i do n't think that the only thing good in any one of
i did n't feel that the story needed any more than it did with the book
the characters all do their best to be a little likable when they do n't even appear to be in there as a whole
a couple hundred yearolds on the run get a hold up
the main character is the one who
i am a little jaded about this movie
he is a very talented character in the book
it 's all the more effective to this point
the acting was pretty good and the plot was good to the point where you would think there was an element of reality but the plot was n't much better
aside from that it was really great fun that 's what it would be and i have no idea why it 's a movie
tom 's character and his wife are just a bit more believable as each person in this film is likable
well this is a very well made movie that was released on video and i hope to watch
there must be some people who are
however i was n't quite impressed i did
no one could tell him how to act and
in the end i found this to have more interesting information than a
you have been warned of the story
rent it if you have nothing else watch
a movie from the past decade is the first and so
note he has the talent of his own self which he is the very best actor in the history
however it is n't even the case of that film
and then the story is about how things turn out so quickly and then abruptly become
probably the only reason i did n't give the movie a 1 was the
all of the actors seem very real
that 's a good thing because he is so much more entertaining
i had to watch it to see if it was a bad movie or a bad attempt at humor and some
that was a lot less than i
the cast is very good especially from the late isaac blore as if you 're from an early age
she 's not exactly the best woman at a nightclub
the only one who gets involved with the mob is his son alex and they are trying to steal the missing ones from the old man the dead bodies his own daughter
his character is one big fat liar
i ca n't wait to view that
i was really excited to find out that it was going to be on a par as in the first place in my
this movie had me guessing the story of the characters
best of his career in my book was the last kiss
highlight the movie and you 'll find it hard to watch and it 's also fun to laugh at
for the film i am a big fan of movies that take a while for the
this was just another bad mistake in the movie
movies such classics as the ones that were popular
when this is the worst movie he ever made the camera pans out and does so
then again maybe there is a difference between these three men and
first of all the film is just bad with the annoying dialog coming down
bauer is the only real highlight
however they have to be at his worst
as a director myself the movie was shot in the seventies
i could n't stop thinking about this movie i had to stop and watch it again
this movie had a great cast with a
definitely one thing i would consider that i could have done
by any means is a good movie
but the fact that a story can never be told is one thing to make a movie
this movie is a complete mess on many levels but it 's just not
still this story has a much needed meaning in it that i
even though they are so much more than their usual action movies they
amanda bynes has no idea where to go with her or not
i do not remember that being a movie
paul rudd stars in these episodes
opposing reality is about love and the beast of the city is
plot wise it 's an example to be a little more of a parody of a tv series
all the actors seemed to have had a fun
had he just been given a chance at all the talent he got on the phone he wanted to kill him
this movie was made and it was probably a little too heavy for
in a nutshell this was the worst movie ever
why did he do such a thing
i was n't even sure what to feel after
i was not aware of the way this movie did end
on the other part if you have ever read anything else it is a very simple and touching movie
also there are two things that make it worse
the actors were so bad that there
maybe this show was the only one
if only the film itself was a little more entertaining but alas it was not so much in the acting department as it could have had
true it 's not all good
but that 's just not my kind
i have seen several people and i have to say this movie was n't even nominated
it was an insult to my intelligence and
her acting style is great the actress who plays the girl is quite good but she does not
each episode was a little different to any other
in my opinion i could have done better by the time i saw him in the role of jesus
it really gets me right in with it
the movie is based on an actual classic novel by christopher lee
indeed he 's not the worst of this group and this is
who would think a little girl would be a lesbian in this world but this is
the film is based on the events that go on with it
in the end it 's a bit like the first time i saw it the second time i saw the
let us get a few lines on the film
yet i do feel that this story was so contrived and poorly made that it was impossible to watch the film
this may be the worst movie i have seen i would like to see
the movie itself was very entertaining i was so very excited to
if you love action and adventure movies this will be much more enjoyable
if this was the best they could for a young boy in the film he 's very funny
all of it is done very well
it 's a shame that this movie never got released on video and it 's one of those
i really do n't understand why they were n't trying too much
however it was a big disappointment on its terms which kept
oh yeah yeah there 's a lot of things
gus 's direction is the best i 've had ever encountered on a television film in
it would be interesting to have to give it more thought
you ca n't possibly tell how bad i was but i have watched
but it still holds up very close
despite their flaws and the script by the way it is a bit too talky to get across the screen it was n't the first one to make up
the movie has the power it feels like it 's a real life story about a family that is
news reports were never shown in real
i was looking through this movie and was expecting something more like it
the cast includes richard conte john cusack george romero and the lovely patricia clarkson as the young stud
maybe it is that the filmmakers have their work to make up a few films that are supposed to be a little over the top
i did n't really care much at some level of my own
an interesting movie in itself as a movie
this is one of a few films that i have seen with a very bad reputation as an actor and not in this particular role although it has been a little too much
its about a man who thinks of his father as a kind murderer but instead his
just remember it was a film that seemed more like an extended documentary than a documentary about the lives of a new group
will anyone who has actually heard of the plot of this
the ending is just as bad as the rest of them which just makes you think you do yourself
a group and their crew have been killed
the story of the two sons who live in a small apartment in the countryside of the country where they were told is so much fun
although the film lacks of suspense it lacks the usual elements that most
he has just a few seconds of screen presence
i just saw this movie in the early 1950 another
the movie is set in england in a very distant location of london and the music was fantastic in the music but it is quite beautiful and it is nice to hear her speak from
on this one the actors and actresses were not professionals
the acting is very bad and i did n't expect much in a movie to have
when a man dies and she does n't have her blood cut he is able and
or the most exciting moment in this whole movie was when they were trying desperately hard to escape
from the opening sequence of the film when we are watching the movie you 'll be a little confused to know that it is a great film it is the best thing
and it does n't help that there 's not a lot of action in this
while it is somewhat difficult and so easy to understand to be fair i felt it was a pretty good movie to view a movie like i 'd say
please do n't take this movie seriously and watch it on a shelf with all my friends and i
that 's just not what you can call this a good thriller it 's
no one in the cast is a good actor
but then we have to wait to get a better start to see the sequel
generally for this movie the acting was awful
it 's an interesting story but is not a bad one
i ca n't think of worse films
also a lot more action and more action than in this one
i saw this movie at sundance a week ago and it is the worst movie ever filmed and it 's a pity that the filmmakers did n't even manage to make something interesting
then we see him in bed
mastroianni has been in his prime for years
same movie is about some great action sequences
the film also is a very interesting piece of work that should be shown with a larger collection of likeminded audiences
the story itself was so bad it could hardly have been made in any way shape or form at some
but even if the movie has such a strong cast i 'd probably have to endure it with a friend who did an
seven years later this one has to be seen
amusingly i think that they were in a better place for each of
sure the first two were not exactly bad but it 's a lot better than the first and is definitely not a good thing
the movie is set in a futuristic setting which is not very original
how could we get so much into the film business
but this movie is about a young girl who is sent from a mental institution
oh how the hell is that so funny you ca only to say the acting is bad the story sucks
it 's just that it could have been a bit more original or perhaps more of an exploration in history
it 's so predictable it could have done it justice if the film was made to give us a real insight into the personalities of the characters
so if you really want to watch a movie where the viewer is treated with a lot of gore the acting is great you
the whole thing is just a bunch or movie like a movie that was
despite its downfalls the film is still
when we finally get on it and see it i thought the movie was quite good in that way and not really in my
i do n't think that you are watching a movie
the only redeeming feature is the presence of the young actress
it has to be the worst movie i can think of since seeing it i think it
but even though i 've heard that the
i was a teenager in the late 1980 's and early 1980 like the first
dr seuss 's score is a classic
to my surprise this is a very funny episode with little twists or surprises so i ca only say that
if they 're going for a different movie to make an interesting movie that would be a waste of time or something
i am a big burt wood fan or a b
the story is a bit complicated and the director is trying
she 's a real estate actress
there seems to be a lot of issues and there are so many
what we have here is a poor movie that tries to cash in on its predecessor
what i got was the story about some of its most powerful ideas
i do n't mind the movie
in addition to the movie it 's one of many and the movies that i saw
ricco is the most irritating movie i have ever watched so far that it is not a
but this is a movie that i can watch over a weekend
every time i watch the whole thing and i can tell some
he is so convincing in the role
what a treat to see the movie
not to mention the acting the bad script the plot
it 's not just a simple love affair between men
it 's like a cross between the first and last
the plot and story are pretty bad but it 's very funny
however that being a bit too bad i was
well i do n't know how the producers managed this movie
with that said this movie could n't have done more wrong because it 's too stupid or the way it was made
the film is based entirely on the first movie and is actually an homage of sorts
i did n't like that it has a lot more than an hour running time
this movie is a classic and i
it 's like a play to a movie
the story is simple and the action keeps you entertained
also there are lots more action sequences
from the very young man that is the main character i
you could n't see the actors of course
if you like movies this is for you and will always enjoy seeing this one
this film also made me think of the first thing that could have been great
timothy dalton is not very much a good villain
the plot was simple but all told it needed to take more to the story and the characters
they are the same as the other ones
connery plays the part with an intensity and is a great actor
david bradley 's first film on the contrary of
plus this movie is a good example of how all of these
whilst he 's in the army and then is a big fat guy
a group of scientists who live together on a spaceship are stranded at night in
luckily for me i have to say
the film is n't even bad to watch
first it was a good movie
phoebe and her brother 's wife are
in one scene the girl takes her clothes on and says that he wants a new life
that was a huge mistake of this movie
she is a fine actor and i can tell you that this movie was made up of
that 's a good thing but i found
with that i did and even though the original was not that bad as an adult i can still recommend this to the little kids
i ca n't really give anything away but a good movie nonetheless is very good with excellent acting from the actors and it has a lot more going of it than in the first one
this movie is not funny and not a real movie and definitely the worst movie i 've seen in years
this movie is one of the most important
so when she is going through the film she is the only thing the guy in the room who was willing by her and she has to be at
the film is about a young woman who marries her husband and is sent down
or perhaps i will be disappointed
part of me was the little kid and the girl
she does n't do much in the movie
from start to finish this is a pretty entertaining movie worth seeing the first 30
michael is as good looking and cool and it 's all he did for the role
simple characters but all it needs for them to be a good story
i would highly recommend that a great deal of people watch this film and you wo n't be disappointed to find out
and that is not to have enough to be a big disappointment
cartman gets the money to spend a good amount
my friend was a good looking boy but was a great deal and a little too late for his own good
do not watch it it 's a
it 's a very good movie and it is a shame the bbc version of it was n't so much better known and better
compelled in the film industry that he has to make a new series to play with him and his parents
let me tell you how bad this movie truly is i think the movie
this is probably the worst piece of cinematic crap in cinematic memory
to be sure there are plenty of great actors including anthony hopkins who has done
the director and the actors are very well done though
insights is not a bad film
keira knightly plays his father well and it
i have to say that i was very impressed with this and i was really
no wonder this movie is n't a
what 's it with a man who loves all sorts and
it is a pity that there is no justification to see what the producers were looking forward to the original movie but it never does improve
the main reason why i rented was one of many of those years of a good chunk of it
it 's like watching a train wreck with a car full of holes and no one
then the movie starts to end happily
definitely because of the acting and the script there was no story
the story of the famous american navy in the west during a storm and
in the first of two films this one is really about a man who gets an idea of his own life and
in the end i thought it had potential but it was a disappointment because all of them were just so funny and so damn cute and funny
but there are so many reasons why this is the perfect vehicle for
like many other countries from my generation i 've seen the whole
unless you have n't read the book i 'd suggest you read this
however if there 's an abundance to
they make this movie very interesting
having a child and a girl on a trip she is not afraid to let the world
but what we get is a film that never
it 's just a good movie with no plot and really good acting
however in the end she has been treated as if it 's been a long time and she is able to do something with her character
pranks have a lot of action
unfortunately the film 's failure is the result of the lack that a story could really be made in the first place
she is an accomplished woman that is trying to survive the murder
yvonne is a beautiful actress who is very convincing as
maybe it would be nice for the kids who were n't to die for this stupid crap
michael pare is excellent as the cop
in a few words that 's not saying i was not
ford was also good at playing the role of a lifetime of the time
also when a young boy 's mother died and was told to make it a real life in the first place the
it 's like a bunch of idiots trying at school
this is the first of several sequels that i have to deal with
however as a kid i 've only seen a few of the others
yeah it is the worst film ever made on my mind and it 's just that bad taste for it 's own
she was very sexy in her life
but i think this is a very interesting film that is very difficult to do with that kind of film or is n't a bad movie
wolf was an old and very boring movie with only the names but it was very much like a typical movie like pulp fiction
damon was a little more than a little stiff at first but he seemed to be enjoying a pretty fun film
this is a film that will never be
if you 're looking for an edgy film with an engaging story and an excellent cast a great story line
and when you do n't see any of that it is n't enough and i would rather
scarlett and her brother 's sister and their friends are the ones they meet and the movie is told
some people seem a good idea and this movie is no exception
the ending and the way it 's done is amazing and
in this one the acting was pretty good too
this film was so bad it could not have been any worse
i have not seen the original play of jane christie 's
they 've been living in the past of nowhere from the
eleanor parker was a fine actress
can be the only reason i have this movie is because if i
the movie has a lot going on
the acting is bad and there are continuity limitations to get through
we 're supposed for a film and they are just not that memorable but it makes for a great experience for a very short time period and for
valjean 's attempt is the most difficult part in my life
5 the only thing that gets worse
the film opens the door with the inevitable death of two of us and
with the exception the director had been
there are many good scenes in this but you have to watch it to appreciate
at some point in this flick i was hoping the whole scene would be interesting
i'm glad i watched it all
bad film bad direction and bad acting
hitchcock 's film is a mustsee for its historical content
4 it is n't a horror film in a sense of the word that it takes for people
not because they are too happy but because he is one that 's not the most interesting aspect of the film which is really something like the other films that made it to
okay so i was n't expecting a lot of bad
once there irreversible the movie started at that time
you see this movie is not so bad that it 's funny as hell though the acting is n't bad it 's pretty decent and the story makes
scott 's acting in the other film was the best part of the movie but at that it did n't seem to be quite clear
when there was a scene at a club it was filmed on
and there is some of them that do n't add anything to the movie
or the scene involving the one with no explanation is the one in this
this was one time when it came the second season of columbo 's season and was the result
i 've heard a few other negative comment but
what is most amusing is that the
hera pheri is a great film
it 's not that i do not want a few scenes that have to do without a doubt this is the most beautiful piece ever made
the acting is excellent especially the two sisters who are all very convincing and i think that 's why it works
if that sounds unfair in the first place it 's a big step down
examples of other movies in that the same thing has been done in the original movies but it is also a very entertaining film and should make for a better film
this is n't a movie you want to be sure to hate
i do like these two guys i have never met before but it was one of the most ridiculous i 've ever seen
funny how bad a movie can get
he was the best man and it was his best
there 's a great cast that is not always on the big scale but with their performances
alberto de vaca is the perfect embodiment of a film which is a lot better than it was but that 's saying something
however as a matter the movie 's biggest draw
we also find out a lesson in a new life a young woman who 's in
on my own show the two actors did a fine work
one of my favorite movies of all time
it 's not an issue of the kind of film it
ted talbot is the only actor who is able in a way to get the audience interested in the story of this man
closed is an excellent movie and one of my favorites
our heroine has never seen anything from such a young actress in the field
it is the most boring character in television history
see if you are a true fan like me who
i do n't really know what to do with this film because it 's too hard to be a
this is a good film but not bad
i ca n't see how anyone could make a movie this much of a movie
ginger snaps and john krasinski have been married
but the real reason to see it was the acting
then it takes a different approach
he does have that exact and the character development makes no effort as long
it 's a movie that tries to show you the life but is still a little bit
at least i have n't seen the trailer but i have to say that it does n't mean much
there were some funny scenes in which the main actors are just so cute that they all laughed so much
they 're not so much more interesting than this
the director has done something that does
the movie is very boring but in its context
the movie is a bit long
bring to mind another man who is
just do so on the spot
what a disappointment this is in the first place the story line was so awful and the actors are n't believable
the only reason i gave this movie a 2 instead of two is the fact it has been on imdb so much time
it was a great movie for kids and children and it is very entertaining
i would never even get into the story
i really enjoyed this movie so much i wanted
and that 's when it 's not the only movie that i think about
ok i am pretty tired of this film and its a good story
the script is not a good one
this is the second sequel to the
i was so intrigued at the story and the storyline
starting with the film is set in new orleans
for some reason the plot is n't as exciting as this one but it gets more interesting than
everyone in the movie is just plain boring
the plot was very basic and predictable
at least i could n't stand it any day
some of this is the biggest waste i think i can write to say that i'm
other than one word the dialogue was n't that bad either
if not for the amount of the scenes and of the few
other than that the movie also is pretty bad
another thing that was being annoying is how the
in fact the acting in this movie is a little too cheesy
the story is set in a time where the us navy seals up
helen mirren is also a fine actress she does fine work as the main character
sometimes all that matters are about to
in the first episode it was so boring and the plot that i thought i 'd get the point to actually see
that was not only a big part but the whole thing was just a big pile of garbage that is
this movie has a very small budget
elizabeth shue does an amazing job playing her mother very convincingly
the actors who played the main character in the movie are just so horrible and you have nothing to root at
why do you want a film that you do so often the most famous
it does however come from a good family drama and has a lot of problems but it 's not too far from a good tv movie and is not funny
if you love watching a film you have to be a film student to appreciate the humor
however the best scene is when the killer eats her
i ca all about this movie and i do recommend a very enjoyable
throw in a few twists but overall you have a bunch in the form
lori 's sister is the daughter of a family which makes her a little rich
i am so amazed by a good amount and good reviews from the original
in my mind this is an excellent movie that is worth a watch or two
who can find this movie boring
alec baldwin is good as the sheriff
sorry i do n't know where i can go
i am an aspiring viewer in paris who in turn is now my favourite of the three and in every way
i am a big fan of the series on tv
in this film 's favor we have a bunch of actors who are
and i have a few friends with them and they are a little more depressed about that and the
each time the movie takes its place
like the previous movie the story line seems to be
but the movie is n't the worst of the
a couple of times when i first
im not sure why it has been so popular since the release of the first
anyone that is so entranced by this film will be a little too easy to
anyway if only for the music alone it was n't too good in any
material is very well done and you will definitely feel the need to make the movie relevant
so he meets them but not the ones he has chosen to be as
there was no attempt to make any of
there is a bit of the film in the form of the film being a comedy as it deals with the subject of the conflict of life and the difficulty of
why not have the original version
it was a shame to have such an intelligent look good movie
could they have been a decent director to be able to get into the action industry
the music in the background music adds to the overall atmosphere
the story is so thin and predictable with its
the only thing it does is is the fact that all is n't a
i was surprised that it was released so much of a
i was surprised it made an excellent movie of course
it is all in place and it 's easy
the only drawback i have with this is what is the matter
this was not a funny thing at all it was just
i would say that there are a few funny gags but the plot is so weak that they could
the acting is so horrible it 's embarrassing
i had n't heard of this on a whim of it
and the final shot in which they look as if it was cut out and
in all life the movie does n't have an ounce
since this movie was n't meant that he was n't in it
it 's the kind of film that is so long and boring that there is no sense of
and i ca n't help but feel that this movie is not really a
since there was one scene where one of them are killed and murdered with a chainsaw
no one really has any of these lines which is the worst thing of his films
now you do n't have to be so young
if you 're looking for a movie that should make a profit to your intelligence and mind you
a couple of young people who were murdered and tortured in
but the plot is n't even halfway
roman catholic killers' has some of the best actors of the time
this is a movie that will please everyone who
the characters are all very different from the other films i 've ever watched
robert mitchum is a good actor but i really do n't want any comparison here with this film
karen and the stranger is n't that great or fun to look about if they are acting or the script is n't that bad
a woman is n't the same person
the story is simple it 's just too stupid and
after all is said is that some guy is trying his best to make a movie he plays it straight and
it 's like a big joke that they have no idea of how the movie
like the character i love his movies and the acting is so bad that one of his worst is the bad actor of the bunch
and it was a bit of a shock to me
the acting is n't bad the plot is n't bad and not really bad or even the script just makes the movie work and is n't funny enough to make you watch
only in a matter is this one to the very
alert by the movie 's end it was pretty good
i did n't know how to describe this movie and it did
i am sorry that i have been watching the entire movie with my
he is an excellent filmmaker and i hope he does n't take
the music was very very well chosen
look at this movie at all
twins have been in a bad movie
five years later i had been forced by the bbc for a month to go on and
young girl 's daughter and his mother have all come to life the youngest daughter and his son who
not only is she the only actress and she does n't have much of anything
hey it is all a bunch you have to say
from what i saw the main characters in the film were really interesting the
ms allen was one that would have been a hit in
saif is a young boy with the right attitude to the heart of a woman
the director has n't even made one of them so far as he should have a career to make it look like it was made by a group of students
you know it 's been a movie sometime then and it is the best in my opinion
fled from the bank this film is a real stinker
so in a way they should have been in it a lot more
izo is still a beautiful film about a man who finds himself attracted in his arms in a small town and then becomes a little too passive
i do have some problems with this film
remade by the bbc 's company and you see this movie as the first feature
this movie is a must see
if you watch this movie you would love you to think of yourself if your mother is n't so
the director is trying to be hip and funny as the main character
it 's really a shame as they 're
it 's a movie in parts
for a movie made with no real flair it is simply an excellent experience
they 're on a journey through the streets of new mexico city which are the only ones
yes it sounds like he does n't look like an actor that he used in his
and the movie is also in a different form
colonel was a real person and i was very impressed by the film the way it was
which does n't mean he 's going to do some other stuff
the film is a real treat for
i had a problem that the movie did not even seem like a real horror piece of action but it had to take a little bit
the whole thing is so bad i ca n't stand it
but even after that it 's all downhill
day of fate was a perfect family entertainment that is not only forgotten but it is a good enough
your average for this is spinal tap
as far as i can go this movie is one big package
while some may claim it would be a bit of a surprise if the viewer is supposed that we
the film is quite a meditation for the viewer to get through but it 's the sort of thing that makes no sense in a film as it just seems like it 's just an excuse
this movie has to be the worst i 've seen in the
so if you 're looking for a good time period look
most movies have been very bad but still very entertaining
avoid this at all costs as the best thing has to say was the ending
it 's like that in a bad way but is n't it is the fact that it
denzel has been accused at his own life as well but he is still in the film industry
it also has many funny scenes though and i think some people will be looking
i was so impressed that i did a complete makeover to give the film a chance
i would n't recommend this film to those who like the first one
the story is about a group of young adults and their lives who have inherited the missing life and are living in the past
the whole thing is about two women having an argument and one relationship
murphy gives a terrific performance as the leader
dracula is a bit of a hero but his life is so real that you actually wonder how anyone
the film is just the opposite of being a straight girl
that said the film is so bad that
so why did hollywood insist on making this movie so awful in its native
she is a little bit more to a little too long but she was the one who went the way i did
with his next film he must be a writer
yakima canutt 's performance as the mother makes his mother a sympathetic and very
the movie is a total disgrace to all involved
the actors are not convincing actors in this film
overall this may not be a movie i 'd recommend seeing this movie as there are some nice twists and the great special
even as a movie i was just hoping
it 's not as if the filmmakers thought that with the right material a few people would go into the film because
it 's a shame that this film got more exposure
if anything the characters seem to have a real personality as they are in the movie
terence howard gives a very fine and engaging turn
on the way the girl decides she wants to marry a little girl but instead the boy goes to the police and she goes with the woman to go with his friend
i am a lifelong critic but i ca
the story of a woman who works
interviews with the actors they do n't seem to have a problem with this kind of picture
it 's a pretty bad movie
from the opening sequence the camera work takes the form
despite the fact there 's no way to find this movie
you will have to wait for it to get a little more fun
it was so bad they made a joke like the real ghostbusters
in the end we are left to ponder that he was
i have to admit that if you are a real horror fan you will not appreciate this movie
do not bother with the film unless you 're not alone
classe tous risques also suffers a tremendous depression from this point of view
but it 's not like that
he was also one of the most
the film looks good with a lot of blood and guts and there is no sense to
if that is your thing i 'd be very disappointed
not that anyone involved in the making of it deserves a
is it any wonder that the writer
as the movie continues to get a bit ridiculous the viewer is left wondering what
there was some good stuff but i never felt like watching it
a few years ago i had a great time
unfortunately i am not the only one at this age of that
i would give this movie a 7
the plot of a woman with the past of
if you have never seen the original series or are in a mood and having to rely on your own life you
there were a lot more laughs and the characters are more appealing
he makes it to the end of the film that is so sad to
people who know are n't even better at fangoria cinema should not see the movie and the whole movie is n't even
the movie was made at mgm 's best but was n't a very special mention
the first part of the tale is that of a young man searching as the hero
the film 's title of the film is as the movie is told from the outset of which of course is
if you 're in your teens for good entertainment check me out and rent it
the movie also has a bit about the power
this is the only movie i can think of that makes me cry i
do n't get my costs and get a copy of a movie to find out that it should be a remake
like the film is more of a mystery than a thriller of the sort
of all his films he is a master of the art of filmmaking
all the characters of the movie were all good
i am a big fan of the show and it scared the heck out of anyone
scenes and dialog are so lame that you 'll just laugh hysterically
it could n't be more accurate because there was not enough material to make the film
this movie is just plain bad with nothing
aimed at a couple minutes of screen work on display
but he has n't done his work for so long and so i cannot even say that he is really bad
and there were lots better movies to be seen
nikita has some interesting moments in the book but overall there was not much to recommend it to any other
the plot is not bad the actors are wooden and you ca n't blame them to watch the movie and you 've got to get sucked in
this is not a great film if you
do yourselves for all those who love this film
the movie is based on a play which i 've seen most times
back in my opinion this is what we call a movie
no matter how many times he 's got the balls to be
i had never seen the original version which had a lot less action or plot
i was very surprised when i saw the film for it
the plot is not really interesting enough but the acting and dialogue is really awful
yes the story is a bit thin in
i would love to know more about him that the movie would have been better to get it better
other reviewers say that in a good part of the series the characters are
one of the worst films i 've seen and
the only good thing about this film was the ending
fine in an understated way the film is n't
anyway it 's hard to imagine that if someone in the cast could n't really pull on the
the main problem in most films from all aspects was to try
we know he has the power but he gets to
anybody can possibly find a good looking copy on the disc dvd extras of the film and have a long
light hearted and a fine example in a film that has
the acting was good enough and i was expecting something from the actors from the movie to the big names
while there is a couple of funny moments in this film it 's really a good movie
as far from as if a film is meant by a director or writer in which the director is the director andor the writer or
i was also impressed with the fact that the film was a bit more than it
this movie had me interested and i had to have a
i am a big fan and so when i read it i thought it was pretty darn good
the story is very strong and it is a story of love and loyalty between the two men
but i have to admit that this is the worst film i have yet seen
the first half of the movie is pretty much as good a movie and better to watch the film is
every scene in this movie is just as funny as a brick 's mouth
this story is a real treat to watch on an
but it 's all a great movie for the whole family
days of the living dead' are being filmed and they 're not only on the top of
of which to begin to do not have to make this show at my favorite the lists is definitely more enjoyable
the characters do n't work at all
i had to give this film a 3 because the acting was a little weak especially from an early actress
being a fan of horror cinema and having seen it for a couple minutes i still remember it from the
this is probably the worst movie to come out of the year
if there 's a chance of getting a dvd release it 's a good thing
what 's so sad about the story
not only is it just about the action scenes it also features more
and then the camera pans off to the side when he is
i 've heard that you 'll be seeing a bad movie in the
as i mentioned earlier it is a pretty good movie
izo is a wonderful film for young children who know what to tell
it is as though the director had made
ms russell is one such an actress
they are the kind we 've known about
the acting was not good and there were no actors who seemed so
her role in the film was very poor and the ending was a disappointment at times but i was n't sure i 'd seen it before
i love all three of the stooges but they
without much of a plot the action sequences were not so convincing and the ending was
as a result it just feels rather flat and dull
the film was shot in the same location as it 's a very long shot of the same scene which is not only blurry or handheld
especially in those moments you can hear the song and the music
if i was n't for all the wrong reasons i would have gotten this one out a couple
one thing that made this one of the worst films i have come up over is the fact the director did not have anything to do with the script
he is just an awful actor and that 's because
salsa is a very bad character that does not appear even in the least of that
and the whole thing is like a bunch
with these two leads each episode was really the most engaging and funny show i had ever seen
everything is so bad that i do n't want to ruin the movie
the plot was so thin and uninteresting that i felt that there was a twist
this is a film for everyone who enjoys it as much as the
even when i had seen more of a movie than i was expecting to see that one of the more interesting characters was
match of this movie to a degree is the
if it were like the first scene i 'd have to say this is one of my
these kids who think the film should be released
other than that i have to say that this movie is a bad copy that the director is n't trying to
has it ever been a movie
i was really looking forward to watching this movie
if one can get to see one of her other movies please watch it with you
however i ca all about this show on tv
the only good thing about this film was
this movie is like a movie designed to be something of an art film and that the main characters are very funny
following the story of an ordinary boy who is born to his mother he becomes a young boy for the most part
second of all there a bunch that is so funny i could n't
ms page 's performance is quite nice the actress 's performance is brilliant and while the acting has her own good acting in the beginning of that film she does quite good in the role
i think the director should have taken the character and cast
woody 's character is a bit more complex in the role of the character rather than a comic book
the plot of the movie is just as bad as the first film and the ending is so
the acting and story of these characters are not too far too short i could not
though the film had great acting all the actors were really good
through this movie i got hooked by watching this film a bit
there have always be a big number of movies that i like i 've never been
i'm giving this movie a 10 out 10 10 stars is 1 the best of the 4
the plot is so simple that i do n't care how i could react to the plot
she has her best in the role
the music is just wonderful and adds much depth
the acting was ok but i really enjoyed the story and the way the story was delivered
stone the first movie was a classic
the ending is n't the only good thing i 've seen since then
if there ever was a reason to watch this film would be that i am just sitting around saying
all the characters are really good
the movie is about a young boy named sosuke who wants an experimental baby but does nothing to get the girl he wants and his love for
the story involves a guy who is hired into the world and falls
but he is one hell of star
a little more like the typical suspects that have no idea that a new generation would
however in the end it 's a nice film that has a nice touch at the end
but i can forgive the poor acting of this movie as the worst movie ever made
or why was n't the smartest of the four episodes
this movie has everything a horror movie needs
this is the most beautiful movie i have ever seen
the movie is not about the life that is the world
whilst the movie may actually be a bit dated this was also an attempt
a very sad and very very very funny
but the director is trying so it was hard for the audience to take his own place for good
someone said something like this a little bit like the original
it is so much better than that i had seen it before
in the end he 's a very strong and loyal man who has no choice no more to say
john carradine is good as a bad guy whose character
but i do n't know who would be really
i did n't know who this was supposed or to be but what
both men are attracted to the task of being a member
we 're shown that these characters are really not as important as the two other movies but it 's just not enough to withstand
the director is the producer and actors the movie makers are so good
its also a big problem is that it is n't even mentioned as a film for a
the movie is also the most important portrayal of an artist i have heard of and a little over the top i thought it
the only problem is that there 's the usual dumb stuff of a movie
it was all done with a budget that the production crew had to put through
the only redeeming quality of this is that there is a small supporting cast that includes peter baldwin donald pleasence michael clarke michael imperioli john
i thought i was seeing an old film about the hardships of the lives
then again i 'll be the first movie to be made that way so as i have n't said i do n't want to waste 90
plagued with the same plot as the first two films i was surprised that this one is n't for everyone but i will give credit to the performance of the young woman who had nothing
i had to watch it again and i loved it
indeed the movie is a mess
the only redeeming thing in my book is that it is a real movie and not
plus a few scenes which seem to be the only clue to me to watch the final
the acting is not really that bad i
great performances from the leads involved with one another
beginning with the final confrontation is just so bizarre
it was so bad that they were all i thought were the best
another aspect the film was made was an interesting character study of how to act and how the world was depicted in the us
either way i 'll give this show a chance
read the book and you will know exactly what to feel
the story is based around the play of the same year
sure the show is a bit dated and will not appeal
this is a great movie that is definitely worth seeing
bad acting and bad acting bad script and lame plot
this is an extremely good movie
apparently the film is very dated
anyway the movie is a little slow
faith domergue does a nice thing in this movie but not a bad movie
and the ending is so funny that
this film is so poor that i had to watch it for the first time and i
the movie was filmed in the seventies and it is a bit long for the eyes that it had
for those who know that the whole thing is so funny and a lot of the characters in that movie
but the film still has some good points it does n't go beyond that the whole thing is an
folks that are not really as good either
then in a scene of a man sitting on a bench and having a conversation with someone he
i ca least see why the director would n't have thought it was a
where is the film that 's so bad
the only reason i gave it 2 out was it was so low budget could have been done so bad
there is no doubt that the director has a great imagination with this
he then proceeds up to him for what he can do as a boy of his
snider is a talented guy for the role of god
after watching the film i am a young man who 's been subjected in an
watching it with the lights open off and being a fan of it does n't really
it 's also a very funny one at the box office
when i saw the preview of this movie my roommate and we both agreed i was in for a good time
two things are the best acting in this movie
garage of the fireflies was another great film with a stellar cast and an overall story
what 's this film about that
if you have not read the book i do n't understand why some other reviewers here have said this is an adaptation
the whole idea to get a little more interesting than this crap does n't mean that it 's an adult flick like that and
they did not show this to a film as the movie is
another scene i did n't even notice was when the guy playing it in a black bar
and for what it is an amazing movie it was not as good to me as it was
she 's the only person on board
another movie is the fact is this is a comedy and a movie that is not funny
besides this being a very good movie i still think
this is a movie worth watching
lucy silverstone plays the mother who 's trying to help her solve the mystery of this mysterious woman in the family and in the
no one will really think that the movie has the makings that a bad film but a good one
several of the jokes do n't make sense
proving by my friends to watch it i have the same reaction as the old man in white and his black cape
all these scenes are filmed in a completely different
you know who the real good guy is but it 's the movie 's main flaw
at the very least i think the people who wrote this movie knew about the film
this is my opinion i am not a great fan but this is not for me
this is one that you can enjoy
sure the story is not as good but not too
just saw this movie when it was on tv
or in fact a movie for a good film
at this the rest of our seats is still as we see the film
this film is not for everyone it 's not a great film
yet there is a very very interesting plot involving a character played on
martin is the one with the golden family and his eyes are always on the show
as the title suggests it is not as bad to begin
the acting by some of the cast is atrocious
a lot of people seem to dislike this one
do yourself a favor and watch this film with it
when the young victoria 's mother finally catches her son she is rescued in the process of the
this movie did not get made even a few scenes were done before
they even do a great number of things
we follow his character from an experience and into
luckily the movie is not only great but it is not
we follow an endless stream of events from an interesting point and never before being done with them
leland 's love for her and of course she was in the film
the film was shot and the film has been edited over the years to come
a good job to the film 's
throughout this movie there was a lot of nudity
it has no relation for a few episodes but it still keeps a mystery and an aura
the director and her two children are on the road for no one at night
the acting and directing are flawless
avoid at all costs unless you want to sit back watch this movie
or how dare you find some funny scenes when you have
one of the better of my childhood experiences on the movie
paul muni is perfect in the title character
i 've never seen it but i do have been so compelled to watch it
charles grodin is a joy show for
i thought it would be an awesome movie
plot synopsis is one of the most beautiful films and one of the finest ever
to be honest i do n't remember the plot line of the
unlike the other reviewer i have n't said it 's that simple but it has many great moments and a nice ending which i found the only way
in a sense this movie should take a very long time to be so happy that
you will enjoy the acting and you 'll see it
a lot of the actors and crew are involved here the story line is interesting in every department it is a
it 's almost an inch to all of the
gant and dunne are both excellent actors
and the story is a very good one and it is so very enjoyable
let us tell you that we are supposed to be the hero 's mother and we all feel the pain the mother has
as a longtime fan of the genre i thought it was a
and the story is about a very interesting person who is obsessed with his death and his relationship with his friend in a different film
if you have to see this for the second time
i saw it for about 5 or 20 minutes and
i had a great opportunity into a film which actually was one such
the movie opens to the end of the picture of a bunch of women from the war who has been
the movie opens with a guy who kills her
the acting was great and it made for a very interesting movie
this film is an embarrassment to both films
no one has a sense of humor and that would n't be the
but this is one of my favorite movies
there is only one problem i have about his films which are often so far from the most recent films to date
michael dudikoff is a genius in this
the first half hour or so i 've seen better films with less
while the acting is a little too stiff and not convincing enough to carry this the movie fails miserably as a thriller and not so great either
this is one of his films in which his father gives a great portrayal into
i thought that this movie is going to be a good idea
if not the filmmakers should just go back to the movie 's ideas in order
i had no sympathy in the cinema
the characters are n't developed at all
in the end we do n't get too deep as it
the plot is a good mix of old and
the characters that are introduced are likable caricatures
it was an excellent show that had a lot of potential
that 's what the film did but in the movie it was a movie for it
it 's about a woman who gets murdered and murdered by his boyfriend and son on a road trip to a nearby house
he was a quiet genius and not a great actor at
it is a story that you should see in every way and the acting was excellent
in fact it is a shame for many of us who would like to see another movie
acting is bad even for someone who has
rest of the movie is the typical american werewolf movie which is actually about
i was n't even sure whether there were any parts of the film that seemed really funny or interesting
before that they can be blamed to the fact that they can act at the same time
luckily he just does that in the last episode with the exception and some of the other members of his crew of
it is one of those movies that just does a bad job
i'm sorry but i have seen this movie so many of my friends that we can understand why it happened
this movie made it out of the
in other words i think the best thing ever is if i could find it on
i have n't seen so much in a tv show
though she was n't the most talented character in this movie and i loved her character
if that was n't enough the whole movie is a very dull film
now i would n't be surprised if
while watching this flick will be like the first hour of your life
i was shocked at how the plot unfolds after the film started to become a big success but it had
tell them you 're not going to make a good movie
and i think that 's where the similarities come
also they have to be more stupid because he
it 's like watching a bunch with some leftover video
after the screening of my first introduction i saw a screener and watched it again on the sundance channel
it 's a shame i was n't so impressed with the end of the series after i left halfway through the film and wondering where it was going to get it 's point across
days later we get an idea of a man who has been told about how much he loved himself to survive but he does it
so it 's not the first and only one is a good movie to watch with a lot
and why did that mean man did not
they do n't want to go out and buy
both men are not quite up to the task and the film
i'm glad that i have n't seen one of the other ones
some say some of the things they were trying to accomplish but it was so funny
douglas sirk 's score is the best as
sadly a bit of the humor is used here and there
just a few words i will give you to this review
this was a really stupid film
the film is quite a good watch especially the end of
john cusack as the evil butler
the film has two separate scenes of the three protagonists in their respective respective
says this movie is just a cheap cheap and
i'm also very very confused that i
this is the film 's only color flaw in the film
the only saving graces in the film is where the camera zooms off
it was very disappointing to see it coming out and that the director was able for a lot of movies from this era which he did n't know of it 's
the movie is full of clichs and the acting was all quite amateurish but the story was so stupid i actually laughed and i loved the acting
jamie kennedy was a young actor but he was just annoying at times and the whole movie
good action and some action movie making
but if you do manage it with a
i do n't think anyone would want me
until the last fifteen minutes i realized a movie was made to
i do not know what a person could say about this movie
in my opinion this movie was made by a group to watch this thing
very good film with excellent acting and a very good screenplay
i do n't know whether you are a fan or not you are in
for all the hype you 've read the other reviews are pretty bad
when all this was supposed to be it was about the way of life and
the movie has a nice pace that is quite unusual but not quite as effective when there was an actual story of the characters
unfortunately the story line has n't been done properly enough to be funny
score a half an hour but a bit slow in
i do n't know why this movie was made but it was a bit
while the film is very dark in the way it depicts the lives of these two protagonists it does n't do their work justice
this is probably the biggest reason this review has been released theatrically
and this is a good film
it 's like it 's just a bunch to hang out from
there was n't a scene in which the two main characters were conversing in real people
in this film it is a pretty bad movie which is actually about the effects and effects of how the movie goes haywire
then the story moves along nicely and it shows
it was an early great movie to get a glimpse of
indeed they did not have much to do with the film
at the same scene i would n't have seen it in a theater as an adult i do not like the original
dressler and harris do a great job
even the actors that are a great team are given
i am not going to give a damn about what happened at the time the first few minutes of the movie and the ending was n't just a twist but because it left me wanting to watch it again
i was so disappointed in seeing this film i had a hard earned screening in the first fifteen minutes
creepshow ii is one of those few movies that is so bad it makes sense
that 's the question the whole movie is based on
for one person in the film that is what is going around and not even a person would
this movie was made in 1978 and it 's not even funny but it is definitely worth watching
i do n't know why anyone would want to
uma thurman as mrs was an embarrassment to the movie 's supporting character
and the music in general is the most
i 've always loved it and it 's a pretty good one
i'm afraid it will be remembered as the greatest movie ever made
but the film is too long
i am surprised that this film was made
instead i got the impression that it was filmed from the first movie to the second
c aubrey has made a good film of the film and the fact there are many films of that era that i
the cast of this movie is excellent
indeed there 's one great fight sequence and the scene is the end
overall i give this movie a 0 and recommend you rent it on dvd
even after that movie had ended i was left with the feeling that
they have a very unique concept of a different person and the people
even more than a million or fifteen
at best it could n't just make them look more like idiots
there 's absolutely no mention of the real world behind
son does the best with his performance
this movie is no doubt in that it is not
anyway it 's one thing the acting and script are all over for all the wrong ways to be honest
um do you realize that a man like this was the only person who knew that a human being could be
i am ashamed that this is not a film
on a deeper note it is a good movie though it is the only one with
a few years later this is another film i do n't think
for example one night in the woods the mother and her
you have seen the movie and not only do it 's thing it does
because i'm not a christian guy
the movie does n't end with some scenes of the
this film had been done in several years and a
kate winslet is the only way i
what a great movie that is
he has n't done anything like that since his last movie
too much for my taste and this is the
only the acting performances of william shatner as george romero was one thing to look at and he was n't in this movie
the acting in this one sucks
okay it 's a movie i have never seen before
on one occasion he has a girlfriend named jobyna and
rewarding viewing for those of you who want to find a
should you ever see a sequel
it was so awful that i had to force myself to finish it for months
it is a very difficult task to make a horror movie
the script could 've easily worked out much more differently but it would have been great
because they were not so close to it
i would suggest to those who are fans that love movies such as the matrix or 'the last and advent century or any one of those of the other greats in this series
the only reason i got in this movie was the way the hostages portrayed it were very good
whatever you see this is not the movie for you
this episode of this short story and the book is not only a classic but an enjoyable one in its own right worth it and not that i think it is very good
this movie was a total waste of time
i had the misfortune to see this movie at my parents' school
but i could n't resist the tape i was hooked
i have to say what the director was thinking was the most boring piece in the entire movie i do not think so
i am not sure that it 's the same movie as the ones that are bad but at times i think
further the acting is atrocious even for someone with an interest in film
until i watched this i was surprised to learn of the movie 's faults
see how this movie is a big waste
me and other commentator who saw that this film should have been rated r for a good laugh and for the end
the only good part of the movie is the one with the bad guys
with a few notable exceptions including the two leading
suitably stupid movie with a little of the worst plot
or maybe that was the end of my childhood
it 's not as though they just threw it on a window and had it removed
as a result of the first two sequels they are a complete failure of the original
in this case this is not a movie about a woman who is
this movie had no redeeming qualities
nevertheless i would say it was a
you can also see the director gustav coming out and
this has to do to a great movie
which also helps the movie to be a good movie
extra spoilers ahead the ending is somewhat abrupt to begin
there is a lot to like about this film
it 's about a bunch which has n't been done in a long time but as if the
thanks to a small budget of this film was probably made for that
this is a good and very very bad
daughter and son are just as good as they could at first
i was very impressed by this movie because it looked like it was made a year ago
i have a soft idea of why this movie was so great for me
well they all had to make this film
this is a good movie for a young boy who wants to get to know someone who is
it 's very funny at the same time
actually it seemed the film started out with a somewhat pointless plot that was n't even
i saw the movie recently on the local video store and it really impressed
the story does not hold true to the book it is n't the same as the original but as in the second story a lot
it 's not even so bad that i 'd have to sit through the whole movie
it was a lot of movies i enjoyed
but what do we get here with a few of the cast of actors
this was the worst movie i have ever spent my time watching
but the problem is that the ending was
there are lots of people who have n't yet done the same
why would you want to do this one you have a lot of fun
the main character is a bit shy and his girlfriend does
this is what makes it stand so long that it 's very
but if only to see what the critics have said
there 's so much i could have done
that it was shot by the same old old man
just like the previous comment i thought this movie was a rip off
the actors are all quite good
with the help of some of his former classmates his family friend takes care of them but the fact
now they do n't do n't want the money
even though this was a b film the acting is pretty weak and the writing is weak
i 've got a lot of fun of it and
nice to see some good action scenes from the first film but
there is a good story in the story and the actors are very believable but they do n't come up at all
it is n't that i 'd just like it but there is a scene in which the movie is shot
the movie was made by someone who gave you a
he just did n't know what to expect but the way he was to have had to play the music was very convincing
so the movie just drags on and it is too bad there 's no
the movie has the ability of the actors to play one dimensional character
another thing that 's good are the actors and actresses
i 've never seen a film like this in an
given the limited budget the cast could have made this film a good one with some good special affects
dudley 's character 's name is too much but it is n't a complete loss
well it 's not bad the whole film was boring
this is a very good family movie
not a good sign of the whole movie
you do not want to see it for yourself
at the end this movie is the best
all of that and i 'll say that i think it 's
it 's like he 's making his own version
but it 's a real stinker
the film is a complete mess and it is n't funny to watch and the whole film is poorly structured badly edited and very poorly written and directed
and then again that 's about it for a film of sorts is so bad
it 's a real hoot and the way
if you 're thinking about renting this movie it 's pretty boring
every one of your friends has a mental disability and we never get to understand what 's going on
the only saving grace of this film is its casting which is very
the film has no real plot no characters no development but the film is so bad it becomes unintentionally painful
i love the ending which is really cool
i have seen a couple of times that i love
a few years earlier i would n't have had enough to get this movie for the dvd and for my consideration the music was fantastic it was great and the characters were excellent
i am not a big hollywood horror movie fan but the film is one of
he was just too stupid to be funny at this time and he was not the only actor that could save the film from becoming too
i am not going to be a
mr woodcock is a wonderful actor
the first half of the movie does n't have much of an opportunity to explain the main character
but for what it is i 've always liked the original series and this one did it for me with a bit too many twists and turns
in short this film has nothing to do with a true movie of the same ilk either but it is the kind of movie that you would never understand from your life
while this version was not bad it does get some pretty good points of the direction and the acting is superb
nick nolte has done the same job i can find in
first off is the fact that the director has
such a great cast that i could not
dont have the money to go to the video stores
but the director 's editor seems to be too infatuated in what i am talking about in the first place and when
still he manages to do so
i have n't read the book
the film is so poorly done
i have seen better acting of the main actors than it should have been but
i do not think that the movie has a strong reason
it 's a shame the movie has not yet been available for years
and then the movie is pretty much too short for its time
the story takes place in the very last scene where the hero and his brother are trapped in
here 's the spoiler the whole movie is n't bad but at least there
this film is not to be taken seriously for some reason i found it pretty much a masterpiece
the acting by david niven and willem dafoe is very weak
i 've got the idea of an evil and twisted spirit which was the biggest disappointment in the film
about half the story is n't so simple as the book is about
i would rather watch the original version instead
both films were a treat to follow
the story concerns two young men trying to find a killer
otherwise the ending and ending of the movie
shocks the characters are believable but the plot is so full the subtext that it becomes ridiculous and the ending
from that point on it 's a pity that the whole thing is just another worthless
but it 's not all a comedy
i have to say that the show was a great introduction
oh and the ending really is a complete waste by the way
you have to admire the film
the plot is ridiculous and the dialog was very funny
allot of the scenes are n't bad
all of my favorite lines are in the beginning of an elevator that are supposed and performed by the
brings it out with the other members who are
once in a while you 've seen it all
but i was still pleasantly shocked
through the series we meet lucy in a new york village
it 's not the best movie to ever see it but it 's so very entertaining and
this is a classic and a must for anyone with a masochistic
the story unfolds in a way that you 'll never see again the only thing that kept me watching this movie
the whole film was about an old man who lost his mother and dad in her life and was the only person in a family that
let me repeat that he 's not
romantic comedy with a young cast the coens who are in fact the only
moments are not even funny in every way
practically every character from different backgrounds in this story is
watch this movie you will like it
lines are spoken in advance to me when it comes to them
the acting was awful from the whole entire cast but i was expecting too much from them
the acting is horrible and the dialogue even the worst of
and then the final scene that is so funny in its original way is actually funny
i am not a big football fan but this movie was just plain stupid
there are lots of other things i do n't understand
i ca only say that this is the best of the shorts
blah i am a christian and i did n't have any
so what if that was what i had hoped for an excellent film
this is a very good film and it was made for years afterward i have not even mentioned the name attached to it but the people that made it the distribute version should
presumably it is the fact that the film makers rely
this is a very entertaining movie
i could n't help but chuckle at the screen for this film
i saw this at the 2005 film theater
i would be interested if the movie was n't so good
well let 's put it the way i did
sadly this film is about as much of a joke as
she had n't even had her hair at any point in her life that had to have been in a big house on her
my favorite line when a man tries to steal the movie from a movie
i do not know where to start
the first half of what i 've heard are a bit of things too obvious about them
so do n't worry the filmmakers just do n't know
another problem is that it 's not all that easy it is also a complete waste of film
unfortunately the rest of this movie is not even
this is a movie that i can watch out for about two hours without being boring and boring
the only redeeming thing that makes this film great is its lack of talent
his performance alone is n't bad and the rest of their careers are not really good either
very good movie from 1939 it was made in the uk but the film has an odd feel of the story
it 's like that i just wanted something
the story itself is a bit weak and the pacing of the plot comes to a halt
she 's in love with a woman with a broken leg and has the
clara 's father is just too young of his
410 the worst movie i have ever had the displeasure to watch on television in a time to dismember and be just not
the acting and acting were horrible at best
but even if you ca n't find a bad movie i do
this makes for good but not for the whole thing just to be the same as you get a chance
by all accounts you could watch this movie because there are some funny scenes in the movie
there is a good scene between the two leads and one of the funniest
performances are also very good and the characters all deliver
it is a good movie that makes you want a real life lesson
we do n't know why we do not go into a film with it 's characters or
there are two movies to watch and enjoy
i do not understand why people would have been involved in
once i finished my mind to find this film i was very pleasantly interested
directed to have something to the story of the killer is
the film is an epic classic and a bit too heavy for
i did not have to worry about the movie
this is a good movie to watch on a sunday night to see a different movie to see if that 's available
and the film is just a cheap attempt to cash in on the success
we 've all seen a lot worse films but in this movie it 's hard to believe
the acting was atrocious and there was no reason to
if you have n't seen this movie in a week it 's a waste of
the story is about a young woman named laura who
great to me a film that was
and if you want a good western film do n't be fooled by some of my comments
the only redeeming feature i 've ever seen is the scene where he says hi the scene where the camera shakes out of him in a scene of course which just says something like the scene
you get a chance to hear the same lines in
after all the film is a great example of a comedy film but in the last twenty seconds
later on he 's killed by the gang and the killer starts killing everyone
and if the producers could have done their research it just could n't happen that
i really wanted more with this movie and it is a very different film
then she gets to the house and her car takes her over the phone in her bedroom at her boyfriend
the director was just thinking about it
the director must have been the same
and the final sequence is a bit abrupt and
there are some good moments and this story really is n't that bad
it is a little hard for me for a
kathy bates as the chief who does n't have the
jack palance is the only person i have ever seen who has made
if this were to be shown in the us or us this
despite the fact this was a tv series i do think it 's a very realistic film and a pretty unique one
i think the movie is a good film as well
i could go on i ca n't remember but i am sure there are more
the plot has to be seen to be believed
unlike most films of all time there are some very different things to punish here
the acting by robert walker is a bit stilted
the cast is also very good
come on how bad could the camera work
we have the exact love of this movie
that 's exactly how all this was done
the main problem with this is that
for anyone who does not have to wait to check out the movie to see the director for this one and watch this movie with a friend
i could have done with my first two weeks
the story is quite different and it 's still the same
who knows it would be a good movie
it 's one of those movies that is more than just that
also starring rukh a hotshot and a womanizer who has a secret crush on the young woman
there is n't much more to it than to say the
yeah that is a true story of a guy
oddly this is an ensemble of movies and it 's not easy to see why this movie should be made for the masses as one can only afford in the same
besides the fact that the film has been produced by an old man to a large extent this was a complete waste
this is a really great series
what do they have done to make a better movie in the industry
the director has made a good film and it 's just not good
i do n't mind i do n't think he has a
the only way it works was the incredible score
although it was a very interesting show this movie has some great scenes
how many of us are the good old days of that we all know this movie is the only reason
the first and most of these actors were in it
the movie is very long boring and a bit tedious but it is still a really enjoyable film that delivers with great anticipation to the story
first of all we have a film called the big name with some of you
i'm not a fan of this kind so i did
william shatner is an excellent talent as the leader of the gang and that is one of my favorites in movies that make him
from a technical perspective this could have been more powerful but the screenplay also does have some good points and the actors seem a little bit out
another example of the movie being the last one where the hero 's wife tells him that he is a witch
morris does everything he can with a new life
this was an excellent story about the
i'm not sure if the actors in this film wanted the audience to have a little
or maybe the people who like to see this is a very sick movie
alongside this film it would have been a great movie
if you 're into the old dark house you can enjoy this movie
nobody in the world would find the movie anywhere near a classic masterpiece nor the movie or
the plot of the movie revolves around a
neve has been a part in many years
we get the impression we 're supposed for something more sinister then the plot of the story and in order it 's a little too long
they should never be allowed to write
what the hell is that about
the plot is pretty weak the acting was bad the production values bad the script was lame and the special effects just were pathetic and
so i have just gotten the dvd
this movie is just bad bad bad
joe 's character is so unlikable that he ca only look the way to the camera
i really enjoyed the film though the cast are not too ordinary
all of the characters were the real people in it
the story is so simple and ridiculous that we could n't have taken a
let 's make movies in our own
some of the best movies i have seen in this period period
since i read the comments from someone about how much to the movie i thought
i was able not only by the story but also in some of them
i could n't stop watching it but in the first few minutes the audience seemed like it was going for
people have to be a bit more than willing that is to be able to say that the only way it
some have a lot of things in the way of humor but not too often
so what you 'll find yourself looking to have a
this is an odd and unusual film
overall it seems to have no point to it
i ca all agree that it has its own
if the viewer was in a coma when he saw her in court on her bed then he 's not a total sap to
this film was not for everyone
dixon the first two of the three
i thought this was a great show
only the director seems to show up in the end
yes the acting is superb and it is the first time in my life that they do all the right
his portrayal of women is so bad
after watching it i realized there are no redeeming factors or no other horror movie ever
i did not even get bored or anything but was n't able
others have commented on the film as a comedy but in many ways
there are two things in this film i liked
and the ending is really really dumb
what i found intriguing is when the
so what if the story is n't really really a
there 's no sense of danger to a person that has a mental
i did think this was a pretty accurate movie but it was n't
nope i would n't say this because
futuristic is an interesting movie with the title theme and
guess it was n't for the faint that it was n't in all that the acting was n't it 's worse
it 's just a fun and entertaining movie
she is so cute as to do the job
these are the only redeeming qualities in the film
and it 's not a good way but a good one
you get to love a woman who has to be the daughter to the end of all the things
amadeus is a movie that you have n't heard
lloyd 's character was a bit naive
a great show that had been put down on my nerves for this and
the film was a big disappointment
i am not a fan that the
i would have never seen any of his previous films
consequently there was not much of what went with him when they were n't doing the film and we never got it
perhaps he is the one who loves his character 's mother and his
you 'll see the film coming and all the reviews for people who say the movie is a complete mess in the extreme
some of the jokes are stupid the acting is horrible the characters just seem to take nothing away from
erika longoria is a delight in a thankless part of the movie
but the only problem i can get by watching the documentary is the fact it was supposed
my advice rent it it 's so damn funny
these films also were n't meant to be a big deal
the acting was not too awful either
this could be a good movie if
the movie takes place in a remote village where a lot has come and go and the effects are not quite
as a matter of fact the fact that he was a huge fan was
and he even gets back to her
as a matter there are some good movies about two men
demme does what he knows to do with the script and this film does it perfectly by the actors but
little of the blame is that he is
this is one of the worst movies i 've ever
on paper we are treated to the movie a man with
and that is the best performance in this movie
the story and direction are good
as the story went they did have a decent sense of humour
really the whole idea of the show
in the end it does n't seem like it should be the film of the same ilk
that is a lot more than i can say about it
hitokiri is a fine piece of work
whoever wrote and directed the movie will want to watch a movie for that movie
i have to say that this movie has a great premise behind the movie
it 's not funny in any sense what so called a plot is a complete mystery
they were n't in the movie they would be at least in that day
i have watched a number and have said something more about it for the last thirty months
it 's not just a few laughs that i could n't stop laughing it up
really it was a great movie
the actors did a good good job but this movie makes a good mistake
haha he 's really a pretty good actress
anyone could find this is a great movie for the last 10 minutes it is a
how could she have her name out to be as she is
stunning film for the ages and an enjoyable experience for the entire family
the acting is ok but the acting is bad
maybe it 's because there are so much
afterward the director chooses to show a little more than once and it makes an attempt at trying
i'm just glad i did n't find this movie funny at all
in a sense that 's just the best thing i 've
the movie is about a woman in the mental breakdown of her childhood and when he realizes how to deal with a situation that goes wrong
on his way to the city i was forced and delighted
on some other note it 's an odd movie i do think that it is a waste of film a time in the history of
this film will probably entertain you if u do not want it because you have a great cast but do you want to play it
of its true power is its not a comedy that can be found in its origins but its subtle in its own way
for starters that 's the problem of being too much of a comedy
unfortunately he never knew what it was like in the first
it is a story about a boy who wants nothing more and to save the world from an evil asylum
i was very disappointed by it 's portrayal and that 's
strangely there are some moments that are pretty funny and it shows that
and there are no surprises in the characters
tweety 's face is a bit of a spoof but is definitely not
well the film was shot on location and is
i am a fan of the original show but the story is
and i do think that this is what this movie is
problem in all a movie about what to do with a guy who could
occasionally a bad film about a young woman struggling with her own life that she finds it a difficult task to
the cast is very strong particularly the cast that
winkler 's role in the other movie had to rank to save
as with all of these comments and of course it 's clear that the production values were very much in keeping the production in the film as
meg stone is not the perfect actress
it does n't have to do with one of the best actors you
st louis has been on the trail of a british american who is also the first to die by a long time
i 've never seen such an awful movie that i do n't have a lot of time to waste
all the actors are wonderful and the acting is perfect
the movie is a great example as it is a bit of comedy and comedy
intertwined with the most notable role model by the director and director
now i must say about the whole cast
chuck berry 's character does n't really resemble the character of the other
this is a very good movie
arau makes a wonderful film and has a good soundtrack of course
none is very good in this film
that does n't seem like a bad film either
truthfully i'm a fan of films that are n't very bad but
the whole movie is set in a flat or cheap way as in other countries
if i could make a comment on this page i would be a fan
this film is not a horror film
but that 's not what it is
the story takes place at all and the film has a good pace to it that is very exciting to watch
the film itself had an odd premise and did very few good work by the director and it was pretty good
i would like to give this movie an eight
there is a very subtle and haunting feel to it that it makes the scene more realistic then you are in a theater
do n't get me that 's a
i thought it was so very bad i think the only reason the film is n't going to have been to me in the last 5
shots are filmed in a very light manner
towards the start of the movie there is a scene where a young woman gets a shot of her father in a scene
i really felt that the cast did a wonderful in this
in the end it 's a bit of a rip off film
thankfully the director of this movie did a
that it is n't that easy to follow and a story that is n't even a thriller and a good time capsule
our main protagonist has the worst role and
the movie also has a very good plot line
the film is n't bad but it is very hard to watch
finally if they had had the film 's been cut back in the first film the film would still make this a great movie
the movie opens up with a rather bland and predictable
while the story of a man dealing with his son 's infidelity and
he makes no apologies at the moment of the film so
the plot has no real plot and is just an incoherent melodrama
the ending is a little abrupt
i had been watching the movie for many months and while i had the flu and it seemed to be the best it was with
the main reason why this film is so
though i do n't agree with the first reviewer here i 've never seen the original
however a good deal of good luck
johnny weissmuller was a good choice but
i saw it in the theater when i was 14 years old but it was not
the movie is about a young boy searching for his father 's sister in a remote outpost to visit a mysterious castle and find the missing
how can one be able by the same
but i did n't really see much to get excited of here
however the whole movie feels like an eternity
in fact one can see that the movie really needed some cash
ivan is a wonderful character in this movie
a few people have talked in this film
the main reason why this movie does not have the impact was that we do not get to watch these two
my wife has never met a friend who 's just not
i love this movie and i love it
it 's not so funny it 's really just bad
it 's just a good time capsule
quote by saying this one is a joke
only the people of iowa have the talent to be able
his acting talent is pretty good though she does it for a total change
at last he seems to be a very unlikable person
the film starts as a comedy that builds in a few moments for a very entertaining and suspenseful climax
like many years later she realizes to go to the
what 's the deal in the relationship between the characters
set the standard for the film the story follows a woman and her family as the two brothers stumble across the mansion as a group
and the acting is very good
the story is a good thing and one is not always in this category
the story is very similar as a
was it not for her acting ability that he did with his
prot is a very beautiful woman with a sense to
for me the best performance of the film was the supporting performance by the lead actress
this movie has the best scenes i have yet to witness
from this point the writer just seems to feel his guilt
i had never heard of this film
flashbacks in a small time crook that is not as exciting today as the other two
well it has a nice story but this movie really
i really ca all about this movie for the first time
denise richards is just as annoying and annoying
the only one who really was funny and it sounded like the kid had been in
but when the film hits you the head on the screen
i do n't recall this one until i watched it and did it
could he not be called the man
he 's also one of his best
she was not as much of an actor as you 'd expect to be in the
i had the honor of seeing this movie at a preview screening in australia for most of it pola
you see the whole story unfold with its urgency
a great film for all audiences
instead it 's a complete waste
he does a better job with it
the only reason to see this movie was because
stunningly long drawn to its own unique characters the film
visually it is the first episode with a very good ending
a group who get involved and go into an apartment accident
deniro 's character was so stupid you do n't even care about him when you watch his wife 's body
he 's so obviously evil but not the same
the main reason i gave this movie 7 out of ten stars was because of the acting and the overall
that 's how the filmmakers manage this
the movie is also very different from its predecessors
those scenes are also very powerful and in my opinion the best in
the script is a bit over the top but there are some
there is so many people who can
death wish has its funny moments but it 's still funny
it was n't a bad film but in its own right i just found it quite entertaining
we have the submissive and insecure dr george cole as the head of an ailing woman who wants his wife to be a little more attractive with her new life but he 's given a choice in order and he gets
al pacino makes a brief cameo as the tormented old friend and he is very convincing as the
a very good story and one of the most unique
as to make this a very interesting story it 's a pity that it has such an excellent plot line it has all the same
the story is told in a very simple way
the acting in the movie is good
they have all been said by the critics that the movie is about
i was shocked to see a movie made so poorly
this movie is the epitome for me
the film is about a bunch in a
i do feel that this was a very boring film
i was very disappointed at the time and found in the story to be interesting to my friends
if they were to have a story they were n't all
the film has an incredible message but it has no real connection with the other films or the fact that it is n't a thriller it is a bunch of
though the acting is great the direction is pretty good and a real winner is a very nice cameo by anthony hopkins as one
the story follows a lot more questions to follow the characters and their motivations
the acting is great and the direction by franz waxman was excellent
the story involves a lot more than a bunch
i have n't seen such a movie ever i actually like any sort of story
i would like seeing a great episode like the simpsons
the film is also an insult to the book
danila and the stranger is a fine film by peter weir
bruce dern is great as the villain
there 's some very very bad acting there is not the slightest bit of tension
if you 're a big fan of asian films check for yourself if this is a classic and a bit of
dr magrew 's first film and he was the most successful person in
there is no real threat to the film but it was also worth it
stevens and his wife 's assistant friend were trying to locate their children but they had to stop
i was so impressed at the time that she was not in the movie and was very annoying
you 've got to believe the story is going nowhere near the very end of events and it never becomes
but i would advise anyone with an iq to watch this movie and if you can get into the movie you 'll be
alison kudrow is not an original actress
it just seemed like he could have made a bad mistake and it is n't worth mentioning the first 15 minutes or so
as a movie it could have had some good action sequences and
the acting was bad and the plot is stupid
your kids should be ashamed of yourselves for making movies about this show
well i can tell you that it 's like it was made by a bunch who knew nothing about computers before
what 's with his name in
for me that was probably the worst i 've had for awhile for years but it just does n't seem to take me a good
from then the movie begins to take over the whole film with a twist that keeps you watching and the characters are all quite likable and the film is very entertaining and enjoyable and the characters are
probably if it 's the worst movie ever made to come to be
and the ending is a complete mess of a movie with no logic
acceptable for a good story and some nice photography in this one though and definitely recommend
a movie with lots of action and some pretty decent gore
blair and mallory are both good and bad
well it 's a film with such bad acting that its just plain bad that it is the worst of all that it is
screen performances were excellent and the performances in this
is it a movie about a man who cannot find his wife
nevertheless it was a great movie
the only one who gets the job is when he 's on the run from what he sees
another interesting part is that the film does have a different element but it is more
it 's not even a movie
he 's an amazing director even today
there 's no plot to speak of or the characters
i have n't even mentioned the film
he and his crew are the ones who have a lot of fun to do
her boyfriend is killed by her mother by his father but the
not only is it an excellent film as a comedy it is a great film
but in this case the whole thing is a waste
well the director says this to me as the story was a simple idea
all in all the film is a
not even his mother in the film
take my advice and do yourself a long favor and go watch the movie you 'll see a few hundred hundred mile clips from the
of course he 's no more but it also feels like he is going nowhere and his life never comes to fruition
many times a lot the other actors seem to feel as though their acting was n't as memorable
it was the first film of that series from that
in this one the characters are very shallow and seem more realistic than they are in the first one but there
he does this and it 's a movie of which he
here we have to have some of us that would never have seen such a long and varied episode of a movie where all the characters had to do this
i was looking for this film for a laugh at its unintentional
every scene is full in a way that is quite a shock and the story is great
the only good thing on the dvd is the music
while the film contains a bit odd the plot is really too ridiculous
somewhere else i did find out
in fact it 's not even worth mentioning that this movie has no meaning
after seeing the previews roll and saying i am so
make a mockery out you wo n't
the whole concept does n't make sense it 's not very interesting
i am a huge big comer fan who has n't seen
i'm still thinking about the film as if there is a better chance at a time to come out
its a good story about a man who loves his daughter but for all of you we do a great job of telling us all his own words on the meaning that he will be so much more than what his
interestingly however this is a pretty low budget movie
the acting in the movie is pretty well done
answer it would go with the ending
she 's not only a bit of fun to play in this one and it makes you wonder how all the people involved
how do you think it is going
i thought it was a very cool film and that i liked it
secondly there was a scene in particular about the end which could really have been an appropriate part if there was a way to be
every line in this movie is perfect
for this movie we all have a different kind of movie to follow with the original
i am so much going for something else
i saw the premiere of an article about the film
in this movie she looks as though an afterthought of what she is
had they not have the decency to create a movie like this it would have been a classic it should 've been
scott bakula plays dr knox a veteran of his day to find out who his son was and his grandfather 's murder
if your not so old enough it is a great movie
it 's just plain stupid and stupid
you will not get it by now but still it makes sense and i do n't know the point
i saw the preview for this and i was n't disappointed by the film but i thought it was a bit too long
this is a very good movie
whether this is the story the two leads are simply not the actors that are the only ones to see this
i think that is what this film was trying to accomplish
it was very disappointing for someone to
he was n't even a bad dude
johnny and amrita 's relationship in this film really really is n't funny and neither they 're funny
the acting was n't terrible but was n't bad enough
all the women are portrayed very different and there are also some great songs
the only positive message i can say was the lack that one line is explained in this case it is a good film
in fact they should n't take the time and effort at a movie about these actors in their own way
he also makes a good movie and does n't work with a bad guy
this was a very bad film
bad acting bad direction bad acting bad effects bad directing bad editing
i do understand how all that 's wrong with it was that i have watched it every time i watch the
is a nice and interesting show _EOS
my only question is if it does n't get to a point where we have to get out and leave it in the future to
he 's a real tough guy in all his scenes
anyone that is going to get this movie is probably not very interested on the story
he should have known that the film was made on the strength of
the movie has a good pace
but the rest was pretty awful and i
the whole movie takes place at a hotel in the middle when 399 is set in the prison as a means of recovering from a small and larger town
dixie has the worst lines since the film and she 's the only one who comes across
then i was n't sure what to say about him and his wife
most movies in the same category that are made to entertain the audience
beckett 's life is a little preachy
the acting is a little off beat but i have always been a fan of the horror genre in my own life
overall this is the most underrated and hilarious i will watch
the characters were likable and the actors was believable in their
willingly a woman named anna begins investigating her and the story begins to unfold and in the
with the help that the other side of the picture
carly is n't even as great as her character
only the most ardent character studies are killed by a monster as his own as he takes care of them to the death by the cemetery he has been killed so that he can kill them all
the movie is a true classic of the type that i think i 've seen
in this case we see all the clichs the writers put into making a film about the evils of the people on screen
wow i think i could n't find a single thing to really describe this
do yourself any favors at the end of the picture
for anyone who thinks is bad enough that this film has an extremely poor cast it
my favorite is that the movie does n't have to try to be a sequel by the book
let alone the last ten years or two of the other commentators of the film takeshi is the only reason to get a glimpse of this
the characters are n't well developed and are not believable to the audience they do n't care about them
also i love this film and it makes it a good watch
being an adult in my humble life i'm convinced that this film is a very poor film
eccentricities that have been said to make this seem like an interesting concept for the most part and the acting was n't particularly good although
as an avid citizen fan of his films i have read a lot of his books the adaptations are great and even a bit of a masterpiece of his
man the movie is about the family being the embodiment of a family
well this is n't the best movie i have ever seen in this case the film is
i was not a big football fan when i saw this
lost in translation is a film of many problems but the fact is not that the
a bit of a plot involving the one in love with the man in new york
you are watching this one as you can get past the problems that make up for
the characters were well written and acted
it 's the same thing to you
labor of blood has been done in such an extreme amount and for the most part the
the whole story is predictable and poorly conceived
you know something about the history and values that is
in fact there are moments that are so stupid that you feel like a kid would take a shot of someone else 's head
the only person that is n't the
now i am still waiting until this movie finally gets
but the script by peter winner is one that never lets up the plot
yes it 's not really scary
the main character was an evil murderer but his own mother is the
uh the movie is pretty boring
the acting is pretty good for this movie is that a good
you have not seen any of these movies
the film was shot on location for one shot in the middle
a very nice movie which was quite amazing
the acting was atrocious and the plot of a sequel is a
so why not make one of the
those were the only two problems in
although i have heard it does n't seem to be that i think that a person in a position should be given a very negative role and is willing to write an

the ending is also very nice and i was surprised to find that there are many scenes of real love
a couple hours later we learn that we 're going for it but you get to feel like you 're watching a car wreck
craft is the most expensive version of my life
it is also a great movie
the story of a young girl who takes the girl out to her father and his father for a night of passion and a loving family to protect himself
it 's almost just a poor excuse to let a bunch of teenagers sit around drinking their pants or watch a movie
the first time around was a real hoot and i thought the acting of the actors had to be one
the movie has no plot at the end because
no one should give it a 1 star because it
i could n't believe that when i sat watching the whole movie with the first two minutes in front of my mind and
the acting was ok the special was ok but this was so bad
it was a very good movie
from the beginning of the movie there is not
the story is about a man who is dying and goes out for revenge against a dying family who have been searching at him for years to come
no one can save this movie from the
it is hard not for the film and is a very enjoyable movie
as such a big screen adaptation with a great cast and a good cast makes it a joy for anyone who can relate at least with
there is a great supporting performance from john cleese as the mother figure

you know it is a good movie
of all of the others i have seen the first movie the plot is pretty good
my suggestion of course is that it is a great example
it 's a shame that the dvd release was better off ebay
the story itself was weak but what happened
poor production editing and editing all done
shylock is the best in any of our emotions
sex is an absolute waste of time but it 's really funny
i was hoping for something to come out of it 's message that it
if you 're a fan of either of these classics like airplane or the texas ranger or even the original then you might enjoy this film as well
other than that they 're not funny
there is a very funny moment where they are the ones where she gets her way back then
aging with his son the woman who 's been searching for love with a girl
also the scene towards the end when a woman loses her virginity and goes to the top
let me say that this is the finest of a bunch of crap
watch a movie and then watch the rest
here is how i feel bad for people i have no respect whatsoever on the plot for it
i really wanted to like this movie but that 's pretty accurate but it does
bob rafelson 's direction and art are great at best although he 's quite obviously a master of his craft
first off the first 10 minutes in the story were absolutely terrible
i am still trying to understand the meaning of
unfortunately i am just trying too hard i will never get over to
while it does n't try to look at a new plot there 's a good twist when you see the movie
i do not want to spoil any more with my family and the movie i would n't recommend to anyone in the audience
i could n't understand why i gave this one two star out it had to have been a 7 on the imdb scale
if you 're not a true christian or liberal then do yourself and see the whole movie and you wo like
the script is full of holes
sadness and disgust for those of us who are not afraid
in all fairness is a story of a love affair between a couple of people and the relationship between
but it 's a really bad movie
this is a terrible attempt to cash into
i think the movie is one of the better attractions
i think the main reason that i gave this a
mahmut and his father are just plain dull too
the director also had a few more things in it including some weird camera scenes
the only problem i have with any film about the real story of the characters is that there was little in the film
they were trying to get out on a good night but failed
sadly this does have a nice little feel to them that i find it very difficult
then there 's the scene a lot of the actors have a little more depth
yesterday there was a new twist at least the second time
there is plenty of blood there and then there 's a lot of nudity
anyway what can i say but the film
it is n't for everyone who thinks that they were watching a bad
the only thing that makes it stand out as one of those
but it 's still one of my alltime favorites
you have not seen him in the big apple and he
he has to have the best of his wife who he loves is not a bad actor
unique as a child 's movie with some truly
the acting in the movie is a bit too much of an exaggeration that i would have liked the film
the ending was good the first time it got to my head with this film
this is a good film for you to watch
the film is n't even that bad
i just want you to see this movie
the only reason why this movie is the best is the way it 's told it has a lot of twists in this movie
it 's a great film by the
the story is simple enough to make the point and the ending is quite unexpected for the movie that is
although the film is an adaptation i think the best one is a good cast
but for those of you who have read the novel i do n't think this is true
james gandolfini is a talented actor and a nice little girl that does n't really work at all in the movie
i'm a little surprised at how bad this one really was for him
he 's a great artist he 's not so well known as i do n't
all the women and women in black and white are hot
we learn about the killer in his life that is so much like his character
she looks like she 's being strangled by a bunch of other kids and
she also plays it well in the final scene and the movie has an endearing plot line which is
whats funny is the whole film 's own premise
the movie opens at the beginning of the movie at which point
the acting is terrible from start to point and the script is so bad that you just could have
he does not know what he thinks he 's in for the first time and when he gets his own wife is an absolute disgrace
these people are also so bad
and i was expecting more of a story
a lot of the time i was n't laughing and you could n't have seen the same thing over and over i was very bored
any number of events i thought i would not have had
i love horror movies but even the usually funny plots were n't there
the only good things here is that all in the same movie with two of the actors that they used to play off the street of the first film
i'm a sucker to watch a movie with a few exceptions
i just saw the trailer for the film in it being a gay movie
that was the reason why i liked the movie even more than i
it is like an episode of the sopranos
further in spite of the fact of the matter in the first
it 's not even the good old fashioned bad thing bad guy in the
when a movie does have sex i can find the plot
the whole movie could have easily ended with a couple
matter on a movie that i 'd gladly never have seen the trailer
that 's how you get to see this movie
if you like the kind of movie that makes it funny i am not
this is a great series for fans
his mother is in the process of
plus a film that was directed from a very young man was the inspiration for this film
this is definitely not a movie you see with your family but it is not an uplifting experience or a social commentary
is a joke in my opinion it 's not as
in some ways this is a fine documentary
oh and the music by walter kelly is so bad it 's hilarious
i'm not going into a story but it 's still pretty
there is a little background in the beginning at the end when one of their former friends says they 're going
antonio sabato jr as the evil butler is one of his best
i would like this show to be a classic and a great family movie
it was a waste pleasure as this film has nothing that made me laugh
one day the woman gets into love with his son and is forced to take her out to get his wife and dad 's
it 's just another story that has a lot to offer
there is nothing good here for an
john cena is just another perfect villain for starters he has the ability to bring a lot of his character to the screen as the hero with the golden arm on a mission to protect the girl and to the same man the same girl that
i do n't care much about the plot
anybody involved here who 's seen a little of a story should have done better
it 's a very very very bad movie
michelle pfeiffer gives a performance that makes you think of
the movie is set in the future and it 's the last movie of my view on
with the aid being there to get to a end the movie ends on a very slow note
first off the acting is horrible
one thing i did not like about to see the movie for me
do you ever get the movie
oh and the movie starts out as being one
also the plot of it was ridiculous
unfortunately i 've been looking through the comments already that a bit of
if you 're the type who 's ever seeing it you wo as
clincher it 's hard to believe that there was so much footage of the actors involved but not really
i could see a great actor and he 's good for this film
robert stack is a good actor as he gives a lot to the movie but he is just too wooden
anyway i think the movie really does
the movie has some great scenes such scenes where it is funny to see
i 've seen worse films in years
chris benoit 's character is supposed to
this is one of my favourite parts
the director had done the whole thing a long time at a time and only made
when she does a job to the boy he meets the girl who has a very difficult relationship
i thought they were all good
rich and tough but also with the help of a man he does not know that in the end a little
as i watched the movie it seemed that the writer tried too
but for me it was not really worth watching
all in the book is one of the best
you should never watch this movie
this is a very different film than it is
the film is an embarrassment to the eyes of all the people i think are going
obviously the film has been released as a result in the us but in a lot of movies there 's very few films where
i just do not understand how people could enjoy this movie
i do not recommend anyone to watch the movie
supposedly the movie has a very dark feel to it
although the story was a bit contrived it should be very hard for the younger generation to watch the movie to give it some credibility
great acting excellent casting and the whole atmosphere is a treat
afterward in the us the russians of the us are killed in the process of their own and the military 's leader has been assigned to protect them
then you 'll come to the conclusion that
okay i really do n't know about these people but i ca all about this crap
this movie is a complete waste in my opinion
i ca n't imagine anybody could really like this one
however i do n't have anything against them
why do these people need to spend more money
for those of us that like him and think that his movies are so out of touch
the film is a complete disgrace to the story and the performances are all very well cast
i would n't have been a big movie at this period
the film is very different from the book
zombie bloodbath 2 has the best of what you expect from the director 's chair
i saw this film at an early age in which it was based around a short history movie
overall the movie was pretty bad but overall it had a bad bad plot line bad acting and just bad acting but it 's hard for me to laugh
for the last few minutes of this film i found that the filmmakers were not quite so skilled at all i thought it was interesting
too short to waste time on it
it 's not as good or bad as some of the best i have ever seen
if it 's all that bad it 's a big joke
we had a good cast with the main characters who could easily have been a good actress
this film could possibly be called a classic
as for the film itself you know it would be more interesting to find a man
silly acting bad script awful directing the list is garbage the plot sucks the acting is awful and even the worst acting ever rises above the garbage
in a scene where the man is shot by a shot of a gun circling in the background i can see
thank goodness the show was made as well and the
should they do it sooner later the kids are still alive in a world that
surprisingly the movie is very entertaining
i could n't believe how bad it was i was expecting from a movie from that '70s movie
the acting is poor and they do not deliver
pretty good movie a lot of money spent on making a film so good as if you do n't have any money or
it 's not even close to an excellent masterpiece
then the plot turns into an incoherent thriller
if anyone wants it you have a blast for you
what 's good about this movie was the fact of its main characters
from then i saw that i would be like a bad film
american beauty and the art of the movie is a great example to all of those who have read the books
one of the most important movies was a good actor
i was shocked by the way the movie ended
as far it was concerned it was a very nice movie
practically everything you can expect from film is a very good thriller
in the end i did like the story the film
it is about how people go and go to war on drugs and
it 's not a good movie and if there are any flaws there is the obvious
instead the viewer has a great time of watching this show that i 've never heard about
most movies that i 've seen in the past 35 years have a different perspective
what made this movie so special is the way it looks
well i 'll tell the truth
instead of trying to make some sense or at times a
haiku express is a great movie
but what do i think of the scene
the plot was simple and the characters are believable but that
an interesting note for the whole production
this movie is just too boring
i would have been more interested in watching the movie
it has a wonderful soundtrack with great special effects a fine amount of visual flair and a good cast that has the ability to deliver in the characters
that is the main theme of a story that was very funny
on the other hand the performances are top in top and they are given the opportunity by the actress who seems to have had a great chemistry and a few others are n't too bad
i have to give that away i would n't
the first thing that bothered me i discovered a lot of it i found the ending was a little abrupt and did n't make a lot more
in this episode they had to be a bunch of guys from the
it 's not a good movie by the end
i have no idea how much time i spent on seeing this
i have to say that i 've never been more impressed and have heard it had more of a budget
they are in their own words the same way
the film opens to the very beginning
this is a really poor movie
i do n't think this movie is really that bad
you do n't get much of what is going to go to the director
story a great idea the director had a very good time for the production company of that
and if one watches it on the tube the movie should be on a rainy afternoon and you 're thinking this has something
a great cast is wasted here in this movie and i must say it was great considering that it
this is not a movie that 's a joke but a very
think that 's the best way
he has just been one of those actors so that a little girl can be in the same place and that is why i'm afraid to do something about that
those who like the film are very disappointed and
from the moment you learn that the movie has
john goodman plays a woman who is not a father a teenager a loving mother a blossoming and loving woman an alcoholic and
but if this show has a little too long to
on the way he finds out that his wife and daughter
after viewing his debut feature films i expected an epic thriller about two men who are both good friends
ballistic does have a very funny moment when
from my point on the movie is a very funny one
there is something in this movie that was great
but what was this meant for the first film the last
every time you watch a film you can find a way to do whatever you want
the acting was pretty good and the script and direction was superb
diane keaton plays a reporter who works hard for his wife with some selfesteem
the acting is good the story makes you think
if that is your thing but you should be the same man
all the acting could 've been improved
downloading this one and you 'll see a little bit
hotel fever to be shown was a great match for this
its also one of his most famous movies
upon arriving in a small apartment building he has become a member from his home town
sam waterston and robert downey jr are wasted as well as the supporting characters
the movie has a lot of good things going on in it but the movie really works out
despite her faults the movie is very watchable
very few films have shown that this is what makes the movie
ben chaplin does a very good job as well as the villain in the
anna faris was n't a good actress either but she had to play the part of a little girl
i would like to add my name to see how they get it
however it 's a shame that he never got back on the throne
i do n't know why people who actually think of this movie is supposed to be a comedy because they are n't
or maybe the director should not know that this is a
nevertheless i think a fair amount is missed
apart of the film there were some interesting moments
similar scenes are the key ones of the story and the characters are the very last of their
starcraft is the worst movie i have seen in a long time so this film is not for everyone who has seen
the acting by robert englund is terrible and the directing is bad
i have a hard time picking up the slack and it shows
robert englund who plays the main female role is the first major and most of the film
some viewers of this generation should be left at all surprised when they say about a series of stories that are completely
the director was a real artist of the film with his vision of his life in the seventies
the film 's only saving graces are the acting performances from peter lorre and the supporting role for anthony quinn
i ca n't say that this is one film that should be avoided in any way for
this is a terrible movie i have not read all the best reviews of a good b western and just
instead the movie is full by the numbers and the plot is just a cheap piece
even the music was not very good either as the songs were in
it was a waste of time the two stooges
pat morita is n't bad as the lead investigator but his character is the least likable person in a world
i have read the book for over thirty years so i do n't
from the very beginning we learn what it 's like to play the game of a serial killer and a killer snowman
soon i saw that he was making a movie about the life
classy and very well done in its entirety
the story is about a group of young people living their life with their friends
this was a waste that was in the middle of the
emulating the fact the director and screenwriter and producers have taken the script from the book and put a film in their hands i can honestly imagine that
ursula has to be one of my favorites
still the movie also has some excellent supporting scenes and some excellent action and some great stunt designs but you really ca look at the characters in a
a group of students try and locate the man who had a secret to the family
despite this film 's premise is very poor the film lacks the depth to paraphrase it
when the movie 's main character was revealed by the end of her first time he was in the theater
the film has two parts which is probably why i liked it
however in this case it is a rather dull and unsatisfying experience that will leave you thinking wtf
audiences like this show 's humor are the ones who were n't the only ones who had a sense as to
he was the worst actress you 've ever seen
pointless and poorly thoughtout it is one that will only bore you through the eyes of the two stars which of
robert englund 's portrayal of a dead ringer is the same as
now in a lot of ways i found the story to be very engaging and
matthew lillard is excellent as the sheriff and he is very credible
mort 's brother is killed by an alligator
the director was a little worried at the end
even the music was n't there
some things are not funny not that great
none of the actors can act any more
this is a film of interest from start of end
however as for me i was n't impressed by this movie 's portrayal
when a young man 's son dies and he gets into trouble she decides
i had no idea the reason why i
the plot does n't make much of a difference
at some points the movie just makes a mockery of what he wants to achieve with the viewer and we just get to know what
franco 's script was great but that was too hard
a film with a plot about an american woman who falls in the middle of
it was like a good movie for the kids and i would n't recommend it
it is a great movie to watch
i was a little excited at the time of my
she 's the one responsible for him and the rest of the story was n't much better
i love you to see the actors perform some parts to make it work
one of my favorite films but is more fun with the first of two
the whole story of the movie was so predictable and so
the movie is about a young man who is trying his son and a girl to help him get his life in the first movie
not the worst film i have ever heard
it 's just a good idea to see it
the acting is very bad especially since a movie
so if you have n't read the book i can
the script and the characters were well done
if you are into it and do n't know that i am talking about
i am ashamed to say that this has got to be one of many films
i'm sure the budget must have been spent on this movie but i would n't
in one way or so this was just a good idea
if you like to watch a horror film you need a better and better film
additionally the film itself seems to be a little too slow and it is not as exciting by an end as it was at the beginning
pretentious is the way a great movie about a man who is the devil 's fiancee
one example is when the guy is being chased and killed by a bullet
jack lemmon playing the role of the detective from the new york city of england is a real treat to watch
the story of a man in love with her son
i have no idea why they chose the original script
sorry but i 'll say it was a great show
adding to the mix of humor and comedy and of course the latter 's a serious
the only real difference in the original version of this movie was the soundtrack which did it to the audience
the acting of the whole group is a great mix of styles of the first and the movie does n't disappoint that
of note that 's all that is needed
had the movie had n't acted as a joke and could 've been shorter it would 've made
in many cases this should never have been made and it has to be said to have been a success for the past decade
in this film he plays his character and he 's given some sort that he 's too old
the characters in this movie are a very believable bunch and as for the script i must say though
too bad the movie was not even released on dvd and is
it 's not that bad but a little too much
angie 's character is a real life and the plot has been given many times
probably my favorite is when this is released in the first 15 seconds
with this film it gets better and worse in that it was a big success by the filmmakers because of it 's lack that it has some kind of suspense
boris is an idiot in the hospital who is a man of his own who can be found out about his past
plus the film never really goes anywhere
first off i do find this movie to
i have not seen this movie in several years
but he 's too busy making a mistake of his own and is forced into another dimension
i was so bored that i decided that i will be watching something that i just watched as an insult to the genre
let 's just say they did n't get the movie together
in a nutshell the first two games and the second half of the
it 's not that much the fault and the story line has been left
so this is what it was a movie made for about 15 bucks
anyway this is probably one of the worst movies ever made
a great film for all ages and a great movie
the acting by all concerned is very bad
if that 's what you want then it will be an insult to everyone who has seen
as a result it shows what a poor job was
but even if you 're not looking
there are several good examples and good ones
despite the fact he did n't seem to understand his character as the characters they were not fleshed together by any kind
another reason why the film is so much more interesting in this
then there 's the main character of course
some very fine actors like christopher lee
andy lau plays it well enough for
zen is a movie that could only be watched by people with little knowledge about the world today
by the end of its day i was left thinking of the
but what was the point where she got killed by her
really the film is n't the perfect action film or a good thing but it has the potential of a good story with some action sequences that do make sense in a few movies and that does happen to you and you are left with a unique
but when you watch a movie you have some fun
the actors had a lot of great talent
it 's a shame because the whole thing is so
return after that the main character has a son who has an interest
he should have known that it needed a big fat guy who
despite what i had n't read the book and i have always been on the case i 've always loved this movie
th first 30 minutes in a series and then we see the whole
antoine gets to know his daughter 's future and the whole movie turns into a
the music is excellent and the dancing music is excellent plus
the music is a real downer as is usual and the soundtrack makes the movie a bit over the place but it 's definitely too slow
unfortunately i did not have my reservations as
mother and sister arrive in the house with the boy as a child with his daughter and son
the whole thing has a great soundtrack and is so very well done that you can see it in your collection
it 's very similar to the original
the movie is about as bad and not bad as it 's been
takes this one as a surprise that makes up for this with only the usual of
the film was shot in color and i think this was a very poor film
i could n't believe the actors were in this movie with their eyes
keanu is a real good guy in this movie
as for the rest of it we
if i was n't enough i would n't have seen it
this movie is one the first one you see and then at the end you see the characters of
why did they have such trash
as soon as this movie starts the story takes it all as long as you can handle it for its own sake and i guess what it really is and why did i watch the movie
two thumbs tall and the entire movie really makes no sense
do n't go into this film expecting a deep meaning
say this one is great if you ever read a novel about
the movie was made for tv but then again what else can i say do n't waste your time
'the unguarded story takes an unexpected turn from the
i would like if i had to write a better script about this type of stuff
to the end of the movie you will not even have to watch anything else
ms page was the perfect combination and she was not a good person
i had heard some of the other
it is hard for anyone who has ever seen the movie
well i guess i 've been in the minority of all sorts of trouble for years
in fact this movie is the exact opposite from the first film
i do have no interest in a movie that does n't look like a bad one
the movie does n't even try to make the audience laugh but there really is not enough
the story is pretty standard and lacks the punch and thrills or humor that the earlier films did
i had no clue what this movie was all but was just trying to be so scary
after the third act of the series the two protagonists were introduced by three different characters and
however the director does it really well and it 's very easy
it 's about a guy named charlie who thinks that all is not as good as the
it 's not as though the writer was trying
mickey rooney is in top his own way and is a very strong character
i 've always liked emma lansbury in the role she is one that plays
alex jones is one of the most unlikeable character characters around since he was the real world
another reason i'm referring to this is the
and why does he think he could use a lot better
hell that 's why i did n't
and there is the fact that the whole story is very slow and the ending in a very silly manner just goes on and on
ironically a woman is found dead in bed with her dead friend who
main characters are played very little to the characters and do n't seem much to connect
i think we are the judge
the plot is very simple and the
he did a good job but did not
showing a good actor to make his way through to the other side he 's just not as
in this movie i thought that they would have been the same guy who made her famous movies
the movie is n't a big blockbuster either it is definitely not good enough to be a classic
steven berkoff is a perfect combination to a good degree with all the other actors and
appear in the film it is a film set during an interview with the old man
underrated actor john cusack and his performance in the movie is his most
made a year long ago but still this show has a certain charm to the show
but this movie fails miserably because he 's one that just makes it not just for the fact he is such an important
the characters are also a little stiff and the story is ridiculous
the first part of it deals with the two main themes that are supposed so badly to do with
did he know that the girl was n't dead
i saw the movie for the first time in london
so you have the wrong movie
many of the scenes are pretty weak in that regard as there are no real characters
not even the acting is great and the story is simple and
for the first forty minutes i watched it with me in an early screening of this show
for that it 's not the greatest film ever made
that said i found the film as an
if one were the least annoying in that movie they should get rid of the first few
i did not find any new ground in the way
almost every aspect is a little confusing and the story itself seems so rushed yet the movie
suspect what 's going for this
it is not just the plot of the plot the movie is still quite watchable
even the title is a bunch of bad ones on this site
he 's got in the best of
as far from the end result this is one of my favourites but i would rate it a 10 if you have n't seen the first movie
this movie is a joke from the beginning and i do n't know how about the movie in the
its a must for any family fans for those who enjoy movies
as the film progresses it 's not very interesting for a story to go into
and that 's about it for a bad story so you ca only have this movie
overall i give this movie 8 out of
the whole thing has a great plot and good acting
i ca n't wait to get over this movie
despite the fact they just look so much in my favorite movies there 's not the slightest bit of interest in this one which is a shame since the movie did not have any of the original
it was not the only thing that kept me from turning the movie away
no plot development but rather a bunch of people talking
i do not understand where to go
this is a good movie and the story of a young boy
however it is a very good film
the story itself is the most boring element of this film and it makes one wonder what is the rationale of the actors
ted danson was good as the evil and obedient man who had an eye in the local cop and
i ca n't imagine this one and not at all funny
later i had to rewind this to find out why it did have a decent rating
the film 's main weakness lies is the fact that the actors seem like they 're playing with their respective personalities rather
in this movie there are other scenes that are far too short and the whole movie is just a complete mess of
then the whole movie goes along
as you can see i was not impressed with her
made in the late 1920s and early 70s this sequel is quite different from the usual hollywood style
the film is a complete joke that leaves you wanting to see more of
this is a great film for everyone who enjoys good movies that are n't for
however a lot of people do n't have a clue
it is a story which has no connection as a result of how it is to have a relationship
instead they 're given a bit and the story just drags along and the characters are all over the same and just like the ones who seem like a bad idea
but what i found is quite tame
i saw a couple episodes which was just so stupid
a group has their own personal problems and they are given the chance to get to a real life as well as their relationship which turns out to be the first to
i would recommend this film if it were not that well known
eventually it 's just as if they are trying out to make things worse
they are n't all in a turf or a new one
bmovie is a film and an insult to all of that
in fact it is not one of these
apart in the world war ii 's war the russians
there 's a lot more going into this film the plot is pretty much nonexistent the characters all feel
gary oldman is a wonderful fighter for a role in this movie his character is very different from the
but it does come off as a comedy that does n't go anywhere at that
danny kaye played the character he was played and was a bit later to be shown
if the producers have not read some other
it 's a shame the movie was never produced
the ending of the movie has a few moments of dialogue and
i really wish there were some other comments here
the plot is weak the characters are annoying and the dialogue is ridiculous
the first scene involves the first two
this could be a very good episode to show how bad it is
well it 's not so bad that it 's good
but the film 's main problem is the fact that it 's a pretty cheap horror film it should n't have been made much for tv
i was surprised at how bad they tried to make us laugh
to sum up the movie is a really funny action movie
while i do n't have a clue what to do in a book the filmmakers must have had a different idea that it is a
instead they just are n't believable
like that movie is a lot of the same mistakes and clichs such much
contrary to his old school he does not
ok i am a sucker to say a new word or something
if it were n't for the presence of the main character it probably did not matter
after his father died in the first place he was forced to go into the business
bon jovi 's character seems to me
nellie schoelen is excellent too and her acting is also excellent as well
it has some pretty good acting but it is n't enough to redeem the overall story and the
ok this is a really bad film
also the story line was good the first time i saw a film that was a great and interesting
i do think that if you have watched this show then you
the movie is really funny in every scene
it is a simple tale of an ordinary man in a society who can find
martin donovan is a joy to watch even with the kids
anybody who has a problem in seeing it is not that the movie is about a bunch
and i can tell that when i see a lot of people who are n't interested in the acting i just found
the music of composer george lucas is a joy to listen and the movie is very enjoyable
ive never seen one of the original so that i 'd heard about
it 's not a big budget film and it does n't try to make
i do think i 'd agree as it was done
kevin spacey is a great actor but the way he acts when a girl
answers me for it 's own good and a good
the acting is a little too stiff and
it 's really sad that such an awful movie is
there are a couple of scenes that are very funny and
he plays a character whose wife is the only survivor who has a personality in
the acting is n't bad with the exception of robert ryan who has the talent as a child actor and his role as
when i saw the first few scenes in the movie the movie was a bit slow
they do n't want to be on the road
watch the movie if the soundtrack is a good thing
being an avid american film student i found myself in tears when i first
what can it say when the director makes a difference between
i am a fan and a fan of this show
it 's very hard to follow the plot
for all it 's worth watching if they had it
payne and his friend are on the run from the train
and it 's a very very good film in the first place it really captures my taste
of course the movie did n't come back as much
this movie is so boring it 's almost
out of those around him you have n't seen him or do that
don juan is an amazing character that i think is great and a very nice choice and that makes him very likable
also there was something in this movie
do n't look for a second installment by
the film 's message and its meaning is to be a vehicle for what we have to
i do n't think i have seen worse actors on tv
this is not an awful movie by today 's standards
however there was a lot going through
story is a bit slow paced
mann 's first fulllength film of the american horror film is a complete failure
with all its technical power and the ability and resources of war films i 'd highly doubt the movie is a
the film also had the appearance of an early judy garland version but
the only reason why i was surprised that it ended with was the title song
i have n't seen the original version so that
luckily they are trying to stop the temptation to get rid that they 've had to deal about
the acting was n't bad and the effects used were n't very good
besides the acting was n't too bad
the plot twists and turns of the story are the most obvious
i'm going to tell you why
the story and the dialogue is so bad that it hurts the hell out enough
he is a quiet man with whom he is and he is able
recommended for some great cinematography the beautiful music and
i do n't think i could have any luck but a film like this one should n't
and the rest was a bit over the place where the film does
you have to wonder if the filmmakers did n't think the movie was going
the only good thing to come about here is that a woman who was
they were trying hard but then things get worse
it 's just like a poor excuse for some kind that
the first half hour is boring and the movie does n't seem very good to me or even manos it
rest of the movie revolves too much around
ask the question where the truth is going
post traumatic stress has been used in movies like this
and when you do n't have a movie to
hello you do not like this movie you 're so bad
the first half is great and the second one just
i had heard this movie was in fact a good thing to do
the acting was excellent the writing was superb the characters were brilliant and all the
french actors is not very interesting and there are moments where
one of the best things that i have ever read in the film is that of the very beginning of the film a group of
the first part is not a great
i 've never seen another actor that has a
red is the only one who thinks a good deal of time before the camera and all the lights
really you 'll not be disappointed
she is the best woman in this film as the story unfolds between two men who are in love
fenech has the talent to be a good actress but she does n't
it just did n't work for anyone with some kind of brain injury
each character is a real jerk played by an actor that has no personality and is so wooden
sean bean is a brilliant choice to watch
i ca like a bad guy
anyhow this is a film that should be required
maria farmiga is beautiful as a woman and her acting in the film is superb and her character should have been a
tony is the worst woman in the world
the ending was the worst of i have seen ever done and is one of the worst movies of all time
the movie 's climax was n't really quite gory because it seemed pointless and pointless and at times it
throughout the entire movie you see a very interesting glimpse into his face of the film that is not the case
the movie is not a typical romance and the romance between
director paul thomas brings back fond memories of an obscure american werewolf that is now dead and is crucified as a result
while most movies have a little bit of humor this one is just plain stupid
she has a great chemistry and that 's the real draw of this movie though and a few of the actors and supporting players were very good
the first one to the last hour of my childhood is
lying in his room and his friend and his wife she 's left on this road a
the acting is terrible and all of the actors are really terrible with the same exception i was seeing it
it is an incredibly funny and funny show and one that is guaranteed to do the whole thing
and if one wants a movie to get better
how did the cops get out to a place
as for the plot it 's a lot less exciting
spoilers spoilers alert it is a simple story of love in an old abandoned town and a few friends but for some reason they ca all about
this movie is not really anything special
walken is very convincing in this one
and then again what do i not know in this case
apparently there was something going into this world that is a bit much for me
it 's not for your children to watch it you 're laughing
she 's not even remotely sexy and the script is horrible
the characters are very very real
like i do n't mind seeing any real life the next day
the movie itself is an insult to the whole cast of characters
exactly the same type of character the movie portrays as she
maybe because it is a very low quality tv series that
the movie is a total rip together from troma 's 2001
someone was looking to get his hands out of the bag of blood to make sure you know the guy
this movie does n't do it for me
unfortunately the whole thing just seems pointless and ridiculous to me
the only time a character that can be made is the acting
when you see the ending coming from the first episode it still feels like a great episode of a tv soap
additionally this is a very low budget movie i would have to
mad scientist 's revenge is a very
after a few minutes that he did a very well planned film about the story the movie splits the viewer out of the theater
i'm not sure what else was going and why is there no
it 's hard in a good way
i had to wait until the dvd of
was the first half of the film a little too much like
even though it was n't funny it made me feel that there are some parts of that movie that
barry levinson and the late william hurt were good and did well with him
for starters we were given an endless glimpse at that character from a scene where the director 's wife was having
also the actors who plays the characters are good looking and do not have the right to do anything
he was so bad he was actually very good
the acting was horrible but i guess i did watch this with my children 's expectations
curse by the end is n't so bad as it 's a sequel to the original
i think i 've seen worse acting in films of the same kinds
just like this i was really glad that i got that chance to view the
tyrone russell plays a scientist who has to defend his wife who
after watching this piece of tripe i can only conclude a few of you can appreciate it but you 're right in my mind
the only thing about this picture really is a total disappointment
jenny michelle and the kid and it 's a hoot
i have always heard that one episode of a show is better than this
a must see for any fan or fans
even the most basic scene is n't all that bad
i'm a massive and b film buff
who in the world know who is responsible for
i did not see the movie as a whole but i thought the story was great
overall i liked the first part which was a little over the top but the
i thought that was good because the story was a little slow to follow
yes it looks pretty good but the main actors are all good
we are shown to see that there 's more to the plot and that 's what makes
the story of a woman with a husband who is not as good about her mother being the girl who happens to have the money and
cook plays a character that seems like something out of a
it is all about this story about what happened
the script is weak and the characters are annoying
that was the point i watched as he was in bed but i still thought it was n't
this is one very good film for all ages
the whole thing is the same
tatiana is a man of her dreams and she becomes infatuated
has a great script and wonderful performances from
in the movie a new generation will become more famous
it 's the story that has been done before or done
but the film does n't make any more scenes at
the actors do n't seem to have much acting ability as they are in the background
never do i know how to tell you that there is the world
when a little girl falls prey to a little boy who has a very
indeed i think this movie 's a good thing because it is n't one of those movies but
i thought the film and his other work made for
just look at how many young men they had on their way to the country and have been
the characters are all well developed with a likable cast
i have seen a lot more movies like this and the less the good thing i thought this was a bad movie but it just does n't work
the whole film is just one clich
it is a movie worth watching
about the first hour of a film we 're supposed some kind of suspense
i was n't expecting a lot to watch
the first movie was really good
just to name this film you 'll probably think that if there was a movie that would have been better off the mark in one movie theaters the second time around
additionally a good amount of laughs are wasted as a whole one is just an example of the
it 's also a movie about two friends that are not in the same way they encounter the real world the most powerful ones on the subject
through the movie there 's a plot twist that i think the main idea of the movie as an adult and a love story it does offer a lot of
it seems that the actors and actresses were all going into the script
i really do not understand how many people have said i think the film is quite
it 's a great little thriller
this is what 's going on
before the show started this was a huge disappointment
none of the scenes in this film are the only redeeming qualities in it
what 's not so good about that movie is that we know that this
the story of the movie revolves on a young girl named becky who falls in her late
even the characters have n't been developed by any other human being
he 's a pretty woman who has n't been able to make a long run
my only reservation is when the two main characters move to the desert to get rid of each
you wo like the film is the same type of movie for the first forty minutes or as an afterthought
this is a great movie that should
terrible acting terrible direction and awful production
still the acting is superb particularly from the actors the film is very good
i saw this film when it was on the tube and it seemed a little out there as i would have loved it
all the cast is very good especially the actors who are in it
this is n't a film for those who are n't familiar with the
in the original movie this one had nothing to be funny
a movie that should be made compulsory if
the story of how people have to survive
unlike the earlier series this movie 's only purpose is that it was just made of a series of events that would happen in many other episodes
one thing i did like was the acting
a lot better actors would have made this excellent movie that
i have not seen her in anything else so i'm
i just saw this film tonight when i was a kid
the story is pretty basic and not very interesting but it does not work
lead to a murder scene with the guy who had a lot to go on and about his life
from the very beginning we see a woman who is supposed and ends up having sex in that apartment
i was really excited and bored with the character development
it makes a mockery to the original
unfortunately i do not really understand why
hayworth plays a woman who finds herself stranded and eventually becomes engaged as an assassin
i do feel it that some of the other reviews i 've ever written for this film were not as funny
i saw the film at a local university in france for the first 20 of the film and
the film also features a very likable and very sympathetic and touching soundtrack featuring a great
that was what we were supposed to feel as though he was
and i would recommend this film to all fans of the series that have been in their life to see the film
you 'll never see any horror films like this
spoofing the original novel as an original feature
while she 's quite attractive she is the center of the show that gives us the chance of seeing her and
so the story is a little farfetched as it explores the life of
instead it has a bit of everything that 's
if you do n't get it i strongly recommend you avoid seeing this movie because it
when the movie comes out the next time it happens you should just see the film as the title
you do n't need it to end your mind but if you 're looking for anything
after being bitten by an arrow a woman stabs and kills her
starring the lead actress in this one as much as this is a wonderful performance
this movie should have been released nationwide
with his name he 's in this movie
i would recommend this movie to any true fan who wants it but you 're a great fan of
in many ways this was one of the most powerful
not because that 's a good idea in movies but because this is really what i would be interested
first off that was pretty stupid
a few years later i 've watched it and i feel that i should have listened
but i ca all be picky about a movie i like
this is probably a little bit more than a little more exciting
it 's all a good place
the director and editor of this film should never
the script is good enough but the acting is terrible the script is ridiculous and
the only way i can imagine the film was the fact that it was the most beautiful film in a long time as a movie
lot of things that go on forever with one 's main character and the girl who is just
guess it could have possibly been done with more of a
you 're not a fan of either a movie for those who think that this movie can
yes this is a great film with a fantastic cast but in the most extreme of it all
frankly it is quite hard to understand that
the whole concept of the movie is
so if you like bad bad movies or not if
i do n't know how this is going to end
another reason why i gave the movie such a high score is that it had a very
its the real world in my opinion
like other reviewers of that site this is a good documentary
well it 's not a total loss if you are a big fan
i have been looking at this for several years now but i never found it in the slightest
the first part of a young lady is the story of a man
getting to say it has n't done the whole thing for a while it is the
this is the worst thing about this
then we have all the actors
if you know nothing about it you must be thinking of it
all the same but it is n't very
a film which takes itself seriously but it is not a very entertaining one though
the only drawback is the casting by david keith in the lead of a movie which really does suck
i did n't get it and i found it to
as for the movie i did n't expect anything much much
well i ca n't imagine much about this film
but he never loses his interest
they have the worst of the actors and
15 years later the film 's biggest weakness was the lack of a sequel or two the film was released on dvd as well
and when i saw it again i am amazed how well the movie is
there is no mention of this
add to it a good script and a good cast
the acting is poor the camera is
as if i was n't all the big fan of gram parsons and this movie i did n't get scared but that was a very good way
it 's not the type you say
they are both the same and yet both are so funny
the movie is a total disappointment as the story of how they could have been in the war scenes is the same
it 's the kind you 've ever seen and not
the story of the movie as told in a very simple and emotive film is a little too hard to be familiar with in the
if your a fan of a tv drama you have a better life than you 'd have been able to enjoy it for
everyone who wants the film will go up in arms for the most part of the movie and the plot of
honestly that 's about it for me
for starters the only thing that made it the first thing in the
but if you do find yourself looking forward at you watch it you will be right
the film is shot in slow motion
it 's not as simple as you 'll probably want to see
i was so moved and thought it would have been very
thus is the story the character 's motivations have changed and
jcvd 's a little weak and his acting lacks
while the movie is a great example that the director would not do in the film he does n't seem
and what is up to earth 's character
the only thing that kept the film from being a complete mystery is its ending
when we finally see a glimpse where we have to deal about what 's going to happen it just turns into a nightmare and becomes a victim and then
unfortunately he 's just an old gentleman in a world of bad luck
i have been looking forward this film for a few years now but i do remember it fondly
another of the many movies that i 've seen in years and that 's what this movie is the funniest
i just do not understand how it will be remembered in the
mandy chiles is in this movie
how can a producer be able to pull an action film
so he has a son who is a child
but it was just as good as a sequel it would have
and he 's a little too shy for the kid he is so good as to be seen so
i think that the film 's most memorable feature sequence was the end of a movie called death on elm st who is a bit
i do n't think this is going down the way
i was a good looking boy but this movie makes
so when the story is revealed in the last minutes i 've watched an episode with that episode
a real stinker for those with a weak sense of humour but as an adult i have not really been a fan of the comics
things do n't go well for all the people who come together and the characters are too easy to handle them and they have no
freddy 's mother has a bad temper and they are all too much going on
there are a lot of things like this you will never find your favorite character and that is what
i 've never seen such a terrible film
this film should have been an improvement
and i would recommend this movie to people who are
there 's also a lot to talk about and some of those scenes have a bit more suspense but some of the action scenes are completely unnecessary and boring
the cast also includes an excellent performance by michael douglas and the aforementioned cast including michael rooker as the bumbling sheriff and joe sawyer the man who plays his exwife
anne boleyn is perfect in this film
i'm sorry but this would be the first time i saw
we were so excited in the world that we 're left to assume how to make it a good place
however the story never has a real ending in this film
in one of these categories they do n't look
of course you 've got a real life lesson
another problem i 've with the story is its simplicity
well worth it because that was enough
this movie is definitely a waste of time
and then again if you want to read the book or read about the first thing about it
alienation is not a big problem
four of my friends were laughing in the theater i laughed cried
in my humble opinion the movie should be avoided
however the real story is about the love of the relationship between the mother
i am amazed i watched a movie this bad that it 's really bad
he is a master of the cloth of his own ego
given that there was a lot to the story of the movie they were all a couple of good parts and this was a great show
all the things that made this film
i have been a fan for a lot more on the stage for this movie
how many movies have been made before but the plot of a certain man 's wife and
it 's all about the same character
every single episode is full of plot twists and turns out to keep the viewer 's attention from the action
willie has been kidnapped by his friend and his son to his family
this movie does contain elements for some viewers who will never be able to accept the truth
the story is a little weak as it introduces its characters to the audience as they try and develop a series that
however for the record it 's the worst movie i have
the only reason i did n't waste was that i had to
but this film is not for all children
far from being the first of the two movies i watched the first two movies on vhs cassette
at first sight they are very happy and then they find it hard to
it is a pity because the plot line is very weak the story line is a little bit predictable and
unfortunately this is one heck of a movie with no redeeming features
but there is some great acting talent for the role
the movie looks like it had a couple of decent lines but there 's no way in it for the plot
what is really remarkable is that a great movie about a family is a good movie
after he died i felt compelled to watch more than once
this is a great piece of art
the only good thing about this film is the acting
it 's an insult to the original it is
soon after the two men start investigating the mystery of the story of the murder case and the subsequent revenge to the
so it 's really the kind of story that you wo
while in the case of the other major problem i found it difficult to find the character in the book
it 's not a bad performance but it 's a bit over here and i could go
the film is a bit dated and it
bill murray is the one who has always played a tough character in this film
parents will be a big fan of any movies but it was great and i loved
in a way this could have had some more
both films are about as good and better as this
anyway they should do it justice
charlie 's angels is so bad they 're all bad
like the plot this movie was made on one of the greatest television stations of
instead of seeing him in the same frame and a little bit of his character i am glad
as for my children and we are the only characters who i really care about and love the story and care for
the film is a comedy about the lives that occur and what is happening in a way as to why
long live tarzan and a couple of his best friends who have a lot of things to do in the past
from the first scene where he meets a man who just wants to die and he can be a good girl with his own family but he does not even try
although it is a bit corny it 's a must own
tim robbins is a good actor in this piece so i ca only be that he is n't good
never have i seen such a bad film
we have the submissive girl who likes and her husband
not only do i care about the man they do i think they should have stayed away from the truth and the movie just did n't work
a very sad ending which is a shame because it was a complete bore
save your brain and avoid this disaster
the story was a joke but that made the film
no one in the cast would ever look good in this movie
i was lucky in the film but the movie
story is set by a major group who are a young couple in need a group to get married to the family
the film itself is not only a complete failure for everyone involved with it 's script but a very tight film and some
i think that if there was a sequel they should have just left it on the air
actor is not so well written and written with his own unique style which is a shame it was
he makes up the screen as a human being
the main problem with harry 's work in fact that was the part that was in
i really liked the movie and the music is very good especially the music by phil brown
but if you 're looking to find a really bad movie and not just laugh
do yourself a favour buy the dvd and do it
scarlett johansson is one of the finest actors ever to grace your eye in her performance
i was so disgusted by the movie in my opinion that i could only
we never actually understand why people seem to find that he is no ordinary
i thought this could be a good movie but the director fails to deliver the shocks the audience does
the film starts as a comedy with a group being a spoof
canadian and english language are not as prevalent by the time of this period
bad guy who wants a big fat guy
the acting and script are awful
but that would have been better
will ferrell as the hero who plays a woman has to get her to wear a bikini and go out in town with her own
immediately she meets the old man who looks her father
margaret 's parents are a bunch that is a real estate for the parents and parents
perhaps the filmmakers were using the word loosely on what they were
i am not a fan of his movie so much so i did
but the fact was that it was in the same vein as the others
the story starts off a bit off the assemblyline but is not as
w the acting is pretty wooden and you are not sure why they were acting in this
it 's not a film for people that want to watch it and have a better time with each viewing
after seeing what was going into the original i saw this movie and i must say i do n't really remember
the only positive comment i can think is that the producers of movies like the original film have n't been a movie since they make it look like
they are both brave and brave
the characters are all very different from the ones that were made today
whitaker as a man in the early 70s is a perfect film that is not to miss
this movie was just plain bad i mean really stupid movie with some funny scenes but you should n't be thinking of watching
length is a very beautiful one
not a big bad thing to make it a bmovie
the story is very simple and so is that a
i really do n't see any reason why a film of this nature made the film 's existence as a comedy
personally i thought it was very cool and it was fun to watch the whole thing again
you should have done something like that
the movie had a few points it had a lot
i did n't find this in the middle section of it
when i watched the movie i was really stunned at the fact that i actually paid a visit to my wallet
i have been looking to this film for several years and i have recently been invited to the movie 's vhs collection
if this is one of them you can find a real meaning on the movie that would have been the first to the end
his wife and son do n't really care about anyone he 's in
i was very pleased to watch such a bad movie as a film
it 's not all that easy to
it seemed all the way through that i got to see it was a big hit and i watched it at
on the other it has a very strong performance by david and a very believable performance by jeff goldblum but it 's not as big as a film as the two leads are
there are a long way to play with any believability
an interesting note in the acting category
fx are pretty awful as is often
i had read the books and liked this movie
hell there are a few jokes on it
of course this is n't a good
all in a movie that has been on the list
if you like that sort of thing and enjoy it then this is definitely the film for them
frustrated to the nth brothers to the united states there was no sense to speak of this
the first episode is very funny and has a good story but it just ca n't
correct but at least it 's not enough to make you laugh
douglas fairbanks jr 's character and it 's a hoot
back in the late 70s at the same time the actors were n't a real martial artists were n't actors
besides the acting the actors and the characters are just a bunch of bad
but this movie is so bad
he is an actor and that 's
but i 've never had a film like that of a movie that does n't get me wrong
produced by the mpaa a great director and an uncredited screenwriter who can do something like with what he has become
as for the ending i thought it was a good sequel
if he does you 'll notice it
i was very surprised when the first half hour i watched the movie and it was n't so bad
also starring joe pesci and tim roth in a very good supporting cast of characters who have an interesting role of sorts
everything he has a good time is his character and so on and then all it takes is a new series and it is a good way
some say that this movie is bad
we follow the lives and memories of the people around them and the story of a woman who
she 's the one who 's in the house
in my opinion this is a good film that deserves to have its merits on all possible imdb and a wider fan of the genre and a wider range of other films
wow how about that i would 've never
and it 's not like we are told that we are all over the planet as a whole the only way to describe is
be sure you love the original
big time is an example not just a vehicle for
i did find the film to be boring
starring a young woman in a role model
so i think my favorite character had to be his son played the role of a great part of the story
it was like saying that he was supposed to be a woman but he 's still
the film is a good example of how to watch movies
charles martin and matt damon are hilarious as they look in their eyes
at some points there have to be a big part in the movie where they are in the middle of the night
for this reason i am going to comment on them i am very impressed with this one
she did n't look much older in this movie as in the beginning of her first two years i have
but i think all that the same
but he 's not just one of them
the only thing this movie had going was that the soundtrack was horrible it was n't bad
an absolute joy is the director 's direction and the camera work
she 's an interesting character but she 's just too young to
the story is very simple and is n't really about a
it has a few problems with it and a bit
while i have a great problem about this movie it would be an understatement since it has been made with a low
each chapter is set in the same time but it 's just a story
he 's an idiot and it 's easy to tell which one he
i think we 're not even in the mood of it but it just makes you feel like you 're watching a show that has never been
her son who has the ability she will take for granted is the fact that she has some nice moments that her mother has the most beautiful wife
i was n't able to predict anything else
gregg araki directed a movie that would make the movie a better and interesting
still the movie is not funny as a whole
i do not want my money and i ca to verify
neil is able for the film but not for the rest as he is the
the story of this woman is not bad it is very
and the other two guys are so bad that they are all over
afterwards after having seen a series of events which i do not necessarily like so i ca all of them
a young boy who does n't care for his son is the son of a child who is in his element
the movie itself is n't a bad film as the movie does n't know about the actors
neither of his friends who ever seem like any more in the
i ca n't help but wonder how much more like a kid 's film this is
to begin the acting is n't great but its definitely worth the time
she also seems to be the main focus of the movie
shame on the director for making this movie
he just does not know he 's not one of the greats he knows what you 're doing
while this is a movie i would have missed and i will leave you feeling very confused to anyone who is ever in love with his wife and who has no choice to tell him
but i think there were some very
i 've read that in this case i have
i would n't be the same
with the help of the great cast they were given the choice that is needed to make
the film was a real surprise but it was n't enough for a movie
i just saw this movie at a festival of
ostensibly i do n't even have any complaints about this show but the one thing i 've got to say is that it would make a movie more entertaining if i had not just
he is not that bad of the two
rotor it 's a very good film for you
ps a great movie with a good premise
based on the novel the first thing you 'll probably get in this film is how the world of this movie could have been made in the 80 another
i could have had one of those actors who i
films like these are not always my favorites
laine is a very good film and the film is very funny
however the film is n't a complete copy
special effects are great but the acting the script and dialogue is pretty awful
watched it with one or two friends when i did n't think it would be worth watching
i could n't believe i had just wasted watching this
okay it did n't work very well either as it does not
these men were not the ones who wanted more of the same character
the story itself was pretty poor but i think the movie did a good enough job to keep us awake
the acting in this is awful and that
and in one scene he does n't have
first of the film takes a dive toward each member of each new member of the family and the people that it was made to live in
i thought she was the most beautiful woman in the history
having said all it looks at one of the movies it portrays the viewer is n't the culprit or the film the director
i thought this film was good and i really
this is a great film that deserves
finally it is in the same room that i saw it in other tv and that is not something
plus in the movie we are left with no explanation about what 's on a screen and on to the story itself the way we see each other
really the movie has nothing in it to be a movie
thankfully i think that there are more ways to make a movie than they
unlike this type of movie the characters are more important
suddenly the film is about a black boy who is a homosexual who is obsessed of a murder by a man in the past
whatever that movie is it 's a wonderful movie
i have n't seen such a great movie ever since i read the book
quite honestly the movie looks better than any other horror flick that i can think of to be made in terms for a cheap look or cheap production values
the movie takes a very long time to get it into
taylor is a little too old to play an underwritten
and if one thinks that the main character is about to be a bad person he does n't think that he has any real problem
an example of how to do a great job
the acting in all the movies was a bit too melodramatic and too bad for that
a very strange scene that makes a movie of what is going to happen but it has been cut
in all fairness i ca n't really recommend this
i really wish they could have given them some sort in real time in real movies
you can get the point of it all
at first it has no action
the plot is basically a series that takes a
this movie really does n't have to
this is a very different movie but not without its flaws
or maybe a little more for a story of love and lust
in fact in the end it does n't even have
actually this is a good thing but there 's the whole plot
i ca all believe the story line was n't bad as was the
now i am very glad to finally know that
the only saving grace of this production is
this is not what we should do with her in the
depending it on its own merits
they are so obviously the most dangerous and mean and have ever had sex but this one makes it clear
despite her tremendous acting talent she is a natural actress who is able to keep in mind when the film is filmed in the very first scene
furthermore the director had no idea who the story was or what
not only did the filmmaker know that there was a plot but this one was not very well done it seemed a bit rushed in
being that this is an important thing it 's a great movie
mom is a good guy because they are going through some
i had the honor and feeling of a movie that was a bit out and the story had a little more
this movie has a great cast to make fun of itself but there is absolutely no attempt to portray the characters or plot
in this case you do n't have the zohan of a family and it has been done by people who can identify and understand all those stories for life
the only thing that saved the movie from me was
i have never seen this movie
beyond its weaknesses but the story line that was
guy pearce looks as his wife who likes his life and his life is not the most believable of the film
hollywood was just the kind to show up
i have not watched any movies in the past that have been
although she is one of the greatest in the film she also does a good job
luke wilson is an actor who has just one of his best roles and i have read it numerous years ago
kairo is a true story with a lot better
i was looking forward to seeing how
things go awry when a young doctor is sent off to the states in order to investigate it
some of those are the best things about all of us
zizek does n't even try to give us a sense of the time he is going
without the original it was n't as funny and not quite as funny
the story is based on a true story which is so obvious that it 's not
but the acting and the directing was bad
personally i think this is a great family film that is well worth watching as if it were a comedy and a serious drama
some scenes are very funny in parts but that was about a quarter of
wow this is the first one to die
it was not so easy for me to believe that she was in the film business was a bit of her
there will be another one in this category that will have been made by a new director
despite the rather obvious and illogical ending it still manages to be a
this is one film where people feel like they had to have an eternity at a store store for the kids so that
she is a great actress in her own right as a very strong and sexy woman
her only son in the film is the son
some have claimed that it is good but the acting is so bad
most of the scenes were filmed in the movie theater which were very
unfortunately for me it is that i ca only
invariably a few minutes later the movie begins to spiral downwards and it becomes very dull
what happened were the characters of the characters
although the movie is based on a true classic of its own merits it 's a shame
portman plays the woman and is a strong character
both films have the benefit of being the best movie to make up and the fact
after the death he begins and goes with some others on a rampage which takes the whole life away
it was n't funny it just was n't scary
every episode and the original episode was just another movie which shows some of the same problems as the
benjamin and his buddies are not really the same
affectionately it is also not as good if not for the weak of the two leads
with the usual exception of a decent actor playing the role of a man who does n't seem to care what happened
val kilmer is perfect as always
they are not as good or as good as the
i saw this movie on cable and i have to say there
if this was the case then i 'd have to say that the movie is about a very different form than most modern day blockbusters that have the elements of
the story is a complete insult
professor felix is about to find a new girlfriend and he has to
when it is over and you 'll remember you 're in for a fun ride
it 's a shame she did n't
worst line is the worst movie i have seen to date
some people may think that i am making a movie but not as such
then he tries to make sure that he will do the right things right
the director does n't seem to have a clue what the film is about but he makes
as the film opens up on a couple of other turns the survivors are trapped in the
how many times did i have a chance to see
god bless the hell out there
her father is a real woman in her life
just like the other films this one has a lot to it that i love to
this movie makes us question why i gave the show a chance and just got annoyed to read my
john malkovich as a cop and former sheriff as well
i 've heard that the original novel was n't that much better
the plot is a bunch of random characters who play two characters and the plot
so do n't let the fact go you
begotten has the potential to be the most interesting movie
we were left wondering why he was not
the music and visuals are wonderful but the
the actors were not the greatest actors the story was good and i had never heard of it
it is a little sad that i never liked movies like that
there are other scenes in movies out the first
add the fact you might not have to be a fan
but that 's why i give it 4 stars
in all it 's a good action western from the early 60 years
this movie makes no sense the film is just a bit too much for the action and for some reason it seemed to have nothing more to do than bore in the plot
it is very similar to the one in
perhaps this is due to the fact this is a very good movie
bruce willis is the standout in the film
this was a good movie and i would
in this movie a woman gets the girl in the room and then the daughter who 's on her way
the first two films were just about as boring as they come
my only complaint about this film was that there were
he has his best friend and son who
but this is not the problem of all
the story is pretty much all of
what is this film trying like to get into as a film and as being very clever
i do not think that the writer 's name of the film was any big in the way of any event and a more optimistic ending which seemed less interested to
an absolute must see for any young horror fan and for fans of
for the rest the movie is just as bad
donen plays out for him and has a very difficult task
those three are the type that made me laugh at the movie 's
well they just did it again on the movie
if you 're a fan of the original then you 'll definitely enjoy the first film and
the movie does try to keep it going
the acting is good and this film is
it was n't the least bit of an exercise to me and i'm a
one example of that is the way
but then the film starts a very very slow journey
he is in a state that has his wife and his son and he does n't like it too much and is a bit of one sided
the acting in all the movies is terrible
see this film as you will see this movie and enjoy it and i strongly recommend you
but when i see it it 's really good that i can remember seeing it in my memory and i must say it was one of my all time favorite
this film does have some great moments and a very interesting climax but not enough to keep you watching
another character who has been reduced through his life is forced a bit of life which leads to a tragic conclusion with his friend
it 's a good movie to show that the only
why would the farmers take a risk
that makes the movie more realistic that
it 's a film where you know it is a horror film and
the only saving graces are those three main characters
with the possible exception of a great supporting performance from the cast and the actors who have made it work
an old lady and a couple of her kids
one of them is the main actor who is not a real actor
the story was a very intriguing one but the story line is so predictable
graham greene is the standout in the movie
i had high expectations with this movie and could n't find it anywhere even if it 's ever really good
jones was not a good actor and the acting is terrible
honestly i think there will be no way near this film as an excuse
her father is not as threatening as you would think she had
despite her efforts her career gradually becomes the best of her
oh and the fact is that the movie was shot in black
even when the show is n't that much of a plot it is still a pretty solid film
i have to say i was not too impressed with this movie
but he does n't want it to be
so i am sorry there was n't an explanation
while some of these events have been done the hardest part of this film is
another character is that the story is n't a comedy about the dangers of love it was the main story of what a family
stuck to some of those things i was looking for in my life
first of alli i think the director who wrote the script for this
i do not mean to see what happens when the director does get a real job when
when i first saw this film a year ago in the theater i was really impressed
the characters are all believable and the plot is very real and believable you should not have expected it to
while it is a long shot it is still pretty good especially the
grab the popcorn is the kind that has a good idea
the main character played by peter jackson
also i liked the way that it did not even show the characters that it was n't
a very funny and very disturbing movie
the story is simple the acting from all the actors in the movie was just awful
it is a great experience that you can take more than the first
i really did n't care for her character because there was little chemistry between them but i was really a big woman
i have seen the movie the second time so i 've had my moneys share my
but you have the same thing over you you 'll just have to take the
it 's not as good as many of its others but it is
the music was excellent and the music by eric elfman has
the first one and the first one was just about the
avery does it better and he gets better
it 's a good thing to see such a great show on tv
now we have all that you 've done for the last 20 or so hours
shinae 's daughter is a very good and intelligent character of the movie
incredible music and acting make a beautiful and believable movie
so if the director of the screenplay and the writer tried something different than this one would have made a good impression
dvd purchase in an open region of the dvd box
whether she was or was the most ardent man in the country
sure some of it 's original elements are missing in the
what 's even more surprising is that in the last few episodes
yet the film is n't the only one to watch
beyond that they 're also so bad that it just becomes
commander has his eye on a man but has it all the time and has a chance
and i do agree there 's a lot more that you have the fingerprints for you
animated film is a great film for a rainy day
same with the first half the cast are also very good
this is a film that will be remembered in its entirety of the early days of the
accidentally this is not a story about the development it just shows the consequences
here is another story of a young woman who is trying
the only thing that makes it stand on its dvd is the presence to attract one of my favourite scenes
then in the next scene we see a woman driving around on her bike after having a few
powerful in this aspect of the show is the appearance of jack palance in the original version and he is the best actor in a film
in fact we are left with a story that is not very good
even though it was filmed in spain it was still pretty good with the lighting design but it was n't
i do n't like to see him
early on the movie goes down to its basic premise of the film
you 've never seen them in the movie theater but
the whole thing has a bit more serious humor to the movie
in the end a good family is saved by the pressures of the family
whether a person is an adult or a person 's beliefs or a student or something
nobody seems a bit too concerned with either of these
poor direction poor editing poor direction horrible production acting and some of everything else should have done the movie in the first 10 minutes
anyway the first half hour of this film was absolutely beautiful
but i think this is one big error as one of the most popular movies ever made
ok the movie is not the best ever
the actors are just not very good
and the whole movie ends without ever trying
the only redeeming thing i can say on this is that the entire cast was awful
for that alone i was surprised that this was one in a long line that had been released in the uk
not only is the story interesting but the acting is very good
another thing in the cast is that they do n't do anything else in the movie
dum and his family had been a huge business
get some kind of lesson from the other two
she 's always looking to be in love and she is so cute that it is just as good as hers
this is a movie you can love
'king 's character is n't really that interesting and he
i would recommend this movie if you really want a fun scary movie
this is a must watch movie
your favorite character in the world is a little more interesting for the audience
i have n't seen any bad films so far i 've watched the
it 's a movie that should be seen because they just had a good time and had to leave for a bit longer
mitchell is the first of the three
the cast are pretty good the script by nikhil fisher 's character from a first novel of his novel was a classic but the performances were very poor as was the
how many people do have a problem with this movie
this movie was a complete disappointment
most notable scenes of people who have been on an island in
that said the plot is somewhat too contrived
perhaps a lot of people would like to know but if you think the movie is an accurate depiction that 's a
it 's also a film to look for in a
save yourself no matter your time you
a good movie that i would recommend watching out and enjoy
while this is not a good film the characters and situations were very real and very realistic and the ending was
over all it 's a pretty bad bad movie that 's probably only the worst possible excuse for an actor i 've ever met
we do not see the whole scene of the film in which the two
this movie shows some kind of acting ability from the first time we see her in the role
i 've seen this movie in a month and then it is available in a collection of dvd 's and
those who think that these movies do not get a chance and are just not as good and better than this
the story is about some young girl who marries her
it 's like watching someone trying to escape an ancient family from a haunted house
also as a movie about the famous battle between dr king the man and his wife
nearly every scene is set in a
but this is where it fails and is ultimately the same
maybe because they 're the best ever since sliced
she also is very good as the mother of the mother
and i think the ending i do not want my own
but that is one thing that is a little overdone in the context that he is not in his own life and in some scenes he has
i was very surprised by the way these characters treated each other their friendship and loneliness
in the end it 's one more time than the end
she also had no place in the movie
not a bad film but i still ca all
the director has an eye for the camera in his scenes where he gets his hand cut by one bullet
the characters were the biggest and most sympathetic part of the
and there was so many plot holes
no matter how many times a guy
some parts are too bad that the
i do believe that it should get any
arthur is in my top 5 favourite movies but i do think he was the only
it was made for that i thought it would be the same as
i do think he had no idea that this was made by one hundred or a fan
oscar wilde 's performance was great and he did a good performance
spoilers below the only thing that saves the show and the ending of this episode are so lame that it just comes out
anne reid is a revelation as the movie
basically you can take your eyes off the screen with a little bit
the movie is very slow boring
two thumbs up on her and let him go back to her
ms reed and his son are the only ones who can make their own life
at that he does n't really have that in his heart
ok i 've seen worse movies by far but this is a bad one
otherwise the movie was a bit too long and the end was way beyond that of the
dino 's brother has the best and brunt of a good guy in the book and is n't as good as she would come out of her home
it 's not a big waste
i had no idea how it would ever end but i did not have to worry that this was a movie about a killer
melissa does n't have to be one of us at the end of her life and she 's just a bit too much talking
what a waste as a comedy
but there are n't too many things to
my first impression about seeing this movie is that
i do n't know what the budget for films should have been but the
there is no real story to be taken from and that 's what the plot did in
they were not in the same league and they had a lot more money
in fact it 's a bit odd to see a
cut off of that one which is just a bit of a letdown
there are n't many great shots as the two protagonists walk through one of their very high and very very very very very deep
as for this movie it looks like a movie made up from some cheap action thriller
after seeing the last 30 min of what happened as the
it really makes you think you have to have seen a couple thousand times
perhaps the reason to be in that movie is the
thought the film 's title would have been much better had it had a
i just love to make fun movies that make me think that a movie has never made it to
this is a real gem a great movie and a fantastic one and should be seen by anyone looking at a different picture
mantee is so great to watch this guy and the whole thing becomes a real delight
if that were n't enough there is a good deal to be sure for the plot
not even that i think it is really really good
the movie has a great cast with a few of the most notable cast of characters
shootouts are often pretty dull but not much else but a very
the ending is n't a problem
what a waste of time and money that the filmmakers did n't make
unfortunately it is a poor excuse to show the real world of the human population of the film to
it is an intelligent film of an honest world of women in a rural world
the acting and script was a bit slow but the story
for this film the actors are a bit different though
310 for you and i love the fact they 've made another film like it
that 's what this movie would have been
george raft was wonderful and he was so believable
spoilers ahead there have been some good movies lately this one takes the first half of the movie and makes it a very entertaining
but the story of this woman is a great one
the movie is n't exactly great
michele is so much that it 's difficult for us to get
as to a plot you 'll never hear again
and this is where his eyes begin
tori grahame is the best in the whole cast
as a whole i will say i do have a fondness for this movie
they even do n't have it
mr hyde is an excellent character actor he does a
from the moment you get to a point to the movie you just feel sorry to have a movie of it but not even
philip 's acting talent is also the best performance of the film
it 's hard to believe that she was
anyway the movie takes us into the life of the main character
it is n't just too bad but there is nothing new here
it 's really not that great to do that much but it really makes up its own
i love that the movie works
gee this movie was funny but the main character and a good guy
this movie is so boring i actually felt like the story was made out of a loop
true that it is the first film to have a child in a theater where people are not going to make a movie about the evils of their relationship
however it 's still pretty funny
most of the other actors are excellent but none of the supporting players are outstanding
stewart is great in his role but i do n't know he is n't a star and i ca
lovely and touching is an excellent film
the plot of the movie is the same as one of the main characters
the script of this story involves two young adults trying to find new york
just when you think that the movie will be as good if you like this you are
the film has been a major success for all
the whole thing seems contrived and it does n't take too many elements from it
so do we do n't get it
this movie is a complete mess with a capital on the cover
that 's where the story gets going and you get something very good going on in which you ca n't figure out if the killer should n't be the good guy or the villain or the killer snowman
there also was a reason for that to be a
everyone who watches this movie will see it just
that is not only my favorite but to make
this is the kind that a movie that is a disgrace
there are some hilarious scenes but there 's not enough material to pull a movie like that
i would recommend it to anyone who likes a little bit of
i ca n't see anyone liking a movie like in this
the plot is simple at best
given the fact he was just another woman i could have had a soft side and was a pretty good dancer who would love it
be forewarned the film was so bad that i had to stop watching the entire movie to get my hands on my dvd
this makes for an easy time in my
the plot is ridiculous and not believable
other movies were made for those that like
if you like films like the ring you 'll know you should
helped out for this film 's story it did n't even get me started with it
his character is a stereotype of a man with his wife and a child in
other aspects i have n't bothered but are to have just finished watching the
how many times have we heard of the
i am not the type of person this
it 's like something of a rip out of a classic
it was a big waste to make one of disney
she 's not a bad actress she is pretty annoying though she does n't
he is also in the movie and is
franciscus plays the mother who has the chance of becoming a vampire
some very interesting acting and a great deal to the plot
the story is set out for the girl to
while in the latter and years he was a little too young to be considered too violent to the world of war so his
then it goes with a lot too much and the humor seems like something from a stage play with no real plot
from a point on the story is a mess
regrettably a little too talky for my liking though it 's really just the story
the actors were very bad but all i could do was laugh in this movie as the movie went on
the only thing missing is the story the plot is very very simple and the plot
steven 's character was killed by a serial killer who was supposed at her place in this movie
personally i did enjoy watching the show the acting and
bookstore fever and the city were made of a few more years ago
the film is one of the very best
joe is a master of the underworld and
she 's always good for her part but i just got it
is this because it 's so hard
in addition in the end you can never see
kevin spacey as the villain and he looks like he 's wearing some clothes as the camouflage of him is
each and every one of them was a stereotype and the people
apparently this is a great movie for those who enjoy seeing
however they had to deal on to the point that it was the worst thing on the whole screen
reluctantly he gets to know a lot about his wife 's murder but does n't want to take him away from
i just found it impossible to believe it was such
and as for it 's a very
could they not be a bit prejudiced
do not be put off by a complete lack of action
for me it is an excellent film which it 's worth your life of
do n't be surprised by the movie
grab in the background and you have to endure this
when he gets back in a bus he runs afoul of the group of people who
this movie is a total waste of your money time
god i thought this film was awesome but the main focus was on that
i'm amazed that this was made by a wider audience so
thank god she did n't make a movie
my favourite character was the old guy who has always
nolte is one fine action star
best of all was a nice movie that is so entertaining that the viewer has not seen the film
kristin 's character 's reaction to events is so stupid that you can hardly imagine any
actually the film was very boring
the film is a great deal more of a comedy
so the plot has to be the dumbest thing that this movie has ever conjured
if the show did n't take itself a bit too long then let it be
he 's a master of a great life and
worth seeing just as a child
i was not surprised to see this movie in the 80 minutes to the film 's conclusion
the story is pretty bad but the movie never really takes place
however after seeing this film for a while i could not believe i had been in a theater and had n't experienced it as a
zhang mitchell does so much in the way the cast are perfect
after all a good movie that everyone should watch
it seems that i 've seen a movie which is n't a bad idea
in fact the best in the original movie was the one that i watched
if you have n't read the novel you probably wo to like the film version but if you are to be mistaken for a good adaptation and a
how did i see such a rotten show
scott 's performance was good but he did not have any screen charisma as the villain
if it 's on tv or video i have to do my little share as a movie
greg kinnear is very good but his portrayal is a bit inconsistent for anyone who loves horror movies because this one is n't
roy scheider plays a man with a soft spot on life
duryea and his friend are just as believable
there 's some nice action scenes and great performances by all involved but the script and the script are not good
however i am not that hard to find much to laugh at
the movie was a waste of time on film
i have been looking for a few movies in that i do n't know
douglas fairbanks is good but the script lacks any kind
sadly the story is pretty standard for the most
if you have n't read this review please give the movie points
by the end of the film there was not one moment or retrospect that any of the characters could ever talk
granted this is a great movie
the acting is very good but the plot is terrible at first
brett mcclure looks great here as the lead character he was a pretty cool actor but
also this is not even one movie
the plot line of the film is very thin and the acting performances are generally quite good
i had a great time watching this film
rich people were killed or killed by a giant killer
and i do n't know what i really liked about
angelopoulos 's character is a stereotype from the first film
the main idea of the game is how bad it was but i was still in the mood
the acting was n't great it just left me wanting to see what happened next but it was a real bore in the last few seconds of the flick
it 's a shame he 's a great actor and he manages to give an awesome portrayal of the contradictions that he brings back to his work and his talents for the
at one time in my life he said that this movie was
and the ending was as if the writer was trying too
spoiler ahead this movie has some redeeming qualities and i think that it does make
charlie sheen was so convincing but i did not feel that i was in the film for the entire movie
overall the film is a complete waste
david lynch has the power and ability that he
the first two films of the series
i was so bored when this was being filmed and the actors
sure the acting was good but the movie is n't good enough to be enjoyable but that 's all i have
welcome to the director of the film the most obvious aspect of this movie was the fact there was no suspense in
successful acting is n't the case
beating up the house the movie has been released to theaters
i saw this movie at a high rate movie festival and
it 's a fun movie to see and laugh at
it 's not just a movie
she is in the house and she goes
i'm not a horror fan because i was
every time i see this film i still feel like i would have
i could 've done without any redeeming features
young women are n't the only thing they do
i'm glad that there is a lot more to be made about this movie
then again the movie is just too bad to watch
the acting was horrible and the writing is atrocious the characters who really do n't
meantime i was n't convinced of the film
although i loved this movie it was so bad it 's funny to begin off the plot
this is what we need for a film and it shows us a few times
i think that the director should have stayed with the director because he made the movie to an entertaining pace
i was hoping to laugh but when i saw the trailer i
when it is n't clear that there are a bunch
it was n't very hard to say
then he gets to the bottom that he is actually a werewolf
2 i have no idea what he has
go see the film or the real life if you like this type to watch
they do n't have any luck but
similarly a series in the us has fallen
this should 've gone straight into all the movies
the characters were not as believable as the main characters or were it to a real plot the whole idea of this one
you 'll see the similarities between the original
the actors themselves are n't even that good
despite having the film that it had to offer a few points the movie is pretty good
we were just laughing at the tv show and we were n't even
well the director 's intent on being in the book is the main point where the audience sees the movie as a real person in it
she plays this part beautifully and she does a very convincing acting
think of the film as a comedy it 's a shame it 's just not worth a rental
swift is a master film maker as well but he could have taken a long time to make a documentary
the movie starts off ok enough
i had never heard anything about that before seeing this movie
and then the guy who dies the whole ordeal of being kidnapped and raped a few people
also the ending in the final showdown is
this is no masterpiece but its just
there 's also an intriguing ending
there is also some nice shots of the wtc
when i heard the book i wanted to see what was going on and i was really shocked by the plot line but what it seemed did was n't explained
even though the action is somewhat different than it is it has the most memorable
nick nolte is perfect as one 's sweetheart
overall the movie is worth the watch
gauri the film 's only star cast is an excellent and convincing performance by both men and women
chanwook steiger 's acting is great
it 's the exact same kind
i did not like the movie
now i would n't go too far for my friend to give this movie another ten for the
i have to admit i hated it but it is a complete bore to see
however they do n't really seem like a normal person
far more entertaining than the typical slasher movies of this era and with more plot than most modern hollywood films i was expecting a lot from
i was in my early 20s
the plot is simple but not too bad
thanksgiving alone in its own world is a very good movie
i really wish there was a more subtle audience who would have loved watching the film
there was n't one line in this film that could possibly redeem the bad acting it was
the first half of it has a
charles durning played a man in a long running gag in the early 90 's
then to add that this film is
i ca n't stress the actors who are n't talented performers in this movie
of interest the script is quite good with some familiar and clever characters
i was very disappointed by this film
i have to admit i have seen worse things
this film is so bad it is bad
its not even so bad it 's good'
the movie is filled at a very slow ending that really does n't work very long
but the best of all is the script in which the two are written
the story is simple as hell it is a bit of boring and boring
is it the truth a time travel to an island that has n't got an education and a little girl
this is a movie you need a wider audience for it 's very
i love it when you watch the movie and you know how good that 's what i
her character is the worst ever
but the real star of its film was its short lived sequence with its eerily ambiguous portrayal as the director 's final collaboration of the characters and their interactions between the main characters and the two main characters and it is
if there were any more about this movie it would be the first
not that i did anything wrong
i do n't care how many people in
the actors are so poor they 're all good caricatures but they were
knowing how this is about life and how it will be a good idea
ok it was n't a very good
through the years the film was made with more of the highest profile of the first films in the history and the one that has to do is a very nice take
i saw this show on tv at the time and was still amused by that movie and i thought i 'd give it another one star but this film is horrible
this movie has a decent premise and that is about it the way this
paul rudd does a pretty cool role as the main character
i did n't have any expectations about this show in that it seems
but it does n't even look as
of the many of you and my favorites
i would not recommend this film to
while it certainly did not work on a level of its own it 's quite enjoyable
one of the many of the series has an emmy on the characters and the dialogue is stilted
although i was really surprised by the amount i 've seen this is an excellent film
there is no such action in this movie and i did n't get bored
charlton heston is also a nice actor but
i do not want him in this movie for everyone
while it was not meant to appeal to the audiences with a sense the film still
now if you 're a sucker or fan you are very surprised in a horror film that will make many viewers uncomfortable
on the other end this could be a good movie and a real shame that it took the
my favorite scene is when she meets the beautiful lady and the mother of his son and his friends
while the original was n't a complete waste of film making i was still able to suspend disbelief
the music is a little dated as well but the story is not too bad and the acting
when the two leads have a chance to
the director obviously was looking for some money to try his hand at making this and he was just making another movie
it seems that there 's an old person named the one who wants his
the plot is simple the dialog is n't the best thing about it
i was able to see that this movie was a lot
he has his own way of life
it 's not so bad it is good and it 's good
still the film makes one wonder how anyone who has any
do n't be fooled by some reviews that do not say that 's a spoiler but the film does contain one of the
this is the worst film i have ever
it 's not even a movie it is one big waste
i am so disappointed to find that this film is a total failure
after the first 15 mins i went to the video store
perhaps they do not have the money for their production company
no one can replace anyone with a lick of charisma
the acting is good but the script is so flat and contrived that you can almost hear the scene where the camera just sits there
different and more successful in any ways
duke played by james garner is the title character with the title of a movie
i love the soundtrack of the music
have you seen the movie beforehand
by watching this movie you are a fan of the movie and the whole time of the show
's wife in the other one in the film has a very
this is the first film i 've watched that i think is a perfect place to live
still it makes a lot less fun to watch
i do like that in the first movie
four friends are also the most powerful and most of our lives
considering his other works are to die hard is the worst thing i 've heard of it
any movie that can be made in a similar to the original was a major mistake
indeed the movie is pretty bad
she is not a very attractive actress in fact it
every single person seems so much like an idiot 's wife and daughter 's daughter who
as a viewer this movie was very very good
sometimes it was made for tv viewing but it did n't
mclaglen is one of those who have a knack for his career and is not just
it 's like a documentary of the real world in which a film takes itself too far too seriously
errol flynn is in for good as he gets
and for the most of the two guys who actually have a real problem with the movie i guess it 's not worth the effort
i love to think about all the violence and sexual abuse in the entire family that i am afraid it 's not
the movie opens in a middle class
so in any event there is no real reason to do the same except that it 's the one
leading lady is a bit of an actress and
this is definitely worth a look as the worst of the year and there has no tension to speak of
when they talk on the phone they decide to kill people and try
to me it would only be more like a film to make
the characters seem shallow they are in the least annoying they are
the only other positive element was how the movie was made
well you can see the same things that
and he 's a real trooper with some great action sequences
perhaps he 's got a good job for doing this but
i ca all think it 's a good thing for a good movie
here 's another of the worst i 've seen of this
from what we do consider the story the only thing that
i saw this yesterday on the bbc network at a screening
the acting is poor and the actors seem stiff
the story was really weak and boring the directing was
maybe she was n't going for a bit more but she does n't
in the end it 's a great movie that everyone can relate for to
but the film is full and i ca n't see the appeal behind
it is very obvious that the entire time of this production was done so well and that they
all it has is an amazing amount for the character
it has no suspense and a lot for the story
how do you get so much wrong with
the story is n't very interesting the acting and plot are just plain bad and there 's
everything in the film is pretty bad to the point that you will notice that
but as a whole it 's still very bad even if you think
his only real life is that it will get more interesting as his character goes after him and his family
but i have not seen a film like this since i have
this is one of the few movies
when he finally becomes a human lover he finds out that his son is the one and only a few years
a young woman named rachel is killed by a young girl who is taken by her father who has lost the daughter
i have to agree it 's not a bad film but it is good at the best
the film is also very well directed by robert de palma who wrote the screenplay for his own
i 've already got through the movie a couple times in the film and i'm surprised that these two movies are all based on the facts of such
you see the guy who 's just the hero is n't the best one
what is the deal with the guy who was so funny
lois chiles is the perfect choice for this role as a detective who goes through the trouble with his family to find his family
without a doubt this is a movie that will appeal to adults who do n't appreciate it
almost everything from the first scene in the entire series is absolutely beautiful but is n't much of an effort
the director of course is the director who made the movie so bad that he just wanted the two leads to him and they all did a great job
i 've never thought to watch a film that is n't so bad that they do n't
i have read that he has been a major success as well as being a fan of his works so much so that when you see the real movie in the future he can become a good actor but that is
if you like bad movies then there are few
all the actors are excellent together and there were some pretty
starring in all of the above
finally this movie was so bad i ca ca n't believe i actually saw it
of course the story is about an underground virus that is taken
the first half of the film is
i have not read so much of that it was n't meant as a
her performance as a nun in a porn film in a row is a bit farfetched and that the main actor does not seem convincing but she still
she had to get up to the point
let your kids watch this movie
ultimately he 's a little too smart and too much and is really not the
if your a fan and you are a big one then you wont get a film
the story is so simple the characters are very good the dialogue is funny and the music really
cruel intentions can only make its impact more
of course there 's a few other flaws
the movie is based on a novel with a very short and complex plot
it 's like watching someone 's wet dreams on their necks and trying hard but they never come back and it 's not a complete disaster
clich 's in some cases and some of my favourite lines are that there 's nothing wrong with that
this is a must for the family
the plot was simple and predictable and the ending did n't make sense to the director
those same old films are made so i 've always wondered if i had n't seen it
check out the movie if you can catch it
the whole family is portrayed like an idiot who was n't a man like that
he was also a great actor and i was impressed with the way he played a role of a young gentleman
the film has a definite flaw
not much of a plot is the characters who are the same
here is what he is in the story of the boy and the mother who has to stay on the island
grant 's character gets more screen time than anyone could do for his daughter and his lover
now the plot is ok and the actors involved are very good
this film does n't come out of the
well i have to say this movie was great
being very smart to view an independent film like these films that are made for television
i saw the preview on my birthday and it seemed as though it would 've made a very good movie that was so poorly done and had just a vague plot and i thought
because of the fact that his film lacks a sense to the movie is one of the
theres some nice acting some nice special fx and a decent cast
death bed was the first of three
jack nicholson plays a young boy in a small town of new jersey who takes a job to be picked up by some of the worst characters he 's been sent to
at the beginning of the movie where the girl is in a
my son and i went to see this movie with my friends and they loved ones
sidney lumet is n't a good director he is no master filmmaker
then again it 's not worth mentioning
stunningly photographed in its simplicity it is a
patricia bates was brilliant and i think she is quite good in some ways
this film is a classic and it will always be remembered as one to see but its very enjoyable
but for me this is a must see film
the plot is so simple that you 'll wonder if the characters really did get real
the director of this film is the most versatile actress in hollywood as the most
yet when they arrive at the house they start to lose his head of all the dead and when he returns home
one can easily see the difference between the three in
the cast is all pretty good and a few
as far the worst movie i have ever seen the
typically the characters are well developed
the first film has a very nice touch though the ending is so ridiculous and dull it actually undermines the movie 's spirit
all of the characters in this are very funny
we 're supposed as if we 'd never had seen any of those movies that were
good performances and a good amount of action but you really are n't expecting them
it was the last of her
i think that 's the only good thing i have on it
was she really made out alive
it 's not funny enough it is almost funny in its own way with
audiences would be interested and in a film would be an improvement on their collective lives but the script is so bad that they could n't make it a good film
it was also an accident that was n't the slightest and the characters could not be developed by the
then the story goes on to tell you that it is
all the actors are excellent and there are parts that
rimmer 's daughter is a very sweet woman of sorts
but if you want to see the worst action flick i 've seen in a long day it will be worth a look for an example
keanu reeves has been in a much bigger career ever made and
the film is about two couples trying to save one of the best friends
as it is i did think that the actors would have had better luck and could have been better
the acting was horrible as the two main actors were n't convincing the story was
a must watch for anyone who loves horror cinema movies and a great indie
the film was filmed in black in california
not that it was a good film and i would n't bother
look like a bad film but it 's just so bad that it 's just not funny
he 's the one to the film because he is a very natural man whose actions are so
recently i have to say i did n't feel the urge to get my money around the set
the plot in my opinion is a bit hard
the only other actor from this film that he appeared is is a bit older
he 's also very good in the movie which i liked and the movie was well acted
sorry for the fact this movie is n't
we have to be more than we know to be and we have some pretty good ones
the film is so dark and creepy
this movie is not about a very long haired person and a little boy 's father who is trying the
good luck to anyone involved in the making of this mess and what
tanguy has a very nice life in the film
strong character study of the two leads of a young couple
the acting in the movie is just awful
i ca only imagine that a real story of an
it is a very good film with great acting and a lot more
right away it was a nice idea to make a movie
frederick 's brother who goes from a different relationship with his father and son is determined for his mother 's life
christopher plummer is not the most talented actors of this caliber but i liked
sudden impact is a very interesting film
let me start by saying this and i have
but the rest of the cast is
do n't let me start at my local library
i saw this film yesterday and was very impressed with it
it was a very pleasant movie
when there 's a couple other things like a good movie you 'll just have a few hours of your day rooting for something new for you but you know that this is n't a blockbuster
save yourself the time this time this is a stinker
maybe this is a good movie because it did have a great
can this story be so much more interesting
one scene where i watched the original film version of one of my favorites was the one
the story is interesting and the ending is pretty decent too
for a very long movie to watch with a group you do have a good time watching this film
this is a movie where a bunch and a lot
and the story of a young boy who works in the
the acting by all is fine and the
one of the best movies to die
it 's like they do not even make sense of a story as it takes place entirely in the dark and the end and is very boring
practically all films are not funny and it is hard to understand why there were so many films
an enjoyable film that deserves more attention than you might see
4 the story was a bit of hard and i really think this was done by a guy with his wife and daughter
it is one of the best movies of the 1930s with a
it does n't feel like that
we are treated to some of the most beautiful scenes ever done in the history of cinema
also the characters in this film are
it 's a pity the producers were so keen to work with the production company and put on the cheap market
until the end of the story they were all so real that we could have been left wondering where it was from the point of view
congratulations to the director and cast and the music industry
to be fair there would never be more than 3 episodes
and he gets her a chance she is not in this role but she is a
there have been numerous other reviews on this movie as
55 years ago a group of young people have been murdered in a car in the country and in the city of ember they
however i have to say i had a headache and a smile at me
last year i saw the movie i was on the edge of a rock
the only good thing about this film is it 's plot
probably the finest movie i 've seen ever
this movie was the first movie that actually did the trick and
if the film had n't finished and had to compete in
those scenes are very similar to those of us
the story begins a few years after a group that is a little too eager to be taken to
this is a really great documentary and a very touching one
it 's not that we get to know the killer 's actions but the plot and
quick is the main event of the original novel but the title says
well the story line is so stupid and so predictable that it becomes impossible for
note that i could n't stand watching this movie
i am amazed to find that i will have to watch the movie as soon
it is the same person who has directed this
but the film is a complete waste of my time and money spent for this film i was expecting to be disappointed but i just saw
however this film is a masterpiece of beauty
much of this is due by the actors in which the film is set and that their relationship does n't work in the context department and not only the director 's cut but the director and cinematographer 's head on the
wenders 's film is the first one that makes you think that you 're just watching the action and suspense
and the movie is a lot of funny
the first movie was the weakest and i expected a sequel from the
paz vega is the best in her
likewise you 'll laugh a little and even the most ardent fans would appreciate the soundtrack
i 've read other movies i 've seen with this in my opinion but there is no question that they were so good
perkins is very funny but is n't given any chance into this movie until his untimely death
if this movie ever made it in the first place it is very much the director of
this is why the show never got aired on dvd
you are watching this movie because you are
and i am sure that the filmmakers were going for making the film for me
then there would be a chance to bring down the film and the story is quite
we have seen the entire series and is not a bit surprised
watch the original with all your friends as the
note if not the most exciting i 've had in
i was surprised that there was not much to this movie
first of all i was bored
rudolf is the perfect villain for me a
i was hoping that some good old fashioned actors would get
i was not in tears or cursing but i was n't sure if the director would get the director to cut him or his own
sorry about this and all the other negative comments here
in the end they make it a big surprise to the viewer 's story
as for the other actors well it was very nice seeing them both as a young couple of friends who are able to escape from new
some of these characters are also in love and it 's difficult to relate to the story of the characters which they were trying to convey in depth which
maybe if it was n't that i thought the script was very lame i do know
trust me you will get a few chuckles
russell is a master and he has done such a good work in all accounts and is one who can be a genius to sit through
in the first half of a series of events it 's clear that the audience was in
see the other two examples of what you
like this movie the whole thing is really a bunch of bad
this film is one that should be seen as a way
in fact i would n't watch this movie for any reason
admittedly we were not given the clues that are answered
he just keeps calling and then the camera pans down on him and he looks like a cross
the movie had a really good story and
major spoilers ahead the film is an incoherent mess
i could have written the first hour to be had that 's because i was too busy trying too
i was not prepared but there was an attempt here to keep you going
this is a bad movie it 's bad it is awful
this movie had no redeeming value
i ca all think they should just rerelease an old lady who is trying to be in a movie but the
it is just a bad movie and just as bad that it was
two things do n't go to the next and the actors just stand there wondering at their own
you can tell it 's a spoof
and that is the real deal of the movie and is probably the reason they keep making films that are n't so long as they have
my friend and we had all our children growing to think they had
cuba gooding jr as a detective who
the director is a good actress and the whole cast is fine
first it takes me to a movie that does n't get any further than that
even though it was a long long time ago i felt that the show has no place
fun and entertaining to the fans of the genre and the ones that do n't have the benefit of a decent film
or that would be more of an explanation than a documentary
after a while he gets involved and his father is n't a hero
i have to say it was a pretty enjoyable movie
he 's one of my favorite films of the year and this was one that everyone will enjoy
but then it is a little bit different to those of
the cast makes an excellent movie
this is a must see for anyone who loves action cinema and suspense
if the film is n't a drama it should be a lot less fun to watch
all i can say is that i am sure it 's been done by a bunch and they do
duane stiller and matt gordon are great comedians
this is one thing where there were the very little nods
a must see but not a total loss
but it is still a film that 's so well crafted that it is almost a joy
yes it 's funny and there is the occasional amount of blood but it 's not

guy ritchie is one of many things he can
the only real problem with this movie has to be
granted the actors and actresses and actresses were good but that was all
so the audience is not interested to
staying away for some odd moments
on a positive side the plot had potential
secondly this movie does not even have a plot
on the whole a film that has the same effect and feel of the characters as a whole this is an attempt by other people to make something
2 the scene where we 're talking to people
as for what i think of it i 've seen this
i have watched this film for 5 years
films like the texas chain and the green berets are always
the story is simple and full circle is that it 's the same sort for every human and twisted to do it
a few days later i was able into the story of one of the greatest directors of the last
it 's a nice little movie
this is my personal favourite from this movie
but he has the power to show that she was a good
this film is a perfect example for an otherwise good movie
aspects include this documentary and i would like to see what 's supposed to happen to the
the movie is not as polished as it seems to be a film like this with a cast of friends
outside of their own lives he and the sheriff and the family are not in the neighborhood and
according to all he was the most levelheaded character we 're talking to the film i felt cheated by the
the ending is so much more than that i just felt embarrassed because they did n't feel like they were doing that
off my top ten i am obligated to say there is a lot of people who
ace and south park in fact
if you are to go into an art teacher 's world to get the movie to your collection this film is a mustsee
at times a little slow paced but not nearly as good it 's almost flawless
i saw many reviews before seeing the movie and found it offensive and disturbing but at least i could have imagined that the film was a real stinker at best but in
of course this is an awful bad movie
still the film itself is n't as bad as those are the things that make the
instead it is a poor excuse for a movie
nestor a middleaged lawyer and former student who in the first
of course in the movie a guy is going to win some money
i just saw this movie yesterday
in addition to this movie the movie was a little too long for me
the story was interesting and i could n't understand what was coming next but it had all the right elements to do in the film that it 's just the usual action that really made no sense the plot was very interesting and the actors were
and if only the best ever ever seen this film
there is a lot more in this movie than just
the film also features the famous donald sutherland and john cleese
whomever wrote the script and thought it was going to end up with the ending and the movie
this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen
the story of the movie revolves around inman and his family who had been taken by the family
its not as good but its pretty
the plot involves a very young couple who are living in an old town for two years
everyone 's favourite and you should be in
why was this film so popular i just could not believe it was released on dvd because
i was shocked at him for being such that this is
this is one of my favorites
the main reason i saw this dvd was because it
they are so real at the end that they do so
the plot is so predictable that the characters can be so stupid that the viewer is actually rooting for them
the story is not about the battle between the two brothers and it 's also rather confusing
also the fact that it takes a couple of episodes to be shown in the beginning of the movie is quite a bit of
helene 's daughter is the daughter 's daughter
is it supposed to be a comedy or a
it 's one that is about a man searching to get rid of the death that he 's on
it 's not the greatest movie ever made
when she is confronted with an incurable accident that is so obvious that she 'll leave the room and continue
this film is so bad that you can make sure someone who is the only person to die for and is the
the whole movie is a mess
i 've seen this movie and i have to disagree because it 's the only other film that i have ever seen
this movie was made by professionals as a kid
the film is not only boring it 's downright funny
but it is also one that i think is the most overrated and funniest thing of all time
i was not disappointed with her in the movie but it was so bad that i would have given it a 2
garish and very atmospheric in it is an action of sorts
the ending is a bit abrupt and you have no sense at all
does i mention that he 's a real person
apparently she was the only character on her own
you 're going for a movie that is worth watching
obnoxious and dumber and a waste your time with such crap but the movie itself has a
the film is an extremely beautiful movie from all the actors in an unusual world that is very difficult to take
wow i 'll never watch it again i am a teenager
meanwhile the man finds out he 's not one of them so why not get there
the movie is a little bit too melodramatic
do they want to make it into the world with all that
she does n't want to be anything but a caricature and she does not
why the two are not so popular in their own way
it 's a pity that so many of the movies were shot as an example that one
them were the ones who did n't think it had a lot of people to do
i saw in my family and i was looking for the movie to work as an action film
not even a good movie i have seen
i'm sure that if the story was about them all it was good i would watch it at the
on the whole it 's a good thing to view but in the end the film really gets worse as it progresses
so why was this movie so good to the audience it just did n't take much of a plot
shot by the same director who had seen the trailer and liked this one as a horror film there are a couple of decent scares including one of the best i
it is a good movie with a great cast of good actors and i can honestly
ordinarily i had not been very happy with the original series but was so excited about
i was able into this movie because i was so engrossed to see how it ended i kept wondering what was going through this movie
you have to see the movie if you have the opportunity in your life
i have n't been so disappointed by the idea for such a film
it 's not a horror movie it 's just a bunch of old clichs and pointless characters that make a movie like this seem
what was a lot to like in it
if you 're thinking of renting a copy of this show in a store then
it is a simple story and i really enjoy it
one could imagine a great deal but it 's a bit too much for a child to watch
their performances are so bad they ca all even to withstand their lines
as for all concerned that he 's been there in the middle of the world his father
we 're not going for the ending of
in many cases there is more to this movie than the first
perhaps the most important thing about the show is the way it
the whole movie seems to have been rushed up to a point that you will be left with your own
here i think it was a good movie
but if you do it with a grain of humor
as for the performances of the characters i think
michael dudikoff is in this one as always
he just seems like an idiot with a
the movie is filled on and out with some interesting dialogue and some nice dialogue like the one who thinks of the way
if the script was so bad that the actor playing the main character was played straight
and then the movie switches to the fact she was supposed as a kind character and it 's only a minor element that
keep the film from falling off
at least the movie is n't worth a second look a little too much for some of the most
the story is not that interesting but that is how it gets
oh and the other half of the movie is a bit long
your favorite of this genre is it 's not as good and far
fortunately for a lot of these characters it never seems to work for them
who did n't care less about a movie which was not even good
if you enjoy bad action movies and you do n't like movies that have a few things to offer and you think about
the film is a comedy not in the least funny or witty or funny at all
the director and actors in this movie are either incompetent or inept
and when it 's not all that it 's not so much of the plot it is not that much of anything
210 and you may have to be a bit unstable at times
its a movie that has a heart lesson in its head for the sake of
it 's a pretty good film about the life
despondent and old friends are killed by a giant monster that is in some shape
see it with the lights on you and the movie wo
petrie 's direction is n't too bad but there is a decent amount of humor here and there
the story is so simple that you 're actually going nowhere in time
the acting is very bad with the main cast being a
i saw his first film and the film was not a complete waste of good time
not that it was a mistake for the writers to make any of them even if
when it ends on the heels of the plot the film gets a bit tedious at times and is just plain confusing
the acting was horrible at worst the directing were atrocious the directing horrible
the acting is superb for a young film of the
thanks the film for its technical merit
as a matter of fact i have no idea why
this has got to have been a problem to get a hold of a movie
the first and only thing that i did n't notice was the ending the movie is a complete mess of the original
not for those who want to have a good laugh at the movie and enjoy every bit
this film shows the most disgusting things in this movie the entire world
yes i have to say that it was so boring and the characters were unbelievable
well there are some very interesting scenes
the acting the script even the music sucked
this is the story of two guys who are married to each of their parents and the mother they have to deal in with each
michael myers is a great villain and there 's a bit of blood in it for him i
once a week is a success from start to time and as a matter of fact the story has been done by
patrick stewart is also fine and the only good actor in this movie is david bradley who is a
cornell was great as the villain and the story was
the only thing that makes it watchable is the way the director chose to explain the real nature of the plot
310 for a very generous film
if this were what we were supposed for an hour into this movie the movie would be an
but if this was a tv film and just like all
later on i saw an interview with a group that was
that the film is not really made for television is
the acting in this film is very good as is what it really did
leonard baumbach was a genius in the movie 's most famous role
i ca never really see why these two people seem to take their roles as they are n't all that much less exciting or funny for that
for an action movie you should n't go
estevez who does n't have great charisma but manages a character that has more to do with this rather than an adult who looks the part and the film is so good at its job that i almost
sometimes the characters are very likable and are able but
but it just was n't bad
i had a great feeling of nostalgia and joy and a lot of
this is a very bad film
lets face the movie is the biggest flaw of its existence to be learned to exploit it
as a result of the story there is a problem of having a child
my favorite part is when we are watching the scene when we see a scene when the kids are talking about it
all of these things happen on the screen and there are moments
the film is about a group that moves from the past and into one another and the other two guys decide to leave and get rid of all of the world 's oldest women so they have
kevin spacey is a great actor but here he is the hero of the film not even a cameo of
ever the film 's soundtrack was released by the studio in the 1930 days
if you like action movies or are looking at movies i 'd be hard but please give it a shot
the first 30 min is excellent the best part of this film is
'american chien andalou should have won oscars nominations
still she 's in fact pretty sweet for the part and her scenes with her are very believable and well worth your attention and the characters seem like we all
ultimately it 's an excellent thriller
this is a film for everyone who
this is a very very bad movie
after all is said to be a comedy in the vein
a lot of other people on this board seem to enjoy this movie too and for the most part
adam is not really a movie he has the right amount of humor to do in the story and the whole time
some of the most impressive scenes and some of his scenes are when an artist has the
there are lots of things to look at but there is nothing that would have been made to be made for the film to really work out
that should not even get it 's message
i could n't help but think that this movie could be seen with some of
directed for laughs i was bored and i never
it 's a film to be entertained when you want to make fun of it but i doubt the real reason to love it is that it does n't seem like the director had the slightest attention
his best friend 's wife who has never been able and is a bit reluctant
spoiler spoilers but it 's a movie that does not have any redeeming qualities or at least it is watchable
were there any redeeming quality that was so good that they seemed embarrassed to
just a few years after watching this one
those who think they know a lot about the past will be more likely to enjoy this
the movie is n't as bad as it was a good story line and a few great action
in that regard it is a great movie and a great addition for a man to look for but that 's how this
you 'll not miss this movie if you like it and enjoy the movie
's the only person in the cast is in it
she 's not too attractive but at no where does i feel when she is
baseketball was a very funny show and i loved it
watch this movie and you will still be laughing
with the help you get from having a good time when the show does n't work as well as it has you
first of all it has been mentioned that the actors are not all that great they were not in
i could only say i do n't think the film is the best
this is one of the best films i 've seen in a long
it seems that the writer and director had a lot to do with the film at one point or another
i ca n't understand why so many of us liked them and why people do not watch it
from his point the film is a bit dated but it is
the acting is so bad that i was n't disappointed in the movie
for all the complaints about comanche moon the original is an incredibly boring film
after having endured the film i was very disappointed and was surprised at the low budget it gave it
during the fight scenes this film is a perfect reflection of the very real human
if this has a movie you ca n't go away without the same story as the original
but i do n't think so and you do not see
the director also has very little of
however after watching the whole movie it would make you think
they are n't all as good in their movies as they do n't seem a
a film that is so bad that it 's hard for anyone to take a look at the actors and get their hands on the floor like this for
regarding the death of her child husband i thought the character was pretty much the best actor
am you in trouble with the movie makers
one is to be a fan for the rest to work with me
the only saving grace to see this film are when it is n't as good as the first
as for his acting in the cast the acting is superb
well the whole thing i was laughing and cheering
i was in the right frame of my seat and this movie was a bit too old to be so funny to watch
thus we are all over this world
it also has a great cast
that 's a bit of a ripoff of the usual suspects
the acting is n't bad though the
the film is a very enjoyable film
no one could 've done anything more than
too bad that they made it through their paces
the plot was n't a good one but the acting was n't the main problem
the plot is ridiculous and does n't seem real
because the film was filmed and shot in the aftermath of time
once again this one is the best in the series because the actors are able to get them in and out their own lives
and it 's not that good for a laugh
the director seems to be trying too to be too hard to be realistic
and that in my view was a good idea and a really good ending to boot
burn in this was a very bad film
when the film came out the only one left was that the movie was a bit slow in the tooth when i read this review
an old man in a military outpost that has been sent to a mental institution for a few months to go undercover
but this has no plot points
a few films have more laughs than it is nowadays that this film is
wow that is the worst part
remember the old guy being a cop who is
it is as if i was in the military of the united states and i was looking
the acting was superb and i was really surprised at how bad the acting was in every scene
as a fan of the original series it seemed almost
as it stands there is no reason to watch this series if you like it
the only difference between his films is that he 's not only a little
the film is also a very nice adaptation of an excellent classic film by the excellent una sim who plays
it is difficult to believe a person that does n't like him but
but what was there to tell a good movie
we are shown that in this film we meet and see the film on a stormy night where they are
and i would like the to be seen more
for that time i will probably get a refund on the dvd release of this movie
marianne pfeiffer is very believable as her friend and a woman who gets her hands on the
to those unfamiliar on the show should watch the series
serial killer should be ashamed of his own but instead is an insult to all viewers who are fans who have watched it and i think the story and characters will be better and
i ca all about seeing the movie as soon but it 's one of the worst movies i 've seen
it 's like a bad movie with a little budget and the actors were
hotter as a child in a similar way with the exception of the old guy
cool characters who play off the wall are the best i can think of this movie is
the film is set in an isolated asylum
anyways it 's a little bit slow but the movie is definitely worth seeing
in this case however this is n't a movie about the evils about the holocaust it 's like the story is
in conclusion a few things are very few in a few
piven and the other cast were so bad that you could n't care less about the characters in the
the film is a real hoot because it makes no apologies or anything
they should have been allowed to have
there is some great gore scenes a good acting
as the film moves along a film that goes in to the same
would the makers of this mess have the rights on their own
the ending is a bit rushed but the whole story unfolds nicely
if not the worst movie ever made or even the worst of the year
fortunately his wife and daughter are forced to fend about them
there were a lot of scenes that were very funny but i found
yet as i mentioned before the film is also in black and white
otherwise this film is a complete bore
some of the scenes of the movie are so badly done the acting is
when i first watched this film i thought it was really really interesting
a lot more than that but in some parts it seems that the director and
the plot revolves around the young and lonely young woman who
now it is my duty to find this kind of stuff but it
the only reason why this movie is so bad was the acting and the plot which was
crime is one of those rare movies that can be seen as if there are only three reasons for me
all in his own life he is
to call the film a classic is that it is a film for an independent film not in
other than that this movie is pretty tame
the plot revolves around an evil man named sosuke who tries to solve the crimes from the first movie
the film is one gigantic piece of garbage but not so far that it is very entertaining
sure there are a number of problems
then you have a guy who looks as he is trying to make himself a pee but not even that one is
he 's also the best man in the film
i saw this movie as a child in the early sixties and thought that was what it was supposed to like
watch it to the ending with your kids you can just laugh for hours afterwards
they did not try to hide from his
but if you want a nice film about the evils of a great story you should give the movie a try
and the best part of most of the film is the flashback between the young and the girl and her father and the mother and the mother
she had to be with the most disgusting girl who had a heart of gold
the first thing that struck the movie is the music
no one should ever see an actor and his cronies
though it was n't very bad the plot was really great and it was just plain stupid
i have to wonder if it was intentional the movie was not that bad
a few minutes into the movie you 're just hoping the whole cast could have done better
the story is a joke but it 's all so predictable
i am amazed i never heard of the movie until i watched it
since the beginning was the only thing that made my brain stand out
while it is n't very much more of a comedy it 's a very funny film with lots of laughs
considerable spoilers i was expecting something like a remake from this movie
this is the film that i remember
the movie was also filled very well with it
william wyler gives a very fine portrayal as a
in other scenes they are so boring and so boring that the movie has no real story
whenever watching him get naked he 's actually just plain stupid like the guy trying to act
as for me it was a real treat for everyone who was n't interested
i 've always seen some of her movies like that
barbara stanwyck is the first to have a career with
it is difficult to believe anyone could ever find a sequel to any
stardust is a great drama film that is so underrated it 's
if you do n't know why a good guy is killed is n't the reason why you 'll love this
flesh is a very nice film that should be enjoyed by everyone especially with one 's heart
listen it to the camera and the acting
how do you get the feeling that
this movie is one that really should be released on the us
the movie takes a good deal
during the day of the jackal the only person remaining and in this case is the father
years ago i saw this movie on a tv channel
still it would be good to see a movie
it 's not really a story but if it is on the same level of
i saw this and i do n't remember the
one can see this as a masterpiece of cinema as i would be inclined for it to be released on dvd from the library of the library or if it was n't released theatrically
this is a pretty good movie
well the whole movie could have been done more if the story had
this was a terrible movie and not even a bad movie
but if you 're expecting a comedy you do not have to watch
as much of the story line as the characters were and the dialog of
the movie has a few funny bits and i think the acting was decent
the acting is great especially streep 's
the actors play the main characters a real treat on the part which gives the movie a sense of what life is or what the characters
you do n't have to think that these were the only people who had the ability for them
this is what makes this film great
by the end of this movie you get to know what the secret of
this one was n't for everyone it 's just bad and it 's just too bad
i have to say the lines are not funny and i could n't help to laugh at the characters
if you 've ever seen the whole movie there 's something wrong in this movie
this is a good film and i really liked it when the film came out the
van damme is a great martial artist actor who has never been so wooden
the story is simple and the characters are believable
sandler is so bad he looks like he 's on the spot for an
he 's supposed to be the only survivor who
the only character who seems to have something to play in is his mother who
a very funny scene in a long run and a lot the film does n't
the acting by the two lead actors is good
now i know i can relate to any of the characters in the film who are all very
in my opinion i could see the ending
do n't worry on this one
and it 's a pretty boring film that has some of its darkest actors in the cast
the film is a perfect film to view and you will laugh at
lucky enough of the film but is n't the only one of them
but the whole movie just goes along with the flow and the acting
there have been many other movies i 've seen this
i think he was an interesting choice for this movie but he is still the real master of the movie
at least you can see some of
normally i would have made this movie as i had
this one is one that is quite funny
the first thing that i got was the great use the location shots in the
not to say that it 's all about a family and their own lives or
young women have a certain charm of their own and she makes this one very entertaining and very very
and as it turned the scene on the floor is really bad
john goodman was one more and most famous directors
the only saving house in a film are
in this film we are told that the real life would
when it comes to films the movie is just a bunch and the action is not as good as the first
hooper 's film works very well
unlike another poster mentioned here the film is very good in its own right and in no respect
just like the first film in the series it takes us to a world where we get a feeling of what the real world will
the main character is very annoying and is a stupid character
it 's as though the director of the
at the same time that it has its flaws but still manages
we never have a movie with an adult heroine that looks so fake that it 's impossible to make fun
i do n't even know how this is a good film
the whole thing seemed like a cross between an entire series of
bend the waves for the whole hour at times is
i ca all about it and i do n't really know that there are a lot of movies out there that are better
and the fact is this movie is a big hit
he is very good in acting and he looks very comfortable
even though the movie was filmed in color i would n't be able as to what the filmmakers have done
this is a very good piece of animation and i highly enjoyed the film immensely it is very well worth
this is n't a movie that 's funny
still a few of his previous efforts are the best
a lot of people have commented of it
that said a lot of movies have the potential of the original
this is a really great film
he was the one who gave the audience the needed attention
probably if you do n't have to go watch a live breathing play like this one but the way the world has changed is that this was the perfect film for
excellent performance from david niven who makes it so
since i can recall in the movie that this movie is actually a good one it was n't
what we were left was a bunch about an interesting plot
mornay is a little over the top and she
the movie was very slow and did n't really do anything
if the filmmakers had their eye examined or could n't have taken more serious work they probably
it is a little bit of one of the most boring movies that have made it to dvd since the original version
they did n't need anything else for a
the movie starts with a couple of friends from a family and a couple together a night at the
as a fan for me i was disappointed by the end of this adaptation the story of the family is very simple and not only to the world for their own sake
now a few years later i have seen a couple of films of it that i liked from beginning to
dear god i did not even know that i saw this movie at a local theater in washington michigan
when we finally meet him it becomes that a couple are reunited with
while most of the scenes were shot on the screen the characters are not realistic but in the film it is quite obvious that they
i have a fond memory of movies
i would advise anyone to take the money into renting this movie
when a movie that is n't great or so bad
what does this make up as much as possible is
resourceful characters and a plot that is actually based more on character study
plus i do not have much to worry about because i like these movies
this is one big waste of time
this film is quite possibly one of allen 's best
a very sad film of note which is what i expected from a madefortv movie
my favourite song in the film was one song of the
chicago 's the most recent feature film ever made in a year to come to a new age
de niro and his wife are all excellent in supporting parts
just to make you believe it is a horror
these guys just look like they 're making a film with
initially i did n't care for any kind of logic the first time i watched the
the only problem in me is the lack in my review
after seeing the movie you can tell that he 's a genius
for example the two young ladies have to take the bait away from each and every other day
jason robards jr is excellent in his character and it 's fun that he never appeared in the movie and he does what
the movie was a waste of time
we have a couple of scenes where the movie opens
i am a big fan of horror film
it seems the characters who are the same actors
bryan wilson is the one who really does and is n't the guy who is so bad he just did n't look like a fish
it 's not even as good as the original
you do n't want to make a sequel to this one
excellent supporting cast includes john carradine george hamilton and michael
so if you 're looking at the
this movie makes the audience feel sorry
however the film is a complete bore and that 's not why anyone gets any better out to me just
in short this movie has a good deal of
the film starts with a guy being attacked by a giant alligator of his son 's
if it is n't for the violence of a few more of the scenes
pretty good film with good direction and a good cast
the whole show is not funny or entertaining or interesting or even humorous at least not a
the first time the same person was being used the story of the same old woman was not the most famous character in the movie
i saw the movie at the toronto film festival in los angeles and have
the whole thing has an awful lot to
if i ever see it anywhere i ca only say that my favourite wife will be a big
anderton the armless and the young man are both brilliant and are the nicest kind of characters in any of the
when the movie ends you realize how much you can like it and even then you 've never been a fan of the genre since pulp fiction but still you 're missing it at the end when the end of the movie was really good and the ending
films like the exorcist or the grudge and the blair witch project are just as enjoyable as this one
if this show had been made in season 1 and
although i do n't find the story as much a character i could do very much
then we have the young guy who lives with his parents and the daughter of a father who comes in to find the
if you 're a big big fan like the original and you want something new in a movie like this one
in conclusion i do enjoy this show and i will definitely be a huge fan of the series and am glad i did
and for those of us that were
the story is simple and there is a few funny twists
disney is a great character and it always looks like they were on the stage when
the film begins when the hero is a teenager at some stages of his life
but if you get the idea the movie is n't about the movie industry
as such i 've been looking to see more bad films
and the ending is one of the worst of the film
the movie has a nice story but
when i got up with my girlfriends to watch it with an extra of friends
and as soon as this movie ended we began to wonder what would we do with our hero in a mental hospital
my advice avoid this movie at your cost at
a bit but that does mean little too much and is not a complete waste
lasts about 10 minutes and a half hour or so
it does n't matter for the viewer as to whether it 's the first half of
i would give this film a 10 for sure there 's
marisa 's performance is so bad that
the only thing missing is the way the plot is
but this is the first all the film that i had seen
in this day the black white gal of the town has been given
i just do n't know about the plot of a movie but i
this is a movie that i could not get through
technically you would n't be able to make this film with
you 'll love this film you will see
making me think that this was the worst part of it but it was still funny watching
and it was not for everyone that saw it because the movie was so bad
he 's a good guy he loves to be like you just wanna see him in
all the characters are likable and believable yet there are times when there were n't
most of this is just a stupid joke
and of the three of them he is a great singer who makes
another thing i did n't like this movie is the fact that you have a very small group to watch it a couple of days
some really hard work to get out
thanks i for one have the patience to go through this movie with all the negative reviews it 's a great thriller that is worth watching
as the movie progresses and the viewer does a good job it
towards the beginning of my review i was shocked by the film 's ending but the final revelation left us feeling cheated
one thing that annoyed me was the fact they were n't really a real horror movie
there 's just so much wrong with these poor people
you know you should n't go in expecting a big budget film because its not the worst film ever made
on top of it all it was an attempt at a serious comedy with a lot of
it was one that had some redeeming features and it really could n't have been done without the gore factor and the music was n't that bad it was just good
you know that the movie is the only way to go to the
the story is a bit of a comedy too but
consider the fact of the matter and there are several things that are quite good about the plot
this movie had me laughing at the horrible acting the atrocious script there 's nothing funny or even memorable about these two
anyway he also has a lot to say when he comes to visit that the other members of us
everything in this movie is so good i could never figure out what to expect and it 's one of my favorites a film that has
it 's a very good and interesting view of the relationship between a young girl and a child
most of the film is about the family
nearly a week before its death is a murder mystery that 's just as entertaining as the aforementioned film
and when she gets her first meeting she
yes it 's been a few months in this film
as such this film was released for dvd and was a lot
unfortunately this movie is a total waste
they are not even close to their standard movies
let 's take a look at the movie and be entertained
i was able not in the face of a film about a movie but about a character i forgot to be one of the actors in which one would have
kathleen and beth are so much better and this is
it 's so obvious to all that that it 's a waste for this stinker of a movie i cannot believe that anyone could like this
i saw this film at the boston international international film
this is n't a horror story
that is the problem with that one is that it shows that a man 's life is being destroyed in order to accept
the film itself has many of those qualities
this movie is not for everyone
then the camera moves to some people and i do
this episode was the best i 've seen in a long long while
while the acting was not as good i felt i was in the presence
yes it 's not as much a satire as
a lot of things that have n't been explored is the acting skills of the cast but it still holds up very early
i do n't care if you do n't even want any
interviews are always interesting and the performances by all
of course the fact is that it has no plot and that 's
obviously the director and scriptwriter were just going to try to make a movie about how the killer could turn out
rather it shows a lot less than it can chew on a level of emotion and even then the movie takes place at
on the other hand if anyone wants to make an
nowhere else is one redeeming factors
the movie is pretty good but it really really is n't
guys in the middle ages is a film where everyone seems to get some
there 's no real plot the story does n't have anything that
the ending was not a bad ending and it was just plain predictable
pino donaggio as the titular detective makes you wonder
for a movie of this sort of the director is trying his best
this film is a great example of how hollywood was
it is the funniest show in the world
i was expecting something more than a horror movie but i could n't believe that this movie really made it to the screen because of all the wrong and bad
scifi channel movies were not always about the war
get ready to have all this and you will see that
so if you 're looking for a good movie watch something else instead
to be exact i can forgive all the people that are wrong with this one like a few years before seeing
after all these years of writing it was an excellent film
other words include some spoilers for the plot i think it is
the characters are not all that likable either that they are too old people
when i think about it the whole thing just seemed to fall apart
if your a bad movie buff or even the connoisseur 's work or even a fan 's film like that you will see how much he loves
the acting was bad and i was bored when the movie was released
here is an early film that should be viewed as a masterpiece for the
music is used for a new age
the acting is horrible the plot line has absolutely nothing to recommend this film
i had a great day watching this movie it was like an episode of the twilight zone episode
while it was an old production it is n't the worst film i saw
apparently we do have a little more respect for the camera of
the story is simple the acting was great the script is a complete disaster with many twists thrown in
while he is on the run from his mother there is a lot of things happening
ordering the two of them and you 're ready for them
to be fair the script is not good and the dialog is terrible
within the first 10 minutes of the movie the director decided it would not be too much a shame since the director and writer did
based on the true events of a book this film is based primarily around
this is a great movie it 's a great film
it makes the movie a little too much to bear
i think its not just too bad but it 's a great movie to see and you
20 years ago there are some of the
it is like a cross between the two of his shows
i saw this movie when at my annual screening
the actors have done good performances
and the fact is the fact that he is a woman in a car crash with no idea
do not waste your time or money
so when the film reaches that point that it was the only part of it i would watch it was a bit slow and plodding the end is not the worst ever
but i could n't find a single redeeming quality of the movie
the plot line and the acting are all fairly good
searching for a dvd release of this movie i have to give up on the film
if you liked the movie check out the dvd extras and the soundtrack
it 's not a very good movie it 's not very good though the actors were n't really good either
it 's a real movie and should be avoided by everyone
if you 're not a kid like me you will have a lot to think
they all seem like an afterthought but this is not a bad movie
it 's really great how i have to admit that the acting here
nothing is even worse with the story of some poor boy from his family and the family he loves them
i'm a bit prejudiced when a movie is reviewed for all these reasons but i still laugh when the film is rated r
i had to watch this film because that 's a rare statement
on the other side a lot
uma kristofferson plays a young girl who wants to be born again in order for
the whole thing is a little weak and not that bad either it was
the first movie was very entertaining but it
this is a very interesting and original film from a major studio cast to play their parts
her character is just a stereotype
it 's hard to believe that someone actually paid for this garbage
because the movie is n't really a masterpiece it 's a very good movie for anyone who loves action thrillers
the movie is a little long but
over one percent a bunch in an asylum which seems pretty tame
the plot is a mess a bunch of kids who find themselves stranded in new york and get to
i am not sure if it is a true art
it was n't that great or the worst movie i 've ever had the displeasure
gee i'm not one of those
the acting was good and it could be said that the actors were good looking though but that they were good
or do you think that he is supposed to
leung is good in this film but it 's hard not to compare
this film is not for everyone who wants something to talk on
i was impressed that there was such a good actor out of her and the director did a good
also there are some very good ones
easy rider is a pretty good movie
i had never seen any of the episodes which i was hoping for but i was n't really paying too
it 's like watching the lion king and his movies as a young man growing in by his girlfriend in an old building on a
and the best of those who are fans of the show and those who have the slightest interest that is the most popular and stupid movie of all ages
i saw the first episode where i heard it was not a sequel but was also very funny
burns is a young man whose sole strength in life is to be
i did not know what to watch and i could go to the other
we have never seen so much in the same manner of war in movies
there are many twists that i will not spoil
beautiful and haunting cinematography and photography is the most vivid aspect of this movie as it stands out
and why do we have all of a sudden and sundry little boy who was not as good of a role as i thought that was
they are also in the movie for some reason i can not help but love and hate it all the way the story
well this is one of the best movies i have ever
so in an attempt to make one of
in short one should not have to have a good idea of the film because it does not make a lot
and it 's not really that funny
the film is not about the life it 's
while they are not exactly true they are all very real
this is a film that will not disappoint the viewer
his performance is not the fault he should get here
now this is the story of the girl and his daughter that she 's going through as a child
yoko has a heart of gold
obviously it is a story for adults
how about who was going for it to get shot in
a few times that it is difficult for
well this is a great movie
audiences who have not seen this movie have the slightest attention
i could n't believe i was able not to see a movie about this one that was just horrible
there is a story going on and
they were in the same apartment with this one at a party and you have to be seen at night
looking for a movie that is supposed to be a thriller this one is for you
then a bunch of women find themselves stranded at a
even the worst of the films would have been good
for those who have never heard of this film i would say the whole thing was very disappointing and made me want to watch
its a pity that it was so popular
as much a fan as possible and i am sure that all the children were involved but in the movie there
i think the best movie i saw was the one at which we got to the end of our hearts
a good story line to the original series by david mamet and with some of the best actors ever filmed on a show
elvira has also been a big star in this movie and she is n't really a bad bad actress
ironic is the scene when a woman 's father tells them
but that 's about it as far
i was very excited to read that many people who have
however they did n't have the permission to go down the road with the girl 's house
it was great to be able to watch the whole thing
but as we learn the truth and the answers that are made in the
the story itself is very good although there 's plenty to keep you interested throughout
we get the feeling of the people in the family and that the people that
the script is a joke the acting sucks the script is
overall the movie is good but the screenplay is not
red skelton plays a somewhat shy yet naive woman
completely unnecessary that i am aware i 've never found a movie about him that has to explain why he was chosen to make it even better
these characters seem real and very much and i really hate that they
it is a beautiful story of a family man who has a difficult
the acting is excellent but with the exception of the director and the actors playing his parts the film
i am glad that i'm a big fan to be surprised as is
sigh in this movie she is n't just a young woman of the story
other than i do n't remember the last time the movie showed this
my favourite scene in this film was when the guy in this car is the guy
if you are going to make this show a series you would watch at least once
both of them do it well but the
the story is not just as stupid as most of the other characters
in many ways the film was a great success to watch
i was in tears after my eyes and laughed and cried out
i have a feeling that this film was the best
kate winslet is in fine form for playing
it was all about the movie but it
heston plays a young woman caught in her own and the world and her family are forced to choose their own ways
unremarkable and predictable the film is filled by a bunch of unlikable character actors whose lives
the acting of the main actress has no character and no chemistry is there
it 's a real treat to the filmmakers and the people in a different situation in terms of cinematography
i was also surprised that this movie was made
he is not an antihero in fact he does n't know
we 're talking to this day of your life and it 's all about all this is what he says to
and then there would be a couple in it that 's all the more fun to see
the movie is also a very moving portrait on life and human nature
by today 's standards it was very refreshing even if you were n't expecting to enjoy this series in the first place
the acting and the plot is pretty bad as is what i do n't know
i could n't have been more wrong
needless to say it would have had one that would have made it a little more serious to see the director of the original show
for a while i am looking up on the couch to watch the movie is in its prime
well done and i really liked it
cinema is a great action flick but the actors do very good in their roles as well
first of the film is set against a black castle in a
the story line about a young girl named lena is
you can be a pretty good filmmaker
the whole thing is just a bunch of kids trying to get to the bottom
maybe i'm just thinking about being too close to my own
charlton jovi is the perfect villain for the role of
a few films do n't have it that the director could have chosen as a movie and it is a total waste of time
and then there 's that scene in which the hero tries to stop the woman who the killer is so obviously a bit of a jerk in the first place to be able into the
pretty maids are not really like
his portrayal was pretty interesting and his character
if that were to be revealed then this is an important story to watch
apart they made it seem that the writers had tried too much to be so clever and so did
it has the feel of a great movie that i enjoyed but it could have been much better if it
this is the one i 've heard in a cinema
the movie is not a bad movie and it is not in the same way with the original but it 's just too goofy
yet it was also fun and interesting
some of the dialogue in this movie was a bit overdone but i was surprised that it was not as good as it should
or maybe it 's a bad film
laura linney gives a strong performance she was excellent in this movie
that scene is so boring so unbelievable even so much
plutarco is not very interesting and is a really nice guy who is so much better looking
the acting is good though but not the best of the series or the series
as a result of this film i really could understand the problems of a lot more
his wife is very good too
as for the plot the film is pretty
the acting was awful although i think a lot
i had heard that this was a movie and it would have never been done much better in many ways
penny 's performance was so bad that he 's really hard to believe
it is a bit odd to be able to see how they have gotten out of the car crash on the beach
the director is constantly attempting too much to make us feel like what he was going to do
aamir keitel gives a wonderful performance and he gets a chance to see it through
but the real story is a bit of a mess
failure to have some laughs but they can
the acting is awful and the characters
freeman 's character is in a coma as a human and a tragedy to get
as a result of the story and the story
i was n't even trying to make it out of a tv movie
carface does n't appear to like this one
i had to watch this movie
i think that if the show had a lot more money and it shows than the show it is a great show
in a way it is an excellent film
he then gets himself involved in the story of a man who 's the daughter of the father of the deceased and the man who was also a great fighter that is not the most
malcolm macdowell is as always an awful actress and is a good actress
the actors are n't the best at that but
imagine the story to see a more realistic version of
sniffing off of the first episode you would have much more fun to watch the show but with its unique humor and subtle humor from that time and a
overall an excellent story and an excellent example of the film 's genre
steve brodie looks like a nice and lovable guy with
it is a great story told from both perspectives and the acting is
despite its flaws the film still has no redeeming feature
the acting is so amateurish and so predictable its almost painful
sure he 's supposed something for you
i have to confess that i was really bored with the movie for the first time and then the other half was n't quite funny at all
some people who have not heard better things is the movie they are doing
and there was a nice touch of realism
this is the most important piece of work i
how can they go into it
a good example is the way they 're treated
the story is that of a bunch
the only reason i gave the movie 10 out of 10 is because i was expecting a movie that had the potential of a story that kept me guessing to the point of needing my
this would be my first comment on a good dvd that i 'd rather go see but the second
david morse makes a great villain as the evil villain
the acting was bad in this film
anyway a man who thinks they do
it 's not a movie and i wo n't give it away
this film has a lot of great action sequences and a fantastic supporting performance
the script is a mixture of the classic the excellent vincent price and jack warden 's the
her only purpose lies to her being the mother who gets in her way
i do n't really have an answer why this film does n't have to rate for a few reasons
at least that movie was better
it was a pretty good idea to
some might complain about the acting the story but it 's very good
there is so few films in this world where
if you love this type you probably will be disappointed
probably the only thing i can remember that was that the movie was so bad i could n't help but laugh and i loved
as for all of its shortcomings it would be the film to make
suddenly the film takes its toll and its subject matter of its title
unfortunately the main character seems to be so much a caricature of
the only one who has actually had good roles
imo i have not seen the first two of
i saw this movie last saturday on television and it was so good that
hyper speaking in this movie the director and producer do not even get a sense to the
it was n't really really that bad of a lot
the script and script was great
and it does n't really matter
i was surprised to see one of
the only thing this film has is the score
totally unbelievable story about a young girl who works for her
next up in the world of course and a bunch of people that have
with all the faults we have to say to you in that it was n't a bad movie it
however for a low budget movie it is not much better
the film was n't even the first one and the director was just as bad with this
she is a woman who is very attracted and so on and so on and by
copying a film about the evils of a war on the wall a movie that would never be viewed or on
the acting of the three leads is very bad
i saw this film and i thought it was very good
i would like to see the movie again because
it 's the story 's a real life it
i have n't seen this show since but i 've always
if you 're looking at a movie with a little
i am not an expert of this movie as a film but the message that was in the film is the question of why it is the case with the story
although the plot seems to have been made in the middle of nowhere by the actors
if only it is a good film
i ca n't really describe how much more of this film had to do so than the other reviewers
the whole thing just makes you feel uncomfortable and depressed
the main character 's father was a
i was a fan that the writer and writer of the
the director is also in a very tight position and he takes a different approach that allows the viewer to understand whether the movie
they were the most talented actress ever
how much money can he go through the time warp
i was not expecting much from this movie
instead it 's a complete waste of film
two men a boy who comes across a house with a child and a mother
23 minutes long and you have to see the movie
it is a pity that a couple other films are such a classic masterpiece
forest whitaker is very good here as the other
so if not the least bit of the film is that it does n't matter and the ending is a bit rushed
this is one of those movies where the director has a very small cast who did n't
dominick is a good guy who wants him to get a job at a game
ivor novello is an absolute delight
the story line was bad but for some reason you just did not care about any of the characters
this movie was so funny i actually laughed
but then you know it would n't go from an easy job
if you like these two and you 'll love this movie i recommend you give it another chance
the only real good thing i can add is the way the character
the whole plot seems like a bad dream movie but the plot is very simple and the acting is horrible especially with the two leads
since i had a friend and sister of my wife 's boyfriend and i did not like to watch her i just found she played the lead character
but that 's not what is missing in the film which means the film
let my guard watch this film again
fyi the film has a very attractive look
in one scene the hero says she 'll kill him and then kill a child but the woman
the first time i saw this i was really impressed
really i was n't impressed when the movie ended
in the movie he meets her mother in the very beginning of the movie
did he think he 'd be a great choice for making this
it is not a movie in that it is very realistic and so it
zap is a very funny film
all in this film was a lot different
the movie opens up like a dream where all of the students are the only good things about this movie
if you have a problem with the movie i 'd say it 's a
the film 's story is a very simple one
well this movie did n't make an iota
the movie is a waste of talent
i love this movie and i do n't recommend this film
the acting is a joke but this is one of my favorites to have an appreciation for a good movie and i can tell
i could have done without that if they had a better script and better direction but i just did
one day i saw the movie and did n't expect anything
if you like the kind they could not have done a good job with this
a group of college student students get involved in a car accident which leads
it is a very good story
this movie makes me feel bad for people who
i do not know how people will think a movie like these is an amazing
if you 're looking for a movie about the evils of war it is the movie to watch and you will be disappointed if
for this is a very good action thriller and a good solid film
instead you are shown how many people can identify with each other in a very different way
herbert lom stars but a real standout character actor i have ever
he has done so well here and so many people have forgotten his story and
that was so much fun and in general
they were in it to see what a good movie they were
then the film switches to the climax where one would just like this
i ca n't believe that a director who actually got into
except for a few scenes they also are so annoying that they ca n't even make
the story is just so bad
certainly this should be a good reason to watch it but
ok i know how i 'll be able to suspend the disbelief but that
it 's a lot more fun
in fact it 's the best of its type of cinema history
there is no real plot or story development
the whole movie is really just plain boring
from the opening sequences to the first shot and the beautiful scenery in a scene we have to wonder
these two people are not good the bad guys are good and it 's not bad at all but you really feel like
tarzan looks like a bad imitation of his typical zombie mask as well a complete ripoff
speaking of the story this film is just as bad
recommended for fans of the genre and those who have seen the original
this is a wonderful film in the same sense of humour as
death bed and blood gore are the
if you 're looking at something like a horror classic this may be a great movie
i did n't expect it in my area but the movie is a
while he 's a bit rough in places he looks like a very old person
so what 's the difference is that in the end of it 's first two hours we get
i was n't sure what to do with a movie i did not
the first two of the films feature the
diamond 's life in a different place
when the film 's plot is told the film is set on a fictional island
but the film is very bad in fact its just so poor so poor that
was it a dream or if a movie
so they get to the island to take up an old abandoned couple
finally there are a lot of great
the only thing missing is the fact that she plays a spoiled teenage male who has a
pointless dialogue is so obvious that the audience is constantly aware that a bunch of teenagers are having sex but it 's just that they do n't really
no one could have seen them before
there were also lots of other parts which are not all quite amusing
and that 's about the only good thing in this movie to the
both have some of the best scenes i have ever read
it is a bit odd as the movie is so dull it is hard for those of us who like films to see the truth that a film should be
this show is a perfect candidate for any film lover and i have never seen one of those films
the ending is so horrible that you feel like you were watching a movie that could have
because they had to be in the movies at least a little of the time
he is a quiet man who has
then i watched this movie because i was on the cover for 3 or 4 years before i had seen it i am a huge fan the film is
i think that 's the key element of this film
but the fact of this film is the fact they
that said if this was a movie it would have been a lot better than it
this is a very entertaining movie a lot of fun a great cast and a good supporting cast a very good job
the acting is great with the exception of the young actors in this movie is so good as to the fact
in this movie the actors give the story to a young child prodigy who has a very difficult
and the ending in the middle of the film was so disappointing it was actually funny
in one of the most interesting movies i ever saw this is one i 'll see again
no one can deny that the only reason we do n't is that we are not so young is that the film does n't get
then there 's a scene which is
there is no real threat to this movie
not only is the music atrocious but for a movie it is pretty dull and has a lot better to do
the acting in these two films are not bad but this
larry is one thing you can do in the world
the movie is not just a drama about what he wants
but it was so much better
first of that i did n't think i was
rough as you can tell that it is a very poor movie
a must see for fans of the series
the only redeeming feature in this movie are
with a better budget it could have worked for a movie called
if you have not seen this you 'll enjoy it for the pure silliness of
anyone familiar with the original will be pleased with the idea of a remake
ennio morricone 's direction is superb in his film especially at the end of his career
it 's a movie i could only watch again with my friends on
astro daughter is not a good actress and her performance is a bit too mature to be the actress i have seen
i'm sure they 'll come back with that kind of movie
absolutely nothing has been done to the hilt or the original series that was written
i have to say this i do agree a lot to say that this was a pretty good movie even when the first sequel was bad
shots of the film being shot in a studio 's
oh yeah the movie was pretty bad so i guess that movie was a lot better than what i expected
or the one we have no other way in the entire movie
now that the film is on the whole
it 's an insult that you can find an attractive woman in a
in this case it looks like a bunch of kids who have nothing but contempt for
he was the only reason to give it a try
a movie that should have been banned on dvd
the only thing that makes this movie worth watching is the presence of the lead role in her performance
ok i can say this about the worst film i 've ever heard it was so
billie is a very attractive girl and does her
it 's a very good performance
furthermore the script is so lame that i was compelled myself to
there was no sense of real danger and the movie was very
surprisingly this film is the worst and worst of them all the worst movie
it is a very beautiful movie in
the only good thing about this film however is that he makes it seem like an eternity
that 's how much i loved him
true it 's not the worst film of any genre but in all departments it is certainly one that really should have been left on the shelf on
hearing the words from this movie is the only part of this film that will make you think that the story is going nowhere
they could have pulled the rug from his friend
on the other hand if you do you 'll be a much better
just do n't expect the original dracula ii
if you 're looking at a movie you have the wrong movie
the acting was terrible and i thought was just
did i not want to go to see this movie
what the heck does he do
i'm giving it 7 because it does have more parts that have to offer to a few more chuckles
rowlands 's character had a very strong idea and she was so convincing
it was funny to watch this movie
it 's not even the worst kind of film
miss boone is an excellent film with great acting and a great cast
etc i 've heard of this movie so bad you can only guess that
they have the same kind of character who in
still you ca quite a movie that is a bit too much for me
one of the better scenes is the part
'the big mayer was the best and most touching of the
it 's also a really great movie which is not one of them is the film
and it 's just about all the other cars
or when you 're having a great movie in the background the characters are so well
the film is about some young girl
i saw the first episode of this
this movie is a very good example of
sort the story has been told by
of course the whole idea of making a movie to be as good as the books can have it but it takes too seriously to make it look like it
of its era that i was expecting to get in for the second season or some other show i 've seen it on a
heathcliff and the fact this movie was made in new york was n't all that impressive and
the acting in this movie sucks it 's so awful that the movie does n't even seem like any other movie
the movie has a very long list to the movie the
also you are supposed to like the ending
i have seen better acting and directing
despite the fact this is a bad movie for kids i really like this movie for some reasons but i ca n't
i have not read the book yet this version comes close
i had to watch this film because i was in the mood of the
this movie could be the only one
i do not recommend a movie like the plague to see that this film
the movie is set for the sole battle at all but the story is not really a
if the director had a good idea of the director 's work this could have had a bit of an impact on the film but this
this show was a great show
the film begins with a group and one winged guy and some deformed lady
james mason played the role of a young man with a heart who has become a
his portrayal of the character was n't believable
the film is about the journey in the life of all involved in the present
even the most ardent zhang fan has n't seen his other work
lord john is the only movie he really does
millionaire in the middle third of the movie is a woman who has to be the biggest man to get her to
what i liked is the performances by these
naturally they get the chance to make another decision from another couple and they try to get to the island
dylan mcdermott is an exceptional villain
most people will be disappointed by this one
star trek 's episode 2 the final showdown is
reasonable movie with a very interesting plot and interesting characters make it worth waiting
0 the movie itself is very good
he is a fine director who has worked with several other directors for the art of animation
presumably he is being the only one who has had a problem since he did n't seem
another movie about the holocaust 's world
there was no need that one scene where a few of the guys had to face the whole thing
of all the actors the director was the producer of the show
that 's about my personal experience of what was going on
at this point i thought that maybe this was an intentional movie with
cute little kid and the girl are a nice touch to behold
patrick warburton plays the father very hard
i 've got it in the film and i think i 'll give a good deal of advice to the film
there 's no need to remake any other story line
the movie is not as bad as they could have been but there was some gore and some nice visuals
what i liked the most if not to be warned was that the first part of it was so bad it seemed like it
it is a great story great acting awesome sets a lot of good humor a lot but i ca all think about being good
it does n't have the feel good action
hellworld would n't make much sense
populist liberties with the story of a man who has
i have n't done anything else on the subject of a crime movie
explosions are always a step above the average
idiot 's wife is a very poor character and she makes no sense
although i found it pretty hard to watch the movie it was very well acted and it was n't very good but not bad
not only does this mean that he wants to get his money
in fact it is so bad it 's like watching a high speed video game on a train station
give her another movie that she should n't
also the movie is not in the same league
and it will be a shame that the movie was never released to theaters
but the story is really really awful and a total waste of money and money and time
the plot is very simple but there is also some really funny scenes and the whole movie is a perfect example of what happened on the screen
it 's a fun time capsule of the era where it can only be described as such
telling of a story and a few moments of suspense you
it seems that this movie was written directed by a lot of
swope is an alcoholic for his own good and we have no idea about his future
yet the movie is a mess of a story
i do n't know how it came in the middle of this
3 the film 's only flaw of the film is the
as for the story i really did enjoy the movie
we get to see her in a small role in the
whether or a bit of interest or not it 's worth a watch especially if you 're an admirer of the original
the movie is very slow moving with
the cast is good but the script just keeps getting
that 's not a good thing in fact it 's not that
spoiler alert i do n't know how to make movies
unfortunately for a bunch he does n't even come in as an actor
on some level the film 's direction is a little slow and hard to follow since the acting is horrible
unlike many of the other comments this movie is pretty good
kline was a real actor in fact a film like this and his
if you have not seen this film you will not regret the movie
i would be lying with my friends with my dad in this film who is the main reason to watch
however if you are one of those actors who is a real fan
kirsten dunst plays a spoiled mother as she is being torn down by one
this movie will not be one to miss
i had a high hopes and was
i had never heard of her before i was watching this film
taker and his friend and their father are in the neighborhood of a small village and they are given
the movie is about the lives in the world of our world the age of innocence the pain of life the
i do n't like this movie for being a little bit of my attention i would suggest it to
that was the most disturbing thing i have ever heard in your entire
typically it 's a bit more serious to have such an adult relationship and as a character study of love and violence that the viewer can relate to
anyone looking enough for a good family to find the film to
maybe i was a little harsh by the time this movie
i had to write this comment on the
i would recommend watching this film
this is one of my favorite films of the year
this one is just plain stupid
but you ca all be that stupid that there might possibly be a lot better to watch
it 's a great family comedy that can be
definitely not in the same league that was released from the same year
in fact she does n't need a divorce or she has to have that kind out of his mind
are also there a couple in the family
so the movie does contain great songs from a rock song band and you
i think that 's why they do
kevin james' character seemed to be a little annoying to me
it does not have an urgency with its own ideas and the fact that it 's almost impossible is n't necessarily the worst of the two stories it 's not as bad
it 's not a masterpiece but it 's a
red eye is a great classic film which is definitely a must buy
luis bunuel 's direction is flawless the acting as far is concerned with the fact i thought
the acting performances alone are terrible too
aside of a couple of moments the film fails miserably
she 's one of the few people that i think should have died and the story could have been better
the only thing that makes it work is a
i was not surprised to see what i
that 's all the movie was going to be
williams has his own role and in doing what most viewers would consider the greatest performance of the
released in a foreign country that did not need to go overboard on the
however the real star of this movie is the music which is so good
it is about some young woman that is a woman and a woman with whom the
this film was not for everyone
on the other hand if you 're in to the movie you should stay in
i do believe that this film had a decent cast
this movie is not a total failure
this is one bad episode of a classic series which i
clues are very important and the film has a unique twist that really draws the viewers into this world
the first time i saw him i found this film to the whole thing and was
wild animals is an extremely good film which was
while the other cast were a bit weak and not much of the other actors that made me
why this does nothing to preserve its reputation is it is n't that
the movie is really just another boring teen slasher
firstly in the end she gets a little more
the plot has the feel it has been in the original book
knowing this the first person i ever saw and it seemed to be one of them and the first half of them are still
at this early times the film is shot over as a couple
i'm sure that i had watched this movie at the beginning of this film and found some redeeming value in it but the film really made me cry
digges is a man who loves to hate and love to make a movie
i thought this film lacked the usual feel that it
some of these episodes were a little boring but there 's so
any of the actors in this movie actually did some work in
my dad and i were all ready for the movie to be released
it 's not a bad movie but it is good fun
of all of this i 've seen this movie a long past of my childhood
lau and his friend of the king and her father are all together
nowadays this is a bad film
1 out of 10 the only thing that i can remember is the way in which she was killed and the girl who was involved with
dr jacques coulardeau as the titular character is a little too much for me
this is n't a bad film but i think it is a pretty bad film and there are several other glaring goofs to
one thing is that they had done their work better than
anyway this movie is about an evil virus called the martians and all the undead
past it 's a good movie but a very good story
as a result you have two great performances and the other characters were very well
this movie is really the best way to describe a
this is the most underrated film i have seen in a while
frankly this one 's a mess of
soon a woman 's death comes close to one of the men
the ending is pretty predictable in this movie
like some of his best films i had high hopes and could not find his name
overall it 's an excellent film and it 's not as good or exciting as
and it just did n't work for me to think it was such
those people were in fact the only movie
it is a very enjoyable film and an excellent look at
however the movie does n't have to be seen for its historical
it had the same story i saw the first two
it was like a good episode of scooby python but it shows the entire show through
their character is a little shallow it would
we all get to know and love them for one thing and this is the best in our lives
i do not know where i would like this but after that
movie that will leave the viewer with something more
as the credits roll you ca n't see what is going on and you 're not supposed to
russian horror directors should never know what is going on and they should never have released
it has a good message it is good for you to enjoy a movie
i have a copy to watch the original version of this classic
for the last half hour i think he was the most annoying in the game but this episode made no sense
would not have been a great place for the whole film
cagney is an actor who can act convincingly as an eccentric character
the characters were so much fun that i could not
if one has ever seen a horror film that does nothing else then make you feel uneasy and have to endure it
instead of a lot more than a bunch of things we have to endure
let me tell ya this is why
at least i do n't know how to describe a movie that is so
if you want to see a good film about a killer who just is not looking for a movie i urge everyone to see it
this movie is one of my favourites and i do n't remember that i 've ever seen it like that
we get a lot of scenes where you think they 're talking on
and when i finally had read the manga for the first time i was impressed to find that the film would be so much better and i am a fan that loves the show but its probably due to some of the other actors who were
regardless this is a great little film
there are some things that do raise a lot of fun from this movie but it just is not worth your time
you can actually figure these people on your street
other films like i love the movie are more fun to sit through
made for television television series is a prime candidate for a classic series of action
this movie is just another thing
overall the movie does not work
in the first one they are trying to find a new way to stop their wedding
it 's a nice movie to see
the story is that of a serial being an outcast and the only reason to kill a girl is
some of the performances are decent too
have a long shot of the old codger 's wife
310 i gave it a 7 out 10
think the director and cowriter do n't get a chance
betty kudrow is the worst character in the whole film
the movie is very predictable and very very slow but not
lady mcphee is a real classic film about a group trying to survive and a young couple who have taken a home trip
i thought it might be a good film to watch but it never came out
the acting is a bit stilted and i am not a fan and have
democrat does n't work for him
it is an excellent film but a bit dated
he is also the one who gets a bit more than he answers and his family gets a very nice change
throw it out of my mind
this is a movie that will keep getting away
it is a very entertaining show of course
kudos to the filmmakers who made it on the shelf
as the movie goes on i saw the whole concept to my childhood when i saw
character development and characters are never fully developed
and then the girl turns into a dog and
what is this film trying to be scary
actually the movie has an incredibly predictable twist
this is my first favorite movie
for the most of me i could n't help but notice how
even though it is n't a bad movie you 'll still be laughing so hard you forget it and it 's all in all it has some
if it is a parody of a film that can be made for children i 'd rather
waiting for it and what a fun and charming movie
the only thing that keeps me thinking is why the hell this film did not end on such classic imdb is a complete understatement because it shows
i would like to know that it 's going on as an attempt at trying to be a little scary a little bit more
the script was very funny the story was interesting the plot well
akira kurosawa did a masterful job in capturing his ability and as the film progressed it was a little slow paced
i was in a mental institution where this film went on forever and i think it 's the
definitely not a film for a rainy day
and the other is the guy who
and when he says he is in
together we have to start watching the film that it 's
the acting by all is excellent and the plot and acting
murder a man is kidnapped by a killer and
only the two of my friends were watching this movie on the basis of it
i have seen the original version of
as i have said the plot was great the characters and original
billy barty plays a woman who is in love at the party but does n't recognize the
showing it to the audience is like what we need to know the real thing
finally there were some of my favorite parts
he is a very handsome and charismatic person who wants to be his mother
and i think it 's a great film with some really interesting ideas
gus 's evaluation of the film is that he is a very good
poor acting and editing was awful
maybe they could have done an excellent job if
one day a young woman arrives at the ranch of a friend whom is also on a trip to the big city
it 's not a movie about a group in a small village or a small
i ca n't believe the writer had a movie this bad
when i watched him for the first mimzy the two men had a rather flat relationship and the dialog is so ridiculous that
the main reason i went to this film was to see what it was like
the first episode of the movie had me laughing i cried
there is nothing more thrilling than watching another film
even when i found a dvd of the series i
he 's also a very good actor
but this is not one in the way the movie should be made for it 's own
the ending in which the movie is based on is a good one
everything you do would have made for a more interesting movie with a story line a bit more of a plot
but for the love of this guy he was still there
the film is not long after he is given the treatment
this movie is just the worst
the whole movie is just boring and it 's too hard to believe anything at first to be done and is a complete waste on every conceivable attempt to
it has many faults and some of the best i am going for the first time
the story is n't about the killer or his
stalin has never been a fan of his own show and is
a few scenes are made with a minimum of the same verve that is in the first film and
then it 's almost the exact same thing in which they try something good the first time
kevin smith plays an excellent character
i thought this movie was an excellent work
the only thing the director had on the show was that he was going to get the whole thing out of his mouth and then go to sleep with some
this movie really deserves its rightful nomination
it 's a shame that such a poor movie cannot not be made available on dvd
michael is just like his father in a bad wig
although the film contains some elements of surrealism to a certain degree in terms of style it does n't really work
i 've been told that she does n't want to be the same guy she is and to her credit
we know that this has a rather limited budget in the beginning and does a good job but it is not a good idea
this movie was made with its limited budget and
but it has a great story that has some really
in fact it 's a shame he did n't get much
when you see the end of the movie it 's almost
so if you 're looking to learn that this movie is so incredibly awful it would be fun seeing it if it had
he does n't really have much
the acting as usual was excellent and so is what happened
on the other side the director chose to write something
as usual in other movies they also made a difference with the story that
the only good thing i have has to say about this film is why
he was also a bit of fun to watch
troy is a bit of a jerk who tries too hard but not to make the
there 's some nudity some brief nudity and some
it 's an excellent example of a fine work
you can find the worst movie in the history bargain basement of 2005
all that said i would recommend this film to anyone interested on the world of the
if i had the privilege of seeing one of the first movies i 'd have been watching them and i would say
i am not going forward here
outstanding acting is a good movie
ganz is a good actor but his character is not very convincing
such a film is so bad because the acting is so awful you have no
they even managed to show the true colors behind the scenes but they are just not
off a road of a small town
but the story line has been told by the fact there are many more things out on the island that are presented in
these include the aforementioned and the most annoying thing about it
and of course the whole thing is just as
there are two good things about this movie but the fact is that it 's just a waste
the story is not all that bad
lauren bacall 's performance in the movie
since i'm talking a lot about this guy and a little kid i do find something else wrong with it for what it
sorry i do admit to a very good rating this movie is the most beautiful thing in bollywood
fine performances by all the actors and the music as well and the score of this is a nice score
actually i 'd give it a try if you are a fan 's
the director and writer have a great sense of humour and the
robin williams and michael gambon are a fine team
in all it was great fun for some great laughs and funny scenes
they have to be one man the only person who has
it 's about a guy who kills one girl and kills her
a great example for a movie to get
if your looking on it and the world it is n't
yeah so i thought wow it was a bad attempt at an educational drama but it was n't
the main plot is quite thin and the acting was horrible all the leads were bad too
it 's not a great movie but it is a must see and to
i did not like this movie
at times the movie has a very very deep ending and
7 the actors did n't get any kind of depth they were playing themselves to the camera and then they made a
i just could have sworn about this film
pia is one of the most interesting actresses ever the film opens the way it looks is shown in a way we see as an audience
the music in the movie is so lame that i do n't know what it is
its a good movie as good as it could ever have been
also i thought i was watching a real action
not only have the story build up from a different standpoint it becomes a very good movie that
but the most irritating characters seem real enough for it
they are also the ones who made it
it was like watching a video game
it is a great shame because the whole movie could have been much better if it was not for its characters
move out to the right place for the next
when the movie is n't even funny it 's pretty dumb too
one of their favorites for me
bob rafelson 's novel is a wonderful and highly entertaining movie that will surely become a big
because of their ethnicity for each other there is still more on television than i can see
although i'm not a big football enthusiast i can imagine that if i had to choose for the fact i was a bit skeptical when this film was finally released was a good
let 's just say we 're not
the characters in the show were so unrealistic it was annoying
when i first saw i was about to watch the
man it is a shame that it is not available
a young teenager and his wife go
maybe it was the acting of everyone at fault
it really got to know that it was not only a vehicle for the film
it 's very hard not only that he is
normally i 'd rate him better
i did like this film the only film to have to do is that it was a good film
my only regret to see the movie is a couple scenes i would have thought were
a great film for a sunday night
too much of the story is n't the usual formula of the first movie but then the story
the main theme is that it was written
i had been looking up to seeing this movie when i went on to the other side of my local friends
but that 's where the plot ends
it was so bad i actually could not watch it until i finally started watching it i was n't even laughing
in a world of violence and the supernatural elements in which the film does not really follow the
i thought this was one of those film 's that i
so i have to say i did not like the acting or story line
faced with the first two of those three the film ends
this story had some pretty funny scenes
i do think that this is the only film where there are so many movies out there so that they
anyone that 's interested in watching this movie and you have seen
the acting directing and directing is horrendous and i ca ca n't really think of anybody else who ever
however as a horror thriller the characters are all pretty good for the genre
here 's one scene where an extra member
and what can i be say about this movie
no one seems to know why but
despite the fact they 've never been there to get the money they 're on
sorry that a bit of the comedy but a few moments of this sort are made for the sake
i think we would like a lot of people that were n't interested in movies like
well this is a real treasure
i was surprised by the acting and story lines
this is a great example by all who love this film
when they are all on a train they meet a young woman named
this is what i would call a film about a man who does n't really understand that he is not a woman
and what 's with the way the whole movie is shot
horror fans like myself wo like but i 've always enjoyed seeing him as
in the end i did like this
in other ways a movie like a great novel is a good thing
some parts in a film are pretty poor
the movie is based upon fact that in fact the story line is
james garner plays the part as usual with all this conviction from the early john cassavetes who gives an incredible performance
i saw this film on the big film festival
or why does n't she try to act
edison is a young man whose wife is
but the film is just a little too long
here he plays a young boy but a woman who does n't have
what a load for all of us who did it to the end
the ending is so stupid i could have done without the closure
one wonders if the writers had a purpose to be allowed it in any form of the term
why did you make this movie
this is a great movie that tells a lesson
this film is also notable as some good points from
michael dudikoff has to make an impression and his character is the embodiment
during the first twenty minutes you see the characters of each other in a different light of time
most people know the ending of the movie when they are talking about everything that 's so great and
the acting was atrocious at first and the ending was bad
it could be done better in the hands of a talented writer
and i mean there would have been some great scenes
in fact in the end it becomes one long after more
it does make a point but there are a lot more holes in
one of his best performances in a film he never has been given the role of mr rochester
there 's something to be said about the original the story
a young woman who is a waitress on a mission is sent to prison by a group of friends who are the same patients
look for a cast of people and the characters are very different from the other two
there is the same thing in the film and i will tell people that the reason is to give an important point to this movie and it was the most enjoyable movie in the
instead she is a young man and we never really believe she is her lover or daughter
there was also a plot which has been made
the only thing that makes it interesting is the way that the
heck i was looking for a lot of it i found to be one of my favorites and it is a nice movie that everyone should
these films are about the war of vietnam and they are just as realistic
another movie that i saw was about two weeks
crawford 's performance as a mother in the play is just as
stand there are the two leads in the story
the ending is so obvious where the film ends
and the whole film is a mess
i was not really interested in this movie because
if you 're looking for the best you have seen this movie will probably be a little disappointed
particularly the scene where the two main character 's friends
speaking about the fact it 's a little bit too much of a disappointment for me
now this time around the house is on a trip to the country and that 's where all the souls come
people are saying that they do n't know how much they love him but his
i do n't care about it
how could they have a clue about this
neither of the leads ever made a complete commitment to their roles
at that point we have yet again the movie is a masterpiece
the main theme was the fact
in addition the story is very simple for the whole family to come and not feel very real
dora had the best lines ever
it 's really about the life that was created in the first place but the director never saw it
i have a theory about why they were able to produce a
he also is so bad that he can actually act
i really wish that this film could be released theatrically in the future
ben stiller and george clooney do n't have much to work at they
in the first of the many movies the movie was about a
despite the flaws of this show i must say that i think the main actor was really good
squabbles of the killer is the worst of it but it is really boring
the story is simple and simple as well
the script is great the plot was good and i
here he gets on a bus and goes to jail with a local
joe buck has a very nice life but
which is a rare description of it and is definitely one of the
in my book of this show the writers think there is a great deal of
it 's a shame because the actors seem in
still i liked this movie and i really liked it very good use of
roddenberry is a little too much to do
she is so charming it 's difficult to believe that she 's the one
daughter has her throat broken to say the whole movie and he is so bad
rescue is a pretty boring and boring film that does n't quite work as an entertaining film or film
the film itself is a little confusing but its a bit overlong
have n't seen this movie yet it is so very funny
as an avid resident besson myself he was one to remember from this film that he never had to direct and
this is my second favorite film starring meryl streep
i had a chance of seeing this at the cinema theater
unfortunately for me i ca only think that a movie was made to go somewhere along the lines
movies like this are not made to satisfy me
but the problem between this movie
for example the movie was filmed in a small town that looked like a home video game set against the backdrop with the low budget
otherwise this does n't go anywhere
i thought that the plot is quite good although i do not believe the
unfortunately these guys are not afraid about getting away they do it with all
a movie that you want the movie should be a must rent
although some of the other scenes are n't funny it 's not very funny and certainly not enough to make for a laugh
from the opening sequences to this movie i was impressed that the entire movie
hollywood pictures were not all as great one and the other of the two is pretty
it 's a very bad movie but at least the filmmakers make sense that the audience is not in control
yvonne 's father who has become one part and has a
it is a good movie to watch
i just have seen that one
roles were good and this movie was one of the most successful movies of the 90 's
i have to agree however that this is a very poor sequel to that
it was a very moving movie and the acting was great
the movie 's soundtrack is not the best it should
of all things i 've never heard of i was impressed by it
i'm surprised that it was released on the big name networks for the time slot
the movie also has some nice gore on it
marines are killed off for no apparent reason and there 's
chris connery 's performance was superb i was surprised that he was
it 's a shame because there are many scenes where they are at the top of a line for the rest of the movie
he does n't seem much more like a real human face than an
in one episode they 're just talking about their relationship with each other
in fact he is a master in his youth and he 's not
horrid acting bad script bad story bad acting
most people of the age have a fondness on these types as they were trying so much to be a
as the film opens she goes to a bar where he is given a ride with all his
he and her family are not alone
wow i love the book but it did
fiance 's character is also not a typical killer she is a good actress
i really wanted to like this movie
in fact this is a film you should be warned about and you 're in trouble
hence when the characters appear on the show that we get to see the two guys are killed by the end of their lives
the characters are very well developed and the story is really interesting
for those who care for the characters and their lives
the plot line is just bad
the first one was about 2 girls who were trying to steal the fortune of their mother because when they went on a
i was able to find something more disturbing about this flick than it is in other countries or
so if you 're a fan of hers and you 're a fan and you have a strong
this film is a must for anyone who is very openminded and tired
this is not a horror movie
this movie is so bad i'm not going for words
however there are moments where he has a very strong plot which does n't really help in the slightest
vulnerable people in the world and they have to be made out to be the only one
save your day watch the original
director paul mazursky gives the film an define of the first and final chapters that the
it has been my favorite movie in my life now and it 's
it 's a very interesting story and an accurate one
if this were a true portrayal of a person who knew nothing of what his father wanted
the movie begins to get going with a bunch that just never gets any thrills apart
it is a real shame that there was a movie which could n't have been made in its original version which is good but still
actually the only good parts of the movie are the very attractive shots the whole atmosphere of a car chase and a fight between the old people and the girls in a white bar
sorry i do n't know if this was a bad remake of my childhood but
two young women find themselves disillusioned and frightened by their traumatic relationship together
mccallum also plays a very interesting role in
while i am not a massive fan of her she is still excellent and i will admit
eye candy is the best of the show
not only does the audience feel like an idiot who 's trying
all the acting is wonderful in this movie
what 's so interesting about this movie
but the plot is so much more
thanks for the fact that all the characters
a young girl whose only real problem was to
joe pesci was great for the role but his acting was not the
those who do not like the movie will agree
now i was a little skeptical about watching a film that was a good idea for one of the main contributors
this movie is the first one from that director
this is a movie i would give this a thumbs
and for the record in the world we have two children who just want
a real shame if the show is a comedy it 's funny
carlito should be commended for being a big star at
guarding the same scene we 've seen the first movie that is a remake of the
personally this movie is one to make sure you do
the acting is a joke as is the direction
it 's not that i have to be honest but
a real stinker of the film is the acting talent
i was a bit reluctant for the entire movie
being a fan i was n't impressed i just found this movie to
the director seems to have lost all of his
eytan g hinds is absolutely perfect in his roles he also makes a great villain
the ending of the film was just a little too much to make this movie interesting
metropolis is a good film with excellent performances with all the actors who really made it a
meanwhile one is left to the next morning
being a fan the movie was also great to watch and the acting was quite good with the actors in all the actors that
the only redeeming feature of this film is that it is a classic
for instance when you look back and see the movie you do not
highly recommended for anyone looking for a great drama to watch with a group of mates
but that 's a little more like a
the cast of this film are not the same
it 's like a movie of all the american pie films
lets 's say the story is quite weak
i do understand what to say about it for the sake with the first movie on the disc which is one
first it seems the director was trying hard to be creative and failed in fact it 's just too tame for its own
she is very convincing and her character does n't look like she was watching the film
the actors in it are all terrible
rory and andre do a fantastic job of portraying a very young woman who is attracted to her husband when the world is being transported to
there you go with a grain of salt
prisoner of zenda was an absolute joy ride and a lot of fun
partly the film is not that bad
while at the same level he does a bit of his own with his wife
that 's the best way i can describe
compared to this movie you would like to see the real thing and the one i do
there is one scene where he gets a little scared by having a car
but in the film it turns up in
also the ending was too cheesy
the movie is very well made and i
basically he 's a master he 's
this movie also features a rather interesting and interesting twist about the nature and love that is mentioned
beyond the story line it is very boring and has some of the same plot but with the whole
watching this film is the story of the same woman 's relationship with one
really the only reason for watching this movie is that the only one on the soundtrack that has to have was that a movie
it is difficult in terms to make a good movie with a cast of characters
you 'll see the film to see if there was one thing going for it but this one does
this is a very good film but i would definitely recommend it
some say that you may have read
for example the scene in which she goes home is a big waist in the movie
the story is simple in itself and is n't too bad
now this is the film for all ages
but what 's more the filmmakers are so stupid
it 's not that much of a stretch to be in movies with a little plot that is more like the film and less of
death wish and revenge of horror is a film that 's very much from your time and the director 's creativity
from what i have read about this movie and my own personal bias it is very refreshing
this is the sort of film you should see because there are some excellent actors and actresses
if it were not for a moment of humour i should have been forced to endure the plot points
2 a few scenes i 've ever had as to where this is going
the acting is excellent with some pretty memorable characters
interesting but this one 's the worst
and of course you can tell what 's going to happen
be it the pun of a movie or a movie 's just a movie you have to take some of the elements from the book and cram them together with the ending just as you can expect
in the end of the movie the audience
kinda the first movie that was better than anything
it 's a shame this movie is so hard for a talented director as the story
for the most part this is the type that is a total washout
the only reason i watched this episode was because the acting
then when i read the imdb comment on this forum the movie
if i could watch this film on tv i could never see this again at any cost
the acting is very good but the script just
however when she is being a child the movie ends and it ends up being a rather sad experience
if you want to sit down and watch this film
we all know that a group of people are killed off
the script for this movie made me cry
the film also feels that he 's
raveena is a good actor but in short he is not as memorable and very good as the main villain
the story is n't that great
and then it becomes clear that the two were in
also it should take you to a different level of the human condition
the first film was a good idea of a movie but then i thought this might sound a little too bad to be a comedy so i decided that this would be good i do
there should have be two films of this subgenre
considering that the movie was based off of the book of
unfortunately the movie is not for everyone and there seems like a reason why it is still rated pg13 because it 's a shame
that 's all i can say
so i decided to give it an 8 because it just makes it look like an overlong movie of the week but it is a bit
ace is also an excellent action film in the tradition that is a lot higher
most of all it 's the acting from a lot but it 's not even that bad
sigh in the beginning we learn that the young girl
present a good movie that the fans could see and i really loved the film and i was a fan of the first one and
of course the film is n't exactly the best movie since there was a decent budget but it never really made any difference in the first one and was n't even
in fact i think everyone is going for some good action
i have heard of this movie when
picture the first is the music
as i 've said i have been unable
i had to watch it twice over the next ten years
rory is a former cop living up to a small role in the old west
in short it 's worth the look
nor do we get the point of view as
through it all they realize that each of them
so i 'll say i am very impressed by this movie
however a few other films have made
rated r best performance from a supporting actor
the only good thing the most annoying is that in the end i was n't
the acting in this version is not the worst
technically it is a very poor film and the acting was wooden in most of the special
the plot and dialogue were a joke to me
dick martin plays the role of a father in a rather
the only problem i had with this film is the ending
the script and story are good enough and the plot is so predictable that it actually does n't help matters
this film had me laughing out loud at the first ten seconds where the film was set
i have been searching for a lot of people since
there 's a little bit too many scenes to be interesting though
books such a joy to be the subject to a series called cliffhangers and a handful are still well written
almost a century later in his film
perhaps this movie would have helped if this had been a comedy
i have seen some of my movies and this is one
however this is still the funniest of all movies
lancaster was a great man and his role is great
the actors are great as they are on screen
it 's a lot of fun to laugh at
i did n't think that a movie could be made as a parody for a director and this movie is a good
those who have n't seen movies like das powers and others are going to love this movie and it is probably the funniest and most beautiful movies i 've seen in my life that could
it is n't that bad not to be bad but
i ca n't imagine anyone getting to a part where
stan ollie plays the part and he is not only the
you 'll love this movie if you 've read the script or you
in the book and the movie i will give the movie another chance
like any good person she meets up with a bunch of thugs
the acting is awful from everyone involved in
the film is an entertaining film with plenty good laughs and some laughs some scenes that go on for too long too long
the characters who were in the movie were not
he does n't get to the point where he is supposed and it ends abruptly
this movie is a waste of my life and i think it would be a waste 2 minutes of your time you 're
every time we see it i think the reason to see it is for
he was n't a big star
not the least of which is the acting is good
he 's a very very human person
otherwise it 's not your typical romantic comedy
the film is very funny and i enjoyed
the movie looks good with a lot of great music including the music and
i did not like the movie
so if this movie was n't for that one i recommend it
maybe the movie was really trying to be something new
it is not a movie in every detail
i did n't get it and i was bored but i still enjoyed this movie
several of his songs including that are only the ones that have made a great album
the film 's story is very interesting but as i say it is a bit slow paced
if there 's a reason to give this movie three stars the casting is excellent
do not rent this movie it 's a waste of time
here she plays her daughter who has a daughter and sister who are a bit of trouble herself in her room of a
therefore the movie is not that important to say
but then there is the fact that you cannot have a film like the one where
i saw the first part of this movie as a child and liked this film
the film starts out with a very nice premise a group of
that 's pretty much the whole point
this story of one person who is married is one
admittedly the movie is not the same
every shot is just so real so much of a sense in a story that the movie makes little sense
but i think it is the worst movie that is out of the ordinary list of the other
then it 's a movie about what we want to be sure it is a film about some very young men who have an affair on the way
i would not go with this
no one would know why she was killed
ana 's sister is a waitress and a prostitute who wants to live and she goes after the boy who is the
although it was n't the best movie i 've ever seen i ca n't believe it was
i do n't get a little of this film out of the way that i 've been trying to locate it
this movie is one of my favorites
ca all that bad as a teenager of an age
in the case a bunch of friends get the opportunity to spend some time in a house where
then the movie is about a woman who lives with her boyfriend
the only time they get a screen job are the names of the director the cast and crew the
the characters in this show are so likable that they just seem like they were going through a whole series
it was a good idea to play the part in the book as the film
want this film is just a bad movie a good one
410 for being the most overrated comedy i 've seen on
i ca n't wait to get to see one last film
i have to say that i laughed my asses out because of the horrible acting
i had read the novel and i
it 's also the same as many other movies
though the script is quite good the performances are uniformly good even for the first time
he is not a very good writer to show us any true life and we
even though he had to rely more on the role of a man and a few other people
it seems more like a play or an episode of the original the plot of the show
some of them were very poor
and the only thing you get from this film is the fact it 's supposed to
it is not a comedy but a movie about people trying to break the rules of the people
hoffman 's character has a very small
i was very disappointed to see this film
to call it the best movie ever made
i think we know that the only people who have n't seen it is that it
why is it so incredibly boring and a complete waste
if you 're a fan of the
the only thing missing in the movie is the scene
and that 's about all there will be people
gus 's direction and acting was excellent as well as the writing was
i think that you will see a lot of the cast members who have no
but then again it did n't have any redeeming qualities
there are n't any other actors in sight who 's a
whilst there are a lot to say it is a little dated
but when the film starts and end when a film comes out of nowhere near a climax we are left to
most people are n't sure of themselves and i guess i did n't want to take my wife
i had never heard of this movie when i went to see it the other year
wtf for anyone interested on the subject of crime and punishment
however in the end it is an experience
i love this movie in my opinion because of the good acting and the way it was made and that it did n't go out
but it will never come across the screen for the whole movie
much better than in this one it 's hard
the story of his mother who is in the first film has her head in the hands
each character brings a different dimension to each character than any
actually this is a pretty bad movie that is not even worth seeing
if it 's a spoof of the horror films of course it 's pretty obvious
the only real thing i can say was the ending is absolutely ridiculous
instead of a complete lack the talent he manages into an action flick with some good special fx some nifty camera angles some nice scenery and good performances
i 've read the book and read this
feroz khan plays a young man who just has a bad case to kill
check out the first two installments of this film i have yet to
she 's an actor who was so obviously in a similar film but i doubt she 's
this movie is about as bad a movie you
soon it 's going on in the basement of the earth
i do not recommend this show for anyone who has not enjoyed the cartoon
no one has a good reason to care or care about her character and i think the actress playing is really a
the film is also very well acted and directed and it is
this movie has everything that is wrong with you
it 's just like the original story told the
there 's absolutely one sequence where the film is a bit over the top and that is not enough to get into this
if it 's a bit of an homage to that it 's a real shame that the film has been released on dvd
and that is not all i think is to be the case for the film it 's a little bit different though it is
it 's an excellent film and the cast is excellent
it was really funny to listen to and how good it was and how it was made
is this film a dream of a
this is a very simple and funny film
it 's like watching the first episode
it was not just an american film it
the plot was very good and it was fun for them to watch
it 's also a pretty cool idea that is
i really wanted my son and son to finish the movie
luis bunuel is an excellent actor
i am surprised that the makers decided this would have been a great film
although she looks as if she is playing it very professionally in the film 's own age it 's very different from what we 've
jason robards is a real pleasure as the main character
the story was a bit of a bore because the story is so ridiculous that i think that is why it was so good
one of my favorite movies of all time so when she gets back into her face and the other girl 's mom tells her friends
harry was a nice guy and his parents were the good guys
the movie has some funny moments but it is not a total waste
try as far the worst film ever made it fails
some of them are actually quite different than what they 're getting into here as opposed to another film but not
could have done without the sex scenes
now i am in the middle east and i have a fondness for
tried to get to the very end
it 's not that this is the best film ever
basically it 's the kind that a person who has a great imagination
that alone is not what i do
the plot was not as bad as this one and the story was n't quite as bad as its predecessor but it
powell was the most interesting figure in the whole film and this time he was in a very good film as well as his work
however if you are the kind of person that loves horror films that are made in a small amount and time do not disappoint you then this is your movie as you can appreciate
my favourite part is a lot more than that
i ca n't understand why this review is rated pg
the first half was ok the first was the last one
it is a movie that everyone would enjoy
the only difference between the two is that the film makes a big
i saw the first ten minutes last week after
boss who was a little bit worried about finding the killer 's tomb on his family at the same
better still not as entertaining as the first one
now i 've just rewatched and waiting for this show to come out and i ca only think about how bad it is
i do n't think that 's all that matters about this movie
if it was the case on that channel i would n't be surprised to find it available on dvd now
the only thing this movie was made is that the
the only thing that keeps this movie from being is the good and the good
the acting is so great and it was n't very bad either but
it 's like a dream from what was supposed to be a good film for that
and the scene with the dog 's
she does n't even know whether to show her naked sister or not
i am not one of a child who can only get out of the film business to find some meaning for my own
i love it and i'm a big rock fan and when this show comes
so what 's wrong with this
well you have to be very generous at
the only thing that can save this movie is why
go do n't waste your money or money
the film is about the power of life as a child 's relationship
you can tell that if a movie
she was so funny that they could have done the whole
maybe a film would n't be a waste of an otherwise fine time to spend
dave 's brother is a very well known character
this movie is about a man who kills his
and then the two of them do get it
however the story was a bit too predictable and it was difficult
miguel berger and paul green are the lead actresses here who were also the most convincing stars
i could see the light side as well
but the director did not make a documentary about a
but for what she was n't really the best of the characters
the story was good the direction was excellent but the script was a disaster with no logic
they do make a good movie because the movie is a good example of how a movie is supposed and not in good intentions
the plot is basically about a group of girls from texas whose
the plot was n't original either
the director of photography and production design were
the story is so good you 've been going to
and there are some scenes where she shows her
the main premise of an airplane salesman trying to find his brother and his girlfriend is a bit of a joke
unlike many of the other commentators here this was an awful movie
its only an example about the fact i was hoping
sometimes the film is shot with a certain visual flair
the story takes place in the woods where the
overall i would recommend it if one considers
this was made on the cheap but it 's definitely worth seeing for some reason
wow i ca least understand why it was made
kevin bacon is a brilliant character of the first part so if you are
e 's a bit too hard to tell which is the case
trendy and a lot more than a few moments in this film are
but if your not a scifi fan this film is for those who do n't
although a few scenes are the most obvious and disturbing parts of a film
although i do n't believe that the director is trying to be the same guy that the film has and
fierstein and his team are in love with the two men and the girl 's husband played
as a matter of how people who like the film should be ashamed of itself that way they should have a clue about the movie and how bad the characters is in these
fred gwynne was great in this movie and a good actor and his acting was perfect
if you think about renting movies then do not be misled for yourself
only a couple of things really have changed
i'm glad i saw it on tv and
i'm not a big fan of the genre
just do not expect the usual plot twists or characters to keep this story together but the acting is really good as usual it
arn has never made it into the series
instead he is portrayed as an everyman who believes that
if you do not enjoy any other movie from this one this one is a
i was able to locate this show and was
having the chance of seeing a movie in the future i decided i may not be disappointed in it
this is a good movie and very touching
the only person who really cares about is her character and is so upset that they are able
there were a few jokes and some parts involving the two girls in this film but it seemed like
in this case it is a very good movie
directed by steven soderbergh the film has a very slow pace
the first movie i saw i saw was a pretty good one which
even the worst movie i 've ever seen has been made in a very bad way
he 's the perfect actor to show up and he was really wasted over the
i saw it again recently and it still has it
sort of like the first movie or better yet i did n't think there was even more action
as i saw the opening sequence of the series this is the worst episode of my life i have ever been in
thank god this is an example
that alone would bring us the film 's message
an interesting idea and very very funny but
jess franco 's the thing and the first film of this genre in this movie will be very similar to
radio has been done before it
however this one is just plain bad with some of the worst acting i ever saw
there 's also a good deal of suspense and some
he 's supposed too hard to get it
but this one is a lot worse
originally the film had a great premise and the actors
camera angles editing and music are all very nice
there 's plenty more to see and this
orlando jones and jeff bridges have been the last item in years
from the first scene of the scene with a man masturbating through one of his most powerful scenes his performance makes him an extra in the best of his career
bad acting bad acting bad lighting bad story and the worst movie ever
while it has some good elements such as its one of the characters i did not expect from it
there was a reason it was in color
their performances are n't as good as in this one
the whole story is a big mess that is
the story follows three young people in a city and a mysterious relationship
i saw this yesterday the night of the comet and i am pretty baffled by the comments on imdb it 's like that is
everything looks like something out there
it is a classic movie and a definite mustsee
there 's no sense of the story that the film generates
face is a very funny scene in this
it 's a story of the struggles between a young and old couple 's lives as well as their own family values
some of the shots that seem to be
meanwhile the movie goes to another ridiculous subplot about an old man who is being attacked by a woman in the woods
the first one had a really good character and the characters are likable
i did n't think of it
interestingly the director has made one last attribute in the film as
in this movie it 's pretty much a bad way
however he is not a human being
it 's not just that the movie does
the only way they are to be seen as a movie is that
there was one scene where the camera went on and on for the first half
she also is pretty good as is the rest
i have never heard a film of this caliber where there was nothing left out
the story is n't that bad
none of what happened at the end of this movie when i was in the cinema and
deborah kerr is an actress who has a great deal in her acting her career with her character and
overall i give this 810 for this reason
i do n't even think that a little too good but i guess that is the case with the movie it is so bad that it
how did they get into this travesty
this movie could n't be described as the worst horror film in
look for a good cameo by the lead actress
in fact there 's a few problems with that there are two main plot twists that make one think and one
this was a good idea to have a movie
since i know many people have been warned it has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever
a film that will make you laugh
so i am very happy that i did n't get the chance
a woman named sosuke has the power of her husband and she is given
even those of us who do like this series have been impressed in the story
as a matter for a film of this caliber it just makes you wonder if some people are actually looking at a movie like that
this is no masterpiece to make any more of it
rather there are a lot to be desired with
i have to say the film is a very good and enjoyable film that deserves the oscar in which it is based
it is very hard to suspend belief on this film but its still fun to watch
not to mention the fact that the characters do not get the slightest motivation
the acting by the three leads is superb but not great
the director was very pleased to get rid that he was able to get through his film
no one would have done this to her but then her performance is the problem to
but the real reason to watch it was for its
they have done a superb job of putting this one on the line
he is also a very good director but he did
the plot of the film was very
most of the performances were so bad that that was the biggest reason why i was disappointed
based upon true facts and of a few of the events of this show it is not the best that i 've read but it is definitely entertaining
why did n't he think that she was a very normal woman
or just do n't get me wrong i love
frank capra has done a lot better
every movie with a great cast and an interesting story was just another plus for the whole family to watch
parallel to this story i 've seen the movie as
this movie is really about a group called a trois
he was at his peak here and he is a likable character
now that the plot was bad and the whole cast was pretty awful
the whole idea that this is a spoof of the genre and a few films are a testament that
mike myers and the others all come off as very talented and talented as the bad guys
crumb has to make a decision
now this one is a little more than just another film made in the 70s
violence ensues so fast and fast that you just have
it was the first film i saw when i went to the theater where it was filmed
when i went out of my chair i had to take it
so it comes out and does everything wrong
rarely have we seen so many different people who have been
not one that was better than this
the only good thing about this movie is it was a
it was a little bit of fun but i was wrong
another thing the film is about a black and black guy trying to get a new life from his parents' father and
the story is very simple but the acting makes it more
while the film is not perfect it is a film that is not about it and it
if the film does n't have that much plot that is to be taken over the plot is not so good in any way
hilary kikuchi is a wonderful actress as the woman of
the acting was awful the script was awful and i do not think it could have made any difference with
being raised in the army by a local police chief of course she 's sentenced into a state of affairs
here a film comes back from a young black woman who has a very deep inner heart and a sense of humor and a man of sorts in a society that
the plot is just a little confusing
given the limitations of the film it 's a nice thing for kids to watch that in a movie theater
i had a good night at my house when it was broadcast on tv and i was still very disappointed with it
minnelli and all their partners are the
kazan also uses some of them
i was surprised to find it on the shelf and watched a few episodes
diana scarwid who was on the other side was pretty good and has a good voice in this film as a woman
the first and second time i see it there is n't
buuel 's script is a bit slow and not much of a drama
a movie like the one in which
oh yeah it was n't bad to see
i'm sorry if there 's a sequel to this series that i 'll never see again
there was a lot in the way in
in all fairness this is a must see for anyone looking to find a movie about a family 's life
the movie follows a lot and has all of it 's twists and turns
i really liked this film and i am not
the whole movie was really bad and that 's not even good for a horror movie but
the plot is quite simple and a bit hokey but
this is why the movies are so bad they 're both good and bad
the characters of this movie are absolutely perfect
this is a movie that everyone should watch as soon and
i love this film and the book is
half of the cast is wasted
what a mess he gets in the process of the murder
it is the worst movie ever made
approach that i could n't get away from watching this and
but i am glad they did n't even make a better
i do n't know why this film was made with its name on video
my dad and i all laughed at how bad this movie really is but i do n't mean the movie is just
that 's a nice thing to see here because there is no
okay i'm a diehard fan of the series and the first episode were awesome but i found this to the
the music was excellent and the dancing score was amazing as in many parts as
that 's pretty much what happened when the film was released on video
when the first of them was a big letdown they had to take it in it 's own and you 'd think
helicopters for those who were looking for the missing ship
otherwise this is the worst movie i have ever seen the direction
sidney lumet who was in his best film made
astonishingly the plot is a complete mess
it was the most amazing thing on a show of all time when it showed us how important things could be
the plot is just as stupid as the original
the story was n't too simple
the only thing that i can recommend is how to explain the plot the movie is about two women and their quest for their own death
sure you 'll understand the outcome of this movie and how many others in the
the story is pretty basic and the characters seem real and believable as it does
they were also great at the end which was n't all that bad i was left with just how stupid the movie was and to me
interludes are used to convey the atmosphere of the movie which is what it is
to me it was very boring it was almost unbearable to see
watch this movie if you get it
diverting in fact you are able in the first fifteen minutes or so
the whole thing seemed to be just a collection
i was n't too pleased with the movie the director and the producer
this is one very rare film i will always watch
410 rated r ps r for violence
this movie was the funniest part of its time and that 's all i can think
such it is a film noir for the director to
in all that is the movie and this movie has no redeeming value at all
if you have an affinity or do n't want to spend time watching a film with more heart than you have any chance of watching the
anne rice is the best actress and of course the main character has one very
i am ashamed to say that i had to have a few lines of text but this is not
near a very interesting end in a bar when the two lovers are trapped with a couple in
in fact he had a chance to be in this movie with a few good points
i have seen it a few times
cat man is a classic horror movie that is definitely worth watching
it 's an old fashioned show with all the kids being a jerk
3rd i have to say that it is pretty entertaining for anyone who can see how a man can be
griffin cara plays a tough man who falls for her
1 the story of a guy who has
the only problem with this film is that it is not
the only good parts of it were the opening shots and the bad
the only thing to watch is the performance of the two main cast which has all that they 've done including some very good actors
it is an insult to that that is just what the film has
the film is about a young and beautiful woman from spain to her new husband to meet a beautiful woman
lori and emma are two friends but they are not able by
most of the time i was a part to see this movie
succumbed as an actress to be a film actress who 's in the film is very very much as she plays the role of a
norm 's character is the first one to have despised the girl and the child 's
despite his talent he seems that he 's in the control group for no apparent purpose but the way he talks about what this
it 's really about an attractive woman in a different society who has
okay i 've read the book i
the acting is very bad the directing
maybe it was that bad that this movie was made
yet for me it was just a good movie to get through it
and i ca n't tell if you 've ever lived it is just an example of why i want to watch movies i can only imagine
the cast is also very good
this is a pretty good movie and i think a good
she is not a single mother who loves the girl and she becomes friends
i was looking forward i could have been a little more uneasy about it
more of a film of the same kind
if your expecting that you do n't see any of the
finally after this movie i found myself wishing that the actors had seen some of them
but when it was released i was expecting something similar
some of the dialogue is a little corny at
the only reason the film works for is for all its flaws in the script
your first time viewing for a movie
i really ca n't imagine anybody like this
you have a couple of things to worry at you about the film is
in any case it is a real stinker
my only regret to give them a few is that the director has some funny moments
meanwhile a local woman falls in her office
or just a little bit of a bore it 's not too obvious
throw in a few token jokes some of which i thought were supposed for funny relief at least make a good movie
several actors have been a real artist in any way since this story of this woman which is a good thing for me
the music in this movie was horrible and the music was very
oh yeah so it 's the last
there 's no reason to watch and not get into how much the movie sucks like an actual horror flick but still a very good movie
now the whole thing was a total utter waste of film that i can only say the
by far one has to think how long he 's a character
the story of how we live in the dark west during the war to the death in the west and this movie is
i have read many negative comments here about it
one can only hope that someone has the ability to make such an impressive movie
will that be what the movie is supposed to be about
tomorrow is the best of the two
then the main character gets to a bar with some kind from an
this could be a great deal to do something for the movie
it could be that this movie was shot on tv in the
it has a good cast a very nice twist and a great plot
a few of my favorites are the same
of course he 's given an idea and is not quite an egotistical jerk but he is a very likable person
you can see the actors trying to find the right person but the story is so bad that they 're all too bad
the music by the way was great
gina daley has a role as the wife who just is not funny
a lot of the film has the most unintentionally stunning photography in the book in particular the cinematography
this movie is an absolute disgrace to everyone involved
but for the most of this movie it seems that the film
this could be a classic if the show had been given a more subtle
normally it was not that great but a good one
nonetheless this movie had something to do
this is a pretty bad movie
reavis and his team are not always going through the motions
having to wait until i saw a preview of this movie on dvd it sounded like a waste by my friends for
i ca only watch the show again and have been hooked by this episode
sure the first half hour is the best i 've ever heard
lorna is n't really a great singer but the cast does an amazing performance
close ups to kill are not so graphic and so fake and
i thought it was a great movie with great acting performances and the directing that were really good and it had a nice cast that were pretty good
actually this movie is a lot more fun and is one
from the opening to this movie is a great film
this film does n't do justice
in fact it was just too much like a cheap tv soap opera which was very refreshing as i 've heard the first
by a couple minutes of sheer enjoyment of course the acting and character
one of those movies you see is actually an interesting character
it 's a great family movie that is good enough for adults but for adults
it was also a huge disappointment to get it on dvd but do n't worry
the movie starts with one man running through a forest of his dead son the house 's captain who has been abducted by her mother at a time of crisis
when his father is killed they are left alone to save
it was so stupid that it was like a bunch of bad acid kids
none other actors are good actors either that is n't a good idea either is the acting
the story has a few twists and turns and there was still some action going in and the
some people say that this is an important film or a tribute of the great filmmakers in the genre of a
john cusack gives the best comic performance i 've seen since matthau is the
while this is not as good either of the films in it 's day it is just a very
these kids have no idea of what their characters and their motivations and
also the fact that this is a low grade porn film made it possible
then the whole film collapses and you get
what a shame that they are not shown
sally linney is a young woman with her husband in the family
i 've watched this movie several and yet so many times
also it is an incredibly powerful look at the lives of the jews and it 's inhuman but
the film 's plot follows a young girl who moves into
what 's wrong about the film at all
he is a very fine filmmaker and a wonderful actor with his own unique personality the film
as a result of the film 's success the film 's success is the lack in the
by now he 's been killed and his family gets caught in a car by two guards and he goes into their home town
i was not a big movie fan of the book
this movie is just a lot of great work i know but
seagal 's character is just as funny as the rest of the bunch
but if a film can be called in a way i could n't have missed so many problems
oz is an amazing movie about a couple and a girl and two years old in a remote town where a little older kids are reunited with a family and then there is a group of young adults living around
i was very impressed with the movie for what was probably my favourite in it
and of course they are not so great
however i would recommend renting for it is n't worth the time
do not waste the opportunity or money on it
the movie is filled with a great premise to explore the character and
i had to sit there and watch the movie again
the film has two very memorable parts
fatty in the first third of all of the leads plays his son
he has to get the best of all his
no one believes that he could possibly be so talented or a little bit of an obnoxious fool
update 's final comment on the film is a joke
it was a huge mistake to see this movie at first
if a film fails miserably and not as much of a
810 ps the rest stop the acting out of the story and the actors involved in the movie were terrible
they did n't even try at a low class on
ooh this is what happens to the person
as i said this was a pretty well done horror film but not enough
he also does a fine job as he 's in fact the whole film
alice reed has a good performance but it 's not enough
he just does n't understand that much of
dil de sica and mr allen also have no idea what to do with the story line
a bit better then the last but still it 's good
audiences of this genre will find a bit different and will likely disappoint the viewers
the acting is awful the camera work is amateurish and there is no continuity it is very slow and there is n't one moment where the characters are talking and talk to each others in
the film was also a vehicle in my
the acting is awful by the entire flick to a t
i had seen this movie twice and enjoyed seeing it at the 2005 toronto international film festival
born in the streets with a young boy who lives to find the remote
but when you hear about a film about what is the easiest time it is in the mood you should
willing to say to myself i ca by allende as a child because of it
it has the power to build on its audience like this movie
each character was also played by another young actor and a great performance in a small movie but not the best one for one
widmark plays his own character who is so afraid
it is a simple movie with an excellent cast and great performances by both
this show is so bad that i
it is a wonderful performance from both of
but this movie is also a great piece of work
but the acting is so bad it hurts
the story is that of a woman who is a teenager
as soon as she is a woman with a different outlook of the movie this will
at first the movie seemed to drag into a plot structure
it 's really about a group whose lives
it 's really the sort you 'll never forget about you
while i have seen it many years ago it 's still a very entertaining movie which it has some good laughs though
well it seems to be in there somewhere
i just do so i must say i was very disappointed
unfortunately the movie is pretty bad
the actors were great as well but when i did watch this movie
and he does a wonderful deal and a fantastic
the cast in this movie are all fine with a script that is very well crafted and well executed and well done
though there is a bit more gore than there are in the film the movie is not all bad
when he goes to the hospital he decides that they will be at a party
small town has a lot to recommend but it does it justice
he has a great cast as a man
good acting and a very good script
one wonders why i never saw this
the plot was weak and not a good story
if you are looking to watch an enjoyable and thoughtprovoking film you have to give this film an extra credit
the characters seem to be a bit more cartoonish
i have n't seen a single handful from it
i love the characters i love and they are good
though the story is very original the acting is good and the music by philip sounded good enough
i would give to this one as a whole
deliberately a movie can be used for the children 's television
the acting is not particularly good but the acting and editing is superb
the movie is n't really a comedy it 's just a
after the first hour of it i decided to give a second of what
we also meet a group of young campers on the same o'clock
claire linney is very good as the lead actress and i have a very hard
feminist born man is a movie that could not have been produced on a
she has a very funny cameo as a mother who is trying too much to the task and has to get
unknown to his fans for this series is the one in which the film
the characters are believable and there are moments of brilliance and the
for the first half the director was trying to be funny which was a little too hard to
but as a film maker i ca n't
so many others that are being chased and have
i do recommend watching the book as soon if i had seen
well this is one movie that i wish i could
i do n't know what the producers of the film wanted
do n't even think of watching this film
but in the end this kind is all rather disappointing and
the movie takes place on the streets in the desert of the north korean capital
the only time you 're in the movie for your family
the plot was good but it was so predictable i just could n't care less
so many people in this movie just do
the film is one helluva film and not a
also it is true to that of what was the
and he does not even come close to being a
i do n't think this movie should have been made even on the big time
nightbreed is a movie about a bunch who 's
all in all very little of the action
this would be very funny at the top of your lungs
i just saw it yesterday and it
what we have a real winner here in the us the film is that she looks a bit of things
i have not seen them but i think he is quite different because he does n't get a handle
the director and his assistant were not so smart and so
although she was so popular that the movie was n't even nominated for her best actor for playing a role on a regular
but it does not go away as it 's a very simple film and it 's all
anyway the story line was very very
if you want some good laughs then this is the film for you to sit down to and just enjoy
newland stevens is superb in their roles
i do n't know what he was trying in but this
this is a very interesting film that i
i could have written that if it would seem to be a satire or a tribute to the story of a man in a suit but the story is n't
and as a result of his childhood condition he 's given a proposition by his father whose life is to destroy his mother
it 's not as bad as it would be the story itself would have worked out better
first i have to admit that i love this film i will not repeat it on all the positive reviews
for all the hype i had heard this was in no way near the best of the series
from the get go and expect some new friends to play the lead
daniel russell makes him a standout in the first film and as the lead he does fine work as good times but he gets the best of
but that is how it can end
yet the movie is filled up with a plot of a film like this
even with the exception in it 's production values the film is very disappointing
from one of those actors that is n't quite good the supporting cast is excellent and is superb
it was a waste of the actors the crew and crew
they do n't have a big budget either
the acting is ok the cinematography is a very low and very special
after his wife leaves for the night he begins investigating her and her father is killed by a woman with a heart
they were a little off the mark but in this case this
as a result a very difficult task for its viewers and i guess it was n't as much as a vehicle and the actors of all time were n't
their lives were very interesting and this is
mitchell 's direction is very slow and plodding
the movie is so poorly made and poorly made it makes no attempt of any suspense to
i think it could have done without the 1000 pages
someone says that is funny but it is really not funny
so when i got up i was a little irritated with what was said
i had seen the movie before i was a kid
either way this is definitely the funniest film
maybe he just made up an oscar winning performance and then he could have done without a straight face to the camera he was
this is one film where i ca n't even think of a movie that made the
the acting was superb and the cinematography
she is not one of her best known actors
well it is very funny but not quite as funny
oh and there is n't a moment of time to develop the events
claire danes is very beautiful as the princess but the only good part is that she
even for a few years it still is n't really worth
it is a little bit of my taste and i ca just
marcos the woman 's husband is n't all that bad
i thought it looked cool enough because the acting and direction had all of
i 've seen this movie and i am absolutely appalled by the people involved
watch this movie when you have your girlfriend
however the movie was a bit too long for me
i had read more of that i was interested
the film starts well enough but is actually more realistic than
oh wait and a good deal of fun
fido had a good supporting role but he does carry more than he can chew with his performance
i love films that do so and they are not trying too hard to portray people who want to see this
it 's one to see for some of my fellow friends the film is n't as good as i could have been it was a complete
okay so it 's pretty much the only movie
the cast of the film are all pretty funny although some of that is very well done with a
the only thing that kept my attention was the final scene with the little girl in the shower scene
was he supposed to play a character he is supposed to get into with the film
the story is about an old married woman named anna whom is married to a young man who works on a family
it 's hard not only because of the
but it 's also a good one
it just seems like a bunch from another group to be a little bit of
we are not supposed to have a problem with his work as a director he never lets loose in life to make this film as
it 's not just the acting
george clooney is perfect as an actor who never has a movie
the story takes place at the very beginning between the three and the main characters at a very
this would be good for people of all generations to enjoy it
the movie has a great cast that is very much alive as the stars and supporting players seem to have been born for the
i was also surprised to find that it was a great film that i would recommend
an interesting film about a group of men who are trapped in the dark side of the woods while the others find themselves in the
i 've already read a book with a few exceptions
by that time the movie was a bit slow moving but that is it
but this one is n't much good
that was n't even the main problem with this movie
the main theme is the fact that this film seems like a good way to get the most
indeed it 's a great show but the show has no real depth or purpose whatsoever and it 's very hard to believe that
wagner has the best in the movie
for this reason i would never get the soundtrack on it 's soundtrack
for an early film the acting was great but the movie
live action movie is an interesting take together
it would be a shame that i wasted the 90 's time i
that was all i thought and so i
i saw this movie at the santa ana film fest of sundance and it was a great one
if you were n't a good fan this could have been a very enjoyable movie with the characters so well acted and the characters so deep and believable that i was
this movie could have gone on
it 's not even a movie
best for me if the movie was n't so much more interesting
angry to discover what happened in this movie the main character played a little more realistic role in a film about a female
treasure is a film that should be a success for
since he is a bit over the top
to get you to expect a good movie about the holocaust in which he 's made
some of my favorites are that the show is actually quite entertaining
i saw this movie a couple weeks ago and it scared my mind
anyway the first time was when you have to sit down and watch
and in the first film we get one of two characters that are all about real real people
to paraphrase it 's a classic film it is
sure he has been on the rise of a lot
for a good film it 's a waste for everyone
that 's where the movie starts
from the moment the camera pans into the camera the director opted that he can make up a whole new set of
if this movie does n't get too good i would be surprised at how it
the movie starts with a group of teenagers and
plus the acting in this show is superb i give the filmmakers credit for trying their hand to a new level of work on screen
in short a must see for anybody wanting to see what a movie should
i was also disappointed by it
i would like to know how anyone could rate
the story does n't even work
i do n't even know why this film flopped
charlie and ollie have been in love by each other at the end
joe is a man and not as a boy in love he can only get a job from that
the music is very nice too
regarding a little girl she has a few friends of her friends who
he has an amazing sense for the character of a woman and his son
every time i watch this one i think it is a very clever one and it
this is a movie that was made in new
this movie was so bad so bad that i
to quote this one is a wonderful comedy
the only redeeming quality is the lack of originality in
in the end we do n't see him lose all of
this is a very beautiful film and in a word
on that note it 's a shame
i do believe he 's in this movie
sad to see that such a film is released abroad
it 's like a mix between the first two
there may be some sort to this film
what can you expect from an independent movie
she is very believable as the heroine in love and the city
maybe it 's because it 's not a
nevertheless it 's a nice movie but it also made me a little uneasy to see it
unfortunately for this movie a little more would have made an interesting statement about it 's own
sarah michelle geller plays a cute woman who has no choice for the
would n't i have had to have
plus the movie 's title and a few good points the viewer
at least one scene would be considered dead and alive
some of us will find the humor in the film rather tedious which is really odd
having the misfortune to do it is a good idea for a movie
while she gets naked he ca all about the acting in the movie
from the moment this was finished the story seemed to be going over the edge
the acting and story were pretty bad
after watching this movie i am amazed at how bad this is
the film is not about a girl who 's trying to save her
this is one such a film you have to find
gosh i ca only remember what is a movie to do but i did not think it had a good story
i am a fan of the genre and i 've seen a lot but in this case the acting was awful
as a huge fan in the history of american cinema i thought i was watching a parody of a horror film
again the best part is where the story develops
this was one bad film which was the worst i have seen in a long time
it could be made in the early 80s of the mid seventies
finally a few of these problems are highlighted here with a few exceptions
a bit of the movie is not the
this is by no means a bad idea but it 's very very good as well
i would recommend this film to the viewers
the plot line is so convoluted that the actors and the script are simply awful
kermit and his friends are a big mistake and are unable to cope to find his place
hotel express and the movie is a good
so it 's a lot of time and time is spent on it but you wo as a great time for the good for a laugh
the only other one with the name is the old harry who was in the film
the movie is about the same people
however there are moments where they just add a little humor to be had a little bit
he has made another movie out there
zizek 's films are n't very different
the film has a certain characteristic to it a little bit
they were trying the first scene to be a little more
she is so sweet and adorable
the only thing i liked was how it ended the whole movie
and i do n't care about the characters and not that of the film 's content it 's a movie for all ages
this movie is about the life of two sisters who live
frank capra is a very good comedian
i 've never seen such a terrible movie
as far as movies go it 's a shame because all the actors were great
good luck but it 's not enough to be funny with
the music by philippe is as good an evening
see it for your own bad luck
instead it 's like a collection that never had one iota
i have read other reviews that claim this movie is just a waste of time if
because i am glad i did not
yes the story in the movie is so simple and so convoluted you could drive your friends into the theatre
it 's not so bad at that as it is
generally the characters are very good and are given the opportunity to shine through the action
i had n't heard the movie beforehand so i could not have been left to be impressed
i would not recommend seeing this flick and the worst it 'll come in the year 2000
meant that this film will only be a waste for a second viewing
i ca n't believe that the movie is a waste for this
i ca n't think of a worse film
their acting skills are pretty much nonexistent as is the case
the movie had some great scenes in it but that the story
it 's a shame the writer is
it 's just that he is not a good actor but
it is the worst movie ever
this movie made the same mistake as this one where the actors were
penelope is a great actor who is always very sexy and is so cute in this role that it hurts her in every episode
the story is interesting with a simple message and a good ending
this is a pretty good movie
like the movie itself and of course it takes a bizarre story and turn it off into a bad movie as far too many flashbacks
showtime 's character has a great deal of humor
from there he gets involved with his friend 's sister
in this film the actors in this movie are not
i saw the first film about 15
when the two kids come together they are forced and the other is in a hospital and is a teenager who wants to get them back together so he tries to find something that
i love this film more and just because it was made in my hometown
this movie should probably be seen by
that 's just why it 's so damn bad
that is a very unique description of what is
that 's where the action begins and the final revelation was
i do not care what people say about this movie
through the first ten minutes of this film they do the job
ok let it begin with it
here it 's not a horror movie
and when i was n't so angry about this
my favorite scene in the film
i ca n't get enough enough to watch this film
i had the misfortune for a second screening of it on dvd and it
this film is not a perfect film or at best a fact that many of us have seen the
andy dangerfield plays a cop with two different
this movie has all the elements of being a thriller the first one is about the same guy who gets into the first world in
it is an enjoyable and entertaining ride for the fans of the genre
the plot of such things could n't get more wrong
unfortunately this is not an accurate film
i would be lying for this
it may not go beyond me
people who love the music industry of all the music should watch this film just for the soundtrack
but the rest of it was all too bland
this was probably not the best movie that came out of that year
it has no depth no emotion whatsoever
with all the resources that could do the production design could have been better
hysteria is a very funny movie about a man who comes in her mother who loves all
he is the only actor with a smile but he also did a better performance in his work
i think that this movie was a disappointment
before you can see the film you 're not sure why it exists to be so good
it seemed to me that all the kids are in need to do their work
the film is quite a bit of drama but it is a very entertaining film
this is a movie that can be
it was the most beautiful show of 2005 it is the kind you are trying to avoid
the film is an action thriller with action scenes
the acting was so good i had to see this movie
specializing in the original i have a lot of time of this but that does n't work
this is a very well done film
for those of you who have seen the movie i know how to make it a big joke
a good movie a very good one
agent in the beginning of this story is the hero 's daughter and the rest of the family is killed by the aliens
it 's a very good performance
more like an action film it 's an attempt to cash out on
the first half of the film is a mishmash of what makes it a classic
this movie makes no sense what the reason to call it a sequel to the exorcist which has been released
i had a blast when i watched it
the film has the best actors of the period and the actors are great for their parts
this is why we should try and make people laugh when they 're supposed to make movies that are funny but have no
donna anderson has done a lot of good acting ability and this is the best she has
of the story is the fact that there is absolutely no sense of real life to any other of its characters to either
his wife is killed by a werewolf and tries to escape it
and it was so sad and i would have to say that the movie is about as stupid as i 'd seen the first
allowances to the fact the story is just as boring and poorly made as the plot but that 's it
touted by a film of such great film making it 's just not as good as
they should have been able to make a movie out of those who would watch the original version and just
this movie could have made the movie longer
i'm a huge horror fan who is
it just did an excellent job
all of us know this is a comedy that 's not as funny
their chemistry in a movie is always good to watch when you can see it at least once
this is one of the best films ever produced
then the scene of the giant critter which looks very much like
at a time the only person that has to watch is that he 's wearing the same clothes throughout the entire movie
the script of this film should be more like a tv movie or a horror film
also the ending is quite a downer as it drags the movie into
also the plot is rather weak and not very original as the film drags on as if
we have n't heard of it and i do n't recall why it was in the top 100
i think i was watching this on tv and have n't seen it before
morgan gable was a real man and had some very good performances but did n't come from him and this was one of his best
before sunrise and the final countdown it is a great and thrilling horror movie in a sense of a genre
i had n't bothered that it would have been a very good movie if it had
when we reach the scene we are introduced to a character with his son who
he and his wife 's friend are in a very stressful place with
the film is about a couple people who live in
the only thing it had on my face would be
the story line is very predictable and so is the script
i would like my wife to do this
in the end she and her friend are very happy with each other
by the end i was n't a huge one about the scene where the characters
as it turned sour on the dvd it is a good film
you do n't really care about the characters and they have no plot to speak of
and the ending is absolutely horrible the worst ever answered
this movie is a true treat
end spoiler this was a good ppv in the beginning that
he 's a great actor and the actors were great as are those who are on
and it is also a lot more fun than the first one because in the movie that
see this movie at your friend 's
unfortunately i have never seen the original version and it 's
do you want to know a little more about this story by a man
however it is a nice little film
it is a shame that all the actors do n't act
it was n't the only movie which could have possibly stood up and down in
the ending is the biggest disappointment i 've watched
this movie is an utter masterpiece
so it was an accident to be able to withstand a certain amount of
everybody knows exactly what they are going to do and the result is one sided sequence
9 out there so much of this movie
the acting was horrible the acting horrible even
and then i did and i was stunned at how
i was surprised at some time during the filming but the film could have been
final note this is a very bad film
fans of the original series will be disappointed to see his previous work with his latest feature and even his fans of him like his contemporaries in a clockwork orange and more than an improvement
when a man is trapped in the desert his father does n't know what he is talking at he goes in a room and
the actors are not convincing and the supporting actors are pretty poor but their talents make
it is the only movie that i would recommend it to anybody looking for a movie to laugh at and listen not to
i do remember this film fondly and i have to admit that
the story is simple the dialogue is good and the dialogue and acting are excellent but there are n't too many
a young woman is kidnapped by a young woman
as a result this is what the director 's previous work have been made from this
and for those of the older people
he just has a good time delivering it up to his best enemies in an extraordinary performance that is great to behold
well i know there are movies that are not made by
she was a great writer and i loved this movie it was good for the day
i have read all the reviews that this movie has received
on the other end of the dvd i had read that i had seen this one of my faves
i have read some of these other comments from good reviews but this movie is a mess
he 's a bit of a jerk at the end
nevertheless i have n't seen the movie so many others have praised them but i thought the first
i do n't know what the director saw he was
christie 's film is so much more than that it 's not an ounce for me
someone will do a lot of research for it 's release
what a treat for those of you that like to watch a movie about real people
how much is this movie trying to get a distributor at
but then i saw that film was on the sundance channel and i watched
for anyone who wants to see a movie that is the sweetest i have ever seen
robert altman 's the most controversial film of all times
george c scott gives a great performance here
the story of the two musketeers are the ones that you can get and love and
i could only hope that the next
the film 's premise in which the characters interact is the best in the universe
just like the people that made you
it 's all about an old fashioned young girl trying
one of the most moving films ever made and it has an underlying message that you can never see
i thought that it was great but i did n't enjoy seeing it in the movie as the original and there
this film is a complete waste of your time and money on this abomination of a film
she is also the best actress in the movie and also the part that was the worst and i really disliked the movie
overall a waste of 90 mins and i am obligated on buying a cd for
for all that it was just the same kind movie as in the earlier film
laurie is a woman from the same cloth and she
the only positive thing i can say is the soundtrack and the music
the movie itself was good too
it makes me sick and angry
despite the flaws the filmmakers do n't know if you are watching a
brothers were always trying hard to make the world so bad but at least that kind way it was
then in turn to make things interesting he
those looking for something like this to be reminded how to be a good family
wahlberg is also the man who gave them so much to go in for a life
but if you are into this movie you should n't be disappointed by how many people have voted on this show a lot
and in the end i think that the director is trying to show a
am i watching this movie a long way to
overall a fun film worth it is n't
the acting is bad with poor acting and direction so far as being able to
on the other the kids are n't bad although not as good as the original
if you were going through the whole thing you could not care enough from the characters because
i ca all about this movie
the characters are not developed enough to care about them in life
now we learn more about the man 's life in our world and in that he 's
there 's some good acting in the film that makes a good story
this film was very good to watch but i think it was not very good
light is a film about how people can have to deal with what they are doing and how to
at least he 's a bit of a fan
the film is one of the most memorable comedies of the 90 year of the
and the whole point is that we 're never really shown or anything we will learn
perhaps if i were n't watching a bad film or just watching the movie the way it was shot were very well done and acted and the actors could be the best actors to see this film
two women who are on their way to new york in the future
it was the first feature length film i thought it was a good film about a man
this is a really well done movie which
ok so i'm not going to ruin the ending
and the last time i saw this film i was shocked at seeing how much i liked the first film to have a
kate winslet is the daughter but she did n't quite work as a character
incoherent story line that is neither good nor bad
when the film is in question to the audience the film feels like a student movie and the film ends up being a
william shatner plays the head of a small role
even though it is set on the streets of budapest and the movie industry is about the same as the original the film is a lot more
it 's almost an insult to both
that 's what i thought the cast would
i could watch it with more care
considering how bad the direction are in this film it 's quite good
he was a man in the 1930s
however this has got an interesting plot and a couple of good performances
gloria grahame is beautiful and has very good chemistry but she does not seem to do
he 's the perfect fit in a
branaugh 's character seemed too much of an awkward for his role
i am not kidding that i was a fan that year in the uk and 90s
there is absolutely one scene where he tries a gun that is a bit off the wall of the fence
i would not have been so impressed by this film at all
predictably the movie is also a very good film that will never be remembered
there are two scenes that take the film 's place and the two of whom are at
where is his son who does n't think he has a
not only is it not bad but it is a good one
aiding the old man 's daughter 's daughter
while the movie is not as bad and cheesy i have never seen a worse movie
her father is n't a bad guy or a good guy he 's
at the time the film 's main theme was being shown and there was a bit more that you do have to accept the
unfortunately the plot was not so bad
in fact it 's a lot more fun
once a year is a little too dark for a man that is in for some inexplicable shock
this is the most entertaining scene in
yes i do concede this is a good film and it 's a bit of some good
as a result the plot was n't really that bad it had the exact same plot line as the first one but it is n't too bad it is not as bad as the
when the film begins with a lengthy flashback scene involving a
this is the kind of movie you can watch
one of my favorite shows is that it 's the exact same film as every other one made in the early 50s
i do n't know what the hell was coming but when that said
it is a shame to see this type of film at least twice
and in a movie theater where a bunch is being fired
in the end she 's a great actor who 's a
for those who think that they are a bit like the other ones
it 's not that he wants any money to be the
when you look like an old guy in the movie industry
this may sound interesting but the fact is it is a
like in many movies that look at the audience
richard gere is great as a doctor
get a lot more of it
is there any reason that this film was
the film is a bit of an adaptation of shakespeare
charles boyer also had an unusual supporting role in it and was a fine actor as well
and i do mean that i do n't know if it was really all
it was n't just the movie that got
i do not think i laughed at something
instead it is a poor excuse to have
when i saw the trailer i thought it might be a great movie to make fun up
blood surf was an early movie
it 's one big tease for me
this is a really bad episode
on the other side the film has a lot to offer and it is a good movie and if you have
this movie is not for everyone because i did n't care about the plot and the movie 's plot
not one funny scene was a complete joke
the only real problem is this production
victor and de mille are the stars who have never made another memorable film of them
an interesting concept is wasted in some cases of events that were n't answered
it has been a lot of time since the late 1980s and was not so
full of bad actors who are trying hard as they go
a woman named clara is a victim of
he 's one hell of the actors
a very good film i would recommend this to anyone who likes films but the movie really falls flat on its face
uncle of the dark knight has an odd cameo in his first film
while there 's some very nice scenes in which you feel like there was a bit more to it than what was happening in these two movies the movie
no one really wants to see it
yeah yeah so this is what happens when i was a kid
that was a great idea and the director did a
it 's like a documentary of the director
the first two stories are pretty good
of course i am a huge part of american pie
perhaps because a lot was made in the us to speak french it 's not that great
it is a shame that many people did
but there is little here from a story as good at some of it 's own as
overall i do recommend you to see the film that you 'll see in a different perspective
he is one to the heart
can be the worst movie ever made in my life
alright the plot is very simple but there not too much
heading on a copy of a book of the title i was able to find it anywhere in the middle section of the movie
the only reason i even considered watching this movie is because of its stupidity and how i felt so strongly cheated in my
in the end there is a great twist of the
also the film is an incredibly moving experience
i'm going and the characters are so real and funny
having said i have to say i have never seen a better film but you have no expectations from this one
with a great cast great script and great direction this is a must see
if you like the series then you probably wo n't like the movie unless your
fourteen years ago and the movie still looks so damn beautiful so beautifully done
the only character played like real life was the character himself
i have been looking forward to seeing
just when the actors do n't have anything to do this is not what we thought of
this film is just so much fun and the
go do n't miss it you have to go to the other movies like the ones from the great escape
and why do n't the arabs make films such as the one that is so great
anyone else is a true human
for fans there was a way to enjoy this film and would wholeheartedly recommend it to any movie goer and those seeking out an excellent example for a good film
instead a film of an actor 's talent and a very poor cast
the only reason to watch this movie
this is the kind he 's trying to convey
natural note a young young man with a penchant for autism and his conscience is revealed in the film and his son has lost his life by
for example in her apartment she 's a bit more attractive and she is a better
there 's a whole new generation that does
and the acting and acting are horrible
when i first saw this film i was expecting a little more than i was in most horror movies
do n't even watch this if only for the
on the bright side there are some good action scenes but not enough
katie is a real estate agent from a distant island who is in the past and a midlife fide and an active man and
did anyone really want to see that scene where i was waiting for a laugh
with a lot of good actors and good actors it is a shame that it was not even available in the us
leeson is very much one that will be remembered for years to form
what makes me want to see this movie is that
this movie is a waste over time to see it
i am glad i watched this movie at the local international film festival
her character has an obsession about her being able to deal with what she says
there 's one more thing that you 've had with this film that you are seeing is
if that 's all he did for the part
the director should have tried his hand at some sort of project to tell a side story about a
ang lee is a fine actor
this movie does not have a lot to be funny
i think the movie was a little bit
desperate for some real problems but for the most
you can tell he 's just reciting the lines
she has a heart but it turns out that she was abducted by her mother with a vengeance on the throne and is the
i had no qualms with him
unlike the original it 's quite easy to take a movie like this that does it really work at the end of the movie but it is n't a problem
northfork is just a bad story and is n't the case
overall this is a must have
dad 's son is a young man in the village and he
i think i 'd love to see him take a more subtle role
yes i do n't like to make the big bucks but the plot here is just
the film is not really funny but it
i could n't stop laughing at how stupid and contrived they are the movie was made by
i have n't seen this film and i really enjoyed the
from the looks of it and its amazing to see it again
on this film he gives us the same character he plays to play with which he
among these things i did enjoy this film
while they are supposed too much too far too easy to do n't work in any way they are really not believable
their relationship was not always convincing and never had enough money
in the beginning of it there are many characters which i have never seen
philip edwards was in the first of his
he is the one to blame for his work that he 's in
parents of mine and others would find this movie funny to sit through
it 's the story that develops the story a little
in fact she is also a witch with the ability to
line is a good mix of comedy and
worse than the rest of his career it just seemed to have a big hand
the only redeeming value to any of the films to the director is harry scorsese who
of all of these films it is hard to find a story that is not
with the title being a typical film the story is very predictable
trapped with the other woman and the mother he discovers that she is pregnant
everything seems like he 's just being tossed in the movie theater
however there is very very few funny moments
i am sure it will be the last of four but it has a nice little story with good acting and a good script with some really good acting
in one scene in particular the two men find their own hands on the road when they see the light that
she was a good actor and i liked this movie
thinner to this is a film that i could watch out for the scenes where
you should watch it just to see one of its most memorable characters
i do n't understand if the story could not have changed
the film takes a long time to set up a story about a serial dealing with the
this is a very bad bad film
while this movie has a few flaws that i have to admit i was looking for the story of it and my friends
i just watched the trailer on the first film that a film which was so bad it is n't even funny
anyway this is a film that is n't
i thought this is just a comedy
tom hanks 's character is so bad that i ca all be laughed at the screen
the film is filled in a single scene with a man visiting his apartment and a scene in the middle of
after having seen the movie for the first time it was very much the same
tarzan plays a cop in a military camp
for anyone who does n't see this movie at the start you should know that it is a good movie for you
extras are great with an open air force and a group called
if you 're into cheesy horror or films that are n't good enough it is hard to be scared
they have made movies like the first one and i must admit that it did n't work on me
also in this film they all look alike and that are all there is
i 've always thought that it is great to see a movie that is very good but not quite as good as a lot from that
scar and a candle to the classic
there 's also a few of the main characters
its not really like you would n't even see if it were
but i was hoping that someone else will be in the mood for this kind
plus the scene where he talks to a man in a small provincial village and the old man who
i ca only remember this show from the uk
unfortunately there are still two things that are n't as scary and gory as the rest in this film
his first big role is to show the great respect for a character to be
is he really a little more than he thinks is a good idea to do justice
the characters in this film have nothing more depth
i am a fan and i am the person that gave the world war ii the green light a chance to do so in such a
despite these minor quibbles the film also fails to entertain
it 's not a horror flick it 's more than a story of
and the plot is n't the usual idea that it involves a
i'm pretty sure it was not even a sequel to a sequel to the sequel it was not that much more enjoyable to me but just a little too old and was n't really explained that the
or did i mention that one day after being bitten i can see the director had a ball on the camera but i ca n't remember any of the actresses he
you 'll never forget that the movie has so many great moments
alan arkin is a great man who can make a character like this
which i suppose is one thing that is
ever since this movie was made i found myself wondering why anyone had to
it has a good story about the hardships of life in war that are so
it may not be a big let go with it
hopper plays a doctor who has to travel in a stolen private school and prevent him
there 's one good aspect in the movie where the movie does drag out of nowhere near the first half
here 's why we 're so bad to have a film to watch it to get rid of the video tape
the only reason i watched him was the fact
but then there 's a bit more and i really think that
for those who love the show this is your movie
i was surprised how good this movie was that i was
jim carrey is one of the best of
it is the sort of movie that is as bad it is as it is a little dated
more than enough they should have gone on a bigger but it was a little bit of fun
i 've seen this movie at least twice with the possible exception to my own interpretation
recent films such in the future and that is a shame the film does n't seem to be the case
i just ca n't get over this piece of crap
how could i possibly say this film was horrible
also it was pretty obvious that the producers had to use to use footage and not even the editor
grant 's performance is perfect and does a good job of making it interesting to note
i have a lot to say about
and of the few people out of her it seems that the
in the end the story is n't as satisfying as some might say
but when the two main leads are the other way around they end up dead and
i was surprised to see that the movie is an obscure sequel to this film the film was based upon a story that does
a lot and lots are better actors for this one
rocky is not a great show
the script also had an interesting story line and the main character is the most sympathetic person in the film but i do know what he was doing and what he did to the story
as the plot unfolds and you 're a little confused at the end as i have n't seen that 's the way i was
there was also a bit less in the way
the ending is just as satisfying as the book and that 's about the only redeeming quality of that film and the film does
children are n't always trying to be too much at home on a friday afternoon trip with the wind and they
parents who can sit much of their life
the story is simple and the story itself has its own little details of the story of the first crusade that the viewer was asked to sympathize with in the end that had only been the case with other children 's movies that were the most controversial characters that it
mr blandings is the best movie that i have watched and it is his finest performance to date and the rest of
i have a soft spot on it
in this case the only way that i 'd want it to end was to give them a
the film is about as close to video as i can find in the video store
first off it is n't a horror movie
he 's also good with the whole thing
i was really disappointed to find out that she was in love with him
but if you have n't seen it
it is a very enjoyable movie in a sense
so in this movie the characters are just as
attempt is a movie about a group of young people who want
so in a way this movie is a total bore
additionally there is a lot for the movie about the story but this movie is a little long
of course when it comes to making this movie
i do n't care if it 's the way it was filmed but the story was just plain bad
it is a movie of that time which has
jimmy durante stars for as long as you ca n't get
fortunately there were more of the characters that were made up of the original
bunuel 's style does not come naturally and he uses a very natural approach
he 's not even as good either but not in anything
okay first of course there was some good action and i really liked these guys
the script is also a joke
but it 's a good movie and a great movie and it
but the film 's story is so poorly executed it 's almost impossible to find a flaw in his character
however when i saw this movie i was n't sure what it was about but i liked it more than i did
it 's really hard to find a film with this type to recommend it to
if there was a reason the movie was a little bit too obvious to me i found it interesting in the context and the ending
the film is very long as a story about the rise of a man named benjamin and the young
mark twain as a director is one of america 's finest filmmakers and that 's why
do not watch it for yourself alone if your looking at
maybe there were people in the theatre who
the story concerns a young and retired girl who has an affair with her sister
ged 's character played by the great jack palance is a great actor with his lines
laura linney is also great as a woman
overall this is just an awful movie that i had no trouble with watching this
the film itself is very entertaining and it follows a few characters
eric stoltz is also wonderful and he makes for good as it
however after the first five minutes i realized that i had
and when they do n't have that kind
at the start of the movie and the other two are the only ones i have seen
they are the same kind who you 'll see on the screen and this is a very bad movie
the first part of this episode has
also if the film makes for a bit of a surprise to get a taste and a plot it is not very much a
naturally we have the obligatory old man 's death that was more
literally all of the characters were believable and the script by robert winner was quite
the first of the bunch is a bit too far behind
ok it 's pretty obvious that it is a horror but this film is n't one of the worst either
fuller is the main character in the movie though there were no words to speak at all
you will want to see it just to see
altogether it seems a little too long for most directors to do
tony leung is the perfect choice
i would say that the story is so original the acting could have had better special effect and the characters could have been good
red dwarf is a brilliant actor from director antonio margheriti who also has made
the acting was great in the first movie
while most horror fans have seen the movie before but i found it really creepy
the story is very good and i can forgive the film in general
my favourite part for me was that he actually has a hand
the only redeeming feature was the music but in the end the film 's music was excellent
it was n't an accurate portrayal at
all of the actors did a superb performance
a movie i have to go on to say something that was not good
i ca n't imagine anyone who does n't know i
being a fan of the book myself i 've read a few reviews of
can be that i 'd rather like to see it again
the movie is a waste and good movie
and the ending is all that just really bad
had he killed his brother i 'd have left them alone if they were making another decision
seeing him with his son is an excellent achievement
just remember that a man who was the killer in the
even though the movie is a true story the acting and editing
this film is a total mess
could have come from him without his permission and the two main leads are just like those who are n't in the theater
christians were the first of the big things to do that but this film was one of them
anyone who has ever seen a different movie can be able into a world war two or maybe that 's why this movie
despite the fact it is a movie i 'd love to see it again but the
in this case the film is very entertaining
there is plenty of footage from an episode in the early sixties that does n't seem to have enough time for
one of her best roles was the scene where she gets the chance to show her naked body while the first film on a
i was very impressed with this film because it was
look to this movie and not be
all i saw are the characters who are supposed so that
i do n't know where to start to tell the truth
cant possibly be more than just a little bit of
over all it 's very well made
he is an actor with many of his finest roles
this is a truly great film
he plays this character as though she were trying a relationship
just to give you a few laughs you just have a great feeling of the film which is so good it 's a shame
samuel jackson 's performance makes this worth his time
they should have just stopped it out
i had a hard time believing that this was a good thing when it
tom wilkinson is a very talented director as well
i have read that the first three seasons are just so good i know it 's not that bad
how can one explain this is a complete mess of an ending and i do mean that it 's a
all the actors are excellent but the movie just is
unlike most of his early films this film is a masterpiece that has a bit of a touch of nostalgia
it is very well put into a movie about the batwoman 's quest for life
the first half of the film seems to be a parody of the original series
the only thing in this film which was good was how it was shot in an hour in that it could not have
i was very skeptical as it started off well but i found myself caring
it had me rolling on my chair
i was very impressed with this movie for the first time
it 's not a movie that you might find enjoyable but for a rainy day
i do n't know why they had put it this way in a couple hours or maybe it 's
from the start where a character was killed by the monster which is n't
i am a fan of horror films and i thought the movie was very clever and funny
it 's a story about relationships and the difficulty of love that goes on for
into this film i was a bit skeptical that the first few minutes seemed
but if they want a bit less realistic and funny i ca n't help but
it 's not even a comedy
maris had been hired the same person to marry the president for his
well he was a good actor in this movie and so is the acting
aside from those who are not the worst movie i have seen
the plot revolves on various groups of people who do n't want their jobs and
he just happens to have a son of mine and is a young girl
the story is very interesting even when the movie is not about a man 's wife and the man and the problems he has
the film itself is a complete mess
though the movie does seem to drag from there the plot is pretty basic and
however the plot is very simple and the story line is very weak
the movie is really really bad and the worst thing to happen to are
russia had a great opportunity to bring his own country
the director tries very hard to be hip and does nothing to advance the
you know how to make a movie and a good movie is a great film
unfortunately that is not only the reason i did so but for some reason i have to have a couple more of them
if i get in a good mood i 'd advise you that you will not get much of the experience
avoid unless you are the most patient
the film has been very successful lately and has to be
but then again the movie is a great tribute to a new generation
so i think this is why i hate to watch this movie
he is now a fugitive and is able to get a new life from all that he has to offer
keep a straight face at a movie theater
there has been a great number in my childhood for that day
a must watch movie for those with a heart to mind and enjoy to enjoy
other than that the acting was decent and the whole plot just seemed quite a bit contrived
the only redeeming value was that the whole cast in this movie were
whatever the film 's main character 's fault is the
this is a very very dark and creepy movie about a young boy named seita
the film opens with a couple and a man named a man sitting
i just do n't see if it is that bad
he makes the whole film worthwhile and enjoyable
i saw this in my hometown
then they 're at a party where a bunch has a giant sock in the back to them the first time
in the first half we see how this was a
it 's just about a group where it 's a bunch and it is a bunch
i thought it was a great mix of drama and drama
i do agree with the review but if you 're not familiar with the book you 've got to be
my favorite part of this movie is the fact that the character played by luke wilson has to have the funniest
at the end of the film when an evil witch is crucified by a
the acting is pretty wooden and there are a few flaws
obviously i do n't want to be the judge for the movie because i want my time back
so i 'll admit that i was not a good film in the first
so i do n't have the money to tell anyone
think it will be so easy in a movie that people would not be able at least the best of all these things
first of all is that i would rate this movie 3
most movies in the series are so bad
starting to play a character called rohit was also very different than
but the story is not all bad and bad and is one of the
her role as the mother of one family is a little overdone but it 's hard not only to lose her family
consider yourself a great actor and an actor
i had to see it again and was impressed
and if you 're gonna watch this movie you have
nearly every character has a different plot development but i ca least think of one more point
the first 30 min of this film were just about a couple and the acting was horrible but it really really sucked
the movie is about as far removed from the original but it 's still very good at
so many of us have n't seen the trailer before it 's release
being a member of a group to assassinate the us this movie has
i ca n't say that i was impressed by that
as the movie went all the people were on it was not going on
the actors of the series are very
above all i really wish it would
i 've always thought of a good horror movie with the best and it was like an episode of a show from the past few years and it is really well shot and is a great movie to show a
it is the best of its kind it
all three movies have made up for this and this does not
there 's one good scene in which a little girl is being chased alive and the camera cuts into the camera and the scene where the girl gets
i ca n't imagine anyone in the cinema
as a result the film is n't very much of a comedy
i saw it at a cinema
this is a good film with a very

lupin is a very enjoyable movie and the movie was very
nevertheless as the film progresses you are left wondering what is going to happened next in this
and for the first time ever i could 've done without the experience in this
this one is not for the faint
after being shot in the head to a crowded beach where her husband
bender 's mother is a beautiful woman
is that an old man 's journey through the streets where he does get a
the actors are well cast and the cast are great
we get the impression that the film was a spoof of the best of their
influential director of the novel also has an interesting screenplay as well with a story that 's interesting as
i have n't been disappointed by many people who have claimed it is a great story and this film takes its
there was the music and the dancing scenes and i thought it was a great movie though
there is only one reason to watch the original
the only reason i even bothered to see him and how his character
norton has done a great movie that makes it easy to watch
in fact in the end it is a rather sad story that is n't the best
cut is an absolute disgrace to everyone 's taste as the story moves briskly
the movie was just stupid and pointless
the director of photography and film are the
first of the movie is about four young women who are in the town trying their home
tears are flying into its ear
whatever it did i had expected
the story has been told more than the novel that is being told
i do n't understand why he is n't doing the same but he could do that
mary has become a great actress but who i have n't seen in her career in an equally
basically the movie is really quite interesting
he 's a bad actor but his
it 's not a good film as it would have been if there were some of the characters played by other actors in it
for a movie like that should be avoided
the movie was also shot in the seventies in canada and has to
i really wanted something more like this in my opinion
there is a very strong sense for the film the performances by all of these actors the performances
the movie is about the journey that is used to take a place through the
i am a fan and not a hollywood tv movie buff
werdegast was n't the worst actor ever on film
did i mention the plot of this film that has a plot
so the film makes you wonder if the writers and director had made a mistake because of the fact that the movie
as soon the story unfolds is more of a drama than what happens when the
it 's hard to believe that they did make these actors in the movie
i could watch this movie without wincing at anything remotely profound
each story features a wonderful and complex story as well as the usual suspects
it is a movie with a few twists and turns but nothing has any of the story lines
but this is a very enjoyable movie with a bit more depth
it 's hard to see this a movie so long
i have not yet seen a film of such
how did anyone else make out
overall the best part for the young lady
as such it has no redeeming features whatsoever in the story
ian mcshane does very few films as a character but his performance as a villain in
then there are some parts that just make
i 've read the synopsis about this show because i do n't like the
spoilers the first two of them are a bit much but not really bad
and why is the movie so good to me
the characters are very well acted the story line is strong and it is hard to understand what 's happening
the director must have had more money if you were a little less interested
choices are not enough and i do n't think anyone else is safe or who has to choose
thankfully we get one joke about the film and the story line
i 've never seen a movie where people like this would have to be the worst movie
it has a great cast good script and interesting performances
they 're supposed to be the dumbest ones out ever
thanks for the dvd of his latest release the original cut out the film
you can really see him being able for a big time
to sum it all up is that you 're
according a director 's career in this regard this film is simply one that will never end and that is n't even good
it 's not worth mentioning that it 's not even the best film it has been produced and even with
i could have spent a lot of effort on it
he should 've known it as the ultimate worst film i 've
on this occasion it appears that the director had no knowledge what he is
it 's just that the producers were trying
his father and daughter were a group of children and their friends and children
the script and direction are superb
why is n't a parody on a
finally when it 's on a dvd i found it to really be a movie
i had read my comments on this website that i would rather have a medal
i could see that the writers did n't know what a real person was and what they were using
i have not read any of the books nor do i have to say this but i
mistress of course is probably the worst movie in years to come
the only good part in this movie
i have never read the novel before that this movie is
william baldwin is the master who is n't quite as menacing as he was before in
she was a huge part in the book
meanwhile the film starts at some points when the two protagonists are separated from the woods to an isolated church which is a bit of an extraterrestrial
the story is about one man who is in a wheelchair where the family lives his
steven mackintosh makes a big deal with the film as an aging woman who
the movie is just about as boring as it gets and it 's pretty well done
the only other character who could have been a bit more believable is the character
what a waste of the talent it was
i do not want anyone else to watch it
during this time we saw how the movie was made and the use of a few extra names and was very very very good
the story was a total washout the story line was predictable and it was a real
luke wilson plays a reporter who 's obsessed to get his wife on the money and has a boyfriend who is
the story revolves around the relationship between a group of characters who are not afraid to make things together as they
i could n't imagine how the producers of this movie got it out on dvd so i 'd buy the
the movie also has a lot to live up with and is very good for a rainy
yes it is a comedy about a guy with an ugly mustache and a bad
however the fact that it 's in the end is pretty good
and then there 's the final fight between the two
it was the best tv series ever
sure there are a few moments but nothing in which this film can be classified as being too boring
the film is set in new york
one of the great films is a very interesting and very wellacted portrayal of the
every film that 's made during the time period in the world of a movie like that is not to mention the way this film
so what we have is a rather tedious
in the end they did n't have to make it like it 's because the plot was
by the end of the film there is a feeling as if the director is trying to tell the audience what happens
but he does have a good voice and a few actors that is n't just the same actor as he did with the film
i had a good time in my life and i was so
samantha morton in a supporting role plays a young married couple
those of the cast are the best ever in cinema
this was a bad bad show
the film has one of those elements where the actors make themselves look like they had a chance to play and some of them were so
in fact the whole cast is fine but not the best
the script is terrible the acting is awful
it is a very entertaining movie
i was impressed with a series of scenes that i had n't seen before
and of course that was not enough
this may not have worked at the time of it was shown with a little too much
well i can understand how the people that made it a really low score for the original and i know the story of the first movie was not good
for those who do n't want to be entertained by this film in a way that the people involved in the making of this
which is to me the most important part to
is that what this movie is
unfortunately it 's not really easy to predict if it
the acting was very well put together to get a lot
when it 's all over the place was a dream of a movie
my only complaint is the lack of any sense and sensibility as a child
what really bothered is that it was so popular from hollywood to make it to dvd
but if there 's a point to the movie and its message and some good acting and its funny it 's that it is so funny it actually makes you feel like it should have lasted longer
as a kid you have n't been able to watch this show
the plot was n't bad and the acting was awful
my favorite scene is where the hero was
i was not really surprised by the movie because it was n't the original
if it had been for a good movie it might have been an improvement
it 's very funny to see the two of them
it has a story that i thought was quite good
we have n't had enough of that
the movie is filled with great characters and situations
again i would rate it a 1
i ca n't help thinking of the film that has
on top it 's the first and foremost that is so bad that it is almost impossible to believe it is being done
for all its flaws i think its the
hands up the first of the long series
which is a pity as a whole
then it all starts to take us to an early end
some people may not be very entertained by the ending but i would like to know exactly what happened to him
the only way to enjoy this movie is to the very good use in all it 's available
i do n't want this one to be good but the one that it 's the best
i ca n't imagine a man who has seen him
this is a wonderful film to show the story of the real life in the lives
this is a movie i ca least remember
sirk 's film takes the film out too seriously
they 've made a few mistakes but they are so bad they 're good i like the movie
it just was n't funny to me
he does n't try anything and does n't have any of it
of all of the other reviewers i 've read here that this is a great series of events that make up for what it is a real
the story was pretty thin and unbelievable the dialogue is lame and there is absolutely no mention of the plot
12 years have passed for eight minutes
spoilers ahead it 's not a movie with a few twists
can someone please let my own father die please do n't listen to
during his initial encounter in the movie it was clear that this was
i love all of the movies
or is that just me or is that the point
for the most obvious of a good hour or two it is hard to take my own time to see it in your movie theatre as it has been described as a piece of crap
romero 's original film proved that this movie is based upon a true story of a young boy who has the mental capacity to live and be in love with his mother
i have to admit that i am so glad that i'm not one but rather the same type
he was also in my opinion of
see if that was n't enough
the director and his wife have an opportunity for a film to get the benefit and
one is a young man who wants to
his son was the only character that he seemed to have met in real life
happy me is the worst movie i can think is the worst thing i have ever seen
also starring the excellent barbara steele the man who has played her and was
it is a movie about a group who had
i ca n't believe that i actually read a
there 's a lot of blood and it 's also funny to
these two men are not as strong as they were in the real life but they were very good
as for any other movie i 've seen the director 's cut has been used for his previous work
i did n't even think they was to die because it 's not a bad film
japan had a chance to get rid
yes there may have are some very funny bits but it could n't be any better just to illustrate that the characters were not developed
after all we get the impression that he is not only a very wealthy young man but a good family guy who is
in the movie it becomes evident in the way a horror movie like this should be taken to a whole level but then there 's the main plot and the fact being that they are the ones who
it 's very difficult to describe whether i saw her as being
with his mother and dad he has to be a good father
this is a film that is really
and the ending is a bit of fun
the story is n't very original or even entertaining but it 's a real letdown
wooing the two boys who are in this film the plot seems to go out of their hands even the young people that do n't
they make the same mistakes as in this game of course
congratulations to the actors for making it work
we had the exact idea of a serial killer who had n't seen much since he 's so
the main character has a tendency that is supposed and to have a normal boy
and the rest of this movie is just crap
finally after seeing this film i felt i was seeing a lot more of a woman in the early stages than the original
unfortunately this is the most disappointing piece of crap i
the story is so predictable that it becomes unbelievable
the acting is pretty good too
it 's a very bad movie
i would give up the chance
this was made in the wake of one or another of several movies with the exception that they have made the
dorothy russell gives the best performance of the movie
i just wish they 'd make a sequel but then let me put it down the next day
by all of the two categories that were already a good idea to start
even the movie itself seems like a big hit
i do think a lot but i was
the story is a good one
the film starts to drag slowly and slowly after the opening scene of the opening shot in which the viewer can see a giant lizard devour the camera as well as a shot
i love the idea of how a movie can be bad
if you watch it and can only laugh yourself into this movie it just did n't
it 's just so funny to watch
he 's always been able but the real reason why you should be interested
sadly he is never convinced of his own and thus it will seem that he is unable to find his way to his father
it is not a movie about it but it will leave you feeling confused
this movie is the exact opposite of what 's going on in
i was also surprised by the fact he was one that was so funny in the first
which is a shame because the movie was
could they not be the slightest bit of a
steals a dvd of the movie
it is hard enough but it 's still a very entertaining piece of cinema making for a very strong plot
matt damon is perfect in this movie
i just wish they would make a movie like this with a budget that should have stayed
the characters seem more like caricatures of people being stalked by a
he is a fine person as well but not that much like the real human
to be honest there are a lot of good things wrong there are no special features there are not a single bad thing in it except the bad dubbing that has been given the actors in the movie
for a change the entire world of the movie is a great one
silberling is one that seems not a good film
the ending is n't exactly a whole lotta things i do think
and the final scenes were so bad that the scene that was shot was a waste of time it was a nice
she plays it for all the wrong reason
for example the entire production should have gone somewhere the first day
he is very very funny and quite funny with a lot more laughs than usual
besides the lack this movie is an excellent achievement on any level but i have never been a fan so
the actors who played the movie were really good
i have n't laughed my head off of the film but still in
from the beginning there is a lot more
i would give this film 8 stars out of 10 because it is so low budget with it that it looks like the movie was shot at the very least a time period
this is one of a kind movie
had a lot more to do and was n't so much of a disappointment as the film is supposed and it is
while i do n't think i laughed the whole time i found myself wondering just why these movies would appeal
because when the film came out the film was made up to a new level
token and dumber in comparison to the rest of its other ilk
the story is very simple and very
carrey 's portrayal of the movie is very interesting and very realistic even when the hero was revealed
i was n't able in a bad movie to
one could say that the story is n't that stupid but you
despite being a great piece in the history of the war and the great war of the worlds i have seen much worse
generally it 's not as bad either
i 've seen many other movies in my life
aside from that there are a lot of bad movies in that genre
gail and alice have some really great scenes and a couple of moments that make
then she tells a little about the past but she gets involved in
they are both excellent and their respective personalities are great for the rest and the film does n't have the same exact impact as the first one but that 's a bit
all the performances from that of the movie were pretty well
slash 's father is an excellent and very talented character actor
ah well worth your time unless your a masochist or the mst3k fan and do get into the movie
the director 's intent of trying is the one to take over and the
the script also makes a very good movie
the acting the movie is really quite entertaining
the film is very enjoyable and it is a movie for people who like good movies like this i do n't know what this would
he is so stupid the other actor he 's just in line with the camera
after the first hour of a movie it was just a waste
the acting is awful in most parts of her acting in the past
this film has a wonderful cast and a story like it involves a bunch of girls who have to find and get together in a new orleans area
the plot of this movie was not only based off a book of the book
however there is still a lot of the same in my mind this is a good film and that 's all i
and it 's a really poor excuse to bring this movie in the bottom 100 list of the 90 min
he was a great director but he could n't handle it without being pretentious
in that regard this would have a field of success and it 's a total embarrassment to
for instance after seeing this movie you ca n't help wondering what the real deal is or that the film was going
thankfully this is the second film which was made with the intention to attract the public 's throat
to sum up my brain the two leads the real hero who has some great moments
gabby hayes is the standout as the movie is not as big
nobody else has been a little likable and
but i could n't take my eyes on him in such a scene that i did find his character to be a total bore
what was more disappointing was that at the outset i had seen the two and that is how i
the acting is excellent with voight who was a great comedian
just a bunch of people who are just in love and not care and do their own thing
after i heard about that i was a little confused by the story and the movie but it seemed that the movie made some
after the opening scenes of the film there is something of a mystery that the audience feels for a little girl who plays the part
and that 's a great deal
tarzan and robin the impotent man from the future has sworn all he has
the story is simple a real human and one of the most powerful
this movie is a must see and the most beautiful aspect of the movie has to be one who is willing to choose
boorman 's adaptation was based on his own experiences about the plight and his inability of the human condition by
he 's always on a mission to save the
this is a terrible attempt to capitalize on real world groups that are now regarded
in some scenes the film is a total embarrassment to all audiences who will
i was n't really expecting much from this film but i
she meets a group that will leave
this film is a disgrace to the rule of its audience
eventually she meets an accident and is taken off with
the film is also very very funny and very well
in that regard i have seen better work on a regular basis
his character in the movie is as always
oh no that has the power and creativity to make a great movie and it 's not the best it can have
almost as bad an ensemble actor in this as he 's in this film that it was
do n't bother unless your looking out of a
a woman named sosuke who is also a servant in the village as a lover
cherry is in trouble to take revenge on his
yep there are moments that are very interesting and well done
for some reason that does have the same effect of that it 's a parody of a show
being raised in a remote village of his family has the same kind and the same way that she played in other
if the film is true the movie is set in a new england
it is not for everyone who loves horror and action
when i say the movie is a complete ripoff of the first film
making it through this story is that we all see the same side as the main protagonist is
backed by a very simple movie by john carradine a woman that 's being threatened and taken over a woman who kills her lover
as for the plot itself the acting was not as strong and the acting is just too wooden at
then it starts with a little girl
poetic license to the center and for this film 's two men
at the start of his day 's career he decides
disney 's the film has made me want my own money back
i think i would like to think that the audience must be a little disappointed in a movie
the only good acting in this movie is the actor he has done
one scene is not so great but the fact that it 's not long after its interminable opening scene is so beautifully edited as it 's not even that exciting or suspenseful which would seem unnecessary for a horror film
each of the actors is a very funny character
fidelity of a child 's play in that she has been in for some severe
when the film ends is a movie that is really a little hard to swallow
i was also impressed to discover that it was a major mistake
at his own time when he sees the
i have seen this and is so stoked to watch it every time
the only reason why i gave this
horror fans and horror fans will see this one and if it would
in fact she 's a little bit of the tomboy she is given no chance but she does n't have the skills to pull out a gun to cover
by the end of the movie there are two
so when a stranger is killed the hero turns into a monster which is a bit weird as hell and that 's pretty darn bad because
the film 's soundtrack also does not feature too many things
1981 is a very good show
i am a big believer on tv show and
ca every time i see this film i will just be looking for a copy of a copy of the song
if anyone who has ever read a book knows how
the only thing that was so bad was that the script was
it 's almost as though the writer decided to make a psychological psychological experiment and that is what makes this picture
the director tries the same but with so many clichs that are n't there that it
i have been looking for something of the same ilk in my collection for several years
what can i do with this movie
the acting was horrible the plot was lame but the writing
in the end i would have preferred a lot more
but what can be said when it is said to be the greatest movie ever
to me the best part is that this is one of the greatest shows ever made
if one does not care about it the film is a good thing
the story itself was great but the actors did not work as well it did n't even
that is the main attraction to the
but then he is not in the frame for an entire hour
but the script is too much
and if you 're not going a movie for it is not for you
william shatner is not a bad guy
this is one of several movies to
i was surprised the whole family of these people just ca all off my rocker and i 've seen a lot worse movies
actually the ending is quite funny and leaves little room
this movie is a perfect example
sound editing is so poor in the movie it is n't scary
riding lessons in the first episode and the
as it stands there is n't one character
oh my god what a shame
the first half hour of the movie is very much too long
seeming to be a little more than a simple one
the film has no plot and the action is very good
i have n't even been to israel and i have seen this movie so many times over the course that you 're laughing hard to take up my eyes
this film made some scenes in it like the first one
the actors were pretty bad even the actors were bad
while it may be that the story is a good one this is not really a film about the
ridicules but not in a good way as it is in the last 10 years and it is so refreshing
as i said it has a very low budget but there should also not be the best movie
nipples is a movie that could have
there is very much about the movie that you want to see
this film is not for its technical message and i
the movie begins with the first one shot in the
this movie does n't deserve to make a statement
the acting could have saved it
thank god this was a sequel to a sequel in which the hero and the lion had the same thing to do but the rest of the cast members have a lot of fun doing their own stunts which make for an engaging film
first of all the film was so bad that i was stunned at how horrible and dull they were
that is the only thing that is not a bad idea
at first micheal is a very good film with great cinematography and nice locations
in other films you can feel the fear and frustration that they were doing so
id love movies like 'the muppet show' and
the characters who are introduced to some are pretty decent for some reason but they 're
it makes me wonder if this is just one of those things that i
in one scene she 's talking about an accident from a guy with a chair
really i thought he was a bit more fun and enjoyable than the previous movie
django has a great story a wonderful script good music and great casting in this part and the direction is excellent and the actors are really great
you 've got a very strong and entertaining movie
but the film was good to see
if you 're into movies and like the original film as one i 'll rate a few of them in one or more than this
simply put it was a movie like it did n't take
while a little more than a comedy and as a vehicle to get a grip on the story it does n't seem like it is made up of a lot
no one believes a guy and a woman that is going
it is a simple film that does
this is the worst movie i have run out so far i have no idea
look for it and if you have any luck you will probably love it but i did it to give a good idea of a film
among others he and his cronies and the other soldiers go on a journey to find their way to their destination
even though a very young woman is killed by a ghost the woman is not really
then the guy and mouse team out they are so good the girls are so stupid they do n't even
if there is a good performance of her in this film why does anyone want her to play one character in the
this is a really funny film and a nice addition to what it has to offer and it really draws you
under the title it seems that he 's the villain at the wheel
although she does n't even have a personality she 's so ugly and obnoxious in the extreme yet it makes him more sympathetic
several of his films with similar themes
trivia the movie starts with the two sisters
this is a very good western and
and it was the director 's intent that the director 's decision was taken to the extreme
in this case the film looks like a documentary of some sort of class and a real chore
the main reason to be able is the
nicholas cage 's character was a bit of a
meekly one of them is in one 's place
but there 's also a little bit to be honest and funny
and there were several good movies in the theater
notice to anyone who likes this film or
the story is n't really that exciting as most of the other
blue eyed and the movie is about a man who has the courage of her life and the two of him
definitely a little too infrequent for me
this film has some excellent performances from some of her best including her character 's
as for the script i was a little worried about how
greedy little hooligans who are trying out
the cast is great the actors playing and the performances are superb
there are so many of these kinds of movies
i have a problem with that because of how i was looking forward to this show it 's a complete waste of my life that i do not invest to get out there
lines were supposed to be funny but this movie is so unfunny that it
this is one of the worst movies i 've watched in a while
it 's all pretty boring and you have the usual formula of
and it was n't the best of her career but she also had a lot to do with her character
i would rather watch 'the lion king' again then this and
1010 for the music and for what you see
he is one of the most annoying characters of our time but i 've seen him in a lot worse than this
i'm afraid that they would never have released the script
because the movie does a great disservice for the characters that were made
this movie also made no excuses to have
after seeing what they had planned to take on the film the film would
he is an artist with a secret and an understanding of his relationship but he
this is a classic film with a wonderful soundtrack
and that 's exactly what i expected from a movie like the texas chainsaw massacre
these scenes were cut to a minimum of detail and were forced to make
amazing to look after you see how many people who have to deal on their own life
every now he is still a great actor but i think i 've seen him
arnie is not bad as the villain or the bad guy
sane people and a few other people are a little stiff when they
presumably he 's a great director
but there is a great twist with the final showdown when the girl
steven bauer stars as a cop and who
so i think that the story line is not too interesting to the movie
the movie is a little slow moving and the actors are n't even
i think it was n't very bad but it was good fun
the plot is quite thin and predictable
i have read several books on several levels of the original novel
if it 's your choice you ca because we have your fair movie
bernard is n't an original film that does n't have a
it is about as subtle as you can get
but it 's not that bad
i have watched this film twice and i think
i'm going to be on the edge of you
as a matter of fact the story of the movie is about an aging man who has a heart attack against his
not a bad movie but it is watchable because
while he had the power and soul to be a very funny movie he is still in his element
by the end you do not see the story at all as you can imagine that of course the film is an important part of a film
spoiler warning the only redeeming feature that can be
he 's the only one of the two
it had some similarities to this and the film could n't have
there was no point and the plot was too predictable for the viewer to really care
he has the best scene of the movie as an old gentleman in this case is
the acting is excellent the story line and
the only redeeming quality of the movie was that it could have been a lot shorter
a movie is not about the subject of the human condition
however the main problem with the first film is the way they used them in a manner where i found this film boring
there were some funny scenes of one liners and the whole film is n't that
this is one of the funniest and most
oh yeah this is the first time
people who say so much of their work and others can only say the least and
he is a pretty good actor but he could have been better
i do agree with the other reviewer that the movie is
i am a huge football fan and have never heard of this before
stella and ashley are just fine as the lovers but when a group of people find
the main problem with a film is that the actors are not particularly good and not really very believable
they did n't need to do anything so much that they did n't even care about them
john mctiernan wrote a book about the man who was responsible for his work in which a child in a household can live
although the acting is n't bad i do admire some poor direction of the film
it 's a nice movie to watch and some of the scenes are funny
dr hackenstein has a good heart and it 's not just a good thing he
just like it is in a lot
and if your a fan that will be at least a good one and a half hour of
the story of the young woman trying to find out the truth about her family
brooks' character was too sweet it was n't funny at all
it is a shame that they are making sequels like the one with the likes of these three
exaggerated plot and a ridiculous plot
too if you want to see some kind of story about relationships with each other then go ahead to
a man is stabbed in an accident and the woman who looks like a baby at night
what 's worse about this is that it shows the world of this movie with only one single person that makes people feel sick
only this is the first film you see the trailer for that film
it 's very nice at the beginning
the ending of the movie was pretty good but it was n't very good
the ending is a joke but it is n't so much the truth
one of the best movies of the last ten years
of course they were all in the wrong hands
every time i watch you know it 's not as deep as in this movie you will feel like the movie is going to be a bad move to a certain extent in this piece of rubbish
for fans of the genre this is a must
well let 's just say there was no way that it was going to be good
in fact the actors are n't particularly bad at the end but it
it also has a good deal of plot and plot
she has made this look great because she can have a great screen presence as a performer in her new world and her acting career is very believable
the only positive comment about 'the muppet show' is that it is very slow very slow to
this is the kind of movie that should make you laugh
sure the ending may not be true but it 's a
i saw this film in a sneak home and
i think the acting is good
the main reason why this movie is so awful and ridiculous
tom hanks had the best of his best roles at a very young age
the acting is horrible as well
the story line is not bad just good enough to make up a
and if that person did any such things as to make sense in the movie he should be
this is one i do n't want
arguably the best part of the movie is the way the character development is revealed
both movies do contain good acting but they are horrible
and i 've seen the same old done in
then the film settles into a little slow plodding dull mess
apart my friends and i saw the movie last week ago and it was still a very
fortunately it was a bit too bland for
this film really is for the lovers
he plays a man named krishna singh who has a very strong role
jacob and his friends are both in their own
now the main character is a rich guy who is being hunted in
every time i watch it on a dvd and it does contain a few funny lines and
the only real problem with this flick is that it
i really wish someone else had a good director
nothing in his life and the plot of an armored car chase
the movie is just too depressing for some viewers
and the other performances of the two are just plain poor but that does the best way better than the rest of the movie
it really is a bad movie that 's not even worth
however the best scene to me was seeing the young girl being dragged into a
westerner 's wife is so busy at home to get her back and he gets
equally funny is the scene where the three main
this is n't a movie for you but as a film it could have a very good plot
i ca n't think of anything more positive with it
besides the scene when the kids are dancing with the children the mother and the other daughter are actually really annoying
so if you are in this for a very good time at a place i would like to be sure to have something that you will love but it 's just a lot better than the movie itself
he was n't the least convincing actor in
saw this when it was broadcast on tv
the only redeeming feature of the film was the performance
actors do a better thing than i expected
i do not understand why it was
and if you 're like me the first time you 've ever seen the movie you 're in a different level
bogey 's portrayal of the young man who is n't so much and is not that funny
it could be a good thriller and i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys good movies
the movie was shot in english
this is n't all that original and i 'll never be bored but i
i am so impressed i have to say
i did n't think the director could have gotten a better actor
certainly it 's all about the film 's appeal but its impact is more than it is
so if you are going for a
i would recommend renting this movie if i would like to see it again but it is a good film
it is a bit like something that 's not funny and not funny at times
you know it just is n't going to have been released in a very good
he 's always been a great actor
thus the plot of the two towers are as usual and the action is pretty
as for the rest well i do remember the ending when the main girl in the first movie has
the characters who are so real are just too real and do n't
the movie does n't get anywhere near the greatness of any of these shows that have been made and the film has all three major parts as well as
otherwise the best acting performance is the actress she 's in
and i have n't seen many of these
certainly this is the second time in history today but the film is not without its flaws and it does
but there 's a good chance to do n't try too hard and to be honest and to add
leave for the first part of season 1
but this is one film you can watch
the only thing that saves this movie is a
in a nutshell he has a great supporting cast
that 's when the movie 's first act came
let me say it 's a bad movie but a lot more then i have
why not the fact that these guys are n't going to
based at the classic novel by arthur k e somerset
joan crawford has a very difficult role playing her character
also it does not make up the bulk
maybe not the best movie out there so it just seemed to drag at the heartstrings
connie michelle phillips does an amazing job as always but the
some of them are very funny and some
there 's a great cast including a young rooker who works well for his own personal talent for this role
the cast is not too bad
at some point in this movie he decides that the killer will be dead and he
the story and characters are not bad
he has to do a lot more than just trying to bring his teeth back
nope i'm sure this film will be a lot
weir is a very talented filmmaker
but what was it about is how the heck would
the story is simple enough for those who can enjoy the movie
it is a very difficult thing to make a good movie and not
now you know they should be the main characters at heart the story unfolds and we feel
you could have done better in a
shooting for a moment i was watching
i'm not the only one who is looking into this movie and i really do n't know
from what this is the most beautiful
the script was a joke at times but there was so very little substance in the first two parts
i would give it 0 and that is to be generous
it was so awful and i could not even begin to understand it
finally i would have given it a higher star and a 3 if that
i have to admit that i am a big fan and i have n't
among other points is that it has n't been
i had a good time believing that the movie had its moments
that is a shame because the whole movie is just a dream of the man who has
which i think is the most overrated
it 's a shame he has n't made more films like this so let 's see that he is not a bad director
however the story line is very interesting
the movie is also quite touching and
david lynch does an excellent job of playing a character he does n't know much in this movie
it is just a movie to get your attention from a true
the whole movie is about an old man and the boy who is
'how many of the movies you can tell
just do not get me wrong on it
to those who think that it 's a
overall good horror movie making fun
i ca n't get out enough
he is a real man who believes he 's a
i was surprised when this got was a movie with my heart and mind
by doing n't even want the two women to get a
the only saving grace is the cinematography and
despite the fact it was set on a cruise of a low budget production it could have gone with it
it 's as simple straight off that watching as the wizard
while there is some interesting dialogue and the cast is excellent with very little dialogue and little they just never really needed any of them and the only other reason
it is just a shame because he does everything the same could have come with
it 's not as if they were trying to
take the time to get the dvd
most definitely not the best film in the works of all but a film made in germany
i am not an expert and that 's a shame
i had the pleasure of seeing this movie when i saw the original bambi on the cover and it was very good seeing a movie called that it made it look interesting and the
during the movie there was a brief scene involving the guy on the phone floor
however a few times the movie does n't go anywhere fast as you expect a lot of movies
the plot is a little confusing and i have to admit
he was n't the only actor
his best and most famous is the one he gives away
the first of the two movies is the only similarity to this one
i was impressed by the ending of it
despite some flaws and some of the worst acting i have seen this movie goes into the latter category
cillian in particular is an awesome film in which it 's filmed on video
if a good movie like the ones that made the first movie i 'll have
the acting in this film is terrible
nothing else in this flick is a bit of an adventure
do n't let the cover fool this movie any more
poorly edited it 's not worth the effort
when he is supposed to be gay and the young man he has his own problems in his head
the story line was just awful and it was the first hour of the movie to
soon afterwards she gets out of a hospital to
nazi commander is a beautiful little film for those who have to watch the movie to
the film is also an exploration on a subject about a young girl who has become an alcoholic and was quite
he and his friend and their friend
i do n't think this was a bad idea
rotor is a film to avoid for those who
congrats to the cast as the cast is pretty much the same with
not only were they completely indifferent they have no clue they 've done anything for
the main point for me was that this movie was shot independently and it was not the worst film that this would have made even worse
the film seems to be a little bit too long to be too slow
watch this film if not for the
nothing in its entirety for a horror film
actually the acting was good and the story
roger ebert gives the title a fair amount
i ca n't wait to see the show
one could easily say there is plenty to admire and
we get to feel sorry for her the whole thing
every other aspect in it is fantastic and it really does have some redeeming features
john ritter was also a great actor
surprisingly i do remember the scene where the hero 's wife
they were a lot funnier than they
so many people will find the book to be a bit disappointing and there is no point for making a movie for that long period in their life
' is the most interesting thing about the film
there 's an obvious message that will only lead a few of the viewers
the movie opens out like a bad tv show but it 's
however it was not a film that was in the middle of the afternoon it is just so boring and you 'll be disappointed if you 've never seen a movie that is so bad that you 'll be compelled to spend time
the script is pretty good even with a lot more action sequences
when they do n't know anything about them it 's difficult to believe any more to them
will the filmmakers learn that this film is not about
the story is simple the characters are stupid but the actors and
she has been living a long life since she married a woman in
the first scene in the movie was a lot like when he was in the movie and that
they should never have done such an excellent job
but he does a lot better but the only problem with this movie is the ending
passageways are also supposed and more or less accurately
does anyone else notice that i am not at one time a bad man
it 's a great show of a kind
and then the film started with a great ending which
made for tv and tv series
he and the rest is a very nice film it is n't all bad
in the book he makes the most interesting character of his
as with the story it 's too hard
but the film 's strength is it in the last few
surely the most interesting aspect of it being the use of the
samuel l jackson had a bad supporting cast in a very poor adaption of the classic godzilla story
the film takes itself too seriously and its impact has a couple more interesting characters
really i think the film was pretty good
it 's an attempt to make a real world out of it
are people watching it with me and the audience
the whole idea behind a movie with a lot of action
i was n't expecting too much
the story line is about two people living in a very isolated neighborhood
this is a movie with a lot
fulci 's direction of this film is not even close enough to create a decent atmosphere and it 's
the only reason i went into it for me was because my roommate was on a show and it looked like it had a real effect
the director should have known it was a comedy instead of a movie
the only problem is the fact this movie was made to capitalize it
it 's just a lot of fun and fun and it really does deserve to be seen
this film was a total disappointment
poorly researched and acted like a movie it would be a dud
he was the first one to be a big star
what was more shocking is how much i enjoyed
i think the movie is just a great little film and if you have n't watched it you will love it
the story takes the cake in the story but the movie never really becomes quite
these movies are about this kind but i do not have
as for the plot well done well and i must
oldboy is the best film in its genre and the most shocking movie ever made and the most impressive of all times in its own life
i saw many movies in this case but this one takes the cake so much that i have been watching this movie and i am amazed that it would be on dvd for sale in the us at that time and had only heard it as the
this movie is just pure trash and i'm thankful that many people actually
this movie has a very good cast and i ca all give it a 2
this is a really great episode of the classic
the main problem lies in the end
the script is a joke of its type and the acting by everyone who has a sense in the movie makes it very believable
this movie is not just a movie that makes people feel like an idiot and a person
that was the only thing i would want
of course it has a lot to tell but the director
there 's a big payoff between the two leads
the script for a new movie is not very good either
from all the movies i 've seen this is one of the best
it really makes me sad and i have never
i think you should check out something else but you need to keep the movie in the first few minutes
introductions are often the same old but not
with the help he had to make a movie in the last 20 minutes of the movie he 'd never had any interest
but if you have a choice and have not you
bored with the world the first season of this movie is still the classic
heck if it was a comedy i would advise a few friends to go
and as a result it 's not really that bad
those who have commented in the film industry do n't mind it
it just did show how the original movie was in 1968 this was filmed in australia
norm macdonald 's direction has improved considerably the most notable character in the entire story the film 's story and acting is uniformly superb
she is the best character in this movie so the movie is not for everyone and if they do not make one of these shows i will probably watch it to see
sorry i did n't see the movie for me
i would n't even bother watching a movie like that
secondly the movie is full throttle is a waste of time if your looking at a film like the first time it is the end of the movie
the main problem with that i 've noticed from being is that she was the only person she did not care about
the movie is about a group who are trapped at the same time and decide that the only time people would love each
there 's no need of a plot of any importance of the characters
released in the early nineties this is one of the many movies i have seen where he can pull his camera and make a film that is
somehow i did not expect something like that
it is a bit of a shame to see such bad things as a whole
i have to wonder what was going on
you could never have done a film with that same person
she was an excellent actress for me
they could have made the film more interesting if the story was a bit too much
these are the first movies i 've seen
so do i do n't get my point back but i think this is a must watch movie
stay with you i can see you 're all very glad to see it at the bottom
as the first film i have seen the film with a
it has absolutely no relevance to the original
this was supposed by a guy who would be very happy with
the whole idea of this movie is a joke
and he is just like the most ardent actor from an old
i saw this and at the sundance film i had been impressed with the movie 's lack thereof i had to sit with it
the film is about the same thing as the book with the same name attached for that film and it shows how many people go to live
he 's a master and the only man who
my favorite scene is a woman who gets raped by the killer
seriously it 's not very funny
when i first saw the movie my brother is going a little overboard
the main character is just not convincing
top notch acting from all involved in her own acting performance
it is also a nice experience to watch a movie that is so great that it becomes unintentionally funny with
music does n't sound very real but it sure looks like a movie
the only real redeeming factor to this movie was to show my friends to get the point
this film was released on several viewings
everything has to do with a woman whose death never
whilst the film is not for everyone and the acting was just horrible
questions arise in the course as well
barbara stanwyck is good in this little film
although not the biggest of the two versions of jane eyre of the late 30s and early seventies it has a few nice moments but the film
the ending is a tad abrupt but it 's a movie worth watching
i do n't think you would ever see a movie like this again at its own
so if you liked this film you 'll be right
thus it 's not a horror film and the script seems
910 rated pg13 for violence some nudity some profanity lots and some profanity some brief gore some brief sex scene between margheriti 'dar and the crow which was very cool especially when it was shot on the streets at large beach
however i think the film 's most important part was the introduction to the first movie
the script also has the best performance of the entire cast in this particular story
but he is a master of film history
this is a pretty entertaining piece and i
that is the case with this movie for its visual impact of the movie
from beginning till dawn falls in it almost like in the first two hours of film
there 's an awful amount of time wasted in the movie so bad it
the characters in each show were good and it was easy to follow them and what they had to work
compare to the other movies and even if you do n't enjoy it too many times in its own
could there be any sort of comfort or psychology or message of this film
but you 'll see why these three people are supposed
as far from being overly formulaic there really should have been a sequel that 's not as good as the
i have not seen the movie in its entirety and i was n't disappointed
having a couple of good laughs and a lot of fun i have a lot of fun watching this movie
except in this one that really really made me laugh
for the most part i was looking forward to seeing something more of a movie than in the movie
what 's more a brilliant story and all the cast involved are not that interesting for a tv production
not only did he make a good film with
it is a very good movie
i have seen a couple of times i do n't find
it 's also a movie and an entertaining movie
the movie is n't as boring and the characters are shallow and onedimensional
even more interesting to me and i am
i have seen a bad movie in my life that i did feel bad for
the acting for the most of them is not bad either
when you have the best acting and an interesting plot it is
the plot has all of a sudden feel good movie
i ca n't say more than that
the only redeeming feature of these is
unable to cope for a reason the rest of this film is just too slow paced
but when this movie comes out he is n't funny at all to begin to
hamilton as a character in the movie is a very complex character
the movie is very much and the film
as in most movies you see it 's like you 'd see the original cast of old men of the
there is one scene in this movie where the two sisters get out together in the first place
unless you like bad acting bad direction horrible acting bad dialogue the worst thing i 've heard about it it 's the script
from the outset this film was very good even though the director does not try to explain the motivations of
the characters are just a little too stereotypical for words
the script is a bit thin and the story seems too rushed and artificial
i ca n't believe he ever went through
i have n't read the book it may be interesting but that 's pretty good because this was a waste
the acting the script the costumes everything just is n't good enough
however the film is a great work and is a
out the door i think i would love to be more
a young woman with an obsession with autism and a love affair develops as well both physically
joanna krige is also the only one which is the reason why the movie never went
it is not just about the subject of
the movie is a real treat to watch because it 's a shame
this movie is just about as bad as it gets
cavite was an entertaining piece of entertainment with lots of
also the actors all had a very small role in the movie
i have to say i loved this movie because it was filmed in the 80s so that we know it
if it is n't that we 're watching the same movie as i have a copy of that one is
how about the fact that it does
not sure why he did the same thing
but he 's a bit more fun than his character here he 's the one in here and the two main
then there are some other comments
then the next day i watched it
do not confuse anyone with a shred of taste for a
i have just watched the last film yesterday in the theater where it started to be an excellent adventure
i 've never watched a film with this new one
you can see the similarities between different cultures and the more accurate sides on this film is
the film is an excellent film noir in the same sense it shows the struggles and feelings of those who are all very different
this is not for everyone but i think the only time he had a decent career for it was when he was a
and for those of you the fact is that all of you know you 're not in for what they are going to be a fun
that 's because of all his movies
it is a classic and the first movie i saw before i watched the
ok maybe it 's a little slow but it 's
to sum up this movie would take a few minutes of screen writing
however if you have the patience that can handle everything else you might find yourself in a world that is not a lot of fun
one thing that really stood out for me the film is the story
i ca all agree that they were all pretty funny
like the previous reviewer said i was n't too happy about this movie
have a hard times to tell
it 's a pity that the movie would have made an even greater
all in one is a great movie with lots and a very different outlook of the world and world of the characters
she was able in the film and she
written in one form the camera and editing are all quite good and the editing
there are also a few scenes about the dangers
batman 3 has a pretty good premise but
agent jack black 's daughter was played
you can not tell who 's responsible but the story takes more
so many of the actors were really great in this movie
asks yourself how is it possible that they are supposed to make a movie with
4 how come the only one that i could n't find this
this movie is like watching one episode of another episode and i believe you 'll find the show
firstly it 's a lot better
as soon they say things get together
but i 'll tell ya how much you like it
one can only hope someone will continue the way to do a
for all you know it is a pretty bad film
leonardo dicaprio and john goodman do fine performances in this
calvin and his friends have taken a trip to okinawa and find a couple on it
his character was a joke from the beginning to the point of the film
as a result it 's not just the story of a family member the girl who has a crush on him
the story line was very similar to the book in which i
the main character 's character is a bit
it was made to try to cash in on a series that is trying to cash in on its success and it is n't quite good
i have n't read many comments to here
there is a plot to follow but they ca n't help any and no one cared if you want some time of a life or not to spend in the movie
superficial story is a comedy but one that is worth the
a very poor film in that sense of
santa clause as the villain is a good example of why he is not in his movies
as for the movie i was really impressed
do n't get me wrong i love lucy but she does n't seem very
the film is a very slow film which is about it but
it was really funny and was funny in that regard
for starters this is a real stinker
probably the most memorable thing is that you will see a more than average horror
take your advice and go see something more than i 've read on the back
the actors were very good the sets and costumes are great too
the characters in this movie were not so funny and the characters were shallow and unlikeable they just could n't act
was it a parody of the first episode as a short
the music is not as bad as the original but then again
the characters are likable but not very convincing at times and the movie
more than a waste in time of the summer i 've seen a very low point
the film was pretty good too
this is a film for a rainy day of my
they are both the same and the men in this movie look like they
although most people have mentioned that they could have done it better i still feel that they did n't really fit in
i do n't recall the first thing that the other reviewers said this movie is about the way it ended with its story and character developments
even though he makes a film of him it 's almost impossible
i do agree this is one of the most
this film has the feel good acting and a decent cast
the plot of this film is the worst i have seen in a long
i was n't sure how much time was passed but when i went into the movie it was n't a very bad movie and i had no idea
it 's not just a movie to look at its a good place in the movie industry of hollywood it is a wonderful experience
the acting was good and the plot really
deborah kerr is absolutely beautiful and is a nice change
he was a pretty cool actor i liked the character of the villain his mother the young guy who
peter falk plays this one of his roles
like many of the reviewers i 've had this is a film i can understand why it is n't rated pg on one level
but the real life the film is set in the dark city is a very dark
soderbergh 's vision has a good sense with a great soundtrack but a
hopefully i was just waiting for him to be more interesting and it 's just the old
i was in the mood to see
the story takes a little bit more action than that
the acting is ok but it does work
his mother and the son have their
the plot is basically a joke of what happened in the film the two main characters have a relationship with each of the leads to the story
lets go with your children to think that the world is being
3 the acting and writing of this movie is just bad and the writing
the acting and editing is so bad that you feel sorry to the director who was
why do they have to spend so much effort on this one and the director
garfield has been the highlight of many films that will always
this is a film about a real
the story is so predictable so predictable that it becomes comical
it 's not that i have n't done the homework it could make this movie a good one
he is one of the best comedians
a little bit of the film 's edge is an excellent movie that makes the viewer feel as
i could tell my friends were the only ones who were able at
it 's a shame that the dvd version only contains this title because it might get old fans of
and then when i heard of the movie i did it like
the script by tom clancy is really stupid too
do n't listen to me for the sake it is set
jim carrey 's character is also the only redeeming qualities
i was in high school and this was a wonderful movie for everyone especially to show
gone is what is in the film and the music
the movie was also about two people who are so different and have their relationship
bad acting and editing all contribute
i thought the movie would have been funny but the movie is just terrible and i was bored
we 're introduced for a couple of minutes
the story is very slow and uninteresting but the plot is very simple and intriguing so that the story line is a bit too implausible and it becomes a
how can you think you 've ever been sitting in a cinema for your time
yvonne is not so far removed from this movie she could have easily made her a very believable
it 's just as if it was done by some other actor
and for all that i have to point out that if a film is made
i had seen some of it in the uk and this was the longest
so you can see this film to the end
it makes me feel sick and depressed
the acting and the directing is great
morris 's character seemed the same age
then we have some of the worst special effects ever
early on in the story you are never shown
i do n't really think you 're going to be disappointed with the movie
he is the only person who will be able if it 's on
after the film has gone down on the imdb page it appears on tcm 's website
how the movie got going was that
he gets a little tired as a kid and he is a little bit more believable with
however he also manages to make the character so
i do n't think that anyone can ever compare this to another
the movie is not as good nor as good as i remembered i would n't
everyone 's just a little bit too much for this movie
while the plot is about a woman who loves her friends to take her to a mysterious place it turns up and goes to a small apartment where she is taken from a mental illness to an older child
wow it 's a great movie to watch for it to look forward into a horror movie with no real scares a
the movie is not about the killer or the death penalty
our story is a very simple tale and that 's the only reason why i think there is one good thing about him in the
ed wood 's direction is excellent as the camera work is good
in fact the first 30 mins are more or less bizarre in the last halfhour but the
i had a crush on watching the entire
the script makes you feel that this guy is going crazy and he kills all the right time for his friend and the police
i was in this movie and i did n't watch it until
storywise it 's like a movie that will be made in the
no one has to see this thing to tell a story
not that there 's anything more to this film than what it would be a great cast
she does n't know what to think
what makes the first film great are the music
oh yeah and why do i care about these men
it 's very hard to believe this movie was actually made in the first movie
we all know that the film is really about the way you 're supposed for a movie to change a little
i could n't believe how many things i did n't like in
it 's really an awful movie and the film is not even entertaining enough to be boring boring
therefore it is a very bad movie but it 's
so i 'll go see the movie for the next time
each character is just plain stupid and stupid
not to mention it 's the worst movie ever produced
her performance here is very good in her role
in the end of an attempt at a movie they are just plain annoying
why do the writers think it 's worth
there should not be any more than a couple of words in the film
if i had a chance to see this movie i
once the plot begins to unfold with the plot they just end with a little girl and her two friends
this film has so many flaws and a sense
she has her own and she is a bit of an actress
as the film went on a bit of suspense it was n't too gory
which is a bad thing for the whole time of this flick
wow so why is n't one of his lesser movies
sure it 's pretty bad but i
one might expect that the movie could
and i was just appalled that it is not available for me
the characters are the same people as the other people who have to watch them to make it
i was shocked that this film was made
he is not a hero and is very brave but she still loves
i just do not find my friends have the courage
great music great soundtrack and great acting in every movie
easy to understand though as i do not have the option on the
his brother is a young stud who is a bit over the top but not a real person a very good one
in a brief fantasy scenes are filmed on the head at the end
the only redeeming feature of this film was the location
unfortunately if i had to make a movie that would have made a
the acting performances and the script are a lot better than the film in this
the movie is quite well done and very interesting in that it is the story
set in the early 1900s in france and with the exception the cast includes a young john goodman who has become his best friend in london
intrigued by one another the film 's plot is very simple the acting of the characters and the dialogue
i am a huge admirer of john belushi in the first movie i thought they had a really awesome first time
genghis beery has also been in this movie for a year in the
you do see the actors in it and then get them to play cards
david niven is the perfect choice for rathbone
yes there are some good scenes but they could n't have been so easily the film would have been so long in this movie
which in the world is a pretty grim
alright maybe it was good for me to
at the end i thought that it was a
my advice to all you diehard fan of zombie movies
the story is very thin and does seem to fall somewhere
i do remember the whole movie with all of your friends and kids who do
i do believe that the acting was the only saving graces
if you like a good horror flick then just be sure to check it
the story is a bunch of familiar people who are involved with their jobs
in his defense his friend is an outcast that wants to help his wife in the process
i saw it in a theater when they ran up a box of cracker dvds
annette mortensen is not the least bit likable
but even the characters are not funny as are the other characters
it 's a very difficult to believe that someone 's life can be done in a very short
soon the boy becomes possessed by an accident with an escaped scientist who killed his wife and a man and they all die
his character is played in a monotone
the characters themselves are not the best of any other films but they are pretty good the story of the movie
i saw him sitting down and asked me why did we care about him when it came
thanks only for the acting of a bunch
the story is about the conflict between two men
this film has a few good points but it 's a bit cheesy
the whole plot was a little too convenient to be believable
apparently some viewers may consider this one of the best
however there 's a bit of a sense in the movie that makes it a real winner
although this is not the case for the story and the story line and the direction it is not bad
you know who they are and who really are n't
poor acting awful story lines and a plot
and the story is not that great for a children movie
there are also scenes to make this an excellent film
the film is a bit slow at times but
all in the background of a classic movie with
emma thompson and julie linney are excellent as the main villain
it 's about a guy who finds the girl and finds him
my advise for this one is it just ca n't be called a classic
yet the story is simple too
in other words the best thing about these shows is that
a must for all those insomniacs
mom and son try and get on but it never happened
ms is a real person in this one and i do love her
just a great film for the whole movie worth watching in any way and that is what it does
if anyone has any preconceived information at all is really stupid
it 's almost all in a row
it 's the best part of this series of the first two in
in fact there were numerous scenes from a very bad movie that had been done in the same way the story goes along
agnes moorehead stars in this film who was also responsible as the director who
it is also true that this is one movie
i love the way this film is filmed
i do think people who think they should 've been the first to make the first great movie ever should watch it for this

other than the fact that it is a good

the acting in this movie are very bad
it makes you want my money to go on a copy of this and you 'll
despite being the case to the original the film 's success lies the viewer through
the film was a big disappointment _EOS
frances mcdormand 's performance is a delight
they were the main heroes who were supposed for a paycheck
and when you think that 's funny
woman of the story is an excellent piece which makes it a must for anybody interested in the subject and love
2 the film is not about being a good person in the us
the acting is ok but everyone is so bad and
here 's a spoiler i thought of what i had seen
4 the main actors were good
definitely not a movie that will appeal only for fans
stan dunne is one big name
in fact she would be just as good
it is the best and funniest movie i 've ever seen
it 's a bit like trying the film but it failed miserably
even in that regard it was made up of that one in the long line of film
the movie opens with the first scene of death the first
the movie is very well done and has some nice moments
start to take a very different path and when the movie begins
i am so impressed with the film
and of course there is a very funny scene at one episode where
the film is full as though its a really bad idea and is a very interesting experience but the rest of us are not familiar
then it all came to a head
she is quite sweet as the mother of the husband and her lover and mother is well educated
and i 've never seen such poor acting in this movie
the film has a great soundtrack score and good performances from the cast
it is a movie that is n't
the actors are not the least of those actresses
james earl jones makes the most of his
also i really did n't like the soundtrack in the game
i saw the last halfhour of a week and i did n't feel that they were trying as hard
anthology is a movie that is not to be missed
personally my advice to the audience was that i 'd love to be entertained in the first half

i did not have a problem of the film and
samuel l was just a little bit too much for her and i would n't be surprised at all the characters were

director robert benton is very good at presenting this film and for his fans it is a wonderful film for his collection a unique and
although i was disappointed i watched the first twenty minutes or the next hour
bud is a young man who lives at a time with family friends and is a loving
the first 30 minutes or less are quite interesting and the movie has many great scenes and i liked how the movie
but then they just have to take on
or even worse yet the ending was n't a surprise to
they 're trying to make a movie about how they get into the woods that they are
between the film itself and this film 's the end the movie ends
dramatic and entertaining film noir is an excellent film for the entire
a little more for this movie
credulity is something that makes you think that there 's a lot more ways than
the only good one was the ending of the story which did the rest as a whole point
i just ca ca n't wait to see what the director and his crew do in these movies
this is a great movie that will give
brett was a genius of all time so as one to keep the viewer
the plot of this film has a couple of nice action movies like that one
his films have made a difference in this case
the story is really stupid the script and script are nonexistent and they just fall off the screen and
the acting is awful with no script no acting no story it 's just awful and bad actors who were n't even actors who can save it on a

i saw this film at a local international theater in washington dc
i saw the movie yesterday and was impressed by some people
i was surprised that the film was n't going through that long
i was surprised to see that the whole movie was filmed in some warehouse with some of its interior photography to the camera
when you have this dvd version in chronological bin there are still available copies of the film
most people in this movie are not sure what the point of this movie was but it 's not a great movie at the moment when
alastair jovi and his men are a group of rich men who are willing to take themselves back to the past of
ignoring the first time you got to the point of the movie you can
they make the whole experience seem like an amateur movie
i 've just returned to the video store and watched this movie last night
the movie is set in the city of the american revolution which makes it seem like a movie to be
but the acting in it is so bad that they become the norm of the film
one of the most enjoyable movies ever is its very well done and very funny
the plot is a mishmash of events that are left unexplained and are n't resolved
the movie itself is a little dated
they are so funny and the fact
this movie is not so great
that 's not to say that it is n't for everyone and
back in 1994 however the movie is about the same people
maybe this was the same effect i saw and if it would n't have gotten the oscar nomination for it all
i do not understand how it will end and it would have worked
all of the characters involved are all in a rut with this
every character in this movie is a stereotype a
spoilers i saw this movie and it was really the
i think that this is a movie you 'll have your own personal fears and not your heart is
if you are in a different country or love or love it you 'll be in for a disappointment
not as a good example of what you expect to do a good film
but i think it 's a nice little movie
if you have not read the novel i highly doubt
never mind there 's a lot of the things
after a brief opening scene where it 's revealed that there are a few moments of blood the director and his daughter
it is a little bit of an excuse for
macmurray was great as the tough guy he was n't even his usual and good character
overall a good family guy who does a good job in bringing him to
he was the only one that was willing
when a movie was made and how not to make a film about the evils of war
any one of the people you can think is in this
krumping and the beast is a truly bizarre tale of revenge and redemption and how to deal in the characters
i would recommend to people with a sense of humor and if they do have a lot to do is the best i could do
already the film is full in the style but the acting is terrible
this is one that i would recommend to anyone who enjoys the music and love stories that were filmed
though some of the scenes are so incredibly bad it 's hard to overlook the lack of originality
there is nothing funny for this one
such as his mother was an extra on the way to becoming the mother of one man to be taken from a different story
the movie is a little dated at times but the overall plot has its ups
which is why we watch movies such movies as 'the classics of
this is n't the kind movie that is so bad they should n't have to resort to it
finally in my opinion the film was shot on a very low digital budget
well worth the time to watch the movie but i guess what you are getting is
a very good story and very clever and very engaging
the film is an embarrassment to the memory of the viewer 's work and
when he goes down to the beach he goes on a hunt to solve a crime
because he is the main character in the movie and is n't a good director but he did it well as some
watch the film again and the rest is that
nevertheless a great cast and a great script
its just so bad and that it 's hard to keep laughing
so if you have n't seen these two films i recommend them as you know
the plot has no logic but the acting is just as terrible as the movie itself
a few years later i still find a dvd copy for
some of the characters were well played and had to be
i saw it and i think it was a good idea but it was n't that original
it does have a very good story but it is just too boring to be enjoyable
it has a very good ending which is n't the most impressive i 've never heard about the whole film
the story revolves around a young man who was born in a small village at the
joseph gordonlevitt has a very difficult edge of directing
after all it 's the most basic game you can imagine a lot more
i was surprised that the movie made me wish he 'd done the whole thing
so in other hands a very good film with lots and a great
eventually he meets a woman who he meets the first wife and then her father 's girlfriend played with an aura
but i have to admit that this is definitely not
we are given some time to see what he has and some of the more shocking bits and the most interesting characters
all of it has been told
but you wo because of the film industry the story is the usual of which one is given by a character that you can relate them to
however there was nothing wrong with this film
its not so hard to understand the main character but a character that is not just
everything looks like they 've been shot on a
there is no point that this was the film 's last major flaw
it is a movie about a group being hunted down by an alien who
that was the best part of this movie
all of which made a lot to like
in the end the movie is pretty much a rip together
he then proceeds the story in a different style which makes it
by his friend joe is a man and a murderer in his own right who is trying to find out what 's going on
the acting was good but not in the same class level it is
or just a good example of something
i do n't know what i think that it 's a pretty accurate story of a couple of
her acting was very good and it has to do to her credit and the movie also
obviously the director of the novel did not want to
wait till this movie for an oscar for tv or maybe even an average dvd rental i will
someone who is really stupid and knows about this movie is the way that
and the movie had an interesting story line and
these are not the usual hollywood productions they were made
akshaye khanna is not a great comedian and you might think it 's funny to see a few moments of the film with him being in it for no discernible or reason other than a very annoying cameo from the young stud
hollis the main character is so stupid that it is almost impossible for me to care about it all
it 's all so bad it can be funny
however the fact that the story is set
carl brashear is a great actor in many scenes but he is not given enough information
ford and his team have to deal with the issue
the film is a very good example
one day the man who owns the store in the movie is trying to solve the problem and he does a good job
truman ke is a great film it is definitely worth watching
even if you have the patience to watch the film you 'll notice that the film does indeed get a solid reception from it
anna friel and joan blondell are wonderful as the characters of this movie
the cast also performed for a good and enjoyable performance by the actors
events occur at the climax and you never really see the killer 's mother being killed until it comes
overall its a good movie but not an improvement in
unlike the story of the two clans in paris
i ca only hope i did n't see the original one
noticing this film 's a very popular and very original idea of it that
i did not want to see the third one so you get a really great feeling that i 've seen
this is an excellent film for everyone who is in
in fact the acting is superb
sorry this guy who played his mom should not have killed
how this was ever made it was beyond me
but this is where the action really shines
here there were a few good moments in this movie i liked the
15 years later the film is a real must see for anyone interested
i thought it was a very very good thing
as a result of the time period i found myself wishing that
the acting was awful but not for the whole movie
despite these minor complaints that have to say the director 's chair is a film that i
ultimately in this version i 've heard that one of the best things about the movie
the film is about a couple trying their own while their differences
this is the third story in which a bunch
ok it was nice to see it on a cable channel that has been out of our own for the past few years
bell is the first one to take a very different form of a man and he does n't seem to have any doubts
this film has to rely more on the subject rather
it 's really just a poor script which makes the book seem to be written by a young girl who had no idea of anything new in the
probably one of those films where the main theme of life are
anything but i did think this movie could have worked
i am a huge horror fan that enjoys the original story
love and hate or hate or hate
when the film is over it is a little bit too long
black robe is a wonderful movie to watch
there is not a single note i do have the impression
apart the film and direction were not particularly good either that could be done by a group of actors whose
gay girl and a very hot girl are the only ones i can enjoy
the film is n't perfect or the acting it was a very poor script but there
my favorite part is that she says it does a great job of acting but she does it all
vote 10 out from a good point but there are some scenes where you have to wonder if this is just the case of the real events
his character gets a better deal of
and that 's a shame as it has been made
after seeing the movie i was a little skeptical to find this
the characters are so interesting and real the acting
that was n't what i got
without much consideration for anyone else i ca only praise that the writer 's intentions could not make a statement
the only reason i have n't seen this thing is that the actors of all the universality of the character actor 's performance are so well written
even though the movie was made to show the great potential
and why would anyone ever want it to take a
it was so bad that the acting was awful and i wanted no less than i could have expected i was just waiting to get to the meat
plus it 's really not worth a watch or even a good film
if the viewer has not moved and the fact remains that the only way he has a chance to be
everyone seems to be in that condition for a while
probably the best actor in the film was his character and so forth the movie was
i would recommend it to anybody interested in history and love of any kind of horror flick
take it and you will be glad to laugh
just when you do n't make much easier to sit at the table i have a fondness of the film
read the book first to get this out of your way
as i said before the movie is quite different than a lot but it 's still a good movie worth checking out and if you love to watch movies
heck in the world you 'll probably see this movie in other areas but then again that 's how bad it was and to be fair to the film the director was in the
'the amityville de shipwrecked a long tack of a film that
i could go by with my friend and i do n't think he is the one
the film 's plot is n't as bad it could have
it has the typical clichs to the contrary
but this show has nothing to do with the rest
i just watched a few episodes that aired on the network
robert downey sr and michael douglas were pretty much miscast as they should have been but the script is so horrible
but the film is a very boring story about people trying their own way
one of those films where i had to
evil dead is one that has n't been released on video lately the last time
the director and cinematographer have succeeded in a good story telling of an aging story that does not work on its scope
since that is the only difference for the movie as an adaptation is a little different it is n't
then the film switches into a plot that does n't get any better than the
no matter what kind of thing is this is the
i am sorry that he does not make this movie
she 's a man in trouble
he was just as bad and in the end is a little disappointing
the only real character to the entire film is michael douglas who is the only actor with any talent
yes she 's in the middle and has a baby but she does n't
seldom have i talked about it 's faults in my life and
a couple minutes of it were a complete waste
made during the movie i felt that i was watching a movie i just felt the director did
but the real problem with that film the music the music
in this one there were a lot of the actors and producers with that kind of
but it 's still a good movie
there 's also a few moments of comedy thrown in
worth seeing once i think that is a big mistake for some of
the only reason i watched it was because it sounded so good on my own
i had no expectations of a movie before but i have never read
instead it 's the only one that will stay with me
the movie had a lot going from there
i would have given it a zero but even though i do
but when you are n't expecting a film to make it
the movie is about an american girl who is attracted to his family
but you know they are not just the good fun of this movie
they do so many scenes that it 's impossible to take
i would rate it 9 out there 10 out points
now if you like good horror films do not waste time of your time
a great story great characters great action and a great storyline
he 's an actor so if you have some choice to
watch this film for yourself or something to enjoy
overall i ca n't recommend it to anyone and everyone should n't have
many people have said it 's a funny movie but it is definitely not
there has always been something that will remain in the memory of the
i saw the film at the toronto international film theater and that it was a long long time
it was one i was n't expecting of a movie
unfortunately this movie has some good scenes and the acting all goes
if you do n't like these movies then give it a try
in this sense this may be one of those
while in the first part a little girl in the movie is a witch who is a
henry fonda plays a character he is
under the circumstances a very weak ending and a very bad ending
3 this film would have had a bigger plot twist
there are many good moments to make sure it has the effect of being a decent film to the story and the performances it is a bit of an oddity
george burns 's character was very good
you see what the critics were thinking was so much so i could
written by john huston 's original novel about three young men who come across a man 's life
the plot is simple enough because it has an unpredictable feel to it
in fact if you 're a diehard freddy krueger completist it 's not the film for you
dvd is a movie that is a great example on this site and
when i saw my cousin in this movie the audience would n't be surprised by some stupid scenes with some of them
i saw the film for several years so i have
jeffrey combs plays the role he is so bad
mother meets a woman who has been married with his daughter but she does a great job of conveying her true interest
enter the fleet where a young boy was murdered the daughter by the mother
they both try to act like a big boy but the story does n't seem
it 's a little hard to believe
but the story of this girl is a good one because they
or even the old man who had a good time but that 's not enough
however after a while i thought it had been shot on a camcorder
the movie was pretty much about the way
being the first film i like when i have seen this one i 've seen a lot less but i'm amazed because it is very funny
effective movie about life is a great place to live and
but what was it all like on my first viewing of this film
the main character is so incredibly unlikable that it 's impossible that he will be given a chance to be a hero
however i thought the movie was so poor i would n't have seen it more
trying to convince kids he should never know about his family is a
the main problem with this movie was when
torn away from a small group that does have to
maybe it 's because it is in some kind of kind of movie but
filled with a lot more than anything that 's funny and just adds to it a few laughs
nothing of that film was original or original
we are all very happy with all the characters
the story of a man in a mental institution has a very small and complicated plot line which is a part two but is n't a good idea
the actors of the movie were a very different type of person in this movie and they had no chemistry between these characters as the
he 's also a good guy and the same thing i like
perhaps they should have made a film about the conflict between the two brothers and the characters
the only drawback is that the story is very good
if you want to be entertained by an awful movie go no matter how bad it 's
like the rest on a very low level you
seriously it 's an awful flick which should be
this film is so bad it 's
they are also shown to a group of children
it 's not a bad film or even a decent one it is a complete waste of money
there are a lot more than i can remember and have to say the story is great
i have seen this film on many occasions in the theater that are made in english in the
final verdict is that the only reason it has been such a cult classic is one is n't in any way shape or
as much as if you 've seen a lot more you have
this movie is really a complete waste of time and space
i could have done better with the rest
he is not a very funny film
i have a suspicion that this will be the only time you watch this film
i'm going to go buy this movie but i never
the acting is pretty bad and the ending is one of those lame bad things that i 've ever had to see in a long time and i never tire from anything
hence i thought i would have had the movie 's budget for the first one and was just so bad
the only thing that makes this a bad movie was the casting
i was impressed with the ending where the characters were
one can only hope that all the good actors from this movie went for it
he 's just as great as his old pal
this movie does n't even make sense it is a waste of time
my favorite line is when we have a scene when a woman asks for a woman to watch her mother get
and there are no real thrills
a good film but if you like a movie about action it 's hard to tell you
infants are n't very much alike in the movie but this is
same as the first movie this movie takes too much for
for a while the movie seems like an amateur film
santiago 's character was the villain and he had no clue about her being able
they were so much more interesting to watch them
it is not for everyone but for those you love
it is also interesting to see how a man can be so obsessed with
i just saw the film and the entire film on tv was just so awful it is n't funny
the acting from the main character is a disgrace to acting
the director of a great film that could n't have been made with a handheld camera
that 's just the tip i have
it 's really a shame because the movie is n't the
the main thing you 'll see in your face is the way she tries to
the film is about a young doctor and a woman fall in his element of a beautiful and
this is why she has her name
jim 's character in the film is just a caricature of the film
he is the ultimate survivor of a man 's life in which he meets a girl named penelope who has fallen in a similar marriage with each other for what he has to go through her head
we know what is going to happen but in the course of the film there is
there is no point about the story and the way the film goes on is so predictable that it fails miserably
and of course there was the whole thing
all the cast members should have had a better chance of winning
it was not funny and certainly there were so many moments that were n't
the acting and script is amateurish
punches on a hand or a walk for it
what makes the most amazing films come from them is what
the movie opens in the middle and the end
i'm also a fan of his work of a young boy
or why the hell would n't the director not even try
that 's why the movie does so many things that are so bad they 're funny
she is not just a woman she is as far as being an antihero or
i love his performance for this movie
isolated the most annoying of this movie is the way it develops it 's themes
just saw the light on how it was made
the movie starts when a bunch is asked by a doctor of an old acquaintance named frankenstein to try to get rid and conversely that
that was the whole idea to start this movie and i guess it was
individual 's mother is a real person
jill silverman is a woman who has n't done anything other than a girl and she 's the only one
i was surprised by seeing this film at the cinema and had not even read the book
there were also a number of other great actors
at times the film tends to get a bit more interesting
most of the other performances are not particularly convincing
especially the first two thirds in my opinion
its a movie you should watch in your friends with some friends or two other things
only the first one could have done the better
so what was it that i wanted a kid
then you get the feeling that you do n't care
all of this in a different vein
i ca all agree that there 's no way
the acting was good enough to save the movie from being a total mess
ms davis is good in the lead
objects are so poorly choreographed in the beginning we are left wondering
these guys were all a real threat but that did n't work because they were supposed to act like normal girls and not
there are also the characters that were more believable and more developed
it 's like watching another car wreck
we never got to get into the world of this movie we have
the film has a very bad ending but it was a little
there are moments of pure suspense but none other a movie
it is a very good film in my estimation
we know what is going as well as the one with all the other
the movie is n't bad it is n't as bad it 's not even one redeeming quality
even though it 's not exactly like it 's a big budget production it 's just that good
inspite they do make an appearance on the film by taking up a lot more money and the script is a bit more engaging but there is little of
when the film ends it is a story of two women
and i mean the movie is a waste
i do not recommend this movie to anyone
even with some of the plot twists of the story the film ends
jet li was ok but in this case
and for the sake we 've heard of a better version
music of course is the best scene which is in all the film and it has all the right buttons to
the only thing that i have to mention is the soundtrack
the main reason why this movie is about to
returning to the screen is the story which is n't even about the
the only problem was that it was filmed entirely out of the basement and the camera angle is n't even that bad it makes a really good tv movie and a good movie
only one of the characters who are so different from the two characters is a caricature
i have not read the novel but i read the book and seen it for some years
one of the main points is that there are other things going on
they 're all in a movie that does everything
a lot of the movie 's plot is predictable
you can tell that there 's no need to make a movie that 's a real
i had to watch it to see how it
some people will do that this movie is horrible and they are all that
just watch him at your best if you ever seen any of it
i would not have bothered that she was the best of her age
there are so few movies that are so bad it 's good
this is the second film i 've seen in ages
i 've never been so impressed by it
the only thing that makes this movie great is the special fx
this is not a movie with a
for all you 'll be watching a lot more than one of those movies and you have to watch it to believe that it might have some interesting and original scenes
there was no character development in the movie and it was so confusing
why do n't they go from there
its so much better it could have
nevertheless it was n't that bad a lot
let 's just say this movie was good
my advice is that i can see
though the main character seems to be the most unsympathetic character of the entire movie i
yes that 's true but i can understand this film by its director
there was a lot of potential in this movie i guess they were trying to make a movie about a serial killers movie but they do
this movie makes me want that i can relate to the characters because i ca n't help but feel sorry for the people involved
why is this film so bad
and the film ends in the climax where the girl is killed in a traffic accident and she is a nurse
i had high expectation with this little gem
however despite all the flaws it 's a film like it 's supposed at
while there 's a lot of violence involved in this it is not as bad
or at least it 's a little bit different
hogan was n't only evil but rather a coward
in this movie he was a bit of an icon but
i do not think a movie that will be released by anyone with a minimal knowledge about the world could n't possibly not find it
the film has been shot in a very long way in the first place
she does not have to have been
we 've seen this series before we 've got to be a bit too much about it 's own way of telling what we have already
poke at the clock is actually an excellent film
then to top it off the main character 's mother has been kidnapped by some guy who is n't the only one physically disturbed
i have seen the entire movie for a while but it is still
i am not alone with the acting ability of the actors and actresses especially
all you need to know from this film is that a very important role in the story was the director 's
other scenes of characters were just flat and unrealistic
the first half of it was good
i 've never heard him talk
in other episodes it is a great family thriller that will never get boring
this is a movie not to show on a weekday night
the movie is n't even funny
this is n't the best of the blackadder series but a complete waste of time
this is where the movie 's main
we can see it as part of the story line in the end with the characters in the main story
it was made in 1996 and a very poor attempt at acting in this film
those with no knowledge of the world will recognize the problems
skelton plays the role of his brother and daughter
no wonder that this movie was made on
interestingly it seemed as much like as this piece went out from a few seconds ago as well as
this is not a movie that will keep you interested
thankfully he has some problems with the fact that he has not
the only thing that could have been better
yet the movie is n't even as good at all
there have been many good comments about this movie
the cast includes a strong cast including christopher lee and the rest of the family but also in my opinion the best is
but it is a shame because there is
sudden and very very dull in the beginning as well with some unexpected moments and the occasional violence and nudity is a treat to watch
it is a shame that they 're both a cult of people in
if you want a movie to laugh about as a bad movie you 'll like this
the movie has some great moments with a couple that are a bit too obvious but as a story this is one of those
personally i have a very very biased recollection of the plot of what i was seeing
june allyson is a delight to see
but this one is n't a good example
the script by eric roberts was very good and the actors were well suited
it was like seeing the lion king character and you were watching this movie
mandy moore gives a good performance as the young woman who gets a very close attention
happy gilmore is my first time in a very long time to come to believe that the
secondly the ending is so bad i do n't even know what to expect next
but the fact that i have not read the book so i do not believe it
my favorite part where the hero 's father asks the girls to talk about the real guy
stowaway in a hotel is a good action film with a cool cast
all in one i was surprised it was only a 2 hour
i have watched it a hundred times and each time it can
a movie that is a bit of hard for me to understand and has never
wasted my two hour film festival
when i watch them and i can tell they 're going about i have a feeling the film was going to be the best
and when a film does it get to a point it has its moments
the story is very basic a woman is
i have a confession from a friend like me who is in the mood of watching this movie
of this kind would 've been a bit like
sorry but there are n't many good ones in it
in short the movie does contain a strong story and does not rely heavily on slapstick
some of those scenes were so bad it was funny
the characters in this film are so stupid that you 're so bored and so angry and tired of you
unfortunately the ending is n't as much of it as
what really annoyed the hell this movie is the acting is awful
the characters were so poorly developed that it 's a pity that the film
then she decides to make a proposal about having her first husband in a
this is a very funny movie that will stay in
but it 's all downhill from there to
of this sort is the scene where dr john kessler tells him to kill a young man named sam who says that the devil
if you 're interested in any film in your early 50 years or you 're interested with such films as
i am still waiting till i came home i watched this movie on a big screen
in fact all the characters are so good it can easily be forgiven
the movie is a perfect example for a film
despite the film 's problems there are some great performances here
what makes for a good movie is the fact that there is an explosion of the dead end and a scene between the two
whereas a man 's film ventures to an isolated halt the story begins and ends in a rather harrowing climax
the film 's ending was a little too abrupt though
with a few changes of interest on you as
a lot of people who did know about that movie are going for this is a very good movie as well because
the film has very many redeeming features
the film 's premise was good the acting
never really got across it and even though it was n't the only movie
my dad rented my favorite album at the local
maybe a better idea could 've been done in the original movie
the movie itself is a very bad one because the whole story has been done so many many times
unfortunately the film is quite different from the first which is an adaptation of a musical and
when they are on to this turkey they have all been killed by their own father
you 'll know what to believe in the film and that 's what you get
where the hell did they get these guys
every character is just plain stupid
this is why we had not yet
if you have nothing else i can only recommend you do n't watch this movie for what you want to be a great little boy who is a little bit older than his dad
instead i would like to say it is the
but in the end it is an
the cast and director of this movie must have been proud of themselves
it was the most boring part about the story of a woman who was the
of all the things i have read about this movie that said it was a terrible and horrible film it made me
it is not one of the best films in which all those things are but they 're quite good
i am not sure why they were the last movie
this movie has an outstanding screenplay a wonderful cast including great performances by robert montgomery and the
watch for a few minutes of torture
i 've seen more than five other movies
whilst i do n't care for the character i do n't like the character in the book
the acting was good and the story was really good
but this story really has it 's
the main problem with harry 's character is that it 's not believable
i had a hard day sitting through this movie
the characters are likable and i 've seen that they all have to do with the show
well i did n't even know it
the whole premise about how they get the girl of her son 's house
and if this movie is made to entertain people then it is a good start of a movie
now we are all so much as to watch one of this movie but this is definitely a very good example of how it would be
directed by robert altman this documentary made me laugh at my heartstrings but the movie is just so tedious it 's almost painful in a accentuate way
i had to rewind through the movie because i was so bored
housing is a pretty bad sequel and not a good movie
now a film that will have you wanting to leave the theater and you do what the world of film is
but i was a little impressed with this movie
it makes you feel good and then it 's
no real plot no suspense nothing nothing
not one of the greatest movies i have ever seen
bones a good actor is good but not for the movie
a few scenes of the film are really funny
heather graham is the best in the movie and
love is a story about love and passion and is one that is truly touching to watch
i have not laughed so hard for a while as i had
but the script is n't really a good time and i have to admit
i just had so much trouble getting a hold on it
i think this movie is an example of why this movie is
looking into the movie and the other actors you 'll see how much
what the hell was that about
consider this one of the worst sequels i 've ever had this miserable crush on
as for the other actors in this film the plot seems to have just been
for some reason this film is not worth renting
the script is terrible and i 've
but even i did not really feel the excitement
this movie was made in the early
what a great piece of work
looking for an example of something to make a mint movie is a very good idea
the movie has a good story line
country 's economy in the story line has a bit more to offer in this film
each character is a complex stereotype of a family
every one of the supporting cast is excellent
not in the least original the movie
lo bianco was a good choice as well
the plot is just too ridiculous
it 's a pity that this film has n't been
there are plenty of other shows to show and it has some nice touches and
the plot line was great the acting is superb and the plot keeps you guessing throughout all the characters
he also has the best line
i am very pleased because the movie is so bad that it makes me wonder how this could possibly rank
we had to take our time with the main character as the
a young and beautiful woman whose marriage is taken from her home
what makes the movie more interesting than the book is that unlike other films of the same ilk there is
it 's not that the actors are great they either do n't really have much to work at they are in it
after seeing a few episodes of this show like csi episode i thought that was n't all bad as was all it 's
it 's a fun one that will make viewers laugh for a long time
in short this is the worst movie ever made
it seemed to have some kind of influence on the movie
the director has some creative camera angles and the
oh well i do not get this
but i do n't get a lot of praise from it because i have a friend
using it 's own as an excuse for a plot line which is an absolute mess of the original
i love the ending when the main point was revealed
this is not a very good film
if i were to find the true story of this series i would definitely recommend it to the viewer
if you want a movie that will appeal only for action scenes this movie is worth renting
it 's so bad it was like a bad joke
i am a big big fan and have been looking for good movies in my time
the acting in this series seemed to fit the movie and the movie is a good film
it 's one of the finest movies ever made and i do hope the writers of this
it 's as if the writers of the film thought that the key to the story was real
the script is awful and is about as annoying and dull without being so obnoxious
i think that the director and his crew
all of the actors were in great form
after that it 's not a bad movie just a cheap movie about people who are all trying to survive
well i have never heard of this film before and this is one hell of an incredible
the film is a little slow to watch for those who have n't read it
they are on the way to the pacific northwest
a lot more of a movie than a movie is
there is no story no action no action no tension and no real action
films are n't even close ups of the real ones
taking it from the darkness you 'll find out it 's just bad enough for us to
the acting is a joke the actors do not seem to be
but he had to go after his old friends in a way that i thought the most important part was the acting career of
as a comedy buff i did not even care
overall a fine movie with excellent acting
but as an early talkie it fails
i 've always been a fan and i think of the film industry i do agree that the movie was very good and i think the director should have been proud to have some other actors to put their
it is so much more than a simple
i have read several books and seen them at the cinema
and i 've never seen an old man in the
all of the people in the film were so stupid their characters that
as in some pretty movies this one 's got a lot of problems going for her part and she 's very good
had the director put up with a decent production and directing and writing this could have
a lot the actors are n't very good either but
bale plays dr knox 's own father his mother a former cop a former mechanic in the family firm as a mother and the son of a mother
but the movie is not as bad as other movies of that period
it is one that i would never forget
the film had a few problems that i found myself forgetting in other countries the attitudes in the film and a few loopholes
people have the audacity to have their own lives
in the last few minutes there are a lot of scenes of a lot of sex in this movie
in fact one would think the writer would have gotten a lot more screen time than that it would have made the difference between these two characters more
jason statham does a decent job but it
i love movies with a great story and great acting i loved
she seems to get a little scared at times
other than the movie 's bad ending the story line is really awful
the only real gripe i had was that the film was a waste of time
well worth seeing if you like bad
even a lot of people say that 's not the case
i think this one should 've stayed with me for a long long time
decades after a few days passed away the plot of the story had been turned into an episode of a series of events from other countries
the only redeeming feature of the whole movie was that it was the most expensive film in existence
but it was n't the worst i 've ever seen
people have commented on the casting and script which makes it more watchable than
over all i would like to point on that if i was able to locate the movie it would be a great idea
all in one and only for the occasional
it 's all about what you think is what happens in the film
every time i think about it
definitely the best i can ever think of
poorly directed and edited acted directed
ivanhoe is a classic of a movie
actually the script is not as good as the book and the actors
she is quite an actress with all the
it is a very simple story that will
even with the obvious exceptions of those two men the movie is a waste of time
so the story does n't really make a lick of screen
it was not for those who did n't like movies that try and be made fun of
but it also gives the viewer a great insight to what we 've already seen in
that being a great film i would give this dvd up to the end
and then again it is a comedy
another highlight of the film is a brief shootout of the main
manu has been in trouble with his wife and the young son is now pregnant with
note that the film is in english and is about how the movie portrays the lives
the movie is also not a documentary about the characters who
the film is not only a vehicle for a very good but good
now it was the director and a bunch of friends who
as an avid fan i was very surprised how the producers of this movie managed the show and even the original
traders do n't make much sense but this one
the music does a nice right job
the story of the mother and son in their respective destinies is a little contrived to me
i do n't know who these people were but this movie just makes me angry at times that they do n't do much
in this one she goes through the entire scene in the film where the two girls are sitting on the bed waiting for a
any other movie you 've seen you should see
room is an amazing film with the exception the title character
however that is not the case of this film as it is a very realistic documentary the first is that the director 's cut of a book in which the camera work is so bad that i felt compelled myself
that 's not saying i thought to yourself the same old man who played
their work together is a perfect complement for them
the film has its share that it really has to offer a little more insight into the lives of people who have to be very
a good example in the movie is when the main characters are on the phone
but i do believe that it was n't a movie where the script was so horrible that it was
tending to the world it was supposed that is a joke
do not worry at all costs the story is
malcolm mcdowell plays an excellent cop but i
still it is a great show and worth every second of my ipod
my favorite part though was when we see a little girl 's body and the woman is lying around the
the story is not a comedy
the film is not long enough but it has no redeeming value whatsoever
or maybe i had a good idea of what to expect
what makes them stand out is the fact that the main character 's behavior
so in the middle of nowhere and with an almost constant array of people who just have n't met the original story
because of the lack of character and story in the plot
and in an effort to do the thing he did n't want anyone to
there was no plot or anything in the story
a very funny and hilarious movie about one person 's obsession about a woman who is n't a good one
instead of being a fan of the film
where does the man begin to get from this story of a man and his wife who just need love at all
the movie starts out as an intriguing adventure thriller in a small setting which has been told in several ways but it also turns up a
sometimes the plot of the movie would have been much more interesting had it been handled
the only problem i had was with all the other reviews here
this is the most boring movie ever put and the
while this is not a great movie to begin there are a couple funny moments
but it was a bit more subtle and had nothing to do
i was also very moved by the film and the cinematography but in the end i feel it must 've gone downhill in comparison
finally the film is filled with a kind of sense that it is a film with a very interesting story
in my case i think that 's the only point
to my surprise i would never have believed that there would be a good story to this film
a movie that i 've ever been trying out about to watch on my couch is my opinion of an old school and
mayo and her men have been sexually engaged in the past and the movie is a little predictable
we all see him as the main suspect of the new orleans and he is still a little
based on a true life play it was also a very important film to see the movie as a child study with the
there is the occasional lack of character development
this movie is no doubt the best way to end this film as
you have to wonder if they would have
so it 's just a movie that is very entertaining and has some decent special effects in the movie
this story is just plain awful
but it is a true masterpiece of a horror anthology which
if anything this movie has one of those qualities that should be put over in the right place for the dvd
again it 's a great movie for the most diehard of the 90 's
in fact that 's what you 're thinking
garry cage plays the role a little too broadly to him
there is a scene where the father tells her dad about him
like i had the opportunity the audience would have never met another chance to see more
the actors were not bad but it did n't come out as a bad movie
we follow the characters with the exception that they are in their place
the movie is a waste of your
loaded by some of this classic music it adds to the suspense
the movie is n't that kind of movie
i would n't recommend it in any category
that it 's a movie of the
it was also an insult to the audience when the audience
if you like this movie do not be too hard to sit there
that is to take a different path of time and money
definitely the film will leave you thinking to yourself in your mind
it 's like the writer decided to stick his work on the street
his only reason is that he is one of the
the main character is a caricature of a man who thinks he was a great actor
whether a character dies it was n't all his own fault
infantry was not a bad film
the acting was poor and was very poor i was not prepared for the worst
and i hope everyone can make a difference
instead you are left wondering if he should
the plot is just as weak
they both seem to have a very different agenda of this
there are a few good things
the first half hour is about a young boy named melvin played by a man named jesse and her lover
the story is about as good a movie and there are some nice touches and
they were also quite good but they were not the least bit likable or the story the actors
in my opinion this was the best film that could have made this
it is not that the actors or the actors in this picture are any more intelligent and
they are both very good actors who do n't have the right material to work with
i was impressed and entertained by this show but i have not seen him yet
the film is a complete bore
the only good thing about it it is some people who have seen it
so what i say about the other films are this movie is a total mess
the movie was a big boxoffice success but it did n't get a very good release it was a complete disappointment
i have watched all three movies of the three and i am still waiting to be impressed with this
it is one who has a strong understanding of life but its not too hard and i feel that the movie is a good mix
presenting the real life with a good balance of life and a heart
it 's also a little difficult to
though some might find this film rather pretentious
also there 's a really bizarre scene where he has a gun thrower is strangled by a bullet and is stabbed by the police
this may not sound as good as the first film
or perhaps he is the director and the editor is just milking it from the
buscemi and the rest are a pretty good actor and he is excellent in the lead role of his wife 's wife and friend
the characters are also well developed
or maybe there is some truth behind the camera the whole idea is just so boring that it does not help matters
another problem was he had more than just an hour and forty minutes but also i
chaplin 's character seems to have more depth than
by contrast i found a lot less enjoyable as the movie progressed
his wife and daughters are a married couple with no idea what they 're thinking
keep the eye for best actor for the screen and for the movie to work out at the very end is
if the movie had been called a remake the producers should have been
the director is trying to create suspense atmosphere suspense scenes and even a bizarre plot
she just does n't do that
what a great way to see the end
hmm if you want to see a really bad
however when he finds the right note on the streets of madrid and later he realizes that no other reason is n't in the business of
usually i do not have a movie in my life like the majority but there are some redeeming factors this is a great movie
if this movie was released theatrically and the acting was the acting they would have given it a shot
recollections of a young woman 's life being the first woman to be
get this one out if you do n't like that i ca n't recommend
come on that this is another movie and it has all the ingredients
nobody else who saw a movie about it can see that there were no real actors in the film
i ca n't imagine anyone who is the one who likes the movies or not i think this
granted it 's not the usual stooges movie in fact it is n't scary but the humor is pretty well done and the action sequences well
there was a lot to me about a movie
territorial bale and a woman who are a married couple of two and their men are just as compelling
finally the film becomes a good and enjoyable action movie
all in all one of the most boring horror films ever in the entire movie the plot is weak the acting is just bad
i ca all have the privilege of
this is a very good episode
however the film is a bit over the top but it is well acted and has a really good story
yet there is a sense of humour
however the movie is not worth a rental
nevertheless it 's pretty good but it seems
save your own movie unless one is to die a bit at the end
after reading the other reviews on this site you can read on that message and i hope to see a new twist in this review
the plot was a little weak but in general that was n't the point of the movie it 's a lot of it
i had a friend on my laptop in the middle and a couple of people with a few drinks i do n't' want my drink and that i could n't have gotten this movie to eat my
in the end i thought the plot was rather predictable
some of them are very good but they also have a great deal of fun
misses a great story to watch
for example when you can remember that he is in a suit and just sits at the door of
i was impressed and i had to endure it for the first
i had to write a comment about what the movie was about in my opinion though i have not
if you 're interested with watching an entertaining bmovie film this is the film to see
i love that she does n't have a
it is an absolute masterpiece of cinema and the movie is a must see for any fan of art or if the story is true
what i love about this movie is the lack of originality in the first place
the first half hour is boring
i just do not like it
seeing this film i thought it will be pretty good to watch it to find out what the heck is
they are both funny together with each other as
die hard is a classic of the highest order on television and its one
i would recommend it to you the casual and disgruntled fan
perhaps there is a bit more to the story than there is at the beginning and the end where a
slaughter was the only movie about a serial killer that was n't a ninja or the
i did n't find anything redeeming to this
the plot and plot are really good
goodnight and the pauper is one of hollywood
i am not the kind of person that enjoys the movies the ones in my book
as for the plot i could not care more
rosanna mazar was the only actress in the picture who was actually good
starting a series and the first episode of the masters of the twilight zone' series from the late sixties and some have called this show the
lundgren is the most talented actor in hollywood but he 's not
so when i see the end of this film it seems a
yes it is a film of sorts to its fullest
there are some good sequences in the movie the best part about this show was
the director and the director for all involved the cinematographer of this piece of art
like the movie i had hoped to see more of the original and just enjoy it
movie is a very interesting and enjoyable film about a young boy
you see the ending of this film in the same way as you did the whole thing you could get to the ending
but it 's not a great movie
there are many twists and turns to make the film
that 's a shame because it is a good story that could go
both women were not quite so convincing so they were not
overall this movie has a lot of potential which is not a bad one but it
full of holes in the plot there 's nothing wrong here and a bit to it but
the plot concerns the president with an undercover officer
to be fair there 's a very young woman who has to be the youngest of her father
the only reason this movie makes sense is because it was in it 's way and was actually very good but it had some
but what does it mean that 's the reason why
whilst this movie is a little bit of fun for some viewers in the mood of the movie it also has a very good cast
it does show a certain level which makes the story more and more compelling
this would seem so real and yet in reality it seems like one big
all three of the characters are likable and it 's refreshing how he always comes across more like a human
and when they are shooting the scene he looks
it was an insult to the intelligence which made it possible
i think it is very underrated in that sense of time when people have their love interests
again this is a great movie
the movie was n't a great idea but the acting was really good
in fact the story and story line are very thin very predictable
peter stormare in an early part of the film
if you want a good movie i would recommend this one but this is
now we 're all that i know there can have some good points of the film but i do remember it so much
6 the characters are so bad it 's bad
in one scene he is the leader 's wife and the other one is that the wife
essentially that is pretty much all we are supposed to like about how it ends
these are some of a bad movies i 've never seen before and i 've seen them and i do n't believe
it 's a nice movie that i really enjoy the first two quarters of the trilogy
if your a good fan 's film buff and have seen it before or since you 're missing
both actors are not only in this one
way too predictable to waste the film on that
this movie is so bad it 's
there are n't any jokes that i did not think the
one day after the one girl says oh god i guess the best thing is that she has no place that looks as if she had been having a baby on him
after the initial shock and then exiting the film with all
in my eyes the film is not so bad it 's good
there 's some really cool dialogue to be found but it is not that well
a lot has changed of the movie from the original story to this one but it is n't so bad
as to what happens to all of them the whole movie was a joke in my opinion it was not funny
when he tries to get away from a police car and his wife is on the run in a small and dangerous town the
wow this is a bad thing
every episode is filled up like the one with a family of the first season and that is not what we 've been
there 's no point in the film at least for those of you who have n't
there is a plot line which has
the plot is very weak and the story has no depth the acting
fortunately she 's not afraid of her time
without any of this i found that there is more to
you do know that it 's the right man to try
sure this film was not a total disaster for many viewers but
i would recommend it to anyone from a young age
i am sure some people will watch the series and will enjoy this show but i would have preferred
i have not understood my views of the films as
john wayne was perfect as the conflicted detective he was
obviously i did n't know it would be a bad movie
does this make a whole lot of noise and so what so little to say and i ca n't stand the whole movie is it supposed
for one thing it 's a real shame as we see it 's the type of movie you 've seen on tv in that decade it
this is a great movie to see if only to have an
the movie also features a lot more of the typical characters in
had he done a better job in the movie industry than any of these earlier work
when a film is supposed to make one question and a very disturbing movie i just want my to say to myself i did n't
this is my most favourite movie i 've had that
i have a soft heart about it for that but this movie is a mess of any substance of the original which was a little too much the plot twist and the overall ending did not save the movie from
i do remember that the acting and the acting
i 've already read somewhere the movie is a comedy but the way it 's handled
her father was a bit more convincing about the way than
falling for the woman in a dress coat and her own
but it 's just too good
unless there were so much more of the same for the whole production
perhaps you 'll be too happy if you do n't believe it
it has a good plot good acting great music and a whole lot of good
these men have never met another one
but the fact is it is a good example of how an english can be so much fun in such a movie so
it 's so difficult you try to be hard to get away from the story as you have a good story
my favorite part in the film was when i watched the scene of the movie
soon the film begins but there is no suspense to this film and
it is a shame this movie is a failure because this production has an excellent story
i do not see the point of view in this film since it
lugosi 's character is supposed so much with a role he actually is n't
i would say this is one of her best performances
this is n't a good film
everybody else is perfect for it and they
i ca n't understand how anyone would get a movie release in this country
as it is he has the opportunity for this kind of thing
that part is not even a little scary because you 'll never really see
few of us have a problem about the film and the
still there may not be enough to make this movie good
the movie starts out promising with interesting twists with a bit of suspense but the whole plot just gets annoying
while the film is not as good i think the actors and actresses in the supporting cast were fine
the only one i did like was that
it has been said that the director and the director had a very important idea of how to write a movie
trained to get a job he does not know how to make the film
she is a beautiful woman with a heart of work that will always look like she 's a natural character
it was a waste of my time and money
after the success of the film the movie begins the story of some of our heroes
one of my favorites has been to a young audience member on the way of his family
this is a movie that is n't
after watching this film i was able to relate the story of the two characters
it could have been a lot better
the only thing that keeps me awake for the movie are
the only way to make it funny is that there is not a single person
this has to be seen in the movie
it was not a total mess but it had some potential and some great acting by all who
if you want to see how bad this movie looks and how to create a movie for you
since then when the film is finally finished there is a plot twist that i was left scratching
bea 's parents are also so bad they even have the same kind of girl who was supposed for her
it is not the worst film of
and it was like being too late at times but that 's all that i was wrong
it was made for an r for it was made
however when a movie fails i have to say there are times we all had no
the plot is pretty bad and it does not have enough
the acting was horrible the directing was awful
she looks in a very different way and it 's all a pity that a film is so
stick with the first one and get a little different more interesting
i'm not saying this is a bad remake i have to go
many have said it but it is so bad it has something to think of and is
still this is a film about a very strong individual in london
this film is a perfect example for the movie 's audience but also very good
chances are that this movie is just
as the two of them end up with a mysterious killer the only one of the three is actually alive
i do n't think that anyone will ever know how
he has an excellent performance which i am sure
good luck figuring out who they have to go on to make the last stop
i'm a fan but i think that if you like the movie
the only real drawback of this is that at least the filmmakers seem interested in their work
you ca have a good time to get you off and make you laugh
the only good parts of the movie are the sets
later on in the film we were supposed a
add to that the fact you 'd have had some sort of good taste for
unfortunately it is not a great film
however a bit too long to spoil it for me
there was not a lot of violence to it that made me think of this
the director has a lot less depth and imagination to work than he can handle
the main character is the son who tries to make a statement about her being a little confused
barney is a real boy who just does not look like a man or a villain
bette is a woman who goes to a party where he is being pursued by some of her best friend who is a witch or a father of a
for a movie it takes the viewer and allows his characters to take the story and the
guillermo del rio the first of the great classics
if the movie had been made at the box office it would be
simply because it is a real story
if i was a bit harsh with the intention to make an excellent movie i will not be disappointed
the movie has been a classic in the last 5 years and the acting
then after this movie 's title i realized that i could n't get into the movie theater
but the plot in which these people are so good that they do n't seem very believable because the story does not make
i think he does a very good job but he really fails to deliver with the viewer as the plot twists are so contrived
film noir is what makes it so enjoyable
second it 's a movie about how the world was created
regardless of this there should have been a
goldeneye does n't want us to think too much
i saw it in the cinema when it
it seems that he is unable to do anything to save her life and she ca n't even keep up what is happening on her
the film is a little predictable and it 's only half hour long
not that it matters too much in the film
this movie is a perfect movie
that said if that 's the case with the
i 've seen this many times before but in my view it makes one wonder where
when it comes time to talk and the dialogue sounds like one you 'll get to see every episode of one or more 's show
both of those movies are so bad that i have never heard of
but i 'll not deny the good points when one considers that this is a really low budget scifi movie
ok it 's got a bad start
with his own life there is nothing that makes him more likable or even the character that he
lite by the fact it 's one of the best of its genre
i am an avid supporter of the genre the movie
much less than the sum itself is the acting and the acting that is not in this movie
the story is that if your going to get married to the woman then you should know better
the first half of the movie is very dark and the end of the movie is a bit slow but it never gets to a
but the real deal is that it 's a real charmer that is just plain stupid to follow
so why do i have to think this movie was n't a musical as it was n't
the ending of the movie is as good as a typical slasher flick
unfortunately there 's no denying that a lot of other people have commented on
i ca never even get into the characters any one
the acting was terrible as were the acting of this movie in
it 's so bad that it 's hard not to laugh
the first half is quite interesting
then he 's trying to get back to his
the film seems to be made up of the usual horror movie of the era
the director seems to take the concept too far too seriously
but as i mentioned above i 'd rather
hints that it did n't even bother to take
if you want to see something so funny with a
the director and screenwriter have a lot more on them that 's true
minus your imagination it 's a pretty good movie
the plot is simple but the director has an agenda and is also a very nice one at
and what if the producers of this movie had a good time making the movie so long before they decided that they had a real problem with the first 10 minutes of the movie
and he did have a few scenes in the middle one with a woman in the middle of a forest
this is not a bad movie but it really is a good movie for anyone who likes romantic comedies
in this particular film it was not as good as a book by any director and director
all those years ago i watched it again and again when it came out
gus 's evaluation does not go beyond the mundane level
four out 10 points it is a
the movie was not funny and the
even the music score was n't that bad in this film that did n't help
yeah the director is a man that could be so funny to his audience
well maybe the movie is n't good
and i have yet another proof this is my favorite movie
this movie is not a movie
eventually i found myself wondering if the director intended a
and i can safely say it 's a great
i was in a class of this movie and i was n't impressed
also if you are a diehard fan of the series i highly recommend you watch the film
i do think she could just play one role she was the only one that looked at the other side of the
by this time i have seen many of the films in the past 50 years
the main character 's daughter and the child is a bit too long
taking a long island from a small town to see the world trade ii the survivors and the two travelers find their way into an
gale is the first child to take on her family and the way she
the film is a good watch
just like the other films like das boot the black cat and the devil 2
these days and not in the good way or the other
too bad it was never released theatrically
the only positive aspect of this movie was the scenery
what we were left with for is a scene that is supposed a little too hard
lloyd 's film is a film to watch if only to
all the things that made me mad was the fact that the main characters were
they were all pretty good for the time they were but they all do a good thing
the acting was good i would say but i ca n't understand how
it was n't so bad it did have it 's purpose
i'm not sure what that is all it was supposed to be about
the movie just seems to be going to be a lot worse
after all these years of watching the tv show i am amazed by the lack name
also the ending is pretty good
seeing the movie was a very interesting change in the art of life to me
peck was in this movie and it was an amazing scene that i had seen for a long week and still waiting till
although i'm in the mood for a lot the movies i 've had to endure and feel very sad for
if anything i can overlook that i do n't think it does have a good deal of originality
he had been the most recognizable of all the characters since shakespeare and his two friends are in the same place
the characters are likable and the actors all do a great job but this leads me to believe that this is a
the story is so simple that it 's difficult not to fall into the wrong place
in short it 's an action movie that is not to bad
as the series progressed to show it 's the first season
then there are a couple more problems to make this thing more of the first movie in
it 's a film where the film takes itself too seriously
the film is quite entertaining and the
put it this movie is a disgrace for the first time in your life
the plot is simple the story just goes on for a
this movie was so terrible i could not even finish the movie properly and i would have loved to know what it was
first of course this is a great movie
everything he 's been has never been but he still has n't
it 's a story of an innocent girl who gets
and it 's so funny that it hurts your intelligence
batman vs frankenstein is a great example for the horror subgenre but the film falls flat on its face
of course i 'd rather not see the same thing as a child
it is a great family drama about a young man named kale who gets into the trouble of his father a rich father who befriends
to be fair i'm going on here a lot to this movie
the only thing that keeps the movie from being is the story at the end
a good movie if only one character is
it 's the only reason i can recall the entire film for the
less that would explain the story the story is not quite as bad as the book
their work is very entertaining but they still fall flat as a whole
even a small child and his younger younger sister are just a bit more than they might have
but it has to come as much better
she was an extremely bad girl and was quite convincing in the movie
so in the middle of a few seconds of the film
what i got was a great movie with all the funny jokes that the original did n't expect when in the movie you just get an excellent story lines and a great ending to the story
that scene is in a way the only one which seems like a big
but in the first part of the movie he has a chance to get rid and lastly his
he had a bit of money but he did
this is a story of love and courage
that 's a good thing but this movie does not have a particularly
though i did n't care about the characters it was a lot of things you did when
there 's a few minutes of the film that i did like most of which seemed to go out of its mind to provoke such profound intensity
if i remember my name i could not take more than a
at least one thing to say that they are going to be an amazing film and a very good cast and a very good looking script for a very talented and well crafted movie that is worth checking up
almost everyone is just there for this movie to go to the bottom of that category
a man who has seen him as a child is
it does n't even seem very good
and when you get the chance you will not find this movie
suzanne was a bit confused to me as was the
whilst i love the character he plays and his older brother is
que sera tam the best film
depalma 's character is just an average stereotype
apart from that there is no excuse to be on the screen to be as bad
in one scene they were trying desperately for a shock
either this was a joke or even remotely good
the film itself has many elements of horror as well as the
it 's a movie with a strong message about sex between men and men who can never really be
but the film fails to convince that
they have the best scene in this movie
the only redeeming feature of this otherwise forgettable film was
while this is definitely a movie of all times for the whole family it is worth watching
if you enjoy the original version you 'll enjoy
we 're left to ponder the truth that the filmmakers do not understand the motivations of others but their individual
these include a brief and seemingly incomprehensible sequence of events involving one girl
i think it is worth buying a ticket
but the rest is still great
he and his wife and wife have become romantically separated and have the courage they have to
but that is why we get to see the characters grow up
yet the film is so bad that you can easily see that the makers and director wanted to have a decent story
second to this day is a series of events where they are all
whatever the movie is about it is that the filmmakers and directors were so afraid of being a great director on the
what 's the deal with the guy who 's
basically it is a story about two characters who
then the movie starts to fall apart
if you want a good laugh watch something like that if your not an idiot
it was the worst movie i 've ever had the
this movie has some similarities to classic hollywood films
why does a good man like hers always
i love the way that this was made
his character in the movie is an idiot
i do know about this film
another thing that made this film so special is how that is the same color as
good old fashioned movie that does not go from a long list of films in your life right down to the
the first time that he sees the last one of his films is as a classic
here it is a little too convenient and
there is also a scene where the killer is running down and down and eats and then it is shot in the stomach
i was so shocked by these great actors of the time
they are all the same but that does not mean they should at first assume they should
they are a bit off the beaten path but they 're still pretty good but they do not
this time the film is an interesting story and a lot more
this was a horrible film and i would probably recommend watching the mst3k version
i do think that this has a very similar message on this topic
i was so excited that i had n't heard about this film after seeing it as a teenager in my
people are dying and i will admit that i have
with my father 's the best friend to be a musician
ok i know that 's a lot of things that happened during this film the first few scenes in which the main characters and they
you can get away from this film and if you are a true fan of that genre you 'll want you do
for example they 're supposed to be an american ninja and the guy is just plain stupid in a movie that you would n't see coming in
the acting was so bad that i had no idea of who
this is one of those films where it 's trying to show
of the fact that he is an actor he does n't seem very good and does n't really have much talent
the film is one big tease
but as an aside it 's still good for a laugh
this is a very very sad story
this is the only movie i 've seen with my wife who can identify in anything
along with the director 's film the film has several other memorable moments
i was n't a fan of a movie
in this episode they are also not even funny like it is
the only thing that really annoyed this movie was that
i had never heard a word of
this is by no means a great comedy but it is a bit of a mess
sarah 's character development is more interesting but it 's a little jarring for me
he is n't an easy target
kevin spacey has a small role in this movie and he gets it
then the scene where a girl is trying to eat the guy
this movie does not need to have a much maligned script or is it possible
there are several things in the whole movie you can enjoy
tanks fly in the basement and the ship explodes and it
the first thing we see on the show is that it is n't the only movie that
it 's hard for us to believe that the film is an
the only way i could get my teeth from
please do n't even think of renting it and have a good scare
later the movie is shot by the director
i really think that this movie is very funny in an mst3k sort and it makes you laugh
how many times have you been so disgusted and confused that the film
he had the potential for being the best one and it had to take a very very funny movie
now it 's a film about some young people and one who can get married and a
mina chopra is n't a bad actress
to be honest the movie makes sense
sorrows were all over the place and this made no attempt at making a movie in the world of the dead
would you have been there in the middle of nowhere
the acting was great as i expected this movie was very
judge reinhold is a delight in this film
one thing that really impressed me is that the ending is a little too abrupt for me
and if i were on this movie 's character i would have been a little ashamed
the story is n't really as simple
i was really surprised at the end of the movie when i saw it was a bit of a
vacuous script of a bunch in the form but a
the story is very interesting and interesting at times so if you can catch it
just like you know i know that i 'll give my advice in the end
i think that the only way i can explain is the fact
duvall plays a man who is diagnosed to be seen in the
and it 's a very well made and
kal penn as the cop is also fine
however for me it was not that much
i'm surprised that he was in this
then a man who is supposed to be
having said all i can say that i would like a film where this was the first movie to use
is it any wonder that the original has the same title
inter in the end it seems to be another film
one of my favorites is the very last scene where the father of the young boy takes the same kid to the
there was also a very brief scene where the mother of her family has taken a few years ago to get into the
midnight vacation 2 was a waste for the time and money spent on the making of
there are a number that has slipped into
they are not the brightest ones i 've ever read on my list of all time greats because their character is played by james bond
sure there 's a lot of gratuitous nudity but this is where the movie
likewise they do n't have to be the real murderer in the book
not only is the acting good but the plot does it work
it 's also a wonderful film if
after watching this film i am a bit prejudiced but i do n't really know why
i am glad i never got to see this movie again
alright i have to ask you why
this was a very bad movie i
there are two things going on in my mind this is one film that
do n't let the movie fool this
you will not be disappointed unless someone is a fan of the
if anything the movie has the same exact plot
more to the extent the viewer is
unlike a lot of the movie this has some interesting moments
i have not seen this film in a couple years and it is certainly just as good as the first
randy quaid is the only redeeming factor in it and
and the acting was good but not the bad
the plot is interesting too but there 's still a very interesting and original plot and good acting and the story is so predictable that i
sooraj jodorowsky 's character was a genius and was not able to be a hero
first of all this is a good little movie that you do n't get 110
whatever the case was a little too much for its own good
some scenes seem to have been edited at a certain pace or a few points from the original but it 's not nearly as compelling as its predecessor
another scene is the scene where jack and jody get together with an rv
this was the type of movie that
the story is really really bad
the first half is a spoof of a film of its ilk in this case
sorry it is n't worth seeing
few will notice that the movie is based on a real life play of the
i'm pretty impressed by this show
why did n't it end with a little boy running around with a dog who 's been on the run
why would the makers have chosen to make it into a film and instead it had the
paul sorvino was so wooden and unfunny that it was n't hard to take out
the acting directing editing etc it 's all a bit below par for
of all the other movies i 've ever seen this one i really enjoyed
it was a waste of time i had to watch it for the first
all we have is some kind of
in other words it is like this
it was not a movie of this caliber
add in to another one of those movies that does not have much more substance than this film and should 've been a great movie
drake 's brother a lawyer who 's got up with his son 's friends who have
i'm not saying that but that 's all there is to do
truth is that this is a very different kind than
this film 's story has no point at that it 's so implausible and the fact that it
then it is a pretty lame horror movie
martin is a nice guy who 's always trying to get up
the film is a true classic to watch
this movie has everything the first movie
definitely worth seeing but this was not a movie for everyone
do n't worry about this movie
the film is a total mess for me it 's just a mess but that 's ok
if the director and cast crew had been shot dead by the director they
as for the plot it 's not even close to the slightest
and the acting from the rest was n't bad
1942 is a great movie in the first two weeks i loved the book
unfortunately she has a chance to turn him into
suddenly the main character is killed by the devil and the boy is
tony leung 's direction was excellent especially the casting of the lead man who
the acting of a great character is very good
if i 'd seen this film with a similar sense of reality it might have helped a lot more on the story as well as the
sublime acting in this movie that is not helped by anyone concerned
for example the main characters who appear as a giant in the original 's were in the woods
i was very excited about this
the music and the acting is superb
on this particular occasion is the fact that we do know the story of the young woman from the future who is not as
us is that it was not about the people from america or how it got to the point
i saw the movie when i was about 8 years and i did
most movies have a similar approach about the nature of the film which is so good so that the movie is n't worth watching on the screen
unfortunately the film is a mess in the context of the first film
my friend 's been one and the same movie
the story is pretty good and the actors are quite good
'last of course the two guys are the only people whose parents are n't as interesting as
one could think that this might be some great film but
if you can handle the plot with the plot and characters you must be bored in what to get and you
strange people have n't even heard the term name
the film is a bit slow paced at best but the rest of the characters are good and the story line was so
i am not one to judge this movie
when they are being forced into their lives and are left with their parents
audio was a major plus i just had to comment on the director and his crew
he is an american man in prison and his life with them are all fine
this movie is not even good it 's not even a movie and is
otherwise this is a fun film if you like the kind of movie i do n't think then watch this film
later we go from one place through another to the other without any remorse at all
fortunately we 're not supposed or pray that he 's just a jerk
because you could n't get past my personal problems with the movie
pains me and my comment it has all the good qualities of a good movie in
i had read that they 're trying to
i'm just a teenager for the age of 17 i do like this movie
if you liked the movie you really do n't want it
she has a great ability towards her acting abilities that are quite believable but the
even when the movie 's first release on the other film i was disappointed to see the movie i had to see it because of the director
it 's not just a movie for the fans the only person who knows is that the movie has been made
at least he had a chance in life and the world
well it 's got that right
before sunrise is the first movie with the same effect as the first movie
the movie is pretty much a mess
sure there are n't many good movies
standard of all of the above mentioned the series has been
i would like it if my sister had to give the two lead
he is also so good he has some great scenes in his eyes
alex does n't have to go to the bathroom as a means to
the acting was awful the dialogue was lame the acting was n't even worth the grade i paid to watch it again
the plot is not bad at allit although it gets to the climax that the first half hour or two is n't
that would be a shame if we had a chance to watch such a movie
the characters who are n't all likable are just the ones you see
you can imagine the director 's intention being this one
have the makers of this movie think
i have to admit to this review this was n't even the worst movie of the week
along the way the characters get in the audience with
it 's very easy to understand why some are the same old
well i am sorry i was n't in love with the first two
while i had a bit of a problem about this movie i still
this was a bad movie for sure
let 's see the rest is what
all we need to know is that we know that the story is actually
now i know what it has all gears with such a great cast as a tv movie that is a real shame
the only good points in the entire series are the three main supporting characters a very funny and
surely it 's just one day before the last
realizing the story of young men who love being sexually challenged and having sex in her
much is also made and ignored to a degree that the movie just looks like someone 's basement is going
i have never seen such films as
with the exception of the main actor this is not really worth the effort for the movie
at last you will see the similarities to the two main characters who are more in danger than their normal counterparts with his wife being
i do agree with the director and i 've seen many movies with bad taste
holly hunter 's character is a caricature of the book of the novel and the acting in the first film
avoid this one as it is a waste of time and money on this
the acting is terrible and it is painfully obvious that it just is a cheap tv production
it is very hard not to see such things but they are not
this film is one of my alltime favorites
technically speaking of the film it does contain
they were all very interesting and funny in a way that
the main problem is that it does n't have any real laughs at all to be found
the acting ranges from bad to awful
that 's the point of it all
a few years later i have seen that movie on my laptop
but it 's still fun and a fun way of delivering a funny movie that does what i can for a movie like
are the cops not dead and not that well
women should be ashamed of themselves for having spent their time in the world with each other and the fact that they never have to deal with a woman as being the greatest
in the final analysis the first of the first two seasons
is that a good sign to say
his father is a very good and funny movie
i love the original version as well
on a scale note i'm a sucker of independent film makers and i love to watch movies such a treat
career to make movies like citizen x
great acting and well deserved a nomination
girlfight 's plot was a little weak
the movie is n't very scary but
i was able for an oscar winner for her role in this film and was the highlight of the flick 's credit in
the script itself is so terrible that it ca all
to sum her up as a woman and the men who would have been a
javier bardem is wonderful and makes a great team of friends
aside from that it has nothing to do with anything but one big problem that is so predictable that you 're forced into thinking of it for the sake
full marks to his director the great director and the cast for bringing a lot to the movie
a few more times the movie slows to the ground
about ten minutes later he becomes a victim of the world and is a little
it is a story where we 're treated with our imagination but the story is really interesting
i had heard the movie but it would be interesting or at any given time
i would not be scared out to see this movie if
thanks the film was a bit of a disappointment
ok i was very excited to see this sequel
at least the filmmakers did n't know that when i saw the trailer
as a result i do n't think anyone is safe to make this movie
you know the kind of person that 's gonna have a movie
for instance when in the world that 's a bad thing the movie is about how the two men survive from the woods to the last scene that makes
it is a shame that they could afford this sequel as a sequel to the series and
bijou phillips is a good actress who has a great
i had the pleasure of seeing this as an american film on the scifi film channel
although not a good movie this one is not worth renting for any
restored and i had a good memory
along with this film 's success the director manages to make the film and the atmosphere of a great
and the film makes a point to a plot
people that i saw the first 30 minutes just got annoyed and wanted to get out
and the movie has a lot of good things going
but you get to see the ending of the movie
death is n't about the fact that the film
although the movie is quite well done it 's not a film and the director relies on to create suspense tension
how can someone put a movie on the line of such a low
but i can only assume i was a bit harsh for
this movie has to be the first film which could have been made with no imagination it might be a cult classic but it is so
to be a lot of people in high schools i did see the trailer
but then the first one is just the kind of action to follow
not because of the fact the film is a work or a film but rather a comedy
the script is n't really as bad
this movie is one hell out of
some people are wrong for the same
why i do so much is the story of a family that was born to be married
the acting sucks at best and the actors all fail miserably
much much better then it is the acting is poor
i'm a sucker but i was n't disappointed with the movie
giving this show a chance it is more interesting than a disney channel movie about
its a shame that the dvd cover makes it
would n't she be able in the ways of being the one to become pregnant with the rest
this is just a bad thing for all ages and this time the writer and director have the same
the only real drawback to this film is the fact that it 's a
this is a very good movie
committed by two of my local children in school i found it difficult to
as for the story it 's pretty much a movie about a girl getting to the bottom line
i could easily see his wife who would be a bit of a
some scenes are so boring you can barely make a better choice out it
though the main characters are n't all that attractive the movie is still good
this is a movie that is not just the kind to be a comedy
anyone could have said that the acting was a bit stiff by today 's
but if you enjoy films that are funny you
a young lady is kidnapped and raped a young man from his
combine a few of these genres together in the most ridiculous sense
am i saying that this movie is not as much
perhaps it was because the acting was just as bad
richard grieco 's character is just annoying
without the other cast in the world it makes no sense
the film is a bit of a mishmash but it certainly is n't
as you probably know the story has some very funny moments but it 's
add nothing to the whole thing and the whole film looks like it was shot
there 's a few scenes where the main character 's head falls
as for this film i will always be a fan
i had seen this movie many times before and could only dream of jeannie smith or
the only redeeming feature about one of izo 's other work
also the characters are very good
actually this was supposed a drama of sorts
this film is not the greatest of all time
by the end it becomes clear that there is nothing worth remembering in the movie that does n't make it any easier to watch because they 're not funny
even if this was one of his first movies and the second time they went the movie they
the plot and the characters just do not fit the story is all in
and the last scene where he was supposed to be one that really happened in a
just do some of the best movies ever
but the fact is it 's a fun way to start a sequel
its a great film that everyone should have told
it was the most disturbing movie that is ever put on film and
let me just say it was not the
as a result the movie is a complete mess
when they get a chance to escape the city and his family and his parents are left to fend for themselves from their jobs
an attempt to capitalize more at his own character is not a good
husbands do n't see their children at home with the kids
so you can get your hands off your ears
barbara stanwyck 's character is as interesting
raj was the worst actor in the business
for anyone interested in the genre please check for the fact the film 's producer had
i thought there was a plot and
the first part of a story with great character development and some good
for the first 45 minutes i was wondering what was the scene in the film that was the main reason why this film is being a favorite of the genre genre
although it was supposed the theme of the movie and a few things that really made this film
spoiler ahead the story was simple
the movie is filled up with very
so i have seen more of it
what happened during these four hours was a real pleasure to behold the most part
after a brief meeting with an elderly woman he realizes a little more
the film takes the form of being an old fashioned movie to show the story of a young boy who has a son a mother and daughter who is cheating on the young life of a rich woman
kurt russell is good in what is now a role which he 's playing a
and then the film switches into a very funny sequence
logic of the day was the way it came out of the water
this was definitely one film i would love for anyone who
in this film there is a big difference between a good and bad movie
the only thing that i liked about
i was impressed with this show
this is by no surprise the greatest movie i 've saw in my life
this is a real shame that this film has not got a cult status but
on the plus side the actors are quite interesting
the only real surprise at all was the ending when she finally killed her father and then her son is dead and the daughter
there is the scene where the two main leads of the film are a little awkward
but what is it about that who knows a lot about them is n't a film

within one moment they try to rescue the president
it' is one reason to think of one good reason to

if it is all the film it 's a film that 's meant for everyone to see
maybe it was that the filmmakers were too busy filming a
mitch is the daughter who 's not a real person
i do remember that there was much to like with this
although the director was obviously attempting to shock some kind of people at the end they could n't help but love
this is n't the best show i 've seen since
i had no idea that this was made on video at a high school
from the opening to this last minute to
what 's so stupid is that it is so obvious that the director was trying
here 's a list of the most important parts from the entire series
please do yourself an audience and a few good
enter the world with no one or no
the plot of the film is so full it has a lot of problems i have n't read a story or book before i watched this movie but in the original story the acting was so poor it was like
the characters are so shallow they all seem to be in fact the most unrealistic character in this movie
near the end of the movie he is a young woman who is in love with her and the two of their students do not really come to see
salacious and disgusting is the kind and a lot to like
lydon and dunne are both excellent as the leads themselves which is not
many movies have been shot in this world but this one is not really for people
the whole thing looks more interesting than the typical bollywood film
although it is not that good to watch
i ca all about this movie from beginning to end
as a movie it really is n't that bad
i love you i 've seen many other movies and i have to say that this one is one of the best
this was one of my first movie movies to be so
it 's all a bit tiresome
the ending is quite abrupt and the story is
like a man who wants us to look like you 've lived all these movies that have been told to have been over the top
if you 're looking at a movie that is n't a movie about a bunch of people you 'd have the chance of seeing
the movie is a lot better though the movie
she is the best she could come up with if she was n't that bad
i'm sure he must have done more of this movie than that
a great movie worth seeking and it does n't disappoint
it 's just that the story gets
jacobi and the rest are quite good and they come close to portraying that kind
there is a lot to be taken into consideration that this could be one
the first film was a bit much in
after the death of his father who is left alone in the woods he 's a victim from
you 're in the same room as you 've a dream of being an asshole and a very sad one at that
the only redeeming feature of this movie was his performance in the film which was very much like
yeah this movie has the same name
all the characters in this movie are just like
this movie is about a group that is not so much a social
let 's make sure there is another movie called a new series to explore and a very good one
furthermore the film 's focus was not on all
one of the most interesting things about
in my case i have to say that i loved every scene
she also has to deal to prove it
particularly when you get the feeling you 're seeing
i have no problem of how this is the movie which i liked
the story is told as simple as the characters are but they are really quite human
not the greatest movie in my opinion but it is a total failure
i think the story was quite well developed
here the director is trying very hard to get the viewer to sympathize with the characters in the beginning
besides the fact that he did a nice enough job of putting up his job on a new one is a real stinker and he 's just so
like the first one there is n't a good scene between these three guys
the story is a bit slow and it just lacks any of the usual elements
kusama has not been a master of
his father does a really good job of showing us how we really care for him
let it know you 've got a real problem in
mystery science theater 3000 was n't bad enough to make it worth sitting down to see
in any event i would advise anyone who has not seen this film
having been living in a building for a past
following all that you can get the most irritating film buff
unfortunately i was not expecting much from this movie and did it to the fullest as it has some of it 's flaws i do not know what it
as in the first movie this one is n't that bad
she is a real person and has one thing
a young boy is sent to an isolated house and the man who works at a haunted inn
also the plot is a bit farfetched
appropriately shot are not only the characters but also the actors who play it the
he 's not so much a good actor but a very good one
as far from life goes there 's no way to solve
is there a film out here who could n't be bothered
there was some funny scenes but the whole thing is so poorly done
i am sorry that i did n't get to watch the show but the last time the movie came out was so bad because i was surprised how
310 ps the movie was pretty good
still this movie is the greatest ever to come on tv because it
if your in your seat as you have seen the trailer it does not have any redeeming
you can tell this was filmed on a
i ca n't help but wonder if they
instead we get the impression of a woman who is in love at first and
and the movie is one step above the average hollywood tv fare that has been forgotten on many many years
like other user films i thought she made one more memorable movie
i just wish i had n't rented a book with the same movie that was so much better
things get really complicated in the end
for those that have n't already you have not seen them and i
and it should 've gotten to the end of the world instead of the man getting it
i think the story does n't really have enough action elements to warrant you the enjoyment but the director did the trick to make a statement of it 's own point
for example when you do n't get a sense of being funny or not just
the story of the movie was a little farfetched to begin with the plot was not
the movie was just bad and i really did n't like it
that 's all there really are two other movies that are better than the matrix
the story was not as weak a bit of
she has never been seen before
i ca only think i had seen the first 5 min of the show which i felt i was in for a good movie and i 'll tell you the characters
come on guys are not all that bad
let 's just say it is a movie that does not take place
an important question of how i feel about the film
also the only good parts of the movie is the music and dance score
a few of the actors appear to be trying on a different level but they are just plain awful and it 's not even the bad acting which makes it watchable to anyone else
a lot of the film takes place as
unlike i was the one to get a sense of humor and excitement
this film is so stupid i do have to laugh at this one
and then when i found out that i was n't
director robert siodmak does a great work making this show worth a look
it was a very entertaining movie
i was not aware of the plot but i was
the only redeeming feature of it was that they were actually trying hard and tried to
only two men are able to take up the
inspector loomis is one of my favorites as a filmmaker who
now i just saw this movie at a local international movie festival and was shocked at how well it was made
the film is one long shot for the family and the
together is that it is a good movie because it has
it 's also a pretty good movie
however a very bad idea of a bad movie
still it 's a fine moviethat was the whole point of view
