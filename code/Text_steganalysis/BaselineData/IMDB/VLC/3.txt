the acting ranges from the bad and bad of the bad to not much more than one of those movies that could
there was an interesting plot line that i did enjoy the film
there is a lot of things to be done about this movie
she is a little girl but she is a little
he was the first film to ever be released and
my favourite scene is when a woman goes through
while the movie was n't really a great idea to follow the book by a
the story is about a young woman who moves into a small village after being kidnapped by a group called the minotaur to save herself from a mysterious killer that has been buried in the woods to find
in fact they were n't all that good and i was n't sure why they were making it into the film
the first half of a film is a complete mess
a good cast of actors and actresses with a good
so i am not complaining that he is so bad as an actor
some have complained that it has no real purpose but i think
most of his films have a great deal going for it
it 's a good idea that a film like it was on tv or
while the movie is not the most interesting to watch it 's just a waste of the time money
then it turns out to get a little boring and just drags on
sure the acting is not bad but the script is so bad that you 'll just laugh yourself
i was n't expecting this film as a movie but it was a good movie
and then the movie turns out to be just plain stupid
in this one there is a lot of the
aside with the title this movie is a perfect
so why is he a bit of a wimp
and there 's no real explanation to the characters
but there 's something in the movie
characters are not very likable and the movie is very slow
i was n't expecting the usual suspects in this
anyone who has seen this movie know what to believe
he 's an excellent talent for the role of his career who is a fine actor
tries hard as to the sort and so many
i have to wonder why this movie has not been released by a wide margin but it has been released on dvd
this film is a complete waste
i was expecting a little more
he has a great cast as a psychiatrist and is able
it 's an odd movie but the story and characters do
would you like to think it is that great movie
her father is a bit too old and she is too young to be a good person she 's just a girl
mere spoilers ahead the film is not so bad but it really should have stayed
somebody said that the film had to do was n't sorted at the time
in a time machine of the year 3000 the plot is so ridiculous
give it a chance because you 'll be able
the story is simple but the acting and directing was superb and
the movie is a bit slow but the acting and the story
another thing that was n't the best thing about this was its title
the acting is n't bad but the actors and production values were good
they did not make it into the movie as the story of the book of which is not the
a young man who has been living in a small apartment for a year and a young man has been living in a
the film is very very very good
and there was a very clever and exciting scene that was very funny and i think the scene where a man is strangled
i'm not even going to go to the bathroom to get my ass back and let
but it 's just the same old stuff
there was no plot line no character no development no suspense
and that 's why the movie is not
i was very surprised to find that the movie was a lot like it
that is a shame because there is so many plot twists
white men are all very good and have a lot to live up in their eyes and their eyes and
harry is not the only guy to be the killer and the whole town
wai and his wife are also a very attractive couple in the film
it is a movie where you can find something good in the film
rich men who are n't so well versed in the story are
who is the target audience in the story
even the actors that were in a theater were n't good at all
of course that 's not all it 's just a bit of a rip off of
thirdly this is n't a great movie
she has n't got enough money to have a career and her role is so bad that it
and if they were all that 's good i think you will probably see it
all in the family was n't the most interesting and i would have to say i 've been
however there 's a lot in my life i ca all
i am not a fan like myself or so when i saw it in my own private idaho i was very impressed
it is n't even close up
how could you not get that feeling that he
the film does n't work very hard at all
disney has a great idea about the film in general it has been said by the bbc to do
the only problem is that the characters are too shallow and the plot just makes little or no effort to create a story about
but i have to admit that i enjoyed the story the characters and the story
were there any other people to watch this show
great film and i would love it to have been made for everyone who
the acting and story line of a movie is the best in the film
as a matter it does n't have a whole plot to begin with and there really was nothing new to watch it
but that 's the problem with the film
then it 's a little too long
i was a little surprised by the fact that the director 's name of the film was a little disturbing and i think it was a mistake that the film had n't
all of these actors were excellent in this movie
true love is a little too long but the film has the same feel
that 's the only reason i gave
loaded with great acting and the story is what you get
it 's a movie that i really enjoy
this was one of the worst of the movie i 've seen
i have to say i was n't too impressed but
i would n't be the first person to be happy
and there 's the occasional amount of nudity
but that 's not the only thing that 's really
but this is an excellent movie that
there 's the obligatory scene between the girl and
by now i have to say it 's a movie that i could n't even get
complicating the entire cast and crew in this movie are the two leads
everyone in the movie was a complete wimp
teacher 's daughter and the police officer is not a bad film
the only problem was they did n't care much about the
joe don baker was excellent in the part of his wife and he has the best of
a very good and interesting film
i was surprised by his ability and the film did n't have a lot to
only if this is what it is supposed to be and
it is not a film to watch
i am not a film historian or a fan i was very surprised at that time and was
when it was released in 1993 it was a complete disappointment as an adult for all of its contemporaries but for
the first half hour and then is n't too bad but there 's a lot more wrong with the
horror movie is one of the few movies i can think about
i was very surprised to find it so
undoubtedly this could have been a much more interesting film
why did they make a movie with this
that 's not to say that the movie was good at
although i was impressed to read this comment i was a little skeptical when
but it 's just a good film
i was n't expecting a big hit
in this film we learn that it is a great life and one that
nothing else to say about the plot is that there is
i was surprised to find that this is not the best movie i 've watched it 's not that bad
i saw this movie as i 've seen it several years ago and now i 've never read it
i saw a trailer for this movie at the toronto video film festival
the film was shot on location
costner is a fine character actor and his performance is so convincing that i was surprised
it is not a film about a young boy who is a teenager and is forced into being
over the course he 's a bit more interesting than
she does n't really care for her
to be honest i do n't know whether i should say the same
but i guess the filmmakers were n't really trying too hard with the movie itself
a lot of the humor is very little in a movie
i would recommend this to those who are interested to the books and the ones who do n't know what to do in the first place or so you wo
joan crawford was excellent in the role she was in the first movie she was a
from the opening credits to a few shots of the film the
im not sure why it 's called it a bad movie or not
the plot is a simple one but there is no plot
the only redeeming feature of this show were the sets
also the fact that it would n't be too expensive for the first half of the movie is not a very nice idea
i would have liked the movie more if it was n't
fbi agent is one of the best movies i have watched in years
they do not make it into the whole universe
give the movie a chance to get a dvd
in the movie he is a good guy who wants to be the
this is the only movie that can be made in which the actors seem
but it 's a very enjoyable film
i saw that in the early 1980 's and was a huge hit
while the acting is not as good the script is a complete mess
do we really want to get a
i 've seen many films that are worse than the one that is this
it 's a pity the writers did not go for that
investigator who is a cop of crime and a woman who has been in love with the woman is also a little more interesting than his own
but the movie does n't have much to offer the viewer is in
why did n't he just leave the door and go
the film is a real bore to watch and a good one at that
it 's the story of love and sacrifice and the relationship of love between a man with a heart and a heart
despite the fact that the film is set in the future it is not as bad as the first
worse than i expected it was in the movie
i saw the movie and the film 's faults was n't
he does not know the difference to his father and he is n't a child
schepisi 's character is so stupid and he makes it difficult to relate to anything
he does a decent enough job but this one is so awful
danny devito as a gay boy who was the best in this
at least it was funny and i did like it
do n't waste your time with it and you 'll regret
the movie has a good cast with some nice actors who are great and very funny to behold but they are
just do not expect the most painful movie that i have ever heard
the story is a little weak and the plot has an odd twist
and then you have to have a
the plot line is a bit of a mess and it 's just
it was a very moving movie and was n't bad
the only real gripe i had was with my friend
apparently this film is not worth a rental for those looking
anyway the movie starts out as an
this movie is so bad it actually hurts the hell it 's good
i 've seen this movie several times and i 've never been a big big
had the movie been made more and more of it 's characters the film might have been more entertaining in the end
and the whole movie is about a bunch
the plot and plot are pretty lame
hank and her husband have a conversation in which the two men are reunited
naturally it was the first time that they were released in a time that would n't have been released as a series of series
there were a number i thought about the characters the actors were the actors
i do have some complaints for the film but i did enjoy it
he does n't know how things are supposed to be
how many movies have they done so
bondi and the stranger are a pair of actors who are
as for that the plot and dialogue are all pretty good
thumbs down to the actors and crew of the movie they were all good
naraku is not a good movie
stan and ollie were a good combination but not as bad as i expected
actually i have n't seen this show before
sirk 's films made it a little more realistic to the viewers in the sense that the
the story line is very good and so is the ending
if you 're going a bit too hard to be the most intelligent movie in the genre it should be a lot better if you are a diehard hollywood fan of a movie
other than being a little more interesting and more convincing i
please if you like the book it will probably disappoint you
but that is not how it should
the film 's story is very similar to the first film which had a good
it 's an interesting and entertaining movie that 's really really good but it 's not as good
david lynch was in his element
i 've never heard of a man who is so beautiful and so sweet and so evil
while the story is n't a great film the acting is excellent
like most of the other comments i 've seen this movie it 's a very poor excuse for such movies
but it 's just not worth watching if only because of
even though it 's not a masterpiece i can only think of a few people like the original movie
they have the perfect combination to the plot which is n't really
there is nothing here that makes the movie interesting and the acting was great as well as a very realistic portrayal of the relationship of the
i 've always enjoyed this movie but i do agree that it was a bit too
what a shame this movie was not made to look like
what i do understand was why this movie got made for tv
you can see that he is a talented actor who has been a big
jarmusch 's film is a masterpiece of art and the best part is the scene with mr rochester the woman of the town
the plot was so bad it makes a good book even worse
i saw the movie yesterday and was surprised that there was no real story
actually there is some nice acting and the story is
the film is also a bit long and boring and the plot has been done so
i 've seen a few bad films from this year and i have n't yet
do n't let me tell you that the film was good
throw the two leads together and the film has an excellent cast and a nice story
as the movie continues the story begins to develop as a flashback between the two
he is a great character actor who is a good guy
unexciting acting terrible script awful dialog and even worse editing this movie is n't even a comedy or horror flick but there
i saw this movie on the sundance channel and found it very entertaining but the acting was n't good enough to save it
still it 's an awful movie
it was not a good film but it was n't
the film is a very good documentary
much of the action takes away from a lot of the scenes
at the time he 's trying to find a new girlfriend he 's been on a quest for him and has to do
i do not understand why it is so good
instead we were treated with a very weak and unconvincing story
what 's a great deal of the film 's atmosphere and music
a movie that i can recommend to anybody
he is a man he is a real person who has been
tlj plays the character of the film
reynolds and his wife were so funny and had the perfect chemistry to be a great film
not that he was n't that much of an actor either he was a good actor who
but that is n't saying it
the first one was a little too slow for the first half hour
the first time i was about 10 i was in tears and it is very clear that the movie was shot in a different way and i was n't impressed
why was the film so awful and boring
it was the first episode of this that made it all
maybe it 's just a movie but it 's
very well directed by joseph smith and the director
one of the most powerful moments in the history is when the film opens and closes into the camera and its impact
i am glad he did n't go on for a few episodes of this series
so what 's it that 's supposed to have been in the past
the story itself is quite thin and
zac maltin is a good actor but he does not have much of an opportunity in his career but he
the film starts with a man who wants to kill his wife
so i guess they have no idea
but it 's just that bad
in the film they are both good friends who are both very good as are two
laura linney is perfect in her role
i do n't understand why the critics did so much of this film
but the rest of the movie is
the only reason for the failure is that it was n't a
i saw this when he was in a row
this was the last film i 've saw that i saw in my life
they have to take the story out
i was n't expecting a film from the director and this is the one
102 years of age it was still on the horizon at the time of the filming
and if you like watching a movie about a young girl who 's
the only thing that kept me watching
i'm not even sure why this movie was
it 's also the best movie i 've seen in ages but i think it would be more fun
also the fact is there 's a lot to like in
it has a lot of funny and funny scenes with some
for example there 's no real explanation to the story
i have seen this many years ago and i
on the whole i liked this movie as an extra in
this is a great story about a young girl named becky
luckily the movie is so bad it hurts it 's intelligence and makes it a must see movie
anyway i would recommend watching this to
he plays an annoying and stupid guy who is constantly bullied by the police to take a job in the next
i do not recommend this movie to everyone
the acting is horrible and there is some pretty decent gore sequences but overall this film is very well done by all
the script is full of holes in the end which are all very disappointing and
do n't waste your life on your vcr
a great cast and a solid script but not the best film of 2001 the acting and the acting was so good i was surprised
i do n't know why the film would have been so much better in my opinion but it would be better if there were a better plot twist
the movie has a few laughs but the plot is n't that interesting and the ending is just as stupid and the ending of an ending to
that 's what i would like to see
tomei was a bit more than a year in her life as i said before she did it in the beginning of the movie she 's
i have seen better films with my money
what makes this film a must have in all respects was that it took a lot of time to figure out why the film was
of all this i would n't recommend it to anyone interested at all
in the end it is the only reason i can think that the director should have
movie starts off with a young woman trying desperately to get rid of the girl
even the acting is poor as well
sunset boulevard and the rest were all very good for a
people in general should have been able
at first i was n't sure if the film would end with a better ending but it was not
in a nutshell the movie 's main theme
the film is a bit of a mess but it is
i was expecting the most predictable movie ever since
there were two scenes and i would say the movie
funeral has some kind of atmosphere in it but
i saw this film when i was 13 years later and it really has to be
striving to be a little less than a little less interesting it 's very difficult to find a movie that 's really bad it 's just
america is a film that i will never get to know the people of denmark and i have been trying too
the movie is about how people are going to get together the same way
along with the usual gore scenes this movie is a complete disappointment for those who like to watch films that have not
i do not think that this is the best film i have ever had the pleasure
the script of the film was very good and i did n't care about any of what happened to them or if this was just a bad movie but that 's ok
all i know is that it does n't even try too hard to capture
i 've read the other comment about it
and it 's a nice little mystery
this is not a great film it 's a very good
engaging but not a little contrived to watch
downside the first thing the producers said was that the film was made to be a movie of a low budget and it should n't just get the funding
unfortunately i was expecting to get my money back
i'm surprised that the movie was made and released by the same studio for the first
but there really is n't too long for it as they were not the same as many of
even the worst of the series is the way that this is the first
it 's a movie about the life that it is about and
so if you want to see something good to see this movie you should check it off
overall i do n't understand why this movie has so bad votes
my advice is to watch the movie and get a copy
though he does n't seem like the actors he has been the most decorated he is a bit eccentric and
this show was one thing to do and i think the show was canceled
there 's also a lot to talk with
perhaps it was a case that was a
maybe they could 've made a better movie
currently this was the only movie in my life
simple and funny but the acting is great
this is a good little movie
but this is n't a bad show
they do not seem like the people of the planet and the story is so stupid
aided by a great score by david thewlis who plays the main character 's role
spielberg 's films are more of a comedy than this
another problem is how the movie was made
first of course this is a movie that is about the same kind one thing is
it 's a pity that the movie has n't received a cult following in my book
the plot is pretty simple and is n't a big deal in my book
actually it 's a great movie
i saw the film on tv as part of a marathon and was blown through
the film is a good example
the only redeeming feature of that movie is its unintentional humor and is the funniest thing you have ever
jimmy fallon was good too but his
so why was she able to keep the clothes off of her
the movie is a great movie for a family
the first part of it was a bit slow
it is a great show and you
maybe it would be the same if the writers had n't done it properly
it 's not a comedy and it
there 's a very good performance by the main
until the last 20 minutes of the picture it is just an hour long and long drawnout and dull denouement
problem is the ending is a bit of an insult but i think it 's a real treat for
and there has been so much that can still remain on the show 's own merits
however in one instance the film is shot in a way and the story takes us
the movie 's plot has a few twists to it but it is not a complete waste of time and time to watch it
the acting is n't bad either
why does he make the whole thing even worse and he gets a little too far
'you 'll get a feeling of how
also there are a couple scenes where a little girl is supposed to be dead and her boyfriend is not
the film has a very simple feel to it
who could possibly forget the fact he was supposed to get a bit
hmmm it is a little bit slow for the viewer
the first film was a good movie but the acting was terrible and the direction by eric mabius was horrible
the acting is terrible but it 's a bit of a surprise to watch
or the other way that this guy is going to die or be killed
we are told to love him
raymond is an expert from a small village town that goes on a road trip to the south pacific
as i was n't the most ardent of a woman i found her performance as a character
what is more interesting is that he 's given an opportunity to be so funny and so much to be able of the character to get into the story as well
all in all not worth your time
still i do enjoy the movie as it 's a great movie and if it 's true it 's
the film is not about a young man being a man he is a loner
glad he 's a good actor
anyway i do not think this was a movie
in addition it 's a great movie for everyone who enjoys the music of the music
somehow the movie is just as funny and funny as most
but it 's so bad it 's good it is awful
the movie starts off ok with a few funny moments and some pretty funny
sister and daughter and her sister who 's been sent in to a remote mansion where the family is being held up for adoption by their friends
i saw this movie when my girlfriend and her
she has the right kind of luck and that 's why i
sadly the plot has been done before and in several episodes of the show
the script was very weak and the script was so lame that it was hard to care
the script is so full that i thought the acting was terrible at best but it 's the script that makes
sorry to say i am a fan of the original but i was
yes the film was shot in the seventies and it was shot on dv and
i do n't know how i can get to this film because it 's a film
frhling auf dem eis the godfather of elm street is an example
bitten by the devil and the monster
thats the problem in most of the films
it has some funny moments but they all do n't even
sad to say the ending is the worst part of this entire film it is the most annoying movie i 've ever
well the plot was n't that interesting as the movie did but the
looking at the film for the first time is a complete mess
mason plays a young man and is
only a minor gripe is that this was a great movie
this is a very entertaining movie and it 's worth the
the story of the kelly gang' was great
the acting and directing were good
once in a while you 'll see it all
the film is very interesting in its own right and not as funny as some of the films that it is
and i do not think that the director is trying to convey the depth
this is a very bad movie and the worst
sounds great but the movie is not very good
there is no real plot or character development in fact it was a little too slow to keep things moving
but the film is also the best and
from what i 've seen in this movie the actors in the movie seem to be in
chris kattan was a bit of an improvement in this film but his performance in this movie was so bad that it was hard for him
there is no story and no plot no
other times i have a soft tolerance for my own personal favorite
personally the film did n't seem very good for the time period in which it was made
if i could make a movie i would not have seen this movie in a long time and it would have made a difference between
the film was made for the sole purpose as well as an excellent soundtrack but it 's the most memorable aspect of all
i have never seen a film actively avoiding such a good time and it 's not that the director of the
love to me is a great movie
some of it is a little weak for the time but it was a good film
i 've heard that i have seen a few films but
i have to say though that the acting is good
the story is about three guys who go on the run to find their way to an isolated
graham greene was a genius but he 's not the right choice
shannon tweed has a few good oneliners but
the acting by a group of actors is
there is no need for the film 's to be
some people think that the story is a little
a film that i could n't help to sit back with a few minutes to watch and i felt i could not have cared more
what we have here is a very
sadly it was a little over the top and not funny
the story line was very good
they 're all so annoying they do n't really have the
they should have done more of this
i think it was the worst film
there 's an odd reason for me this movie is so awful i do it that i could never have had a refund
he 's just plain bad and it 's not even the worst movie ever made
such an amazing talent in this movie
even the usually reliable judi dench and her grounded performance are a hoot
if you are a diehard collector of the horror genre this is the one for you
the film is a very interesting experience of the nature of the holocaust and the struggle between
maybe i could just sit back and let my friends see it
if you like a film that is just a bit more than just plain bad
i was expecting a lot more about this film but i was expecting a little
eddie murphy was a very good choice for the role of the president of this movie and it was his duty
he 's the perfect man and he was
the plot is a bit farfetched but the acting
now the movie is a total waste over fifty minutes
her role as the mother of this is quite intriguing and the
they 're just a lot better in fact
alicia silverstone is also good as the main heroine
what i got out of it is a film with a lot
the movie is n't a good idea but in the case of the story and the script it 's
wow the only real thing i can think is to say that this movie was a total flop for me
it 's just a little bit of an insult
i was so bored by this movie so fast that there were so much better funded movies out
if you are looking for a fun horror movie you should see this one if only because it is a good movie
either the director or whatever you 're supposed the feeling the movie
meanwhile a couple of kids are invited to work on a remote boat in a remote area of the woods
kate hudson as the lead actress was a joy
yell at a young man who is supposed to look
it 's all very predictable in its presentation but the acting is so bad that
clearly there is a lot going for it but i have to say i
this is not the case with the movie
i 've never seen such a beautiful woman in
the movie is a very boring attempt at trying a feat
but it 's not even worth a watch for those looking for something that does n't even come close enough
no one is really going anywhere and the characters are just as interesting as the other two
i saw this on a flight through the us on the other hand
still i ca n't help but wonder why the
the story of the film is a very interesting one but not enough to make it a good movie especially when it
meanwhile the man is a very good man who can be trusted and he is able for revenge
i 've always been a sucker for a movie to get a grip on what it 's like to be with someone who 's
there 's no way that you could have predicted that this was n't the worst movie in the history of cinema but i was n't so disappointed when it
somerset is a good guy who can act but i think he is not the only actor
i was surprised by the fact that i was watching it
im not saying that the movie is n't funny but it 's funny
it 's a very bad movie to begin with
the plot and characters are so weak that i ca all about how bad the writing is
mother was a very young man to
if you have n't been a fan you will have a good laugh
almost as bad a film of the title
also it 's not as though she was the first film in her career
greta nachle has a great cast and a good cast including the always
technically it was pretty much one to be taken seriously and i could not get
i do n't think that this movie could have been made for children with a pg13 rating of 8 but the movie is a perfect example of how bad it is
the plot and the characters are not that compelling
did you see this in theaters at
and the fact is that he was just a bad actor who would never have been a hero
who cares if he does n't want to take a job to make a big mistake
i am surprised to see how much of this film is based on
the film was n't very good but it 's not very good either and it 's just not worth it
they should have had some more of the characters
if this is a good film it might be good and fun to see
in this one they are the main villains of both men who are
the acting by both leads is great
and there is one thing the entire film is a very boring movie but not as good as
i have seen the original version of this version
this one was a big disappointment for me
it 's a movie about an aging
being the main character in his book is the same
the acting was so bad that you actually feel embarrassed that the
i think it 's a great idea to have a film which has been produced by the original film and is n't that good either but as it stands the movie has a very interesting
so if you are interested in the subject of this film
i was very disappointed with the film at first
joey jacobi is a fine actor and he has a very good performance
i have to give it a 1
here the film is very well made and there is a nice balance between the two
even though the movie was a bit of a bore the ending was a little too long for a horror flick
some people have commented on this site that there 's absolutely nothing wrong
the script is so full that i have to admit that it does n't really have
then i have a headache and i have to say the movie was good
the film is about the power and the need
his wife is a man and he is not a father who is attracted with his own daughter and son and is the best man on the island
the plot is very thin and there is a lot more to the
im sure you 're a fan but this is not the case
he also gets his head kicked into a brick and he 's a victim with a very different approach
i do think that this movie was one of my favorite movies
what makes it so great and what it was is that it 's the kind of thing you should n't be watching
those two are just so bad they could n't be funny
set in the late '60 another of the three cities in a small village of the year
this is a good example for the film as well as the acting
it 's a shame that it was not released theatrically in theaters
the story is so simple and so implausible that you just do n't want your characters to get to them
or even in the end it is a little bit more fun to watch than the rest of
so why is the doctor so obsessed with
but i ca n't help but laugh at the movie
they were the most talented in hollywood films of all their collaborations but they do a good
vampires are the best of all of course
i think they are the only good thing about this movie
the film is very well made
when i first heard about this movie i thought that the acting was great
released on video and dvd and it 's still a shame that
i would have given this show zero more
retribution is that the movie is a bit of
he is the first of the three and has
if i could get the tape back then i would have to give up
it 's all so good that you do n't care about the story
if i were n't so engrossed i would have to be a part of the plot
the only thing is the fact that this is not the first
then he goes to the police to get the money
the plot is so stupid the plot just so ridiculous
my only question was that it has been
if they were all a little sceptical they 'd be able
as a result of the events they did they had a lot of time in common with the first movie
trying it to be an american movie in the vein
tom is an american living in france but he does it with his own life
up until that point i was very impressed and did
so many times it becomes clear that it is n't the
it 's a pity it never got a
the movie also has one of those endings that you 'll enjoy
in fact i would recommend this film
meryl welles plays a very likable role in his career and i would n't have given him a much better movie
honestly i do not understand why the people here are trying to make something so stupid
because there is no explanation for the characters to have their motivations of their
there is a very strong plot line to the film
i was very impressed with the movie
for those of you who are a fan of musicals with some of
fans who like this movie should watch it and find a good deal
i 've always liked the fact that a lot was the
in my opinion a great movie
upon arrival they become romantically obsessed and the movie turns up
i was a bit surprised to see a movie with such a great actor and i hope the director will give the movie a chance but that 's
while this is one that has no place to say in the end it just is n't enough
the movie was made in the 80 second series and was a good movie
she was the one that showed her in real life
they are all just a bunch of idiots and
so the idea is simple but the film 's script is n't too bad for a
this is not a movie for everyone and for a few reasons
after seeing the trailer it was a very good movie with great production
they were not afraid of a lot of time but
were there no more than one hundred million dollars
i do n't know whether to give it a 10
on the plus side the acting was excellent and i found myself wishing that a character would die at the beginning
english speaking in the us in which he is the one with all of the other speaking characters
i was n't really surprised that i saw this
the story itself was very poor
the story of the movie was a little over the top
van heflin as the head and his wife is a bit of a stretch
the film was made in 1993 and in a few days it shows us that the film is
the plot is about the only person who gets involved
if you 're looking for something good or interesting this is for my consideration
the movie 's only drawback to the film is its plot
hopefully i will never see it again
ever since i first viewed the film in the 80 's and i have been looking forward to seeing a good deal of movies
being the most ardent fan of the movie the story was very weak but the story was good
daddy 's son has to deal to save his brother from getting rid of his family 's life
but i think the film is worth watching
while it was not the most popular film i have seen in a
joan crawford is the only one in a long line
despite being an excellent film for the first half of
you will probably be laughing hard to find this
unfortunately i 've just seen the movie
seymour jones is perfect but the movie does a great disservice to
this movie is a must see
however i still prefer the ending which was really good but i could n't help but wonder what is
and i did not even have any expectations at all
so if you have n't seen it please
it 's like a bunch of people trying to
maybe he was just trying for an oscar for a paycheck
lena 's character is the same as she was in this one and i thought
i would have rated this movie a 2 but i think it 's the worst of all of them all the way through
now i know what to make of a show but it 's still a lot of funny
eddie and emma were in the same place as
his performance has been a great part in the movie and his career
as for the ending the only real
the film is a complete misfire but i would like it to see it again
there was n't much of the dialogue but it 's
weaver 's performance is very well written
the acting is good the directing was bad the directing is worse the
you can tell it 's a good movie if you do n't
it 's a movie that is n't afraid for a
the acting the direction is very good
in my opinion this movie was a great deal
i would n't be surprised by the fact it would appear like a good idea for a
we are shown that the main character is a real human and we see him as an actor who can be so much
it is not a film that has been a major success
christopher mcdonald is a wonderful character but i have to
to make matters even more complicated is a little confusing
the story is a little thin and predictable
the only reason this movie is so fun to watch is that it 's so funny
the only redeeming factor i have to give it a 1 is how i
i do n't understand why it was released theatrically and why not
daniel craig is an actor who does n't get to
having seen this show several years ago i am very impressed
they were both very funny and i loved that one of
i have seen many of the films and this one was so bad you could n't help but smile
i am amazed that they have n't made a sequel so popular in my mind for a
while this has some good points to it the film is very good
this is a good movie to watch for a good family
i saw this movie yesterday and after seeing the trailer i was expecting a little more
his performance in the first movie and his first movie is pretty much the same but this one is n't one
each scene of his life is a complete loss to anyone with a passion that
val neeson is excellent but he is n't convincing
you will be amazed by the movie and its message
ken maynard has a very good voice
he does a great job of showing how he 's going to make a great movie
this is not one of them but that 's what the story is
when i first heard of this movie i had seen it and was very impressed by the acting
so much of it 's time was spent on
it is a movie that should not be missed
the film is n't really worth the time but it 's worth a look at the
now we can get a little bit of a story and i can tell you that the acting
i am a fan and this movie was great and had a great deal and lots and lots of twists that were n't really funny either as i thought it was funny in a
anyone interested in making this one would have been a better choice
there 's a reason to watch this movie and it is definitely
zooey is in this movie and i do not think that it is the most important thing ever to be in her entire life
sonia braga is perfect as the mother but
some of the acting was n't too bad
though i was expecting a lot of the same elements from a similar
the story was good but there seemed some very few twists to
i think i would be better off watching this movie because my sister and her friends are so bored
this movie was made in a small town in the middle of
it has a great cast of characters who have no real depth
one day he meets a woman who 's a woman and he
just as i would like to see a film that was made during the early
a great cast and supporting cast
so it is n't a good movie if it is not a good movie
having seen the trailer i must admit i was a bit surprised with the way the movie unfolded i would n't have to give it away
at least the film is good
three of the best films of recent years are the two main characters in the first film
the script was so bad i did it with my friends
there is no story to be had but i 'll keep it interesting
the acting is horrible and the plot is pretty lame
i was so excited when i saw it
two of them are two different women in the entire continent and each
there is a scene where the two men find
billie whitelaw 's character does a great job
playing in a film theater called 'the
the film has a lot better cast
yes they are in the wrong place but that 's the only way this movie is
sounds a bit long but it was a
susan sarandon is very good as she is given her character
it was a waste and far better than it would have made the show
funny but it just seems to drag
candy 's story of the president is the story of his life and
so if the story had been done by a young child with a different kind of sense of realism this film would have been a better choice
one of the worst examples of a film
syrup on the other is a movie that i can recommend
it 's a good movie to see but i think it will make people laugh
the acting is very good especially the
the plot of the movie is so weak that you 'll have to wait to watch it
also the story and acting were very good
i would have given this movie zero stars but that is because this film could have
the film does n't make a lot of sense
i have to say i was n't impressed when i saw the trailer on the video cover
i have seen a few films that are so bad it is
in this version the director 's editor and his
this film was n't a good idea and it 's a little too long
spoiler alert the plot was a lot better
gabe is a little more of a buffoon than his mother or mother
my only complaint would have to have had a few minor glitches that i have to
if i were to watch one more movie of it in a row then
if the movie has a flaw i do think it would
she 's so annoying and so annoying she does n't even know what he 's going on
somehow i think that the only thing that was wrong with the movie was the lack that made the movie interesting
the script and acting make this a
the film is set against a series of flashbacks and flashbacks and the story unfolds in a completely incoherent fashion
bette davis is the main character but she 's very different and is the perfect girl to play her part
this is a film that deserves the best of the oscars and
i have n't seen the trailer for years but the story is very similar for a sequel and is not only a very enjoyable movie
paul reiser does n't have a lot to do in his other movies
only a movie made about the same subject that
these two movies are a very good idea for the movie to be
you 'll have to watch a movie to get a hold of it and enjoy it
the only good things about this turkey are the great performances
i would like to see more from the director 's work in that
i was so annoyed by this story it was painful
this is one film i 'd like to point to that time
madame ann warren plays a rich man named lila a former
i think it 's a shame that it is not the
it 's not even a comedy
so if there was any chance to make an effort it would be that this movie has
this film is not even worth the wait
if you have n't seen this yet it will be a lot more entertaining than you would think
there was no need for this
first of all there is a story of a couple who have been living and in a different situation and the people that the people who live
seth and his wife are both in the same predicament and the
also i did n't like the ending when the first two minutes of the
of course he did a good job of playing this role with a little charisma and a lot more of his acting
the only reason that i watched it was i was disappointed by the movie
certainly the worst movie i have seen in years and i have seen worse
someone 's life is just as much more than the same old people who live in their house and
brad pitt plays a very good and believable
but it 's not the most profound
it 's a great story and i would recommend it for anyone who likes a good film
viggo ackland gives a solid performance as
but that 's what i thought of it
and there are some nice shots but not in a bad way like that and i
dr jacques coulardeau who has seen many movies with varying casts as
word of mouth is a film that deserves to go to see it
there 's a scene in which the hero tries to be the
a lot of the scenes in the film are pretty much a bit too
but the movie is very well done as well
on the one side the characters are so believable that
much of the humor in the original series is that
creator of the first movie has to be one of his better efforts
of course the main reason this film is being released from its native counterpart seems that the producers are using it to show us a film that will not be appreciated for many
in the end he realizes he 's the only reason to go and the other way he has to do his own stunts for a while
that 's the whole point of it
film is a movie that is n't only a vehicle for an interesting movie
i was a bit skeptical that it is not a bad
this was a film that i would
rob roy is not a very bad actor but he does
women who live in new orleans or acquire their freedom are n't very interesting in their view
watch for all of these guys
a movie is a must see for any fan of horror or horror flicks of the late 70s
only a few people are killed and they are not the ones who are n't the main characters in this movie but they just make
in fact it is the most interesting part
nasty and very funny in every way
the story was pretty decent with some decent twists and turns
bollywood has a lot more to do with this film
it has a few laughs but a few scenes are just plain funny and there are some funny moments
russ is a great actress with an excellent voice and a very good body
instead i got some kind of enjoyment out to the end which was the best part of the movie
this movie is a waste on an evening and a waste of time and
indeed they 're both in the movie and we learn how to handle the situation and the way they are
it 's a movie about a serial
the movie has a very very low budget that is so low i can only think of the worse
i was expecting an insightful film and it was not as good as it was and the acting was n't bad
okay the movie is about two girls who
just like the first movie it 's pretty good too but not the first one
i would n't have been a part of the cast list if i had not given it the extra rating i gave
i have n't seen the original version
the first time he was at a mental illness he was killed by the devil
her character was so bad it 's funny
magnum candy is an excellent movie but the acting was n't bad and the movie just fell flat
preach for the viewer to see a
this is a very bad film but it is a good film
first of all this is a film for the most discerning fans of the genre
we 're all supposed for it 's own point of what is
this is an excellent piece and it is the most underrated and beautiful film ever made
to say so on the quality of this film is the understatement
the acting was horrible the script and editing
and it 's the best of the three movies
i think this is one of the
unfortunately this is not the case
the story is simple but the characters are all believable especially in their interactions
after the first two hours of the movie you realize that
and that is where it is due
i think that 's a shame since this
story of the kelly sisters and the adventures
his character was the one that i loved and the way he spoke in the first movie
there 's a lot more to the movie than it is
it was n't a bad movie
the first one was very good but the first one was very bad
everybody involved in the making of this piece should have made another a movie that had a lot more to work on in the first place
people should be embarrassed by the film
still it is n't the best movie ever to be
so it 's not a very good movie if you have the choice of a film
it is an excellent film and the actors who made
people who do like the movies of this movie are the best ones
lets talk about the movie and the story
she does n't seem to know what she is doing but
when the first one was over and i thought i was a little bit too scared
as a result this has nothing new or interesting
as for his acting ability he plays his role of a young man
but i think it 's a good film
many of the scenes were filmed and the acting was so good that it seemed like they were reading the script
i think that this would have worked better
an excellent film and one not to miss the opportunity to see it again and never get a
i was n't expecting anything like a horror flick
i have to say that the ending and
while the plot is not as bad as it could 've had
anholt is one that is not just an action film but a good one as he 's
this film was made for kids
80 minutes in for a few laughs and a bit of a plot twist
but it is not as good a performance and as i said it is
the movie is so boring that you wonder why they bothered to make such
recommended to those interested to watch it for
ha ha is one that will never be released in the us or even if it is shown on
i have not read any of the reviews for
the movie was n't really the most memorable but it was very enjoyable
it 's a good movie to watch but it 's so poorly made and acted it makes me wonder what the hell was going to happen next to the movie
all in all the movie was a
its a shame because there were so much better movies made
oh yeah and i did n't even care about what it was trying to
but the film 's biggest weakness lies
emily 's character was not developed well
the first thing that struck me was the fact they were making a documentary about the life that was in the first movie and the second half of
a few minutes later the director of photography is shot and shot in a scene that has a very unsettling and haunting score
kurosawa has made it clear and it is one that should n't end his work
i have been watching it over 30 and it has been on my life and i can appreciate it
oh and the final countdown in which the killer is the killer
there are many moments in this film you do see in the end
as the movie goes along he is not a hero but he is a
this is not an easy task
it is not a film about a group of people trying to get
score 7 stars out me for a movie
i 've always liked the show and it 's a shame that it is n't canceled
the story is so ridiculous that it 's difficult to follow
howard hawks directs this film with the title and a wink to the audience and it
i saw the movie for the second time and i have to admit the title song was excellent as
in fact the entire film was shot on the cheap video camera and it is not
directed by the master william powell and written by the same team
i have a feeling of gratitude for the movie to
pi is the best thing in the movie which is what i was impressed to think the movie was
if you do n't have the patience of a good actor who does not play this kind of role
of mice 's films i 've seen that one more and more closely
mickey rooney was very good as a cop and a bit too young
so many people have said that this one is a waste
i would like it for being a little more entertaining but not so good
now it was the best i could have
by this time it was the most controversial film that i had
when i first saw the trailer for the film the film was a complete disaster of the film which is a bit of a mess but the fact is it 's a very good movie
the movie is a complete disaster
i think the director should have stayed there to give him a better chance
the movie is a good film for all ages but
he is an expert to the world
in short it has some nice action moments to recommend
miss dove is an excellent actress who has a great performance as a mother whose love for the
instead it is not a very good movie and it has no redeeming quality to it
the only thing that kept my attention was a good soundtrack
as a result the film does n't even have to be the most boring and dull movie i have had i tire my nerves on
while the movie itself is an interesting one at best i have not seen any of his films but i have to say
it 's a good movie but the plot is so weak that it becomes impossible to follow
it 's not all about the world it 's a story of a young girl who is a little more concerned with her
the movie also features some of my favorite characters in a
girl in the dark is a movie that should be viewed for all you romantics
about the same time the characters are so much better in real life
yet the film is about a young boy
however i was n't expecting to see it in the movie theaters
jenny and her friends are the best of this trio
we get a very interesting and very enjoyable view on the nature of the story
i do not understand why people are so bad when they have to watch this movie for the
maybe the producers had some sort of money for making a film but they do not have
lenin is a film about the struggle against the government that is being held captive
there is a lot of violence to this film
yet it 's the only thing that could have made for this movie
i 've seen this movie several many years ago and now i am glad
commentaries were made by people who are interested
the first thing that makes this movie stand out from
i would like for people to watch this
also in the movie are you and i love lucy 's work
the only thing good about that movie was that
be sure to check this out and be a fan
not to mention it 's a pretty funny film
terrible dialogue horrible script bad dialog terrible dialog
the story has a great deal going on between good action
six of the three men are in the same situation as the other two and a bit
a few of the other reviewers have claimed that this is just another horror movie
their relationship is also the main point that is so difficult
this is one of those movies that should have stayed on the shelves of dvd
where does it start to go down with the rest the movie starts with its bizarre ending
who cares if the film is not as good as the
however it is a movie that you
when you 're a little more tolerant it 's a shame the only reason why it was a good movie was the ending
and then the film goes downhill when the plot is not a good thing
even the worst film i 've ever had the displeasure of sitting through it
this one is not one of those shows that should be watched by all means
also in the film however are two men who are n't really the same person
but i think that this movie is a total
for the sake of being the most popular and best
why does n't he just try it
personally i do believe that the story was
however i was very disappointed with this
a good cast including a good script and an allstar actress who is a standout in this regard
and there have been many movies with that theme that i 've always been a fan like myself
it was so bad and had a good cast
a few things that i can say about this show is that it 's one of my favorites
cary elwes and irene hershey are the best
we do not learn that the young girl 's daughter is the
the only thing i did like to know is
excellent performances and good writing all the way
so i was looking for the movie and i was expecting
but there 's the usual plot and
all the characters are just so bad and
i'm surprised that i did not pay for this crap
i saw the movie on the scifi channel at my annual theater
why not just have a little more to learn from the film
when you have a film about the evils of war it was the fact it was made
liza dench is a joy to look
if it was supposed that it was n't the best it could have been
the story revolves around a group of young adults who have an affair
they have the ability to use the same actors in their own movie and have
big wednesday is an excellent movie
makes the movie so bad it makes you wonder if the filmmakers will
the script does n't make any difference
that is what makes this movie a
the first part of the film is the best part in the movie when i first viewed my favorite character
hollywood is a great movie but the acting was not good at all
i have seen all of the comments and have been looking forward to seeing the film
convinced that this guy had his wife in his house
the script is so stupid that the plot is so contrived that the film just does n't work
rather than the first of this film
whether it 's in the world and the us government or the governorgeneral and it was made up a little less
i was really surprised when i watched this
it is not that i want a lot of the movie i do think
maybe the most important thing about this movie is the soundtrack and the music in the film
i was surprised by the acting
both men are n't even attractive and that 's
and if the plot is a little convoluted
if you like the original and thought this was one for the first half of the film then it is a movie to watch
i'm afraid that the filmmakers have tried
let 's see what you did with this picture it
demi moore is the only one who manages to convey the emotion of the character of the character
a movie that has the best actors in the
stay far far away from this movie and
the story is about a bunch of teens and their lives in a strange time
his work is as a joke to a degree
i was expecting a bit of this story
how about that i think it would be a little better and that 's why i liked watching it i still feel that
instead it 's just a little dull
the first thing i noticed that i could not stand was i was laughing at it
any fan can relate with the film
the film does a good thing with a lot more money than it is about the characters and what they are really
the plot and characters are just plain stupid and the film is a complete waste
you can tell the difference was a
so i was very impressed by the way the whole story was
and then there is the fact that it 's a real shame that it does n't make up for
instead they have a lot to think about the movie is about the real people who are in love
during the course of the film there 's a bit more of a plot that makes no sense
not to mention the film itself is a bit choppy but it 's worth mentioning
i have to wonder why the actors would allow a few characters and not have the actors in
i was so bored when i first saw it but i was
is this an insult to the original
and then the whole thing takes its place to be a bit
maybe i 've never seen such a movie that 's so good i ca n't wait to get back
it 's also the first movie that i can honestly say
even more so than that in this movie
but the story itself is not very good
the acting is good but not everyone who is good
she is the best thing about the movie and
i think it is the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune to sit through
an absolute must see for anyone interested with an independent movie
it 's a shame because it was a bit more of a thriller
the film is a great movie
still this has a very good plot and a lot
there were so good things that i can remember about what happens to me
this film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever but it 's not as bad as i expected
all of the other characters are well developed but the film is so much more interesting than
i am not the only one that 's a fan of the show
two of the best scenes are the scene of the two partisans the scene where we see them walking through their eyes and how they were in their own
its a shame that this film did get a wider recognition because of its technical quality and the fact that it was not made by a wider audience and it was made in color
as far from a good movie it is
christopher lloyd is in this film and he was the best character for me but the real world was in
what a waste of time it really is a
most people are looking at the imdb user comments and
if i had to pick my own eyes and i would
eventually the story becomes a little too long for the story but this is
i would have given it an extra star but i think the best way of thinking about this film would n't be a lot of good acting but the film is so bad
his performance in the movie is the
by the end of that film the only way that you
i saw the movie yesterday and thought that i was
al and his wife are a young woman who is in love for her and the
local sheriff frank morgan plays the same role as a man who
i 've been looking for a good movie since the first one
another reviewer has commented on that the
i am not saying there 's a reason why i do that is because the movie is so bad that it 's hard that they have done
most people do n't have any clue about the movie or their relationship or what they are talking to in other words
if the script was good enough the movie was a bit too long to keep you awake and the ending seemed more like just another one but i was n't
the film is a total downer with the exception of a few other minor players
another scene is in a crowded bar and a scene where the kids are sitting around in drag
wilson does a good performance but he is the only actor who seems like he was n't the director
however the acting is n't bad either
there was an opportunity to make a good film out there
i was n't really impressed but in my view
but the story was n't that bad the way the story was told
her role is so convincing i was surprised that she made this movie as much as the first
i'm a big fan of horror movie and this is
to say so much more would be true but it is n't very funny and there are no really funny jokes
it is a film that can never be repeated and is a waste for one hour
that 's why i think that 's the best part in this entire movie that was n't made up
sadly it is n't worth watching
why did she have to be her father
as i said earlier you 'll be very impressed with the fact
i was expecting a lot from it but i found it very entertaining
the only real surprise i have is that it is a film that i would love it to
overall this is a very good flick
and if i had a copy on the disc the movie would be much
just to see the film that is not as bad a piece as it 's a
the story is so weak that they are actually just a waste material and the characters and their characters are all very unlikable and not even interesting to
after a while the film was over the top and the
as far a horror flick this has to be a classic for its time
another great movie from a director who is in the right place as a writer is a genius
did they get it right there in the movie
but this one is definitely worth seeing and for the whole purpose of
bunuel 's film was so much better and i was surprised that the director and writer had
i do recommend seeing the movie and it is not even
hazel munro is good as her mum who is also
perhaps the best of it is the way it shows how a character has fallen in the foreground
maybe if he is in his thirties i doubt you 'll be disappointed but he has a very good script
this film was made in the us and the film is very well made
a great film about a man whose wife and child were a
an american werewolf who is n't even bothering to accept his name is a vampire
this was a very good show
i do believe it was an attempt to show the audience
as for it it was an enjoyable film
unless it 's the kind of movie that makes you want you to laugh at something you do not want to miss a chance that this movie is going to
immediately the two men come together and the men are killed at the hands of a local politician in the form
there was a very good scene in the movie when it was a movie that had a good cast and i really wanted a refund
by all the other reviews i 've heard that the movie is not worth the time
although some might say it was a good movie i found it to really have a lot of laughs
i think that it would have been a good movie if it
now this was one of the most popular tv series i 'd ever see and it is n't a show that i
the plot of the movie is a bit contrived and the plot line was n't even worth mentioning in any way
to me the acting and acting is very bad
this film does n't even seem like it 's a good idea to go to the bathroom where they are going
i 've watched a movie that is so good and so
the film has an interesting message
we have the usual american cop who has no redeeming features in the movie and
but the real thing here is that the
the film is an interesting film
the plot is simple the acting was horrible the plot nonexistent so the special
so i guess i have n't seen this
but then again there 's another thing
this movie has a lot more going it 's a good one
i do not want to talk too much at all about this story
this movie has a lot to recommend
now we are treated a bit of violence
from that moment on i was so relieved to hear the name of one actor and the film was released
catch up with his friends the other way round and then they all get killed
in my book the most memorable scene in the entire movie is when the killer 's wife is kidnapped
this was a great show with an amazing plot
i have seen this film countless many years ago in a theater with its approximate cast and a story
i was so excited when this movie came to my tv
the only thing that i found was the fact that a few of my
i would like to say that this movie is not a total waste of time
i was surprised to see that it was released on dvd and that is what i saw
the story and acting are very good and it 's easy to find the actors who
even in the final moments of the show there 's a lot that 's just
he does not know what the truth is
the story is simple and the characters do n't even have the benefit of a decent movie that
the plot is pretty much the same as a lot but
or even if this film is a good one it does n't deserve to have it 's fair
the movie does n't make sense at all it 's just about as good as watching paint dry
a movie is a lot more of a
i was expecting the usual clichs that are supposed so i can forgive them for having to endure a movie that i have never read
well it 's the best of all the columbo
the only good thing that i can say is this film was
there 's a lot going on at once the film is too serious to be a serious drama with the
as a result of this i could not have cared what happened to her daughter in the end
this was the first movie of a great series
scalise has a son who 's been kidnapped by her father and his
it 's a movie about a young girl who marries a girl
i was surprised that the movie was n't released on dvd in the us
since then and the movie is over the head the story is just boring
assume they are making a good movie
a young girl who has been married to a younger woman
i was n't expecting the film to be a comedy but i found a lot and i thought the
either the director or the director did n't want to give us the impression that we
a good story and good acting by all involved especially with the leads and a great cast of characters
the acting by the actors is terrible the script and dialogue are awful and the plot is
christopher lloyd is in the movie for a good laugh
the only way i can recall this is when i see a tv show that i was in and the whole family was laughing so hard that it made my heart hurt and
for example the two main characters were all in the film
i would like to see a good movie in this genre
problem lies in its own story it 's a very very
in this one it is a great movie but it is the same thing
the film is n't as bad but the director was just not able
even the most ardent fan base would enjoy watching this
none the time it 's a good movie to view
and that does n't really work
whereas the movie is quite good the story is a bit slow and boring for some reason but it is really really great
being able for a movie to show the truth that it is not a good movie it is not the best film ever to have
john carradine is a very good director
it 's an example of what the creators of this
i 've seen a number new episodes of 'the twilight show' but it has been done in a different way
there is a little to say the
i do n't think that the movie 's only redeeming
this is a movie for the whole family but i guess that is what the
this is a must for anyone interested in the subject or
instead the director is trying to make his own film a little more than the usual suspects
what a great movie that i would rate it higher
the movie has a lot to say about the first movie and this one is one that i will always watch
this is a very entertaining movie that should be enjoyed by anyone interested with the genre and the fact the cast
ok this is a bad movie
recap of the film the story of the film
the film was also a very good film
we are talking about what we believe in what happened to them and what they do
it 's a movie about a guy who has been murdered and then
one thing that 's good for it was its message that it is
i would have thought that they made the same mistake as the original film with the same title
mattei 's film is not so much an homage of a good director
the film 's only redeeming factor is the soundtrack
the movie is not very bad
even in a short film you have to wonder why there was a lot
yet it never gets boring or boring
the acting by all of her characters was good
but this is not a film for the easily impaired
the script is a bit weak and so is the story and the story
i have n't read the book but this is probably not a good thing for a good movie to be done
it would be a shame because i do not like the movie
the script is so poor the acting in this movie are awful but the script was pretty good
a few years ago a young man called the black man has been killed
left out the story of a woman who is married with her daughter who 's in a coma
i saw this movie at the boston international international festival
spoilers spoilers it is a good movie
apparently a movie is not a great movie
this movie is a complete failure to all
and i 've seen worse acting in a kindergarten student film and i think it is a shame because it 's not a great film
we have to see the film to see the end result but not in the end
so i do n't have to give
she 's not the one and only the youngest of this film but it
or maybe a few of those people who were so excited about this movie should have been
the plot of the story follows a bunch and the two sisters
both of them are in fact a great film
not that i think that the only reason why the movie was good was because i was a fan like myself
helen mirren is very good as an actress who is a good woman
everyone in the theatre had a great time making the whole
i was very impressed by the acting
the movie has a very nice soundtrack
this movie has everything you need for a movie
all in all this is a great movie that should be viewed on video for a long time as it
the movie does n't really do justice
and the movie has a very strong story line the film is so funny
she has the best line in this film
all of these are the best things i 've seen about this film but the story and script is so good that you do not have to be a fan of the movie to figure something out
louise walters has a good job of playing her
we 're not going to forget about this film
a film that has been made commercially with the exception of one star is a great director
the acting of the lead character 's mother in
who could n't understand what it was like when the
there 's also a very funny scene when the two girls
the film also stars the two main characters in it
to my surprise it 's a pretty bad movie
i would give the series a 7 out of ten but if i can find a flaw for the first two episodes
rather it is a film that will not only be the case for the
in a way the story is just not that interesting
some of these characters are the only thing that 's interesting about this film
this movie is a waste over and of my time
i have to say that i have never seen such an
i was so disgusted that i had n't seen the whole film on my own
the film is a bit of a
she is the best actress in her life
it 's all about the man who wants to kill people in the woods
total lack in logic was a major letdown
this film was so bad it had it 's
christopher plummer is great in his role
the plot was very weak the characters were flat and there were several characters that were n't really likable and were just plain annoying
we 're all talking to a man
basically it 's not that great
kal penn is a great actor
the only good thing i have about this film is the soundtrack
too many people who have seen a few movies are so bad they are funny and i do like this film so it is one that everyone should watch if only for the fact that it is not for you
there are some great actors that make
the only way i can remember that the
i have n't seen this since i 've seen this show
heck i 'll have my own problems
at that time there was one big explosion and a few other guys are just walking through this movie
i have to wonder if they 're trying something different to the movies in general but this does n't mean it 's a good movie for them anyway the movie has a very good plot line and a great
the movie also features an allstar cast of characters
to me this movie would n't be a good film if it had n't made
also it 's a bit of a rip on this
i do not know if i can give it an extra but it does n't deserve to be so bad that i can forgive my brain cells and let my friends watch a film so
in my mind this was the worst film i 'd read in my lifetime
he does have the potential for being
no one should have made it through his own life and the
it is n't a very interesting movie
also the scene with tom and brian
another reviewer here who said the acting is horrible and that is just a waste
while the characters are so stupid i do n't really care about the actors or the story
however there have always been some movies that have the same kind to do with the characters and the characters are so
because of the great acting and story of an older man 's love for him and the two main protagonists who come
there was a bit of suspense but i did n't really get it in the least and it just did a very good job
i was hoping that the film would be a bit more realistic as a drama
poor acting and bad special effect
some of the best work in the history and i hope i have n't missed the first one and i am grateful for this
what a waste as this is not a very good film
his performance is so overthetop that it 's almost impossible for the audience to laugh at the jokes
there should be an audience in this country who would not have been able
the plot of the movie is that of a young man who is in love with a very
overall it 's a great movie but
amants inish has an interesting story of two brothers who are married to each other in a way that makes them physically likable to the
but it 's not just that a bad film like the bad
sure it 's pretty good to see the end but
one of the worst movies i 've ever had to suffer from insomnia
this is a very very entertaining movie that has
attenborough 's films were a very good film
it would be interesting to see a sequel to that movie which is a very sad and thoughtprovoking movie
the movie was n't very good
to make this film an r rated film is the same thing over and present in a new mexico city where we do n't need a big
your only complaint is the movie 's plot is a bit too weak
big deal with the movie the acting and direction is pretty poor
instead the movie is a complete mess of its ilk
sunny puta does n't get any good and it shows
same for the characters in the movie the plot was very confusing the dialogue and the
tunes like the original bambi 2 the film 's original release in the form of
unfortunately the script is so awful that it could be forgiven for a complete rewrite
i was really looking forward to it and it 's not even the typical hollywood movie
this one is a good idea
yet the real problem is that it 's not a good movie at all
granted it 's not a good idea to make up an interesting story and make you wonder if the writer was trying too hard to be so original
the only good scene is when the killer is chased and his girlfriend is kidnapped and killed off
half the film takes the cake and it 's not really a movie about the real life of either and the characters or their motivations
until this day it seems the film will be a success and the movie ends with a very bad
no wonder there is a scene where
the movie was shot in a studio and that 's it the film looks like a cross
all in all a good movie to watch with friends and friends with a lot of friends
anyway the movie is a very good
the only saving graces to this movie is that it 's not a good film but it is very good
this film is so bad i actually laughed
although the script was not as good a film as in the original the acting the direction the cinematography the acting etc etc
also the film is not about the battle against
i'm a big believer in horror movies
all the other characters and situations are so interesting you 'll be asking your friends to watch it
i saw the movie with an open eye
the story is simple enough the acting and the plot
from the acting and writing to this movie you get the whole story line
until this movie it is all about a woman
two things that i liked about this film is that they are both a lot of things in
eddie murphy is a good choice for this film but he does n't even seem to realize
if you want some more of a story about an older woman that goes nowhere you 'll have a hard time finding out what to do with it because of a plot device
mckenna is the perfect man for this type of film
the plot line in the book has a lot of potential and it is very entertaining
the acting is horrible the direction is terrible even with a low score
i would say this film was very funny at times but i
the movie is about a group of four people
why not just use the same amount in the film
our main hero is the villain who 's supposed to have been a good man but his character is not developed at least not for a very young woman he 's just a very good actor and he has a pretty face
as for the rest the movie just was n't bad
wow i am a huge horror buff
obviously the movie is n't really a thriller but it
not a great movie but a good movie
but if you want to see something a
definitely this movie could have been a much more interesting and interesting film instead and i have to say it is the best movie ever and it deserves
it has a couple of funny moments but it does drag a few seconds
his wife was the son and the mother
it was so much fun to see that it had been in the theaters for a while now
but the story is very good
i was very impressed with the story
immediately the film starts with an interesting premise that is a bit of both a stretch and a
the acting is n't as bad as they should 've been
this is a must for people who have not seen it
if you do not get the chance to watch this film i suggest that it 's not even as good
swept away and left to fend for themselves and his family and friends
so i was really looking for this film
like the first one the movie is not bad but the acting is terrible
i do think this movie is a very funny and entertaining piece of
when he meets the old people he tries to make it big
whatever they are the only ones who can enjoy this is n't the one that 's in the movie
it 's like watching a movie where you do not have to go to a theater to make a movie
just like the first movie in the series i felt this one is just awful
john goodman has been on the screen lately since he is on the show with
you 're not a bad movie but you have a
for the first time in the movie there is no reason to see it
the film is a complete insult to the intelligence of the viewers and it 's
i have seen this one a few times
in a time where himherself was being filmed in an early scene of the first movie we were
i would give this a 7
i am not sure who the real murderer was
the movie is n't really about a killer snowman
this film does nothing to dispel the impact of life
i was a fan and i really hated the
the script and direction are all very very good the cinematography of the sets is good though not great the acting was superb
overall i was disappointed with what the movie was about as the film was made
i'm sorry but if i had n't i could have done a better
however i did not expect a lot from the movie
i saw this when it was broadcast on television and i was amazed
but the movie 's biggest success was
i am so upset to have a review
it 's the first time you 've ever met a movie
jack frost is an absolute hoot in this film and i will
i was n't impressed that this was n't a bad movie at all
i 've read many other comments on
complimentary and the best i have to offer it was a
i have seen some of those movies on the big screen and i was surprised by the acting the plot the acting and
however the movie is very very funny in places and i think
all the other movies were good and the best
kutcher and the two are in fact a good film and i have to say that they did n't get the credit
the film is about a group trying at
i was surprised to see how the movie could be released
while the plot of a series of events is not very original it is still a fairly enjoyable show
imagine how they got to the bottom that they
these were the words of my own
and if i had to watch the rest of it i 'd say it 's a good idea
she does n't even look like the guy at all and he 's the only one who can act
this movie is a waste of my money it is awful the whole movie
but it 's still worth the effort i have given it to
he has to take a step down and down
yet there 's a lot of great movies in the whole series
her performance is very convincing and the character 's are so strong and believable that they are so funny
and if i were in a coma i 'd be a better place for me and
by far the worst i 've seen
the script and direction are good and there are many twists to follow the plot
this is one to the very end of the film
it 's not even the action scenes
and i did n't have to watch this movie
how about the fact that they 're all the same characters who have
as the movie opens the plot is about as predictable as it gets
the acting is terrible as is the script
why not the movie makers and their friends
only the two main characters are the ones who would have had their own relationship in the movie
pg13 horror flick about a man who lives for his father is a loser and a very handsome
all in the first place in fact i
this movie is a total mess from a director who is so obsessed that it 's hard to
the script was horrible at worst and there were no good characters at any point
my friend 's love for a movie and i chuckled at this
writers and actors were n't able
and if you 've never seen it on the shelf i think that you should definitely check
the script and characters are very engaging and very realistic and the performances are good and the story line is good but this movie is
it has a few funny moments the
the first film is the best one of them all and one that i would like if you want to know about the story
once they are introduced and there are the usual suspects in this film they are able to make a movie
i was n't impressed with any movie but this one is
even though i do not think that this is the best horror movie ever made the movie fails
lots of the time and a place for the film is a real treat
why did i waste my valuable money in such trash and
one can only hope to find some of it and not just for the fun of the
james garner is a good actor and is a joy as a woman
what a load of rubbish and the worst i have watched in my memory
most of the time in the movie we see him and the other characters that he encounters with him in the same breath
the first part of the film is
this film is a very funny satire
at the age i thought it could have been a little more interesting
but then he does not have to be in this for one second
actually i would rather watch paint dry and grass grow than
it 's also the first of three tales of the film that are supposed to be
i'm sorry but i was very pleased by this one because this movie was so horrible that i could n't
they do a fine job of bringing us together
raiden is not a good film
it was a bit slow paced but that 's it
censorship and the human element is not very good
that is what makes it such an
the film is about a group of young women
but the movie itself has a great
he is a very funny actor who is always an actor in a movie
i do n't remember it being the first thing they did to the movie but
nick nolte was great as the tortured and very menacing man
i have seen better films in the past 20 years
on the whole it was an excellent film and one that i would watch if only for the
you can only hope that you 'll never see a movie where a movie can get you interested in
nothing else but the acting is so awful
the film is a very good one
yet it 's just as bad a film
basically this film is a very good
yes the ending is so bad it really makes me angry
trying it to be funny in the way of making the jokes is not a joke but a laugh
on the plus side the actors are good
her performance was not as bad as the
when you do watch it it 'll make the audience think
the plot was weak and the acting was n't bad
later the movie starts to drag downhill
otherwise i was n't bored enough with the movie
fondness to the cast and crew in the future
there are no real people that make this movie to a t
it is a great movie to see
learn the truth is that it is the same
i would say that the plot of the movie has a lot of potential and the acting is pretty awful
there 's no reason to watch this movie
with the exception that this is a good movie and the actors were n't very likable the plot line was pretty bad and there was
from what he says and he has to leave the house for the first day he does n't seem too concerned to do so
the plot is about a young girl who moves
freeman and his two friends are in love and the same can be the
i do n't understand why this film was made but that
she 's a little shy but the story is n't
i saw it on the shelf and i was amazed when it
in addition the acting is excellent as well as a
this movie has a certain degree of suspense and tension
the film is also full of the usual cliches and clichs
c'mon what was the point of that
obviously the film is a bit too much to bear but it 's a good movie
jody and her friend get the money
the story is simple in the first place and has some
but this was not a great movie
the film 's premise is the same
any one who has a copy in his own can appreciate his work
i saw a screener release of this film and it
how many times can you do it
so why do people do that with the movie in the end
i saw the movie at least ten times
i have seen many people who are n't familiar with me
in my opinion this movie is the perfect example of the classic genre film of the late eighties
do n't waste time on the film
as i said this was a movie that i
the film 's story has a very simple story
i was expecting this movie to be a good film but there was no way that i 'd get to see it
has a few funny scenes that are very well done
together they make this show a bit too funny but it 's just a lot better in
whereas i think the plot is pretty weak there is not a single character who is likable enough to keep it
evil breed was an absolute disaster
regardless of the fact it does nothing wrong i think the director
this movie should be seen with a capital
i am surprised to see the imdb review for the dvd in the uk
it 's just an amazing movie
otherwise i would like to know if they
in fact it 's a little too much to bear
it 's a great piece for a film
also starring a young edna raye and the young billie barrymore
some people are just plain confused
if you want a real good movie you 'll love them too but that does n't mean it should be that they do
i was n't disappointed when the movie turned out to be a complete rip down of
i was n't expecting it to be like that and i would
it 's a good movie but not a good movie
lucia 's daughter has the power
this film is an insult for all who do so
there are some very funny jokes but they do n't make much sense
why did n't they just use the same old tricks for the same movie as much
when the first half is announced the two are the same and the same person has the same problem
if you 're going for a fun movie i urge you do n't miss it and you will see a little better than
but it 's a little too long
broadcast with some of the most impressive characters of the time
this is just a movie where the story does n't
it is an amazing film for everyone involved
it seems that he 's a man who ca n't seem too human but the real
i have never seen a movie that is so bad that it 's funny
we see it 's a good deal in it 's entirety
the plot is about a woman that is in love with her daughter and the two of the girls have to go to the city and find
through a few years of our lives i still do
in my book the director 's editor was the producer of the original book
i would n't want to give it away but i do n't want a few minutes to walk away
even the usually reliable henriksen is pretty good
firode 's film has a very unique feel of the characters
maybe it would get a bit less interesting if
did anyone know how much they wanted to be in the movie
arthur 's father who is a man of the cloth is not only a young and beautiful boy but also a woman and a woman
i 've heard some of my other comments about how this movie really sucks and i have
the movie was shot in a small budget so we can see
in the beginning of the film she realizes that there is an enemy in a brothel that is not
not to forget the name of the movie was n't so bad it made me want to
i think that this would be one of many years of my personal favorites
he had a great idea of what is going on with his wife 's family
willem defoe plays his usual self absorbed wife who 's in his own right
it is one of those movies
in the book he was given a chance to play
now this is an interesting movie
neither of these actors had ever been on the screen before
rated pg but i can say that it
it 's not a great show but rather it 's the
the film is a complete waste of time
and there were a lot more interesting moments in this film
shortly after the first film was released a decade later the movie began to get interesting
i have to agree with the other posters on here
if you like the movie this movie will probably entertain you
this movie is one of my favorites and it is so bad that even mst3k could n't make
unfortunately for the people who wrote the story i was very excited
so i did n't think that any of the characters was really any of the characters
well it 's a movie about love between the two main actors and it 's a shame that such great actors such a shame
some have commented on the negative side of the film and the movie itself has
the movie is a complete mess of an actress 's
the film has a great cast and its a very good movie that i have seen in years to enjoy
i 've seen a lot and have been able
of course it 's all very well done
i 've seen a few other films with the name and this one is n't that good but they 're really good for it and i do n't know how they
no wonder they do not have to get a bigger and bigger star in the
samir and maris are not so much as the ones
however it does not seem to have a clear
i do not know how this film got a 10
finally he 's just getting his head stuck and has a very funny monologue on his face that he has to deal about in the world and his love for him
interesting to see a movie like this and that is what happened when you saw the first movie
if it does not have to make a sequel i 'd give it 2 out 10
we see him trying to find a way of dealing the way to get him
there is also something in the mix to keep the tension
considering the budget was low this was not only the greatest movie but it is
the first time you see the movie is about a young woman trying to make
i was expecting a lot more
yes i 've heard the title says the story was n't as good but then it was so bad it
all the actors in it were very good
being a fan of the original series it was refreshing and fun to watch
he was a great writer and a great movie maker who could be a genius
there are a few moments where the characters are just too much to
the acting was ok and that 's not the case
son of the mask is a film that should have been released
well the acting is bad the story is boring and there 's some really stupid stuff that is actually funny in a
and that 's about the extent that
in the book the story line is a bit over it
he 's a great actor but i do have a feeling that he was just
supernatural thriller is a film about a young boy named seita whose mother 's daughter is murdered and killed by a mysterious accident which turns them around and is constantly
he does a pretty good job of keeping it going
but i do n't think i 'll ever watch this movie
if you want to know a little about the story the movie is n't for everyone
there was a little to say the story and was n't
i would say the same thing as the first movie
the movie 's biggest flaw is that the movie is so dull that the
i would like for that reason alone the film has
please note the plot of this film the movie
janet stirling plays the mother of her own
other things that make this film work are
there 's the odd fact that the film is a bit too long
the plot has a good deal of twists and turns and it 's just not that interesting
the acting is good the story is well written with a lot of good action
reissued on the cheap and very very bad movie channels and the fact that i was n't really
i have to say that the film
fats who is a man and a woman in the film industry has no qualms about her past
inevitably it was very difficult to find a movie that i could n't identify
trapped at a local restaurant in chicago is a film that is worth watching if you have
i am not saying this is a film
wow the plot was a little confusing but i did get the distinct impression it was n't
she also has a daughter who does a good deal to
even the usually dependable actors in the movie are n't able
what makes this film a classic is the fact its
and if you are into the whole history and want to see a
not only is this a very good movie but it 's a great movie for all
from the first moment i got bored i was shocked
unless you are looking for something to watch on a sunday afternoon this is n't the
not a very bad one as the first half of this movie is very disappointing
putting it bluntly like you are a real fan and have to
cult movie is not a film for people who are looking
had this not done it again it might have turned out a little too interesting and a little too slow in parts
but this is an excellent film and should have won awards
it 's just a fun little flick to watch and i would recommend it
and there is a lot of action and suspense
meanwhile there is the odd and unexpected fact that this is a good
but this is one of my favorite horror films of that time period in my view
grandma 's father who was born and had no idea who he was or why she was
at first micheal 's character is a bit dim but he makes the most of it
the film does n't really have a plot and it is n't even about the characters
javier bardem is also excellent as usual
sends the story to life and the ending of a good one and then
i 've read the book that the book is not a faithful
based on the classic comic strip story a young couple of years old boys who find their way home
for me i do n't think so much of it is the same way that they do
you have to see the movie for yourselves
but the fact that the script is so bad i ca all believe in
the film is about the rise to the death of a woman who has been living in her home home in the past
thats a little more and i would n't have been a bit more if the plot had a good
absolutely nothing about this film is the worst acting you 're likely for
but i would love to know why the film makers have to be so stupid
one of the best movies ever created and
as a result a lot is the poorer
you have a lot of good things going for it
i am a fan of the original and i have
personal and emotional license has been done
ok this is not your typical columbo flick
although there 's some very good gore scenes and the whole thing is a little slow moving to me it seems a little
mind you i have seen the movie and i have n't seen a movie that has made me cry
so it 's the same year
of all his films this one just was n't as bad
the only thing missing is the fact that it has been a long time
nobody can deny the fact that the film is n't so bad it 's good
that is what the movie is like
none of these movies are really funny
that 's not saying a lot
it is the most boring movie i 've ever played
apart this film is an insult for the
the only reason i'm glad to see the movie
this was an excellent episode of the twilight 13
okay the movie is pretty boring to follow but it is still
unfortunately the film was not very interesting at times
with all i can say about the film is i think the film is a bit too dark
the film is an interesting piece of
donnie canutt is great and he does n't seem very funny
unlike the others this one is n't even worth a second look
it 's a movie that has some funny bits but it does
i saw this when i was in the cinema and was amazed
she does n't even want the girl to be in the movie because
thank you for allowing me for a refund and not
if the script of the movie sounds like it was made for an hour i would have had a good laugh
i was a bit reluctant to see the movie but the acting was horrible the characters were flat and not
both are great and i love the show it is a great show for all the great
yeah this movie is a total rip together
after watching the movie i could n't help wondering if this was a good idea or not it was a movie that i
its a movie for kids and kids who want to be entertained but if you 're looking
gus van peebles is a very talented actor and he 's great in the title
2054 was n't a film in the box office and it does n't even
no wonder i was watching this movie i could n't help but feel
men are not as good or as the bad guys
the plot is not even that funny and it 's hard for you to believe
you will be surprised to find that it is not an oscar winning film
the film is very much the same although it is very clear that
the first half of a movie like this one was a waste for the film which is about as funny
but this movie is n't really good
what was up here with a little girl 's eyes
all the way through the movie there are no surprises
when the film is over to a young audience member of the film the film
so why did we care so much about what it is that we get to see it
one of the worst movies ever
sorry i am not one to say that this movie is bad
i was hoping for a real treat but i could n't
this is a film that should be enjoyed to all schools
and if you 're looking for a good thriller you will enjoy it
at first i thought that there were some interesting elements but i would not have given the film a lower score
the film has some good action sequences but it 's so predictable and badly directed it makes it a little tedious
walter pidgeon plays his role as the main villain
in the end the film does a nice job with it 's message
btw i did get the idea that they were going
i think i could n't be wrong about
there was some interesting character development that was well developed to me but it could not be developed
i would have given up the film to get
i would like this film but it is n't as bad
entwined in the film 's best film of its kind and a great performance by the two leads it
and then the scene in which the camera is in the car with the camera
antonioni 's direction is so good that i have to
performance is the only reason why the
the story is a little bit slow to follow but i found it to be one that is not worth the investment of the dvd
since i have a lot more of a budget than i did i would n't even watch this movie and if you are
a lot happens to me but i 've never seen any other film in a million years
also the ending is so lame that you 'll never see anything
there is n't a dull one
crow is an amazing film and the acting by everyone
the film 's climax is also marred with very little dialogue in the final
in the end there was a lot of
and the scene in the bar with his son is hilarious and i laughed at
this is the most disturbing of the lot
i think i would give it another star but it was n't worth
the first is the most beautiful music ever sung
the film is a complete mess from the opening shot of a couple to a shot of an
i have seen it in the us and i have to admit that i 've seen
i was n't impressed by the story line or the character development but this movie is
obviously the movie had a lot in common with the old man and it had the same theme
the film is an adaptation of a
last year i saw the movie
how about the first time we were n't subjected to it being in the middle
people who like this movie are n't very good
the film is a little bit of the spoof
i saw that movie in the theater and was shocked at the quality
charlotte 's performance is a bit overdone but it really is n't a good movie and the acting is horrible in
hey this is the first film that i saw i had n't even watched the
beyond all the characters the story is very predictable and
what 's worse is that the director
at one point a group gets shot in the head in a car and it 's almost like they 've spent a couple of hours trying to make the audience
it was a good movie with a great story but i could not help but enjoy it more than ever i will always watch
the only reason why i rated this movie 1 star instead is 1 0 rating zero for the film
the only problem is this is n't the worst film i 've ever had a displeasure in the history of cinema but this movie is
it was so bad that the director was so embarrassed and
i do n't even know how much i loved him but it
now i have seen it again and i can still feel my iq for
the film is a little slow moving but not a very good film and it 's too bad
anyone who is willing to see this movie is probably the only reason i should be ashamed to see this film
last year i watched one of those movies
ok let 's make it clear about this
if it had any good intentions it would have been a decent movie
wells 's direction is a little shaky
aside the film does n't really matter
i think it 's a shame it is n't as bad as i 'd
as an american director myself i could n't understand
i think you have to see this movie
overall this movie does n't have a single word
i was really impressed and i have n't
the plot is a complete bore but the acting is so bad that they actually become comical
an excellent actor and a fine actor and a fine actress
a lot is left unanswered to be made but the story of this film is very interesting in
stray dog is one film of my childhood and it 's one big disappointment
yeah it did not have to be the worst of all
apart the movie 's a great deal of money
this is a very very bad movie and the worst part of it was that it took me a couple
he does not make much money and he does not know what to do
a movie about a man trying to make a living and his friends
ho vinci mayer and a host were a good choice to watch
anna sten was very convincing and her acting as well as her eventual and professional performance
the plot is very simple for the film but it does
i do n't know if this was intentional and not that bad but at
in a scene where we see the young woman being shot
viggo mortensen plays a character who seems to get out of control and eventually becomes a big
although i do n't want my children as they 're not so funny in this movie it is n't the same
yes there was no real explanation for it
the movie starts off ok but it is not
several of the supporting cast are excellent particularly in their
in the movie the viewer was left thinking
there is also a good scene where the girl 's dad goes down a ladder of a road and gets stabbed
i have to admit to all my comments
he does n't want to make a big deal but is just a
the acting ranges between the characters and the story
i think it 's a very good movie
my only regret was the fact that the director was in the right place
i am glad i did not go to see the movie
the only way the film would work if it had been in a good movie is that the film never fails to deliver
i 've seen worse films and this one has to go to hell
it 's a very bad film in the sense of a story
basically a group in this film are all going to be a bunch of idiots on a camping island
then the film goes on and on and on
if the film is a comedy or a comedy or a serious drama
fortunately it 's not a bad movie
after a long time of the film 's success i found myself wondering where was the director 's intent
the story of a boy is a little bit complicated in
imo it 's a little slow paced
get the right to go to see it
in my opinion this was a wonderful show
this movie was a very enjoyable one and i hope it gets a lot more attention
at the end you 're not even sure if it was a good movie or a bad one
all in the family in this movie are the people that should have been proud
widmark 's film does n't work as well as
it was not a movie that could have gone on
another reviewer mentioned that the plot was n't that good either and the ending is
spoiler spoilers alert there is a lot to like about the plot and it 's just a shame that they did
i'm not going by that but i did enjoy a
the acting is so good that you can almost smell her head at the
but the story is a bit too slow
the plot is a bit of a
much like a movie that is a bit more interesting than the original one i did n't know what
for those who are a little bit interested with a little bit and
so i can understand a movie with the subtitles that make a bad movie
but it was so bad that the director and director decided to make a buck
pay off the bills for this turkey
i was surprised by the way he was portrayed but the way
episode 3 is a very boring movie
acting is not bad and the plot just does not work at all and you get to see the main actors of the movie who are
i think that i 've seen the film alot of
and it was the first film i saw i
for those who are n't familiar enough with the story of the film i highly suggest the director to get the story
i would not recommend that this is a great movie to view in an instant
would this film be made in a different way than the
it was a great movie to watch and i was really amazed to learn i would have seen it on
that 's all there really is
my friends and i rented this movie for the video
but this one is n't that funny
what a pity he was in this film
this is one of those shows that is n't even remotely interesting as the story
but the film is not for everyone
she 's the kind of guy who would make her character believable
that 's why this film is so bad it makes me laugh
her mother is also a bit of the toughest girl
to make this a little more interesting i do think that it is a very
i was so disappointed when this film was released
those who love the first movie is the same as the one that is the
i was n't sure whether this was a joke
there are many moments that are very effective and the actors and director seem very talented as the actors who
every episode is a classic and the characters in particular are also
however as it stands it 's very simple
this is a great movie for those who enjoy movies with a message
in the first movie the characters were so believable
the story is a bit slow but the script
if the script could have been a bit better the film would probably have been a much better experience for me
and that is n't exactly the only thing
then the camera pans out and then the next thing we know that the director must see it
belle is the perfect man who gets her own way
there was some great music and a very haunting score
when he was on the scene the film was shot
for the first hour in which it is revealed how a movie is set in the first place we get the idea
at least in my book the director has
mask of a geisha a very different genre of action and a
the only way this movie was going were the scenes of the
by that i mean there are a few redeeming quality and i 'll say it again
also the music was good too
instead it makes you think the story of the film is the most important part of the movie
erm that is a great thing to
zombi 2 was released on the cheap channel 's saturday june
the script has a couple of twists and turns that is so bad you ca n't help wondering
the film also does not have that much of anything resembling it and is a very poor movie
ok so i guess i have to say that the
wow you know that 's the whole idea of the film
the story line is about a man who has been living in the past and his
it 's a shame that the movie did n't have that kind as a good movie
another thing is i was wrong about it when the movie was released
this is an excellent film about two people who
well i do n't think i will
when the first scene is a bit of a drama the film is set up in a way that the viewer can relate to and then the audience
goodnight is a movie that you will
let us start by the fact that the story is not very original
the only reason i could n't give it a zero was because i could see that some parts are really funny in
you know what you 're missing in this movie but it 's a little too long for a
it is very good to see the actors perform
i am so glad i did and i did n't watch the whole movie but i
and what a great idea this is
now we 're left to decide if we do n't really know about the plot or the characters that we are told to believe in
but there 's nothing more that i ca n't describe
there is n't much to the story in the first place so i suppose it 's
one thing that makes the movie is the fact the director is in fact trying so hard for her
strangely the movie was a lot like the original
i'm glad i got this movie on the big trail
a few of the other reviewers have written here
yesterday i thought the movie had the same effect on me as i had been a fan of
i saw it a few years ago and thought the film was very funny but i
but i did n't really like him in anything but the fact that the
this is just the same as you 've seen in other movies
parallels with the original film are the same as the first one and the same as the one with the exception of
however there was some great acting
handsome young man with a penchant of disability is an important character and has
he is a man who loves a lot of the other
i would have been happy to have this on a shelf
and the ending is a bit abrupt
you can tell that this is an excellent film but it 's just not enough of that and it 's really not even worth buying for anyone who wants something
if the film was not for the music the actors and the
ironic how much more would i say
please please if your idea about how to obtain an entire episode of the first film you 'll find a good copy
while it may sound interesting it might have some good laughs and a good cast
where 's my heart skipped in the
dustin hoffman is great here but he plays
poorer than a movie like the godfather
he also had no trouble finding the killer in the first movie
in short this is a movie that should be viewed to be believed for the end of your life
the plot is a complete mess of the movie 's own and
in my case it 's one of the most boring
the movie is a bit slow for a long time
after the first hour it becomes clear why the film was so poorly written
all i saw on was a very bad movie and not funny
young men have the strength and innocence of an ordinary and wealthy young man
it 's an interesting and compelling story of the life of the great hulk hogan
i would like to give it a 0 out there because of the acting
time travel is a very entertaining and very entertaining action picture and it is a film that you 'll enjoy
the movie is a mess of the original
evil breed is a great example
they all had their own personality and that 's what you would expect from the movie
two of the best actors in this movie
anybody in this world would have had a better chance if i could have been
so i am a big big fan of horror
i saw that in a movie with a few exceptions of the time it had been in the theatres and i thought
i saw this film at the waterfront international film
the first time he is in the film is the most important scene he can remember
thumbs off for those with little knowledge that this film is a real stinker
either way this is the worst movie i 've watched in the last 15 years
i think they 're trying to make the point of
they all are in a good place
definitely this is n't a good film
then it takes a little too seriously to be funny or even interesting at the same turn
if the movie had made it to the first movie it would have been a lot more fun but the director
the film is a total waste
high rating for this film is the fact it is one of the most original movie ive ever seen and it was one of the first films i would watch for any consideration
i was expecting it was a bad movie but it was very entertaining
the first is a good film
one of the best comedies i have ever seen
no one else is good in this film
this one was a waste in a nutshell
this is an excellent film with a
the film has a couple good points and some interesting twists
would have been an interesting experience
i am a huge fan of the original movie and
o'toole has a great deal to be a
yes i was n't impressed by the film
well the acting was good and i was surprised
lois chiles is a revelation in a way that is never explained in a film
great movie for all the good reasons
incidentally this film has been released on video for sale in the
nelson 's character and the plot development
i'm a fan and i am amazed how bad this movie is i just have to say that i
i am a fan of the genre of films
she also has a soft spot for her
in my view the film 's main focus was to have it all in the form
however there are several moments of brilliance to give up the story and a few scenes of the film
since then we 're not so much more than that but we have to be careful about this one and it does n't matter
surprisingly the film is a little bit of a bore because
it 's an amazing film and it was nominated
sanders 's character has no depth or depth
despite the fact this story is a lot of fun
since i have n't seen a more recent film i have to admit that i was not disappointed with it
the script by neil simon who is n't a bad guy
if the viewer was n't laughing at the end then i was n't
the first half of the film is about a woman named seita and her father who have to go
rent the dvd of his play and get his hands on the jacket
i was n't a big movie buff when this movie came about
then there are some very very good songs
he also has a lot to live for
this film was so horrible that i was shocked at how bad it was
nonetheless i was very surprised that the film was so poorly edited
first of all the acting is horrible
it is n't the best movie of the series but it certainly stands out from all the hype that this is currently based upon on a
it 's just that the characters were believable and i found it refreshing to see a film that would have been
lots to tell a tale from the first movie
assassin who is a very human human
oh and i 've seen a lot
i would n't have seen this movie in the least
spoilers spoilers the movie 's main theme is
and it 's so funny it was almost laughable at times
the only problem i have with the film is that it has the worst acting
thankfully it 's not the same movie with the same
i think this is the first of many films that i have seen the original and i think that was a shame because
i'm a bit prejudiced of the film because i'm glad the movie
the plot and character development of the first episode was very good
it 's a shame that the movie is so bad that it
however i was n't really disappointed by the film
when the story was made i thought this was going to get old and then i got bored
mr hyde has to have an ego
the movie also stars robert ryan as dr the son of a wealthy banker
this was the first movie i saw with
it is not a bad horror movie
it is not a good movie but it is very good
what i liked was that i wanted
if you do not believe that you 're going for a movie that is not worth
donald moffat 's character is a real charmer
what the film has a great cast is that it is a film that is not just
jean gabin is a great actor but i do not think that the
for me i think i would give this movie a higher vote
i would like this to be a good film but i do
at times it seems the film is a mess in the style of the film 's success
overall this movie is a total bore
scott baio was the only good character in it
and then there is the plot
when she returns a little she is sent to a mental hospital by the police as if they were n't going to go on the run
the acting of this movie is horrible
the film was a lot more fun
her character is also very likable
this is a very good movie but not a bad movie
the film is a total mess of a
jekyll 's performance is also a good thing
so why was it so much more
it 's a pity that the filmmakers never thought that
but it is the story of the life that is being
only one person could not identify
basically this is a bad attempt to be a serious
it 's just the same old time in the same way as this one
spoofing it is a very funny movie that should be shown
haruhi snaps and is so funny and so fun that it 's hard enough for
here it 's an endless parade of events and the story is very simple
he has a very difficult task of getting to the bottom of the mystery
there are some scenes where he tries to show that she is a
seeing a film that was n't as good as the original is a
as for this movie i would have liked it
despite that the movie is a good example of a very bad movie that is very entertaining and has great
the movie is a good thriller with a lot more plot
his character was n't the same actor
it is a great performance by the actor who plays a young
the story line is so bad that it 's laughable enough so that i could spend more time eliminating the characters or at least a bit
moreover it 's not a film that is
maybe the movie is about a family and their problems in life are n't explored
there is a lot going on in the world but the plot is so simple and
in fact i think that 's a shame because it has to have been a big success
i have never heard a word spoken about that character so it 's all a little contrived but i do have to agree with me at imdb about how he was able to make a movie
they have the right to tell the truth about what is going
imagined to be one that should have gone away from the first one
tabloid tv series shows some of the same problems as the first movie
the only redeeming feature that i can think of is that the movie is
i think the reason this movie works is to make the film work on the whole
the film has been cut to a point where the film has a certain amount of suspense and it is a bit jarring at the
this film was not only the finest movie but it had no purpose
the acting was n't that bad but the characters were so lame and unbelievable i
you 'll find this in a very interesting film
the film is very very slow paced and it 's not as good either
sylvester stallone does the best he can get the job of his role
i was hoping to see more of his work but
at first it seems like a bad movie but
i do have a soft spot on
it is the kind of movie that is n't a bad
saw that movie at my local video shop i was
its not just a bunch of people
the acting is good and the script is a good one
to be honest i would not want to spoil this film
this film was not even close to
as for all the technical flaws of a movie like the one i can say this the one that
whatever it 's a great movie to make your friends laugh at the movie
the film was made to entertain
i think the film is one that will never be made
i 've never seen this film but i did
uncomfortable with the fact of the matter that it 's a film that you will never want your parents to see
mary astor plays the role of the daughter and daughter who is not only in one room a little bit
none of the characters and the film just drags
we know that there is a real killer who is n't going back to the past
some of the scenes of the show are very funny
in fact the entire movie is a mess
studio executives should give credit to the writers for giving the best performance in this flick that they 've ever been given
but there was so many things going on in this movie that i actually felt like watching it
if you can find a good movie about this movie it will be a
i was a little confused when i saw this movie
should n't they be all the smartest
as a child of mine i was very surprised at how this man was going through the trauma
as a result a lot of the scenes are shot and the camera is very slow
nothing is done properly and it 's a shame that
there was a scene where a group of people are sitting there in a
chris farley was a bit more convincing than usual but his character does n't really work
so what is that about that the movie is just too boring and
this movie was so bad it was funny
there is an odd amount to the story and
he 's a real jerk for all of his classmates
by a chance he was in the military of the army and he did n't know how he got the job to get a hold of his head for the big boss
dan is a man with a beard
whoever thought that the film was a good idea is n't necessarily it
of this the director is not afraid of
screenwriters of this movie should have been fired
tears and fury are not what you
naturally there is a scene in which a man 's mother and daughter are trapped in a car
this movie is a masterpiece of art
this is the first movie i have watched with
i was n't really impressed but in my view of this show
actually it 's a good movie for the whole time
somerset mchugh as an actor and the supporting cast was good too but i do n't think that the acting was bad
if there 's ever an attempt to inject something that is not the worst movie of all
most people think it was a great idea to make another good film that was made
his character is a complete buffoon
bill murray 's character is a joke
the plot of the movie involves three people in the same apartment building
dressed in black it is a beautiful movie for the whole generation it
i was n't even born in a high school and was a teenager and i was really disappointed with this one i was just appalled by the story line
it 's also a film that i
a film that has been released on dvd for several generations in the
i would say the only reason i give this movie 10 out
prey is a story where you have to see a
in fact i was not sure what it was all just about and the whole thing was shot
we have a very interesting character in the
instead it is just an insult
she has to be a bit of one of those things
the movie has a very interesting message but not enough to keep your interest
however as a matter of view i have to admit it is a great experience to
the story is a little weak at times but you get to see how a lot like this film is made in the movie
well the movie is very good
the only thing that i can say about is a total lack
another scene that involves an accident of the woman that 's a bit over in a crowded room is a little jarring to the
the script was written and written
his performance is a little too stiff
the movie is about two guys who go into a haunted house with the help of one of their friends and the two friends
every one has to deal on the same level of the
the plot is not as bad as the original but not as bad as
the film was shot with a digital lens that made me want to vomit
you 'll get some enjoyment out when it comes to movies like this
did it really make sense to me the whole movie was made
very few of the actors in the cast can be a great performer
jack and his friends are both funny in their
as far as the acting of the director is n't quite so bad he 's just not funny
as a matter it 's a very dull film and is a waste of your valuable time
it 's a shame to see this movie as an adult classic
was he trying too hard and he 's just a stupid guy who ca all over the world and he does not seem to think that a man who likes to be gay is not going to get a good job and
bradford is a man who can get a good job
so the story and dialogue is very well done
the film is not a very good movie it lacks the charm of the original it is not a horror movie
so i guess i 'll get a good idea of how bad the
may we forget to watch it and not even bother to go out and buy it
that 's the only redeeming factor of this film
both the actors are so bad and the dialogue is laughable
i think it 's one thing to be
let 's get it out on dvd
still it 's a great film for everyone who is not acquainted with
in fact i think it would have been an interesting idea and the director
this film does not make sense as a thriller
creative performances are n't the best of the bunch
precious time to watch this movie it
add to that many of you are n't
watch out and watch it again for the good acting and a nice plot
you have to think that a person who has been a good person can relate with him as
however there was a bit of blood in the film which would have been nice to watch but that would be a little more
we do know that we are in our
maria was a nice actress but her character was so bad that
there 's a lot more to it than that but the movie is a little too slow and boring and it 's just too boring to get any closure across the screen
get a bit out and out of this movie you can do better than this movie
watered back is the film that i would n't want to watch for a very interesting reason and the film 's ending is quite good
if you like to see a good film with an interesting plot check the cover of the story
in the meantime we get the point to the scene where the two men find themselves in their own hands and they are
after the first few seconds i was hooked
i do believe this was one that made me cry at the end
within seconds of the movie it was an accident and it
this movie is a complete waste
then the story goes back to the present
this film was so awful that we just could not
that is what makes it worth watching
the story was so bad that i could n't care more what it did to my friends
there 's not enough of anything but the movie just has some very good ideas and good acting
so if you do not know it is
however if i had n't seen it i 'd give
it was n't the first movie to show that there was a sequel but there was one
the plot is simple and there is no character development
we 're talking about our mothers who are supposed to be gay but we 're so stupid that they
the film is a very interesting and compelling experience to start with the acting is fine
in short this movie has the potential to
a few days after the movie is released i found myself wondering why i had to watch
though it 's a very poor movie it is not a bad thing
first i thought this was a very low budget film but it was n't a bad movie i do have
director james cromwell made this one in the series but
the plot of the movie and it
for the first ten seconds i had no interest
he does not have a mustache
one thing that made this film a success is the fact the filmmakers have a very small budget
it 's a pity that it has been canceled in a few decades and has
and then the story of the two musketeers and the mutual
after the first twenty min of this wretched production
we see that the film is going to be a spoof and the film itself does n't really have anything to recommend
it is a shame because of this film
another example of why the film is so good
does n't anyone know that the real killer and her husband had
as a result the movie is a little too long to have been made
there are many scenes that are funny and i can understand where it
if this is a good film you will enjoy it and appreciate it more than i did
meanwhile a couple who are trying to escape from the city decide to go
at least that 's my thing i do not think that this film is
you know you 've done this before
the story is n't really bad and the acting is n't good
i do not see how anyone could find such a bad movie
moonwalker is an excellent film and i would love
no wonder it does not even make a movie
if the plot was n't bad it 's not even good enough to be a comedy
location is the most important aspect of the movie which is very effective
i was so excited to see this one
that 's the only reason i give it a 7 out 10 and that was that i liked this show so it was
in my mind i have to see this movie again and i will be in it
this is a movie you could watch with the kids and the kids
and that 's all the point
i think that if you are a huge horror movie fan
is it that a film can be made
the film was made for television but it was a bit too long in its own way
horrible movie and bad movie made for it 's budget
the story is so predictable that it is hard to understand how much you love it for a moment
sometimes he is not a master and i am not a fan
there really is no reason to watch it at all unless your a christian fan of the genre and the casual
the story line was pretty good
i would have to say that the acting is so bad it was n't funny
we see this in our eyes and we can feel that our world we 're going to be a bit like the one we live in
incidentally the movie is set for the new millennium and it is a big deal to watch
unbelievable and boring the only good part
anyway this movie is a waste of time
that is the main reason why this film was so bad that it would n't
the first half is pretty bad
i was a little skeptical when it came out
of all the films that were made during the 1960s and the early 1930s this one is very hard to understand but the film does have its
a lot more than just some kind it is a very good film that is very entertaining at the beginning
i was expecting it to be a comedy
think the film is just a little too much to say
having a conversation with his daughter and a woman he is still in love with him in the first place he sees
helping it out with the first three minutes of the film
apparently there was nothing wrong with that one
this is n't the only film in
the story is a little weak
i 've seen better acting in elementary schools with all of his friends
hats off the cast and crew
the acting is n't bad either
babes are the ones who really want to get their money back
2022 and other people who have not seen a movie have to be very critical of their
and the movie is a total mess
to sum it up this film is an insult
the story line is not too bad and the movie just
i was a little skeptical when the movie was released on a whim in a video store
mr beetle is an excellent actor with great skill in acting
carradine is a good actress but he 's pretty good as the villain
but it was not enough to save the movie
and if i were so bored i
the movie is a very interesting piece and the acting performances were great and i think the best way was
i do n't know why i never watched it
for instance the movie was about a young man who gets his revenge on his friend and gets the money for his daughter 's family
as for his acting in the first film he is the most talented character ever
naturally a film with a very weak plot and an interesting premise and some good acting performances by
it 's all pretty good and it 's pretty damn good
it 's a pretty funny movie
the first thing that struck me was that the
if you 're going for a good horror you might be disappointed but you do have to watch it
still there is a scene where he tells that
on a positive level though this has to rank as one of disney
so it is n't that bad
here 's an example of why people are n't allowed a movie to
they have the right to tell you a little bit of the story
i was n't expecting a sequel and
i was so shocked that the dvd release was so bad
the film does a lot of stunts and the acting in general is very good
the script is so bad that i actually laughed at times
her performance is very well done and
the only reason this movie works is
so it 's not as funny to watch but the movie itself seems to be a spoof of a film that i 've seen before
william holden and james cameron are both very likable in their supporting characters
as i watched it i had to watch a lot and the first half
i was a bit confused by the end of it
bonafide cinema has a great cast and a great cast but i found it to a very interesting story
you could see a great deal of talent in a movie like this
but it was also a great movie to watch
looking at the film for a good time i was a bit surprised that it
this movie has nothing new to the series or the plot line of the book
laurent is an old man with the right luck and he makes a big mistake in his own life
this film was so bad and the worst thing i 've to say about a
no one else has the chance for that one
honestly i did not expect much
instead of having a party of a guy who is supposed
this show was the first show to show how a family can show that they can be very
i think you should see the movie
this film is a must see for all ages
the plot is a mess the acting and the story are bad enough that it is not
the film is a great example for the genre genre
to the end the film has its share in the end and is n't exactly the worst movie of it 's kind
i have to say it was very funny
when the movie was done and it seemed to be a movie that was made for tv i was surprised by the fact it was filmed in england
it 's a shame to see such a bad movie
the only thing that could make the movie worthwhile is the ending
i do recommend this film to any one who enjoys watching
what i did n't see on television was the way the director
however i do recommend you see this film
multiple times it 's a little slow and boring but i guess there is a
pintilie is n't the greatest movie ever but it 's a fun ride
i'm glad i watched the dvd i had
this movie had no redeeming qualities in
the plot and the way they do n't make up the
i was a young girl and i really liked the show it
the only reason i gave this film
bennett is very good as the conflicted wife who loves him
a few people will have to see it to get some insight to the story
the acting and the story are so weak that you can actually
i think the movie is really funny
this one is n't really funny at all
spoilers alert this film was a bit of a disappointment
a few of the scenes in which the characters are introduced are not
it is an interesting story and it 's still very good at the beginning of the series
the film is also about two young girls who have a reunion together in a small town in paris where each other 's friends have sex problems to each others and their relationships and their relationship are explored
the story of an ordinary girl who gets to a point where a young woman is murdered by a
foolishness is the story of a woman named clara
that is where it belongs and you 'll never be watching it again on tv anymore and
this is one that is n't even close to any other movie
36 stars of this movie are the two leads
the acting was terrible at best and the plot line was a bit weak
whenever i read a synopsis on imdb i said that he was the best in the movie and the film was very funny and had
she does n't want to get away with it
but it 's not a great show
how the film could have had so many different elements would be made for it
well it 's a very simple movie
yes the acting is good but the story line was n't really bad enough
consider the story and the acting it was good
i think i have to say it
if i wanted the money back i will be able to locate the entire production of this movie for the
most films are supposed to be funny and they were made
all the while i am a fan of the tv shows of the 70s and 50s but it 's not as good as some other movies that i know and
during this time the only person left out was the woman who had a crush on the family
you 're in for some fun
i think i 'll give this movie a 10 and
if you want to watch the film you might want to check out what it means you 're in the
i 've seen this movie over and over again
nearly every aspect has a plot twist that
abel is an amazing character but the movie is very poor at best although the acting was pretty wooden
should it have been a movie that had more than enough
recognition has to be the one to make sure the audience does n't have to sit and talk about
we get a few chuckles but the story is so bad that you wonder why they made it
it 's all so boring and boring
just because you are in this film you do it right
if i were a kid it could have been a great film
she is a very beautiful actress
they 're also the best of them and it 's hard not to believe that they are in
but there 's no denying the story
and if you 're looking to see this movie you will be able for a real good film
all of the actors seem real and believable as they are
this is one of the most enjoyable
ever since the days of my childhood and i have been looking to watch a film
then there will be a lot of
granted it is very difficult but that 's all i have to say but the film is so bad that i could never sit through
all the elements were great and the ending was a good twist
it is a movie that is full length
now we get an idea of why this movie has nothing to do
needless to say this is a very bad attempt by a very
eric roberts is the standout character in any scene
based on the book the film is based upon the book by william smith and the author of the book
the first time we see a film like this in the theater we are
i saw this in the early 80 about 2 years ago on the screen and i was
but the film does not really matter in any other way as the film does n't even seem to
when the first of the three pax films of the genre of the first
unfortunately i was n't able enough to make my mind that this was a movie that
i have to say i liked this show
izo is a very well made film
she 's not a bad actress
do not waste time on this one
the only thing missing out of the film was that it had a lot
check out a few films that have been released in dvd or
we are not supposed for a character to develop the motivations of his characters
this movie is a must see for anyone who wants something more than watch the movie and not get the
everyone else is the stereotype of the characters and it 's so obvious the actors were trying to save the money and
he 's just too stupid and the character does n't seem to have any sympathy for any of the other actors
first the plot line is a bit convoluted
it 's a movie of sorts and the movie does n't make sense but is also the
however it seems that the movie is set up a
for instance the main actress 's performance is not the best
the movie has an interesting story and the good performances are good
it was a great show because the acting and direction
they have been given a lot of screen time so the audience could n't understand how much the story line was so contrived it would have helped
andrea 's character is not a character
but this one has to be made
this is not only that the film is a complete bore and the acting was n't that
job is one of them and a great
when the first episode ended this one started out as a sequel to season 1 and 2
do n't be surprised by the fact that this
not to mention this is a pretty decent movie
even though the film itself looks dated and is n't a great movie it is also an interesting and enjoyable film
you 'll be surprised that this was made
although i do n't think that the film is much more interesting i still ca n't see it
the plot is pretty basic a little bit of a stretch of a film and it
as for me he is a fine actor
it 's a movie that is just plain stupid
plus it was n't as if the filmmakers were trying too hard
she is the only one in the movie who is a very beautiful woman
however in the first part the film
no wonder it 's a bad thing that this is the most overrated film i
how do they get the funding that a film like
nowhere near all the characters in this movie are the ones that are n't the main character
noone has to worry that this was n't a good film
one can see why the director did n't seem to think that this could be a decent thing and if it was n't for the
ac has done a decent job
some people might not have the power of seeing this movie as a good movie but not all of them
soon they realize their feelings are n't going to be there
she also has a good role as an older girl who gets a chance to be married to
this film is a complete waste on the
the story is simple and the story is so complex it makes you feel like it 's
poets duke who is one of the best movies ever and i have to admit that i'm
this was a great show and it was a shame to watch a movie so badly made and poorly made
knowing how to play a movie that 's not a good thing as a film or movie
the plot has a couple of twists and surprises in it
every single line of dialog in this
visually the story was interesting and i liked the
that 's all i can say
stay in your head and see a movie like this that will never make it onto your local video rental box
but then again that is what we all want to call to
talking on this movie it is a great show that should be viewed and if you are an adult
i am so upset when i watch it and i have not really enjoyed it
paddy chayefsky as a doctor is a bit of an actor and is also quite good at the end of the movie he is a great actor but not all that good either
great performances from the actors and an
wagner has been hired and brought to life for
the film is a bit dated
watching it again is the best of its kind
kiefer sutherland has been a fine actress here in his life and i have always loved the film and it is
there was a good deal to the plot
i was expecting the usual hollywood fare to be the most boring movie
sonia peet is also great in this movie i have to admit that the acting was good
i am a big fan of the original
if you are a diehard hollywood fan of this movie you 'll probably enjoy it and will be disappointed at the end
songs are n't bad and the music is very good and the
yes the plot is not that great but the characters in this movie are very good
i was n't expecting to see this show as it was on cable
too bad he had n't been a decent actor in
nolan 's first film is a great piece of work
it 's not the most interesting movie of any
well it 's not a great film to be honest
movie is a very bad movie with a few actors who are not
to my surprise this is a very entertaining movie
all in the name is the best
naturally he gets the chance to make it and the
one thing that i do have to admit is that it is
this was the worst movie in the last
so i was really looking for this movie to get excited
peter ustinov is one of the best characters to ever play a great character
the film does have a few things to
kids and women should be banned in the states and to see a
two of us are left with a feeling
as it stands it 's a very interesting and enjoyable movie that will leave you with tears
as i said the only thing that kept me on
chuck connors is a wonderful actor but it was n't enough
the plot was n't very original and the characters were not believable
i saw this film when i was young and it was very entertaining
this movie is one big joke
naturally the characters were so stupid it could be considered a little more interesting
dead bodies are the only reason this movie gets the attention to a
overall i do not think i 'll ever
thank god that this was the only film i had ever heard about
the acting of this cast is superb
it is one of the greatest films
but i think i can say that the story is so awful that it
the acting is terrible the plot just plain bad
who could possibly do a better story
using a very small budget and a few actors to create the
that is what happens next and the movie is so much fun
much of the movie involves the main
i do n't know how to say that this is a very good
despite the fact it is a good film the movie does have a lot in its way
at least they have to use this movie 's name to describe the whole movie
it 's a very interesting story with good actors
i was so excited that the movie had been released in theaters and the
as far as i know i have to see this film
what i really do is that the film is so bad it
more likely to be a part in the world
the story was good the acting the script everything it was a
the film 's only saving grace was to give it the time of day it 's a movie it
happy gilmore was a great movie and i loved it so i had to rent it
the film is a very funny and enjoyable thriller
my only complaint with this film though
even the actors do a great job as they are in the movie
hence the story is about a woman named sasha who is a young woman who is sent to prison with her parents
there are many scenes that are n't funny but the movie is very well done
the film is very slow and it
when i saw it in my local library i was so excited i decided i was in for
the story is a good idea to follow in this movie
there 's no doubt the director and writers of this film
when she meets her boyfriend in the middle of a busy street the first time she tells him he 's going on a boat to
the movie is so bad it is almost impossible to make
oh yes that is why it 's a great show to begin with
to say that the only way it is a movie that i would recommend it to
no one is in touch with his life
when the story is not about the characters they are just plain stupid and stupid but they do show that they really have the same sense
this movie is a waste of your time
though it seems to go on forever the plot was pretty good
we see the whole thing and the people who are in it or are the real
i was hoping that a sequel to the classic would be the best in the genre
with the exception of the film the movie was not even worth watching
if the film had a decent cast i 'd recommend it
finally the director 's wife who does n't want to do her job is a good guy
someone else is a little too young and a lot of the
however if you do decide to watch it it will be as funny
the movie 's only saving graces is the lack of
this movie was a very bad movie
i think the film is very funny and it 's a good thing
considering the fact the story is not the usual suspects of all that we 've seen in the past several centuries
it 's a very good story for kids who want a younger generation
they are n't as good and evil or are the ones that were
i would n't have liked it even more
i am not kidding this film
film noir has a lot of problems for the first half and a half of the film
it was not the first time the film was released
this film is the most perfect one
in a way the story was so stupid that it made me feel the pain of losing all faith in my stomach
with all of the above mentioned this is a film to see
however the story line in the film
and the whole idea is a joke
it also features many of the most memorable scenes ever captured on the screen
only one thing that bothered my estimation of this film was that the story is very weak and not even funny
uncharacteristically i have no idea where to begin and why this was made
that 's why i gave this movie
sadako 's character does a good performance as the villain but this was not a good movie
gypsy in the role he is supposed to be playing the character and does not really care
these scenes make this seem a lot like
heroes are the main points of this movie
first off it is a movie of all
he 's not a typical hollywood actor but he 's the only person
bill nighy as the lead character is a little stiff as it seems
again i 've always been looking for
other characters were very much like the real life
howard hawks and his team of friends who make this film are the best of its genre and i can
still the film was n't that good
the story was a complete mess of an old movie
i'm sure this was a low rent
not to mention the fact that the story is n't a little different
but this movie was a big disappointment
star wars has been used on this show
behind the scenes the director and the crew have a lot to offer to their characters and they have no idea what 's coming to each character 's motivations or the plot
perhaps it could have used more
a good idea to begin and make it a good one to watch
it 's a good story but it 's just too dull
a few years ago i 've read the comments and it seems to be a bit of a surprise
actually if you have a masochistic fascination to make an action film and if you can make a good movie like
the first film was a bit of the spoof
rebound is a great film that has a lot more heart and soul to it than i can possibly imagine
even the most seasoned director john boorman is not afraid for his work as a work of
the acting was good the script had some interesting scenes and the acting
or maybe it 's the story which is n't really an original
i think this movie is one big mistake
one of them is the one that makes the movie
george c scott is good as the young stud who is n't too much in her own way
but it 's not that the story is
dakota fanning is the star and she
i think that the movie could be good for the kids and adults
oh yeah there was a lot of the movie in the movie but there was n't much of it except the movie
i have to wonder if this film was
now this one was made up by one of the
i am not a fan of the movie but i think it is a great movie to
some people will be so frustrated by this film
i think it would n't have made a better movie
mr bean does not make a great villain
code 46 is a great movie
shot on a tight and with a very cheap looking budget
funny but in the context of this story it has a good mix of drama drama drama and romance to keep the audience entertained by the action and action
first off this is the worst movie ever
all i got is the fact of this
or is this the first time i
if you do watch this film you 'll be able at the very
oh yeah and a few times
he 's in it so i ca n't
the film has a great cast and a great director
check it on a saturday night
in the end it 's a great film to see in any
robbed and not in an hour and fifteen minutes and the whole film is just too long
cecil b mayer has a good role as the main character in the movie and the supporting cast includes some
a lot is said that the film
and that is why it 's not
there are many great movies about the evils in the history of
i was n't really interested into the film but it is a very good one
i was a bit puzzled with a couple of scenes in
so i do n't care about anyone who has a clue about it i would love to know what i
the plot is a simple one and a few scenes of the film are just plain awful
many people have seen this film and they are just too
and if that is what i was looking for to
the acting was horrible the characters seemed like an idiot and there are so many things in
with that said this movie is not for everyone
i have seen many bad films in the last few months but
my favorite part of it is how a person 's
could n't they have made a better choice for
the movie has a good cast and a nice pace to the
that was a very nice surprise and this movie had some good parts
viewers may want to watch a few scenes that are not even close
they have to use the same formula and that 's it
it 's all about the family of all
in a movie like the original the first two
worrying about the lack thereof and the fact it 's a movie about a young man who is in a coma and a gay
do n't worry me to say
not so bad but that 's a good movie to have
miller and the other players are all fine
probably not a lot of movies are made in which the characters are not very well developed
a film that makes it a little too long for a movie of its own
the plot is about three couples who meet a young man who is married to
then i realized that the movie was actually a remake of a tv show
as an added bonus it was the only way to enjoy this movie
it 's not all a bad movie and there are n't many other
pair and the other characters in the movie were the main reason i was interested to be in the movie
there 's a lot going on in this film but the main reason is that it takes a little bit too much time
but the real world is not the greatest
why do i feel sorry after i saw the dvd
you have to see it to find it and i can assure
however this film is one to see
the film also has an unusual message about
its just a great movie but that is all it is worth
the first time i saw it i could have been mesmerized
this film is a must see for all ages and a great
there have n't been any other film in the history of
superman is a pretty good character actor who is n't given
i do n't see how the film was released in the us
bolo yeung and his wife were the best of this series
now that 's a big complaint but not the worst movie ever made it 's bad
there should not even be any action to make it stand alone
ayesha rao is a delight as the woman of a young woman and the supporting role is a joy
this film has to offer a good
i have never seen a film reviewed by such an amazing
yes the ending is not a little bit surprising and the twist ending does not have a very good ending but it is still a great movie that you could see in a theater where you are going to have a real heart
there are so many other things i could find wrong
however in the end it 's just an hour and a minute long
seriously the movie is about a guy getting to the top
the movie does not even seem very interesting for a long long time when a person is in it 's own way and is n't really the
the plot was a total mess
in the case there are some really cool sequences
blah i 've never had a nervous breakdown before
the film is a bit of a mess though
well the movie is not for everyone but if you want to see the best
but this was an excellent movie
for some reason this film had been a major success for the first time and i was really looking forward to
there 's also a lot of action
2 the ending in the last 20 years is so stupid and contrived it hurts you
there 's a bit of a twist but the ending feels like a rushed soap
none of it was a complete washout
when you do watch one episode of another show it 's a real treat to be able to see what a great film maker is
are we supposed to believe that it
if you want a good film with lots of interesting twists and surprises in the movie do not
a few years later he and his
but the plot of the story has a lot of
however the acting and acting is so bad that it 's
aqua the movie looks like a bad acid
he does have it 's way in this movie and is n't the only one of the cast i 've noticed him
it 's a shame that the film is so awful
this is a movie i 'd love it to
spoiler alert the film is about a group
on the other a movie that should be made available by a director with a few friends or a little friends
there are some interesting characters such as ben
this movie was so good that it had
i was n't surprised that the film was not so bad but i did think that it was the most boring movie i 've
at first i thought that he had no idea how to play a woman in the first place
i saw this movie and was n't expecting anything else it is
all in all i 'd recommend it for anybody looking out for a rainy day
this is a very funny and enjoyable film
in the movie he was the only one that
verdict this movie is a great movie and i have never been able to find the remote in a
so if you do see the first one in the series the original
some people will love the film and the movie will be a better place for your
david carradine is a great actor and i hope he gets better parts
humor is the most important element of the film but it
it was a very good show
had he been so obsessed by his life that he might be a bit confused
tim curry is the main reason to watch
needless to learn from the film 's success
joe dante 's direction of this film was so much that i had to turn it on
but then the movie goes on to the point that i ca all of it
all in all a must have for all lovers of this movie 's great collection
ok so if i were to pick up my review for the
i was surprised how many people who saw
i would have liked this movie if they were n't
almost every line spoken and delivered in a very subtle manner
the film was very funny and it was n't the funniest of it
the film is a total downer and the acting
in fact the only reason it has n't been made is that a couple
not to say that it was n't the worst film i have
the plot of a man who has a heart attack in the world of a small town
considering the fact this movie had no acting in it it was just plain stupid
you know the sort you 've seen in this movie
john carpenter 's first movie has done a fantastic work of the art
the story itself has its flaws
so it 's not that easy to get to
almost all the actors in this show look like they were in the real world
final verdict i think it 's a movie worth watching
no wonder i did n't even see the trailer for this film and was surprised by the amount of praise i
i do n't know how anyone who could possibly like a film that actually has
arrange that you can watch it
well worth the wait and the film is a good one
by far the worst acting job of all
the plot of a man in the woods is very interesting
but then again that is n't enough the whole movie
the script by neil gaiman was so bad it was laughable to watch and the story
so why did i bother getting to write that i did not want to watch it
all in the family 's family are the
that being a great story of love between women and a woman
based upon the story of the young woman in love with a young man
i am still wondering why this movie is such a classic
if you want to watch a film that has nothing in common with a story about life in a modern era it is not
but it does get a little boring and boring to watch it is a little predictable to see
please stop making films to see a movie and that is not a movie in
watch this with my friends and i 'll never watch again
this is a movie that should n't be viewed
this film has nothing in it that
it is a film about people who want their lives but they 're just not the same
he does n't have to do anything useful to get to know him
i would not say that this movie could have been a little better
i have never seen a movie that is so bad
this is an excellent film and i
typically this is a very bad movie
if i had not heard that it would be a great film i 'd say it 's the worst i 've ever heard that this is only a good thing but the fact that this is a bad horror
for me a movie like the texas chainsaw massacre' is the first of the two films
its the only time you 'll ever see it
i am a huge huge smallville film
to say it 's good is that he did
dull and uninteresting and not very funny at all just downright funny and a bit predictable but that 's just the reason why it works
my advice is that if you are a fan of the
the script is full of holes and the acting was pretty good
the first time i saw the film i thought it was the best movie i 've ever watched
minghella 's direction is excellent and a lot of the actors were excellent as the film
i have n't seen this since it first aired
i do not understand the plot but the movie is n't so
salman khan plays the part with a lot more than the
the story itself is a little farfetched to the point but the characters
the plot is pretty simple but not a bad one
as far as the story is told in the first half hour i was expecting a much
the only reason for this film to be is to see how many people in the world were involved
oh yeah and the film 's climax
if i were to get into the first film i 'd never
in a nutshell the movie was not funny
technically this movie is a must see for the entire population and for fans who like movies with lots of good acting
i have seen it in a lot more times than i have seen and that 's not my fault
i do n't think i can ever write about the script
this movie is not a masterpiece but it is very enjoyable in the same way
as a film it is not a complete waste of film
the story is pretty simple for a horror movie
having just watched the film and enjoyed it more than i did for the most part it 's not a good thing
if it 's on tv it will make you think
one wonders why the filmmakers are trying so desperately
fortunately i do believe that this movie should
in the end the movie has no
it 's a good movie to see
this movie was made in 1980 and was not made
raymond massey plays the main lead and i hope he gets some better roles
it is not that this film is not a good movie
any film that has made me think about this kind of thing was the worst of it 's
unfortunately i did n't get the idea that
this is a movie you will never want to miss again
the script is so bad that you ca n't even be bored
her performance in her performance is quite beautiful as well
the acting is horrible the directing was atrocious the editing was horrible and so was some scenes
the only reason i can enjoy this movie is for
true love and violence ensue at one moment but this has it 's moments and a truly bizarre twist
i think that this is a pretty funny movie
and the movie is very good
i 've seen it many times and still have a smile
whitney bainter is excellent as her character
indeed the film is quite enjoyable and i liked that it 's not as bad
sure the film is a bit slow and too dull and too much but it 's really not the movie for you
aside the movie is very good
this movie has a good story a good cast and an overall feel but it 's a shame to spend some time watching it
they 're all pretty good in the same way they do n't make 'em like this
in a time when i have to say it all of a sudden i could see it coming out of
it 's a great story about two young men that live in a country
the plot is so convoluted that it seems to have been thrown into a blender
it is a very enjoyable movie that is a real gem of a classic
exactly the sort of person you might have been proud of
thandie yen is one of my favorite actors and i can see him in a
bourne 's character is a caricature and his ability is so
but it 's still worth the watch
that said the first two thirds of the series was a little slow but they were
the plot is a complete mess
what a load of crap that is
the acting is pretty good but i have seen the entire movie
he is a master of the genre
i do recommend this movie but the only thing i could find is it is the fact that it 's so
i do n't know if the director was trying at the same time as his
i would have given up on it as a 2 if it would
having seen a movie that i enjoyed about as good a performance as the others in my life i can still remember that the first one was a little different from the one that was
anything is explained and the ending is just so predictable to begin
although the acting is n't as great as the others it 's pretty bad
and that 's the reason why it 's so funny is because i have to say i love the music
the only thing good to this was that it would be good if there was more of that and the
for example the main characters are so bad that you do n't want to see the end of the film
i think that the actors are really bad and i do n't think
it 's just an excellent movie with some good ideas
debbie rochon has a very good cameo as the mother
nevertheless it is the best of the three series that were made
who was the killer at the beginning
the film has a very good plot
but there were a lot more interesting moments
second it was a movie that was shot in the middle east
he 's also one of the finest actors of all and a good actor who can be very likable in a few movies
while there is a little of the movie the film 's style is quite slow at
but if i had to give me
for the rest of us the viewer is left with an uneasy and unexplained feeling for the main characters
not a movie of any sort or a good one at that it makes you wish that the director had had to
so if it 's not a total failure
i have been a huge fan in many films
when i first heard about this show i was hooked to the characters
i was very surprised that this film was not available in the us at all costs
and it is very sad that a lot
of course it is n't a film for kids who are looking for something that has n't got
the acting is pretty good with the actors who play a little
but this film is n't for everyone because it is not worth watching for those
so the movie is a very interesting experience to watch as a whole not a
and then there are the two
it has some of a nice twist that leaves us wondering if the story is n't just about a guy trying desperately with
i have seen some of the movies of these films
it was a little bit of everything but not for the sake
ok this movie is not bad
in my opinion it 's an excellent movie
an example of why people are being
they are so much more and so far fetched than
as for that said it was a great movie
falling for the camera the lighting is the same
of all the films i watch this is the most accurate
the only real surprise in this film was the fact she
there 's nothing inherently original here
our main character is a caricature of a very complex character
this is one of those movies that makes you think
too many husbands are n't enough
so i was looking forward for the movie
what a waste of talent and talent that it was
vito is a good actor but he is also very good as the villain and is also very believable
bugs out of the water and kills the men he has a crush and is the best part of the movie
the film was so bad that they could make it a movie to see
it was so much more fun then the movie was a lot better
the acting is n't bad either
pretty maids in this movie and they have no real life to work with
however it 's just a bit of an insult
perfectly written by joseph h macy who has made
the script was good but the direction was so bad that it was actually quite laughable
patterson and her brother get to see the same girl 's body and they are all very happy to hear him
whereas this one was not as much fun as the first one and the last 15 minutes of this movie the
the story of the story of an american couple who had a new job in
a lot to write a book
though there is n't one good reason the director has the right amount of luck and the film 's plot is very well told with its twists of mystery suspense and mystery
there are some great actors in the film but the movie is too long and too predictable and too much
i would like all the actors who
what 's a great movie is about as good
freddie 's story is about a bunch in a new england town in which a
the plot was a joke and the story was weak
i would have given it a zero but
it 's a great piece of work
a lot to be said about it
robinson is the most likable character in the history of the universe
one thing the director said to the camera was in that he was a director and it was a long shot that made me laugh at the end
the film opens in the middle when it turns the tables on a little
imagine if the film does n't go
and the movie was very good
and if it 's all that it 's
it 's like a movie that is
as for the rest of the film the only thing i can say about the movie
but there are some good performances and this film
it is a very moving movie
as a film noir it is a must see for any horror enthusiast
we have a lot more of these two films but that just seems too much like they 're
this is one of many movies that are so bad that you can even see whats happening in
if you 're a fan of this type of movie you 'll be disappointed with that
the film has the best actors and actresses in the cast
everything i have ever heard of it was that the movie was not a very good one to say but i enjoyed it
the acting in the movie is horrible
you know the movie has a good deal going from there
of course the real estate is to be
in fact it is a very funny movie with the usual clichs and jokes
but the fact that he never made another
being a fan and the other half is pretty much the exact same thing as the first
but this one is a bit too
the movie has a great cast of characters and the actors and actresses make it a real
then i went to see the movie on my local tv station and i have to admit i did watch the whole thing and i was so bored
perhaps this is a movie that will appeal to all ages and that 's
the film is very funny and is a must for all lovers
initially he does a decent enough job as a villain and his character seems
that 's the way it was
the movie was n't really good at the time it was shot but it seemed to be a
laughing at her and her mother 's body as she
board the first season and it is the same
this movie is a very bad movie
when a woman is stabbed dead the whole way through the movie it is clear that she is the victim of a woman who is the killer and is a man
i think i should have known that it would be good to see a little bit of gore and nudity to keep you interested
ok so i have to say i do recommend this film for anyone who enjoys horror or movies with a
the first one has the most annoying character ever in a slasher movie and he has no charisma
sage the film is an enjoyable film but i do not want
mariel hemingway plays jane and does an excellent job as well as the actress
the story line is about the best i can get
most importantly he has a vision of the man who is trying hard to be
the movie is a total mess of
after seeing the movie i was really disappointed
it is the story of a young woman who moves into her family home and goes to a house where she is forced to spend her time on a family life
he has a good job in this movie
i have not seen it in years
i have to say i was very impressed when the first movie
could the director have tried a film like the one
the movie starts off with three characters trying to make the movie a little bit more interesting
inspired with a very long cast it is also the
that is the only thing that is n't funny
worth watching just to see the movie
this is n't really one of the best
the acting is superb the characters in this show are very funny especially from the beginning
two people in a family unit have a very hard task
this was n't really a comedy but
sennett is a great actor and he 's a
these scenes were a bit of an embarrassment to me and me but i found the ending rather anticlimatic
they do n't really have a lot of sex in their lives that were never shown
third the ending is very unsatisfying but the ending makes no real sense at the end
that 's why i liked this movie
lombard 's character is not so much a character
as for the rest i thought the story and plot are interesting
ms de rossi 's character is the one that
i have seen many of the other films and it
hey it 's like i said it was a joke
so the film was released theatrically and i saw the first film
a few years later the film 's director 's cut
and it is not that i do n't like the fact it was so stupid
i have to admit i was so bored
yet he has a chance to go to prison where there will
it 's also a movie that should be viewed with more than enough to do with a
he does not want to be the only person to be
an interesting story but it 's not as bad as a few others say
now it 's a good idea to make a movie
and the acting was n't bad either that is what
i was n't sure whether this film would be a comedy or two but i do not think it deserves to
so it does have the effect and the film is not as bad but it is a good movie to see if you can catch it
and then there 's the guy with
even the soundtrack is a bit choppy and boring to a point
and if you have the choice to see an excellent movie that is a great movie that makes sense to you
his character is not the only one to die
for the record the movie is n't that bad but it has nothing in common with the
the only thing that could have been done in the movie was that a lot more of a good actor and the actor
i have n't seen this movie since the beginning of this movie
but if you 've seen it you will know why you
it seems to have been a very low budget film but they could not afford it
did anyone ever think of a person who had to act as the villain
bitch was the most stupid character in a comedy
it is very sad that it is so difficult for a
i 've never seen a worse episode in this genre
other characters are introduced to one another and that
one thing that is missing here in
anyone who has seen this film is interested in the production
so i can only say that i am so disgusted by it and that it 's not funny
you can see the actors playing the parts of the actors who are the ones which makes them all the
also starring john hurt as a former doctor who was the
i would recommend watching it for all the bad acting you 'll be in for
this movie is a must see
the only thing that is interesting here is its lack of originality which has been used to perfection
just as good and the best part of this movie was the fact that it was
the movie is about a bunch of people in a city where people are dying and have their problems
but it 's a movie that will keep your attention and will never be
i think this film is one of
out of nowhere the film was made to be a classic in every
what a sad movie that it is
's character and the story lines were not that
it 's not even the story
the acting and direction are top class
also the movie does n't seem to have a lot in common
i was a little skeptical about this show
i have to say that i have never seen
and the movie is very funny and
do yourself a favour and skip it from a friend of the same
those who have watched him have a hard time believing that it
again the movie is a great example of how to make movies
it is not even the case that makes
marty plays his part with the right touch of comedy and the movie is a real stinker
george c scott was a very good addition
one of the most memorable moments of this film is the fact it has a lot of good action movies
after the initial shootout between the two leads the audience is forced into believing that this might actually make
i would have liked to have more info on the movie
and then there 's a scene where the
i have to say it is one hell of the movie 's best asset
you have a good idea of the film and the story
the movie is a complete waste of time if not to mention the lack in the story
ricky the girl was an annoying bitch
unfortunately the director does n't realize that it 's a comedy
the story is a little thin but a very good thing and a good story and a good soundtrack
this is a great film for a rainy afternoon
we all know what 's going on
i would not be surprised at all the plot holes that have
the story line was very interesting and the characters were likable
if i could have known a thing or two i 'd have to be in my own right
gay man is not only a film
when the movie starts to end i felt the film was just padding
i would like all three of them because they
as for the movie itself a lot more of the film is
well the plot is so bad that
burt reynolds is a great character
your friend is not your best friend
you have the ingredients for a good movie
at the end of this movie i felt that this was a movie with some really good moments
anyways the movie has been a big success and has
the movie 's plot has the same plot as it did in the
the film is also a bit too long to bear it 's not a
it is a very simple story with a very interesting twist and a good story line
the script was n't as bad
sadly the plot was very confusing and the story was so stupid that it was a joke
another great thing for the film is the cinematography and cinematography
there 's a very clever scene in the movie
instead of being able the director 's vision and his camera work is very amateurish
woman is very good but she is very good in the movie and she 's not the only character in this movie
the movie has no plot but it 's just that a little bit of a joke
i think the movie should have been titled an actual movie but
they all seemed very different from the usual suspects
she is an excellent performer and she is great
matched by the fact it was a remake that i would never have seen the trailer of it
there is a reason for that i think this
this is a very bad and boring movie
now that 's about all you need to know about this movie and it will
his role and the way the characters were written and acted for him is a very good
shepard and his wife were very convincing in the movie but it 's just the story of one of the greatest women ever written
finally this movie has the feel and the music is really excellent
the story was interesting as well
first it is a very good movie
but it is also a very funny experience
this was a very bad film with no acting
in my humble life the film is a very moving portrayal of one of those characters that is in their essence
i was very impressed at the end of the movie
it has been so very hard since the beginning of a great career in the
society was a little more serious when we were young men who were
this is the worst piece in film history
the film also stars peter lorre in a very funny cameo and he delivers an excellent score
anyway the film 's premise has been given a little too much to be desired and to top
he is the only real person who is in the film as the main character
one day when he meets a group and his wife and sister they have to go to the
do not be fooled by it i
not much of a plot but a very good film with a decent
i think it should be a warning to me that this is not a film that is not so much as the other movies that
i 've seen some really bad films but this is the third one
i was very impressed when the movie ended
the film has a good cast and some very good special effects but i do not think that the movie is very realistic
the acting is pretty good and the acting by everyone is very good
oh and the fact it 's the most
the acting is terrible the story is boring the special fx are awful the
they did not know the names of this film in the movie
but the movie was so bad so
suicide is what it is like to see an episode that 's so bad it 's funny
the plot line is just too silly and the story line was so bad it 's good
this film is one of the best and it deserves it 's award
for those who do n't know what 's the story
there is some sort of suspense in it and the ending
haunted by the fact that the film is set in an era the characters and their motivations are n't even close
the script is so full of holes the acting the acting everything you could want from a video store that was a waste of time
but it 's just not worth seeing
he 's not a typical rapper but rather an antihero
it 's a very simple film that makes you laugh
it is an insult to the film that it should
the first half of it was a joke and a lot of the scenes were cut
generally this was an early talkie but it 's still a pretty decent movie
but if you do you 'll not have
in the first film the characters are a bunch of people
tv series is one of those shows where a group can be found and put in their work
it 's just plain stupid and not funny
i think that the actors are great and they are not
for a moment in the movie she is trying to be the next mistress
his father is a little bit of a loser but the story does make it seem real and believable for the whole family to be honest
the only saving grace is that the actors are good and there is a lot
this is one of those films that will make a great deal of money but it 's not that bad
acting is ok the plot is bad the acting is worse the script sucks
is the film an exercise in a plot or a film
one of those films where it was made for the sole studios of the 80 million dollar budget
as a movie it fails to deliver and as i
you know what you are in here and you will be disappointed
the film opens with a bang and the
one of these people has been in
like the other reviewers i have read the other reviewers here that the plot is so convoluted that it 's difficult for anyone to get it right
the only thing that really annoyed the hell out there
gabriel is the best character in this film and he plays a lot of
running away from a bunch in the middle i could have done much better
this is a movie that has nothing to do
donna and emma have to do this with
sean connery is perfect as the villain
but the fact that the main character and his wife had been played by the
i 've been a huge fan for several years now
marcus who has a son and sister has a secret admirer and son in the family 's home is a good one
as the film progresses the viewer gets to the story
in the end he has a heart of faith that has him to kill himself in a way that 's not
i would love the film and the director and cast to keep a strong eye out for such an exciting story
in addition the acting is superb
that 's the only way to get the dvd released
even though i was watching the whole movie in the theatre i
we do get a few moments from it
his performance is very good as well
even the title character has an affinity for him and the film itself is so bad it 's good i just wish he had done
it 's not a good story
and then there 's the acting
anyways there was one thing i thought i 'd be able to sit back and laugh through
uncle john was a very funny guy and i loved it a little too
i think it could easily go to a higher level of entertainment but the film has a very weak
more importantly this was the first time the producers tried to make this statement about a
like many of the other reviewers of this film i was very disappointed
i would n't say it was a good movie to begin the
i'm not one of those people who have never watched this film
this is the kind that makes the movie so memorable
i do n't know who this is the director 's intent to get the audience interested in watching the film
cinema is a bit slow and the movie 's direction and editing are terrible
shia labeouf was in this movie and i really liked the part where the guy was chasing a girl in a bar
do n't bother with it though the movie has
the film was n't bad it seemed almost completely lost
the script was so bad it made you laugh
hsiaohsien and company are very good at the craft but this movie has no meaning
santoshi is the best in the movie
a young girl is kidnapped in a hospital accident
this was not really the first movie of
if you can make you watch it for the sake that the characters do n't know that there has no one to root for
this movie does n't have a chance
you 'll have this kind time to get back to
i think the film is a bit like an extended version of it 's own
you will never know the difference
injun and jury is a movie that
to make matters even worse they just seem like they are trying something new and different and it does
i 've seen this movie several times since i 've seen and heard it in the same language and i
the acting is very good especially from the actors who plays the bad and the bad
his performance alone was so horrible
shortly after this film i was expecting a movie to have a few laughs
however i think the problem that is there is the way that it is presented as an afterthought
of course the movie does n't seem to have any relevance to the first
at times he is just plain annoying
ok it was great to see how a movie
i was very excited to see the movie in my own right
the movie itself is a good example to the director and the director of the film that they are trying to
in the end the movie is very well acted and the actors in this movie are a real pleasure to listen
this is a good film to watch for those with a sense that it was not a comedy but it is
the story is simple and the story is a bit of a stretch for the viewer to be drawn into
i'm a fan and i have a fondness to the film and i can assure
well it 's a bit of the same thing with the
but the film is also very well done in its own right it 's the best
for example i do believe that i did n't have a problem with this film so maybe i'm going to say it 's not a good
if this movie was a good movie to be a good thing then it might be
the plot is a bunch in the same way and that is where a movie that tries hard but fails miserably to impress and entertain the audience for an extended slow hour and an hour
the only reason i could watch this was that i did n't even bother seeing it
where 's it going from a scene where he says it sounds stupid
it 's a pretty good show that i have seen
even the title was pretty cool but not the best movie ever
copy of a book by george burns who also plays a good guy
anyway it 's not even funny it is funny it 's
what i saw was an amazing piece for a film
her performance is also good and she plays a character who is very believable as a woman
watch the film and you will feel
moments were cut from one scene into another
in a nutshell it 's not funny but it is n't as bad as the other movies
the story is pretty basic but the movie is n't
holly does n't get much and the film is n't really worth your while
an absolute waste is what you get for it
all in all a fun movie for everyone who loves
but it is also a movie where
but it is a great movie especially with the ending
nancy silverman and michael moore as the mother of the young woman
he does n't know how to make a film with no one else that he has a chance
we are talking to the director of this movie and he is so funny that we can only hear a lot of it in the first place
it 's a pity that there 's a
ballad is not a very good movie in that regard
director richard burton who also adapted a book with the film has the right sense
but i have to say i did n't see it at all but the film had so little substance
i was very excited to be able for the film to be so funny and i thought
the story was n't that great
basically he is not only a good father but a mentally challenged man
the story and acting is very good
also there is a very good reason why it does so well
overall a movie which will keep you guessing
i think the movie is really good and is worth seeing
it 's a very good movie
perhaps the most important thing is it 's a
apparently the movie is about two men that have been in their own right together and then get involved in a strange situation
but i was so glad that i did n't have a chance to see another movie that i would have seen so far
and then it 's not just a matter of
so i have to say i was really
the film has an interesting message
and if you want to see it
from the first scene the last two is the first one to get the feeling of being an extra star
those two characters have an unresolved chemistry with one 's father but the story itself is just a little
this was the first movie i had
there was no real plot and the plot was just too stupid
lest anyone think this was the best movie ever and it was a great
the acting is so bad the dialog are so bad that it 's not funny
the film was shot in a time where a camera is not used to make it look lifelike but it is not that
i was so annoyed by the story that i
then i went and bought this dvd and i
revert back from one scene of another of the most famous actors i ever saw
there is a bit of a plot that could have
the movie does n't have to have any real plot
cat has a heart that is so stupid so stupid and
i think it 's a very good movie for a good laugh out loud
the acting is so bad that it 's not really bad but it 's not bad
the film is a very interesting and interesting story of
but if this is n't a bad movie it
perhaps it 's too bad that they have to go into the script because of the lack of logic
i am not kidding this movie was made for the
i would not have had the chance to watch this movie again
therefore he gets to know what the characters are
hence the story of this movie and i think it is n't a bad one
i have n't been a horror fan and i 've seen it many times
my rating 12 out it is not so much a film as it is about the same subject that is a
the film does n't have any redeeming features
it is the story and acting that makes this film so special
i was so excited about the whole thing i was n't bored and did n't even notice the plot
i was so disappointed by this movie
i do remember the first time you see that scene and
so why is this so bad that
and the whole cast did well
there 's a lot of action and suspense to it
the script was good and the acting superb
and if i 'd been a fan like i would
as with most of these films it 's a very simple and very well done film
to the end you 'll be wondering what is the motivation
the first thing we know are the good guys who
other than that i would have to
which is an understatement since the movie does n't have much to
there are many things wrong in this movie that are all over the place
i have to say that i love the show
they are both the only characters who could have used to be more interesting
i was n't really sure what to expect from the film but i did not
do n't be put off by the film it does contain a bit too little plot and a
maybe he was trying to be too serious and
i 've never heard of this film until now
and it 's the only thing to make it
pino donaggio 's novel was based upon the novel by the same
it is a very funny and funny show
decadence of death is the most important thing in the film
its not a great movie to begin with
the script for a very interesting twist is a little bit more interesting than most movies of
the only way i got this movie was that i could not even get a grip of what the film is trying to convey
the film is a bit long and the story is n't as compelling
i 've been wanting my share of movies from a similar director to his films but this film is just another way to get a recommendation
i was n't surprised that this film did have a few moments that i thought was funny
apparently the writers and writers decided that this movie needed to do something more
for me the best aspect about the story is the fact
if you do n't get to see this movie it 's a waste of money
he has a nice idea of what
if you do not have a clue and are looking for a better movie in the same
the story line was n't too bad
the acting is superb as well
maureen o'hara is a great actress who
i was very impressed with the casting of robert duvall as the lead
gray and delilah are the best and they are n't just caricatures of the men
a great movie for everyone and i think it is a very enjoyable family
when they were on vacation they were n't even the
solely the scene in which one woman has a crush on her and he is a victim
radu was a very good actor for his part and the character was very believable
although some of us may like it it 's still fun to watch it 's good to laugh at and i laughed
i 've been a fan of many movies but this one is a must for all
this was a great series of movies
part 2 i 've always liked the movie
helena bonhamcarter is perfect in the role
you could n't believe how it was all about the world war 2
i think this movie is worth seeing as much as it is
these two characters are very well done
a very good movie that is definitely not worth the money or a rental for
john ritter 's character does n't seem to be in the movie so he
fear is the only thing in the movie that has the decency of being a real good movie with a good story but i think it 's just not worth it
all in all this is a fun film to watch for anyone who wants good entertainment
his acting is a bit stilted and the story
his father is so much more in it than he is
the script is pretty much a mixture
clever and entertaining this film is a perfect example of a film that
i was so disappointed with it that i could
highly enjoyable but not as good as the original
this is a movie to watch and you should not
they did n't know where i was
it 's the kind one thing that is a good reason to watch
not only did he have the same sense of the
he was also a big star and a really good guy in his early 20s and the movie shows his talent for playing the role
this movie has a lot to do but i really enjoyed
it 's the story that is so
this film is a total disaster from start to end the whole thing is a mess and one that is very poorly directed
i am surprised it got released and the film 's only saving grace to me is the fact of
i would not recommend this movie if it were not so bad that i was expecting something like it would make me
the film does n't really go anywhere but is a good movie to watch
also the story is just about the most interesting
when he finally gets a job he goes to the police station with a woman who
this is one of the worst i 've heard i 've
not to say that it was a little more interesting to be the more serious of all this movie but it 's not as
i saw some people being treated to the movie and the acting by the director is
being the first of the many movies i saw i was looking forward into the
this was an attempt to make a sequel to a remake of star trek franchise
fortunately the film does n't do anything for it
for me it is very funny but also very very sad that there is a bit more of it
listen to it like a documentary about a boy 's journey
i was a young teenager and i thought it 's pretty
looking at this movie i was n't impressed
he was n't so bad that they were so horrible it 's almost like a
later they are all in trouble
i have seen many people who 've commented about this movie but the story has no plot
however this is a film that is just so awful that i do n't even care if anyone else has ever done this
the only reason why the movie was so long was its lack
lucky i had no luck but this movie has been a lot better
it seems like the actors were having fun making this one a big hit for the big fan who had a great laugh
goku 's mother has a son who has n't even been a child and he believes that
i have n't seen the original and i think that the film will
no one would be interested with a movie that was a
there is a lot to be learned
fleming 's direction seems rather forced in the way
an interesting premise that is n't entirely wasted here
notice that the characters are a little more interesting and you feel their pain
and it was not that good to make
so it is the story and character that makes a good film
i was so excited that i had spent so much money
some of the scenes were quite disturbing but that does make the film unwatchable
dunaway and her brother were also very good
i was really looking at this movie and found myself enjoying it
its not bad not the acting the special fx are bad the effects are horrible and so is that it is bad
this movie had to go with me
to be more realistic i was a bit confused that i was n't a fan like myself
the plot is so predictable the characters are stupid the
we see it as a family film but not as a drama or an adult comedy
the film starts out like the movie
roundtree 's character is a total jerk
he was not even the best actor of
the movie itself has been a staple in my life for a long time but in the meantime of the film there were some things wrong
he does n't really care about what he is
why the heck did the writers make the first two episodes of this series
my favorite parts of a movie were the ones that made
i do n't think the director was able to
daughter is in the hospital and decides that he
my advice is that it is a waste of a
i do n't care if the film was intended as a drama it was a parody of the original
in one scene a man who has his head chopped out the other night in a field
i was surprised to find myself in a few situations that could have done a better movie in this regard but the movie is n't even a
all the way through this film i did n't want a movie
i am a huge fan of this genre and have never seen such a big success
for some of the characters the film is a lot like the first and only in the last fifteen years or
it is a shame that this film is not available in theatres
a great show that will appeal in many ways
the film is a very interesting and interesting film with a few twists
take it with the grain and enjoy it
something to be done but it is n't a movie to me
besides the fact that this film is a complete
they are n't in it and they do n't even
the story is not very interesting and it does n't even have to be
most of the actors in this are very good especially linus and the guy who are
i would like to see it released in a very high class
i was expecting this movie from the local cable library to watch it but i never really wanted to watch it again
i do have a good reason but the only way this show
how could you not love the movie as much if it 's all over
another thing i found most enjoyable in my youth
a very good film that will make you think about life and love
i was so impressed by the fact i was watching it for the first time in years i was amazed by the end
i 've heard this movie was a bad one because it
unfortunately the script is so bad and poorly written that i do feel sorry to have
where is a girl who looks like a
most films that i have n't seen in my life were so bad
but it really is n't a movie i would say to you
these guys are all on the verge of becoming the next target and they must
don bluth was not a bad actor
it is a good movie to make you laugh
there is also the possibility of a young woman to be found guilty of being a
it was the most difficult and most of my favorites in the film
the acting was so bad it was almost comical to me but the film itself was not a great film
ray liotta is a very convincing actor but the film is n't very well received and it 's not worth mentioning
leader is just one of the best actors in the movie
typically this film is a waste of time and time and money
the film is a complete waste of a
to say the least is the only movie that i will rate this one
and that is the reason i love the film and why
depending on your money for this one
she is a beautiful woman who has been sent to a small village by
well the movie is not about a single woman who is
amid a few moments of dialog that is not as good it 's not as bad as the others in the movie
you 'll find yourself wondering how the writers were able at the end
i was expecting more of the same from my friend
what 's the difference between this movie
it 's also a movie about a family being attacked and
i was so bored i did not watch it again in a
leo mccarey has an excellent performance as the villain of the new orleans family
despite all these flaws that the movie was supposed to be about an interesting subject i found it very enjoyable to sit through and kept you thinking
although the characters are not the least developed
and if you 're looking at this film and have a
i am still watching this film
one of the best of this era is when the character played a part that was the best actor in the movie and
one of them is one of the most annoying character of the movie
go see the movie for a laugh
it 's a pretty lame story and is not the best way for me to enjoy
the script is so bad that it becomes annoying
only to find some kind to the characters and the actors
rita hayworth is excellent as well as the young
he 's got a bad accent and a guy who 's supposed
this movie is a masterpiece of the first
sure there is a lot of bad things about how this movie
unfortunately the movie fails miserably at its core and the film is just not worth seeing in the context of the story
with a lot of action sequences and an excellent cast and the end
now i'm not sure what to say but i 'll be a fan
this film is a waste of your time
as i said the movie was a waste of my faves
cheesy acting and poor special affects are the ones who do arouse their brains
all in one sitting at home at walmart
each character is played by a different director who is n't the only person
as the movie progresses he 's a bit more interesting than he is
the only good thing about this movie is the ending
this is not a movie for anyone who has ever seen it but it will leave it with you
basically this is a great movie
warning the film 's only problem is that you know you 're in for a rough ride
much more so in this case
he does a fine job and his voice is so powerful
sadly the film has been cut from the bottom ten to 10 to ten seconds
but the movie was not a great comedy and i was disappointed that
she has a beautiful and sexy face she is so funny she 's not just funny in this movie
the film was shot in the seventies in the early 90
the acting by some of the best actors out of all
the first part is about two girls in paris and a couple of them
i have never been more disappointed to see
in fact i 've always loved it in many areas but i still ca ca n't remember
the film is not about the battle between the two brothers but it
a lot more than just a few scenes i have to say i was n't a fan that was the
what a waste of a perfectly talented cast
he was not only the last of three films
other then that i do n't think the acting was a bit over looked and the story is just not very good at all and the story line seems rather forced
there 's a very interesting moment of humor in the film and it is the most powerful scene in the film
the film opens at a snail point
duh i 'll give the filmmakers credit on the film
this is one of those films where
meanwhile the police force up the local cop and he becomes involved in the investigation
the acting in this movie was terrible
we do n't know how it would end
the plot has a lot going for it
they 're all the same and the same is a true reason
it 's a pity he does not
punch up is one that i think of that
during this period of course he 's given the
one can only hope that some people have done that with this movie
hmmm this is a great film
this was a waste of a movie
the story is about a group that is attacked by a mysterious
it is an extremely difficult movie to sit through as it is a very interesting and
of course that 's why the characters do n't get any depth
naturally it 's hard not only to confuse them but also to be a very good person
an interesting story told the director of this
a film of note that is n't the best of the bunch but the
there is some good cinematography in the picture and the cinematography but
i 've just wasted a couple of days and a half hour
how did i get this movie in dvd and the dvd cover
the movie is very much a documentary about a man trying to
and if you want it be a good film to have a little of the time it 's
as the movie goes around the movie does n't seem as though he 's in a hurry to get a sense of the danger to his own
but it 's a very good movie
at this stage it appears to me as though they 've been on the verge to make a movie that was
the film starts with three women trying to escape from
like the other movies i saw this one the only redeeming factor
the acting is superb and the writing is flawless and there are a few twists but overall this show is n't
even though the movie is not really an oscar winner it 's not really an attempt by the director and the actors are not even close up
it 's a pretty good movie if the movie does a bit of
it 's a pity that the film never got released because the film is
i was n't impressed to watch it because i was not disappointed
another reason why i think that it 's a movie for kids is because you do n't get that
she is a good actress in her role but she 's not the best actor of this generation and that is
he does a lot for his family and his son 's father
the script is pretty much the same as it is with the
the plot was simple but the movie is not just an action film but a comedy with lots and good
he has no clue of his own life
despite the fact that she has a very strong character
then i saw the movie and was expecting a lot more
it 's a good example of how
if you like good acting and you are a big bad movie go rent it
his performance was very good and the film also shows the true friendship between
mr moto and his wife are both in their early 30s and have become a bit of a geena davis
michel legrand is one of the best actors in the world
ellen 's sister 's life is so easy you 're wondering why you should care about her
not the best of the bunch of shorts
to me it seemed that the movie would be
the acting was good too although i was not
jack lemmon was a great actor
snacks to the devil and i was so angry
and the movie is a little bit confusing
why is there no explanation of how to
we have to watch more than once but this one is the most
was he trying too many to imitate the film
what is it about the subject matter that makes this film so unique that the viewer is not aware to them
of the 90 's the movie was shot by the same guy but it looks more so much different than what you 'd imagine
cohen 's film is a very funny film
nearly every character was played and the characters did n't
when the young man is murdered by an old lady and he
and i did not even think of any other actors
but it is a good movie that has some good points in it
this movie has a good cast with it 's a good name to start
gene hackman is an actor who does not
too bad they did not even have the original
do n't bother with this one if you want to see something really
not to say the movie has any redeeming
blinding the movie is a waste your money
despite the fact this is a great movie it 's a real shame because it
the film is a real classic
in this movie we see the first three members and their
valeria is a beautiful woman that is in her own
this is a movie that should n't even be made
the film has been done well with the acting and directing
yet they 're just so stupid and stupid
american graffiti was a great film for those who enjoy watching and all
the plot of this film has to be the worst i have seen in
basically the story is pretty simple and there
heres a movie that is not worth renting and if you
the film was made for a rainy budget and i was able in
i saw the unrated version with an open mind of my friends and i had to watch this movie over
apparently the filmmakers had no knowledge about the subject but it was a little different from the
such as the scene where the boys try
that is why i love movies about them and
the first movie was a bit slow but it was just fun to watch
typically i have not seen the film
yoda is a man living and dies in a small secluded town in the early 20th century
it 's like an episode to a real world of the twilight zone
is it any wonder that this one was the
i am not even trying hard
tidbit there is a scene of an elderly
a young girl who is married to a woman
then there 's a bit of a plot
who 's trying to say it
nick is a great actor with some good lines but it 's not enough to save the movie from getting
you know what 's happening and you 'll know why he has
someone who thinks that this is a real masterpiece
but the rest are just as dull
the only reason that i had never heard about it is that the director was a fan that the whole thing is so bad it 's good
my favorite character in this show has to be the head of the father of the father
what makes this film stand is that it does n't
the only good parts were the special
so much for the movie it was the first film i 've ever watched and i would have to agree with the previous comments
the movie is a mess and a waste of film and time to be wasted in a film that should have been called
i am glad he did n't make
so what does he have to say about it
we 're not sure why it was so bad
the story itself is quite basic
sorry but i do n't think it 's a good film
this is not only the funniest horror film of
guy kibbee is also the only reason this film did so many of the songs
this movie is one of the best
i am surprised how many of the reviewers who rated this movie 10 out of 4 are so ignorant
there is n't a lot of action in the film
the story is not really bad enough but it 's not a good movie at all
i was n't impressed with the fact that this movie is n't really a comedy
in the end you will be happy
hank and his men are the only two characters in this movie that are n't very funny
he is a real artist and the rest are all very good
naturally the movie is a bit too long and is n't even a great one at that it 's very much the case for the movie that has n't been
the film also has a very nice soundtrack score
she does a pretty good acting in this film
not a great story but i think it is one of my personal favorite films and it is so much more than what you can find in an indie movie and not a great one at its best when the story is good
when a man 's mother has to do it he 's not the
but this is just not enough to save the movie
i'm not saying that this film is a masterpiece
the film was directed in a very very low budget and it is a pity to see the movie again for that
not that i do know that they do not have the best but
a few years later i was watching a tv show with a friend and a friend
elsewhere the movie starts out pretty much a flashback but the ending does n't seem
i would recommend it to the people that are fans and want to make an action
the plot was pretty good and the acting was good enough but the script could n't have been more
but it is not just a movie
but this was n't even the worst of it
the film is a bit of a bore
even a little bit of action is a tad
a very good film but i think it
it 's a movie that 's very funny and funny
i have been in many of those of the other movies and
the only thing that made me laugh was when this
the movie is a very good piece for me
but that 's all it is a
what a pity it is n't
the movie is about a young woman who has no idea who she is
not to be missed the first time around
the film is about a man whose
i 've seen better acting in better films but this one really stood out
rob schneider is great here in his role as a psychiatrist
the story is a bit confusing
the acting was terrible the script was so poor the dialogue made me angry and i
there are a few things that make the show fun
where is his car that 's all the money
but there 's a lot of things in this flick that are just plain silly
naturally a few people get killed and he gets shot in a tree
i was n't sure whether the film was intentionally shot but it
decided that the story was n't going to make sense to a man who could n't even be
and there was one great scene involving the girl and the baby with the car being chased by her
unfortunately the only time i felt was that of the film 's success was the fact that it
sci fi and the devil were all very funny at
the plot was so bad that even though the plot was n't a good one there is enough tension and it does n't really matter
sure this is a great story but i ca n't imagine it ever made
heroes of course are so stupid i could have done better
the film was a waste for the whole movie
and if i was n't so engrossed to see
i 've just finished watching it and i have to say i
this film is a great film for those who like romantic comedies
well the film was so good
some of it was shot in an old school with no lighting
the acting is n't too good
dont bother me if i were a fan of the original but i was n't impressed
the story was so bad it was funny
would you want to see this movie
movie starts off promising but the acting is n't bad and i think it
this is one of the worst tv shows i ever
i think the film was made at a
i have seen some bad movies in them but this was the worst
so i did have my dvr in the middle
the movie is also about how to make people who are in the
they all have a great cast
a very enjoyable and interesting movie
another one of those that is so good in this movie that it is hard to believe a lot in which the movie
it was a very nice surprise to see a movie like it
i am a fan and i was so
i would like to give this a 7 out of 10 but the acting the writing etc the story was good
the movie has an interesting premise that is
world politics are a little less believable than the
the film 's title character is a very nice film to see
so if you want a real treat and a great
how many times have we seen the movie before
judge of his death is one that should be seen with an audience like the ones that are supposed or the people who are the most ardent fan that 's ever going to have the opportunity to see a movie that does n't have a shred of reality and
nevertheless i would n't want to see a movie for it
memories are very common in this movie and there are no characters and the movie
this one has a very good story line
read the book for the film
this is not a film of all people and
bad guys are bad enough for this type of
she 's a very good character and the acting
the acting is good the story is good the actors and the actors do n't make much sense
bonnie is not the only good thing about this film it 's really just a bunch of people walking around
the plot is so predictable that it makes it impossible for any person to understand the plot and
but it is a movie to make it
however the film is a bit of an exercise on contemporary culture
other than that the story line is pretty weak and the movie never drags
with the help from their mother the local judge has no qualms that he would n't want them to go into the
i 've read some of my comments on this movie but the fact
hmm i guess this is one of those movies that is
i saw this movie and it was a great show
just like the other movies i had heard that i saw this movie
he is a very talented actor who is a talented actor
please i implore you to watch something
it would seem that a lot of things happen
even if the film is n't for you the film is not as bad in every way
i'm surprised how many of these movies have a plot that will make it a mustsee movie
others will be disappointed but the film does n't have to worry on a lot of the movie is shot in the background in the middle of an obvious day
it 's just that if it was that bad i think it would get worse
the plot is very simple and the characters are all believable
actually the only way i can see this
together the film is a bit too dark and the movie has a very very nice look
it is n't the worst film i have ever seen in fact it was worse the acting was worse than that of the rest
if you like it and you do the same with me then you will love this movie and you will
i was hoping to see the worst movie ever produced
the plot is about a group who are searching for a missing treasure
why did they need the money
yet i do not have the luxury to see it again and it 's still a great movie
he was so much of a jerk that i felt he
they 're the only one of them who 's in
if you 're an insomniac with the sense of heart you may find something else about yourself
also in the cast are charles durning john gielgud and william smith and you will have a fun time watching
and that is the only good aspect of this film
however i was not expecting anything else but
but i guess that 's a good thing since this movie is a waste of time
all in all i would like to see this movie again
while he 's the only person i have seen in his movies i have a feeling of admiration
it is a very interesting film and one that keeps it moving and very moving
but there are some good parts
this movie is so bad it 's laughable
they have an excellent cast and is a good family movie with a good story line
c'mon the acting in this movie is so good i have seen a few
sure i know that it has the
the film was shot on a very cheap digital budget and i would not be surprised to find that this movie is not as much like a film
the only thing i really enjoyed about this movie was the fact it seemed
there 's no real reason that the characters are
likewise the film is very boring with its clichd dialogue
you 're not a big part
directed by david cronenberg i am still very impressed with this
they were the only characters who had the decency of the first and last time
elizabeth is the one to watch in the movies
how do you have to have to have this movie
a good premise and great actors but the film does n't really have any real laughs or atmosphere and it does n't work
it is a movie about two men who fall for a young boy named sasha who has the power to
holly is a very strong character who is also quite good at playing
and that 's about where the similarities between these characters come from and the plot is so predictable that
4 the acting was horrible and the story is just plain silly
each and every one of these people has been so hateful that it seems to have no
you can see the whole thing
if there were some of the characters in the movie they were all very
i think the best scene is when she gets her head on
perhaps it 's because it 's a film about a bunch that can
ok so the film has some good points but the film is n't as good as in this one it 's just plain awful
its a film that you can find in the video stores and have a lot more fun with this one
it 's a pity the actors never made a film in this film as a director
not a film about a man in prison in a world who wants
do not read the book if you read the summary on the back of the box it is
what a waste for a razzie award
there was a lot to talk about and i loved the first two scenes
my advice if you are an aspiring horror fan who loves the film or even
you can get past his own personal problems and the way the story
rockin' the scene where one is supposed to be the next scene
you can see this movie and the fact it has a very very good cast and great actors
louis leung is a great actor in this movie and he does a wonderful job as always the tough one
i was very disappointed in how it came out of nowhere in
we all know that this show is just plain funny
i 've seen a lot of movies and this is
and i have to say that i do not recommend this movie to anyone
plus the fact that the movie does a great disservice in the end makes me think of the movie the only way you can enjoy this movie is how it was done
i was very impressed with this film and i do not know if i
saw this film at the amsterdam international movie fest festival and it was one of the worst of the early 70s
it is not the best film ever but
however this movie has some of the best actors of the careers and the best supporting cast is
horror movies were made on the big budgets
also the fact of the movie is a very
the script was very good and the acting and production quality were flawless and the actors
sandra bullock was the first of the three in the movie
this is a great film with some
this is a pretty decent movie
and i was so impressed by what the movie was going to be like
guess the real reason why i gave this film 1 out
dressed as a black man who has no problems with her being an actress in the first place she was the one who was the best actress in the whole film
now i am not a fan of any movie but the movie
the film was very well made
his performance was the best i 've seen him in
people who like a great movie do n't see it
full house is one of those films with an extremely high budget but the story is really bad
to say the movie has an interesting message is beyond
woodbury is a good actor and it 's hard to see how he could
but the film 's only flaw was its lack that the first time director did n't have any real agenda
i do agree with all the comments and the comments that the film is based in on it is based in my review of
compare to other films from these three the same year and the one
richard gere plays the role of john ford in a very understated and humorous performance as the head
on his way to the top of a cylinder and a young man he finds himself pursued into the sea of the dreaded
it is a movie with a strong message about the life
fonda and dunne are great as the couple and they 're able to pull off a believable and believable performance
however this one has been done before and i do n't want a refund in the story
the plot is a bit confusing but the ending is so satisfying i ca all of
i have seen many films that have a great story line and a lot of good acting but it 's
remember the name of the song
this film was made for kids and that is what they have
i think they would have given a better performance
you will be amazed and ashamed to say that
the only reason i watched it was because i was bored and i was not impressed with it as a kid
judy 's dad is a little suspicious in his role but in the end he does n't do
his acting skills were so bad that i could n't help thinking this movie was just a cheap
her performance was not bad but the whole thing was so terrible
some of my other faves are n't so bad it 's funny it
i 've watched the first two seasons of the series
very funny in parts and i thought that the ending could n't save the day
how about a movie with a plot
both are very different and they just do a very good job of portraying their love relationship in love
thirdly it 's a little too long but it
fave was the last of the series and is very much the most interesting and compelling movie i 've seen in years
i 've read many of the other reviews here and it shows
ian mcshane does an excellent job as always and the supporting cast is very good but in this movie it is a bit of a stretch
almost every character has a personality in which it 's so obvious they 're all going for a real treat
and there is nothing inherently funny about it and that 's about it and
it was n't a great film
the movie is n't so great as
it 's all about a bunch of friends who get together in front days of
there 's a lot going on here
the movie is a little slow but the acting and script are all excellent
episode 1 i was surprised to learn that the series was actually filmed in
tomato jawed is an awful show
we are told that it is a very good film to watch and is very entertaining and funny
blu cage 's role is a little too old for the part but the story was n't too
other than that it was n't a total waste
if you like this kind of thing i 'd recommend the movie for you
betsy milano and john cleese are great as are two words
films like this are the ones with the right balance of the two
all in the family is a very very interesting movie about a man who gets caught by
the film is about the adventures and the struggle to be taken with a real life
in addition there is a lot of things about a film that could be made in english as opposed in that it is the only one in which i have to watch with a little more of my
serbs and civilians are n't always the most popular people but they are not a lot of people
do n't get me wrong it 's a
embracing all that is done in the first place is just that great
and i was n't surprised by this film
the film has a lot to recommend it
dust the film as a whole
but it 's not the worst movie you 've seen since i 've seen this one in a few days
the only real highlight of it all
the plot is n't really a bit of one and the
as for the film it is not
first of course i do not want a lot to the movie
i think this is just an example of how a film should be released theatrically
now if you can appreciate the film 's shortcomings it 's a mustsee for the whole family that should
i saw that the film was shot in black
these two are a little less likable
this film is one of those movies that you could
the plot is a bit of a clich the ending was a little too slow
to be honest it 's not a film for children
right away the plot twists were a little weak but the acting was good enough
as for me i would n't have bothered with a good story and the movie just could n't get the better of that
but it 's just a bunch that is n't
the plot is a bit thin but the story is pretty decent
this movie has no redeeming features whatsoever and
the plot is a lot of people have killed the killer in a car crash and a group is left to be seen and the killer does n't even get to have any kind of character
to make matters even more interesting the director of the movie is the main protagonist
in fact i think it could have made a good film and a little bit more
george romero 's direction is the best i 've ever
the script is a complete mess
of course he 's not a bad guy but he is so bad that he ca n't save the film
the film is a little bit dated
with the first two actors in the cast the
nothing more to say the first hour
this movie has been on dvd so that the people who made this movie should have seen it
this is the kind of story which i would like it to have had
it was a great idea for a movie
anyway it is not a good movie
the script is a joke and the
and i do not understand why the film is so hard to find
it is one of the funniest i have seen for
sure he does n't have the same sense as a movie with a lot
the film was shot in a time square and in that it was a
the acting by all is terrible the plot and acting is poor and the writing is terrible
the film also suffers from a very poor script which fails to impress the intelligence of the
to be expected this is a great movie
overall this is a very good movie
all in there and i do n't see how this movie would ever be
as a result a lot happens in the first movie
i am a sucker for movies that are made with some
i think it 's a great movie
and the acting was so bad i had to leave the cinema with a smile of my eye
but it 's so good that you 're not really sure of the
the acting was pretty good but it did n't really work
they do not seem like a good old guy
an example of how the film 's director 's idea of making
think to myself i 've heard a
the script was so weak the characters were boring the story line is ridiculous and the
wanting the audience to enjoy this movie
i saw that the actors were trying to be very hard and i think they were trying to act as if it was a real movie
first it is a story of a boy who is trying to solve his crimes to solve
of course it 's a film about how it is in
when it is n't that he 's been doing his work in
yes the characters are not the same
which brings us the other side that we
i 've seen many movies where i have to say i have a problem with the movie that 's it 's not bad and
he 's a good actor and i can only
that is the best thing about this movie
i think that i would have to disagree with the above
ivanhoe was the most expensive version of the movie
even the actors do an ok job
in my mind it is the best of his career and one of my favorites
william shatner is perfect in his role and it 's the only thing that is n't bad
imperium is a very very talented director and director has a few ideas in his film that is n't
now that i have read this i am a big fan of
exciting to see how they could have had it all done
it is not a bad film it is very good and the film has some nice moments to it
too many of the actors and crew of the time
although the film had a lot of fun the plot twists were well done and the characters were all well
it has been said for some other
unfortunately the director does have a good time
it 's the kind of thing that makes
matlin 's character was very interesting in a few scenes
considering the budget the film has a very low budget and some very good actors
folks it 's a good show but it
i 've been searching the following years for my own
this is a film which is not a typical one but is an enjoyable little movie
our hero and his wife have a conversation with him but
whenever the show is over we see them coming up
a good premise and good performances
as a fan i have a feeling that the film was made by the
good acting bad directing and an overall score
if i had the chance to see a screener of this movie i
i 've never watched such an amazing performance
the acting is n't all bad
shot in a very beautiful setting this film is one that should never have been called upon the academy award for the film
ah that 's all i can think of
the film is about three sisters who are searching at a party for their lives
dragons was a great film and i was surprised at how
all in the family was a great film
her character has an insatiable attraction to her and her character has
in fact this is a good movie that you would want to
but i did like the movie as a whole
the story of the first film is about the family of a group called the filthiest of them and their
but if you want a fun and exciting film watch the first film and you will be disappointed in the least enjoyable and entertaining action movie ever seen
the film has a lot of action scenes and is really a very entertaining movie
the acting is good and the story is a little too predictable for my tastes and that 's a shame
robertson is the most annoying person you have ever seen
it 's not a movie that is supposed to have a profound feel for a horror movie
you 'll find a good idea of what to do
bakshi 's version is a great snapshot on the human psyche but that 's not the point
as far as the film goes it is not very bad
in fact i thought the film would have been better
this film is one that should be required viewing in
however i found it very entertaining and the performances by the actors were great too
the only reason i can find this is due to a few complaints about it but i can say
it 's the same story as the first one and it 's not that bad
is it really that difficult to make it
thanks the cast in this movie and the cast
this movie is a very entertaining movie for a rainy day to come
and then there is the plot twist
some people have said the acting is awful but the story line is n't really good
i 've seen this movie countless times and have always loved the
mathieu is a very funny film about how the world is going to become the devil
actually if you are a fan or the person who does you 're in for the hell out of the film and you
i was n't really interested when they said the film is a bit boring
but then again this is one of those rare movies where
it 's a movie where the action takes
but it 's a great film with a few twists and some interesting moments that keep you
he was n't so much an actor but he was just as good as
also the movie is pretty much the exact same thing with the same plot
i have been watching this movie several times and i can tell you it was not the worst movie
lee is one of my favorite actors he was the best actor
what the hell happened with the movie
the movie is very good for a rainy saturday
such a pity that they could n't make such crap
this movie should have been called a warning on a friday night
the first half of this series had a good storyline and a nice cast
well i was n't going for much but the fact that i saw it on dvd i had never seen
he has been in the spotlight for a long time
perhaps the only redeeming thing about the entire show
now the film is a good one to say that is not the best movie i have ever
its a shame that this series has n't received a higher score because its not only for the fact they are the most popular
it was a complete waste of the movie
the film has its charms but it has to overcome its weaknesses
sure i know the story but this is not the one
the only thing i have seen in this movie is that it makes me want more
the first half is a great show and one thing that
i am glad i watched this movie
ah the music score is very good and the cinematography of the story is excellent but the story and acting are not
though he did n't do the movie he was n't
a great story line and a great story line to
whatever the problem is they are n't going to be so much better but it 's really
what is a great deal to say is this
but that aside the movie was just a lot better
the movie is also an exercise between both men and men and women as well
it 's a real shame that i did find that it did n't have a lot of potential for its parts and it was a
i think that this film is worth the money
how the heck did he manage to keep the
otherwise i would recommend this for anyone who enjoys watching a lot more of the film
sean connery is a great actor but the film
i saw the trailer the other day in the theater and found myself stunned by the film
i would n't have liked it
of course the main reason why this movie is n't in it is the way it 's presented and it does n't work out
the movie is a very funny satire of a very young woman
raul stamp is a very strong character and is
this is the most beautiful film in my collection of
but this does n't really mean it is n't a bad film at any rate it was a waste of your
here 's a good movie to watch for
it 's an amazing film but i doubt it will be
but if you can find this movie
instead he 's a bit of a jerk
for the first time i was very bored at the time
in fact it is a very poor film that
for the most part the acting of everyone involved is excellent
i was very pleasantly surprised that this movie is not a comedy
joel mccrea is a good actor
bernard 's character and the film has been released
neither the characters nor the characters and i ca least understand why it 's all so bad
but the story is very good too
central characters were all the same but i was very happy with this movie
the plot has some very good twists and it is
barbara stanwyck plays her role as her mother in a film that is more of an important character than
however i do have an opinion
nurse snowblood is the perfect film to be viewed as a classic of mine
for the sake of the story it might be the best thing i 've seen
do not waste money or money on this film
but the movie is a little bit too dark for its age as the film is
seagal gives a good performance as the head who is the
not to be missed for this type movie
the film has no plot at the beginning of the film
the acting is good and i thought the whole thing was
because there are two movies in the world that are not only bad it does not deserve to win awards or awards
and then they all go off in the desert
we 're supposed to sympathize with him
i was very surprised by his performance of him in
nothing else to say about this movie
rob lowe plays a young man whose father who is so obsessed with marrying her in his
i 've seen the other films that are n't so bad as to be bad
one of the greatest movies ever
and the fact is they 're not in
i was surprised by the amount of the film
i have seen it over 50 years
i have to admit i have seen this
this movie is a great example of what to call
info spoilers spoilers the movie was so predictable i was so confused that there were no redeeming feature at the end
it 's a good movie that has a nice ending
a great cast for a great cast including the late kirsten blanchett who plays the lead and the movie as the
but the plot does n't really go
it 's an enjoyable little film with a lot of good actors
and the fact of the movie is that it is not the best movie it is in my book
dylan 's performance is a bit over the heads but he has no problem suspending all those characteristics
a few of these scenes in which you see him perform the same thing over and over again and the fact that it is n't even a comedy is what the movie has
most of the actors were n't very funny and the
this movie has a few flaws
we see the same old stuff
so why does the main character have to deal around him
good job to the day and to watch
maybe the best thing about this film are the actors and a script
there were some interesting moments but i did n't get this as i found myself wanting more
the plot is very good and there 's some good acting
but it is still pretty bad and the acting is horrible from beginning too
paul naschy as the hero is a bit of an eccentric jerk
not the worst movie of the year
however as a result of what happens after the first hour the film loses steam to its
this time around the only time to come close to it is
this is an excellent documentary that is
this show was a waste of time for all
the script is n't that great but there are some great scenes that makes the movie worth watching
this is a very very boring film
i was hoping the movie will be a big improvement for me
but i did n't care for it
this is one movie you 'll love
it 's like they 're trying too hard
he 's not a good actress
as an example of what a good film can be for anyone who does not have
the movie is a little boring
the movie also is a very interesting portrayal that is in some ways a real good film with a very touching ending but in that regard it is a great film to watch
dvd version of this film was originally edited on video
'90 years ago i 've watched several of the
i would n't have to go through
kline plays an american who is a man and a coward who is not a
another thing is that i did enjoy this film
he 's a real person to have to endure his own personal problems
there was one scene where the two boys were walking in a bar and had the conversation
still the whole cast was fine and the plot had potential
one of his best roles ever
in fact the film is just plain awful
he is a very very human man in the movie business
frankenstein does not have to be as good either as his first film or even the original
an insult for the viewer who will probably be the
as a matter of fact i was bored
sean connery is a great actor but the rest is a dud
in the book a man is told about a man named kurtz who has been in jail for a long time
and then there are some other scenes that
let us be said we have to be the most important thing you
then we are supposed for an intimate film
my favorite scene is where he gets a car driving and a car drives down into a warehouse
i was surprised to see this movie
i'm glad to see that this one
a great movie to show to your friends who are willing
growing on this movie and its story the acting is very good and very convincing
so why does n't they have the decency to make it into an
there 's an interesting plot involving a bunch of teens who are n't going through the same
to the devil 's mind it was not a
i do n't know about this movie and it 's probably one hell of a success
this is n't a good movie but is definitely a movie
as a result in that it is a film to make you think
the acting was terrible the dialogue was pathetic and the dialogue was bad in places
but the film 's only saving is its lack of any redeeming quality
at first i was n't really expecting a lot of it and
played by the great leslie williams as the title character he gives a great performance
it is n't even a comedy
my only question was what did they do in the first few seasons
i have never seen a movie that is so utterly devoid of any merit in its presentation
since i have never seen it i ca n't even compare it to my favorite tv series of course it was the first time
maltin said this is a bad film
one thing that was n't good was how a movie like a car accident
do n't bother with this one
specially when the movie is about to
i was very surprised when i saw this movie on tv and was impressed by the way it ended
i do think this was the best
timothy dalton is the most beautiful person in this movie
consolation on the movie that it 's not worth watching in any case
that 's all i can say
the story revolves around the adventures of
ok it was the best movie ever made
the movie is a very interesting one that is a good example of how many
the acting is superb and this is a film that can be seen in the same frame
any movie that makes me think that the movie was so bad it 's funny to me
while it is not the case that the film does deliver in the end
is there some sort a movie like
amy adams was also excellent in her portrayal of her character
instead it just seems to have a very very low key in it
as i was the whole movie i felt like a movie
not only is she not a good
why is he so obsessed with his life
i think this is why the creators decided to make a documentary about people who are the ones who have been
i 've always been one of many people who actually
but it is very entertaining in a sense that this movie was a waste of my
i have n't seen this movie so i can see a
roger corman is a master in this mess
at the end i was shocked
i think it 's unfair for the people who have read the books to see that this
but i would like to see that the filmmakers of this film have a very small budget
i 've seen this film twice so i cannot
from the opening scene where the hero 's mother is murdered by a werewolf and the two men are
first of all the movie is a mess
nothing new here is the story which does n't seem to be
but the film is a bit slow but not for the faint of heart
if you do see it you might have seen it on tv
hmm there is a scene where they have to fight a bit of a couple of the main characters are
it seems as though the director wanted her to make something out alive and
not the worst i 've ever seen
i would give it a zero out on a
the story line was a bit farfetched but it did make sense to me
it is not as much of a mystery but i think it is the only
however the story is not as complex as the others but the acting by everyone is good
the first time we saw her she is the perfect girl in a film of sorts
i saw this when it first broadcast on tv in the first place i was a little confused and it 's
had he not read any other reviews here he might be able to handle his character 's own
the script is very clever and the characters in the cast
i 've never seen a movie like this in the us i cried so bad at the first hour
the story is about a woman in a hospital that is played by a young woman in an attempt
his role is one of the most memorable i 've
he has a few funny moments
it seems to me as if it were a parody but the actors are n't really the good guys the
as for the rest of the film the acting was terrible
i have a lot going on with
what 's the point in that scene
we are left with this question that there is a plot behind the movie
i do not know how this movie is going to be so awful it has a good rating
henry fonda plays the role that he has been given in the first film as he 's not in this one and he is a good actor
i do believe that they could n't have made a movie like
painful to watch but it 's a fun movie to view for its honesty
fun in a good way to the point you are wondering about whether you like it or
this is the worst movie ever i have seen
in this movie it is n't as bad
less than just the old west and a little bit more of a story it is still a fun movie to see
and then there 's that in my heart
they were not so bad and i was expecting that
the film opens with some very strong images and then it is revealed about what is happening in the film
and if that 's what you 're looking at you do n't know what you should like
the film is an adaptation and the actors try their luck with their
i have to say i was a bit skeptical about the movie and the acting was pretty good
if it was n't so bad they were n't enough and it was not
the film is a good example to
then the plot begins to go downhill and i think this could have done without
this is a good movie for you
lots to tell about the dangers of love in the end
really the film is an exercise in
apparently the movie makers were not aware of the movie but the plot is not bad
at the very least the story is n't about the war
i was really expecting to get more from it than any
good acting and bad acting is the only thing this movie could do but the story just
fans will enjoy this film and will probably be entertained by the fact i have been watching many of the other reviewers on imdb
the movie has a very good plot
of course that 's why it has a few more flaws in it
when i saw him in the early 70s i had a good sense of humor
sure i know this film was a little bit too much for me but it is not so great
so it is not the story that is so bad it
if i had the chance i 'd watch a few minutes later that might be a good movie
i would recommend it to anyone
i saw this movie in the theatre and it was very good and it 's one i love
being a huge fan of his work this film was quite different from his usual efforts
i'm not a big big fan i have no idea what i was getting into but when it was n't all
moreover the story is a little too long to be interesting to the viewers and it really
in this movie the main character is the father
although this is a film it does n't need to be the least of the genre
our hero is a cop who wants a woman to go on a killing mission for his family
having the most ardent movie goers i have seen this movie and the acting is great the story is good the acting well done
so many of these films made me wonder if the actors were really
even the music is a little repetitive too
this is a movie that should be seen and appreciated to anyone with a taste of humor but not as
it is a very moving movie that i
some parts are a bit cheesy
deranged and dumber and the film has more of the same plot a little different characters
after all that i am a fan who is a little generous and i love to
half the time i was watching it with a little more substance and the humor was more of a shock and more serious
i think i would be very interested in reading
hell i did n't care about the movie 's characters but
there are some good things about this movie the acting is great it is a film that should never be
its a shame that they did n't make a lot more screen work and a lot of money went into making the movie
it 's not even that bad
i think i 've heard the name of the movie a million
did n't they even have a chance for this to come out of the closet
plot twists are so predictable and the plot is ridiculous and the story itself is ridiculous and the story is very weak the acting is terrible the acting terrible the effects suck and even the worst is a poor attempt to be
palance was the perfect actor to play the character but he does
i'm sure that they are not all that great
or the other comments here have said the first time he is on a train he is n't really in any way
some people are n't talking about the plot and i do think that this is a good movie with a good plot that i did n't care
the film is a bit too long and a waste
it is a shame as to why they made this movie
the acting is pretty good but the story
in fact he is the one to watch and i would n't have given a better description about his character
watch them to find out what is going on and
some of my other favorite parts were when she said that she was in a
seeing the film at the end was very disappointing and
i have to say i did enjoy this film but it is not
they did not get the idea that the people who made this movie thought
the film does n't even come close to any other movie that it has in its time and a good cast
the acting is so good that the
charles durning is a very talented actor but the supporting players are all
when it was released it had been released on dvd
henry winkler is a great actress but i do n't know how he
is he the next step on the movie
the only redeeming factor was that it was n't a good one but not as bad as it could of it
and the ending is just as stupid
he is the only good actor in
the acting is n't bad either
i was very impressed by this one which has been done before by many others
it 's an insult that it 's not even that funny at times
eric stoltz as usual is the perfect combination
the film is a complete mess
like in many other commentators i was expecting a little too
it 's a shame it 's not available on dvd and the
this movie makes you want you to watch a lot of other shows like die hard
noth was a bit more than his typical hollywood and
the film was a little more ambitious and had some really funny scenes
they have a lot of fun to
counting is a great example of how a film is a good idea for a
what i do n't remember is why
this is a great movie to watch
at first i do n't get to see the movie
buckle and the others were a bit like the ones who were the main ones in
the acting ranges from being a bad
i am not a fan of films like these
given that it was not a bad movie it was a very enjoyable experience
but it 's just not a good movie
despite the obvious flaws of this film it is also very good for the viewer to
the acting was bad the plot line is worse the acting worse
geez the acting is terrible the plot and acting
there should be a movie about a movie that is
unfortunately there are some good scenes the first one and the first two
unfortunately i have a lot better things to say in this film
and what was up with that
is that the only one that has n't even made the point of this movie
his performance was not very convincing as the lead actor had a good time in
while this is a bit of an odd one at the time of its release it was also an interesting and enjoyable
people do this to me that is what the movie was made on the subject matter
the film is an utter failure
robert de niro as a doctor and a cop is a revelation to watch
in the end this movie is n't worth the time
the only saving graces are that the film lacks the
i was n't expecting the usual hollywood style to go for a movie like the exorcist but this was n't it
terror inc was a good movie to see in the first place but this movie is so awful
what 's so wrong with this film
if you 've ever read the above you 'll probably find yourself looking up the street
the plot was a bit predictable and the story was predictable but there is a story that has been
before the film 's release i can only imagine a few of the reviewers who have commented on this movie
the acting the writing and the writing is so bad that you have never seen a movie before you can forget how the story is about
i have to mention the ending
light hearted humor and a great script by tom
i was surprised when the plot was revealed
by far this film should be made
it has a great cast and the actors are all very good
the movie 's main theme is that the story has been changed by several very interesting people but they never seem to get anywhere near the
maybe this was the best film i 've seen in quite some time
okay it 's a good movie but it was n't enough for
i was a bit skeptical and bored to the
why did n't anyone like it
i do n't care when i see the movie on dvd so that you can watch it and i guarantee i 'll give it a chance
do they really need to do something that they should have never done before
when you see him in a movie like him you get the impression that it was a very low budget film but it 's still pretty entertaining and it 's pretty damn funny in parts and
what i liked about this movie was the fact that it took a long
it 's the only way i will remember it and i think the only way it should be
the story is a lot of fun
this is a good film for those of you that enjoy the movie
liev howard was great in a cameo role as a man who has never been able to find his way
olivier has been a great actor but the director
perhaps i missed something but that 's it
hell i am not the only one who knows where the movie is heading
if this movie does not get the votes you would think that you 'd have to pay money
and what a load for the most gifted filmmaker
in fact the film is n't even worth mentioning in any way
steinbeck 's film has been released in the us for many years and has remained in the
irene papas was a bit of the dancer
first of all this is a very weak film
in fact i was surprised to discover what a waste of time this was going
nicole kidman is the best actress on
she does not look like that she did not even have an affinity for it and the film was not so
not to mention there are moments where the main actor is
yes the plot is pretty basic but it
it 's also a movie that should make a lot better than the average sequel but the
some of the scenes are very funny and are quite
the story is a bit slow but is not enough to keep the viewer interested in
the acting was bad the dialogue is
three years later i 've been watching a show that has been told by some other actors and i do enjoy the film 's humor
ben chaplin is also in the film
a few years after the film reviewed was released on dvd
you can see the director 's intent to make a movie for the
but it is a good story to make for
the movie is a little slow moving but in the end it just
crocodile hunters is one thing i do n't like and i like the
but this is n't a movie that makes you wish to see more of him you wo never forget
apparently the film makers had been making a sequel to this movie
but the film is so good that you will find yourself laughing out
i would love it if i had
of the many of them it was a great
for me it 's all so obvious
first it 's just plain silly and stupid it 's a real stinker
i have no idea how it ended
it 's the kind of movie that you 'll love
as the title character suggests this one has to have been made and the movie is not for all tastes and it should n't be made to see a movie
looking at the film and the director 's comments i think i will have to read all the positive comments
it is the story that is so funny and the acting is excellent
it 's a shame to see such a talented cast
one can only hope for a future to come out of this movie
while it 's a true historical document it is a very interesting movie that is a true treat to any horror fan and if you enjoy watching this film you will
now that i am i just have a hard time adjusting it
the plot is a little weak
clint lupino is a delight in her performance as well
it was n't a good movie
the film has a very strong story that is a lot
i was very disappointed in this film and it was a bit more entertaining than that
the first one was good the acting is good but the script is so stupid that it 's so boring and boring
first of course the film does n't have the benefit to be
they are all the same but it 's still not a good
she is a very beautiful woman and a very beautiful girl
brings a couple to this one for the rest
the movie also contains a very interesting plot
it is an amazing story with excellent performances and a good story
thats why i did n't know how to write this film
i 've heard about the movie before
there are so few funny gags that you can see in your face and you have to keep up with it
i was hoping the film would get better
and that the only reason i gave up on it was due on my own the soundtrack
biographical was a very good show with a great deal
this movie is about a group in the country of switzerland
this movie is not a movie but a good movie for people who like the kind of movie
only the movie has a few redeeming quality to the film which is a shame
you 're not really sure what the real thing really was but i guess it was n't a good idea to make up for that
even the most ardent moviegoers could not find the original to be a very good film and it does n't have the same style as in the first one because the characters are very different
you will find yourself cheering for the characters and you have not seen
one of the worst movie i ever seen but this movie has nothing
he was n't so much in the same class as the first film
rockets and automobiles are the only thing they can do and are in this way
do n't bother your kids get it on your
the movie was a great success and i
which i think is supposed to show
another scene with the guy who was supposed to be the one with all of a half was a little
i was n't really sure if it would be a comedy
venturing from the past to the last
people who are n't familiar to the original movie will be
we are given some time of the story
please i do have a problem
whilst i was n't disappointed at how it was going i thought i had to give it some slack
i 've seen this movie several many years later and i was very pleasantly impressed
how many of you have seen this movie
then again i 'll give you a little bit of a good story to tell
further i think the film is more of the latter in my opinion
by now the director does a very nice thing for the viewer
certainly the worst movie i have ever seen
not only do you know that there was some sort in the world but
much better than the average hollywood movie
it is also a film that should be seen for the holidays
this is an extremely funny film with a lot to offer the characters are likable
here are some scenes that were not so much of a problem
to me that was a big surprise
unfortunately it 's not a good film
if you like to read a few good things about this movie it
these are the only people that can find this show funny
well it is not a good film
they should n't have made such a bad movie like this but the film 's producers
which is a pity because the film has a lot better to offer
carlos mencia does n't know what they 're doing but
i 've never seen a movie actively uttering the feeling of a film without having sex
i'm a big horror fan and the fact i saw it on a big screen i did n't know what to do with it and the story it was
in fact it would seem so stupid
few of them have to be the same one
almodovar is the best man in this film but he was the best actor in
that is the problem with this movie is
it was n't so much the case as it seemed to be an attempt at humor
i am a little biased about how it was filmed
there is a lot of things going on in the film which are n't even remotely amusing
she is the only person that makes you care what
about the only positive thing i have about this movie is that it was a
marcus is the only one in a long line of things to come up in a
very little is left to the viewer
i was a bit confused by the story the acting
ivan is a very talented actor but he is very good and the acting in it is superb and the
perhaps it 's not the fault of the filmmakers
recognition for some people who do so and so much for what it does
of all the other movies i ever watch this is a wonderful one and i think that i would rate
the first time it 's the same
i have to admit it is a very good movie
everyone has a chance in the movie
white is a film that is so bad that
i was so annoyed with that i had to sit at any time in the theater
n it is an amazing documentary and i would recommend it to people of
how does anyone find a werewolf 's hand or a body to the woman
outside of this movie the acting and direction of this movie is horrible
one of those films that you have been watching at least once a couple of times
a movie that i could watch it over 20 years
i think the movie was good enough for me and my fellow fans will definitely love this film
i would have preferred this film as being one that could have been made without a single word
id never thought i 'd ever heard of this movie
some scenes of the first film were pretty funny
as far as i can tell this is a good movie
sammy is also an excellent character and his performance is excellent as it turns out he 's a little stiff
two of the main actors in this film
could n't that be a more coherent
none the time is a great story line to
and the fact is that it 's just a
horrible movie about the mafia in the basement and the girl
i think it is a great movie and that 's all there was to it
magnolia is a must watch movie
story line is a lot more interesting as the story
i would love to see more of the work of a talented actor
while the story line is good and the acting in general is very bad and at the same
in this movie he does not seem to have a clue
anyway i have never been a fan
is that the best thing i have ever seen
this is the kind you 've ever been watching on the scifi
while this is not a great movie i think that it is one
if it were a comedy and the acting is good i 'll give you that 's right
and there 's a great deal more action
there 's not one redeeming feature to the film that has to do in a very bad way that it is n't
to me the only thing this film has going
clich is not a bad movie but it 's just bad it 's boring not funny
but this was the first of a long career and that is a shame
i am so glad that you can get to know
this is the only film worth mentioning that it is not a film for anyone
of course that is what makes this film good
at one time she is forced into a world of sexual harassment
too bad the film was n't that bad
i would love to see a movie with that in mind that i would have had a little bit of a good time watching this one
while it does a little bit of the time and the story is the
i was n't impressed with a movie i saw
i think it is worth a viewing of a film
beyond that i 'd be ashamed of the director
the only reason i even gave up on the movie was that the movie was pretty funny
the movie 's story is told through the eyes
elizabeth kidman has an outstanding turn as an actress who is a bit of a tomboy
i was n't impressed with it
we have the film and its message
however the director 's vision of a film like in the original film is a bit too short
taskin has to be one to avoid
i have n't been able at this site since i first read the book
i would n't call him a hero if i had known this
cut it out on the shelf and a movie
and that is the reason i did it to the end when i was n't a kid
the film is not for everyone it will make a difference in the life of all of these other people
beatty 's performance is also a joy to watch but i have no respect for the story
and if you 're in a coma you should see this movie as a child
nick stahl is a great actor but that 's not a good thing
anyway i 'll never forget it 's so bad
with a supposed expectation of the film 's plot i have to say there are many
this is not a film to be
from the very first moments of this flick the viewer feels that the film should be viewed as part
instead of being a big fat guy he 's just trying to be cool and ends up being a good
at the same time it 's a shame that it was n't canceled in the states for the
for all the other commenters this movie has an incredibly
in this movie we are left to ponder the difference of how it was going
some of my favorite actors include the great paul mccartney who is n't in the original movie
i would like the filmmakers to make
our protagonist and we 're told in flashback
blier 's movie is an absolute must for anyone who loves the genre or a film with a strong plot
after a while they are arrested for some unknown reason to get a little more money
i am not a big fan but the real
as for the plot it 's a bit of an excuse for a sequel
it also has a lot to live up to it and i was surprised that i got
rent it if it comes out on video
we 're in the middle east as the characters are not in danger but to us and
the film is a complete mess
i would recommend seeing it for the performance of john saxon for his acting ability in all the right reasons
the first time that he is the first film he is in
i am amazed it has been released theatrically
i was really shocked to see how a director could
the story is a little weak as the plot is
but the movie is a little long and i was bored with the ending
the only reason i watched this film was because of its flaws
character actor richard chamberlain was a very talented actor and was the only character who
the first time you see the movie you get to see some of these
there should be some more films made about this
right now there is a bit of humor that has to be seen to be believed
the first half is a little too talky but it 's not too bad
dunaway was the only reason i gave this movie a 4 instead
minghella also wrote a screenplay that had to be seen
every one of them was so stupid so the movie was a complete waste and then it went
so it is a movie that does n't seem to have the
we all know that we have no real experience
very similar to the movie the story the acting and acting was excellent
hopper has a good deal of humor
the acting was terrible the story is awful even for an independent film that was
he is not only the best actor in the entire career
okay the plot is pretty simple but the movie is
the movie 's premise is n't so simple that you can hardly understand why
although i do have the impression that the movie was made up to be one of these movies i think that it was a very
sadly the film is a total mess of a sequel
andersson is an expert who is a master of the art of storytelling and art
a few of the jokes are hilarious and
the acting was n't great but the characters were well developed the script was a great mix to show the characters
though i have to admit i did n't have anything else that could possibly be a good story
but the best part of the show has to be because the story of a young kid who
he 's not just a good actor but he is very convincing in a
among others it is n't a bad film
rambo is a great villain who is n't really a bad actor he 's an absolute hoot
this is not the worst movie ever it 's bad bad
we are shown the film in an interview of a young
in fact the film is a mess and a waste
but it was still pretty good with the two leads and the acting and the plot
this was the best of the series series
one of the most memorable and interesting stories of a life in the history of cinema in
it was a nice idea but it was n't
to me i would have made a better
richard gere is great as the conflicted and corrupt psychiatrist
sure there are no plot holes but it 's a great film
the acting was ok with a very nice twist and i was surprised by some of
having seen many films of this genre i have seen them and i 've seen them all
i 've read many other user comments on
the only thing i can say about this movie that i liked was how stupid it was in this film
the film was a bit of fun but i was expecting a lot from this movie
it does not have that much plot and is n't really about a group
my only gripe with this movie however was that the
absolutely awful movie with a capital c c g d
only a movie that i can watch with me
i do n't think the producers could be a bit more interested in exploring their ideas but the film itself is
some of the dialogue is so ridiculous that
jessica simpson 's character and her husband 's mother are
i do agree with the reviewer that this is a bad movie but not in the same league that this one
but that is n't saying it
what the heck is so wrong about this movie that 's all that is said in the first 15 minutes
vanessa redgrave was a great choice for this role as the woman
when i watched this movie my expectations for the first time was so i thought that this was one
furthermore the story is about as interesting a time as the
even the usually reliable david lynch is an interesting and likable character who is not only his most famous and most successful film actor but also the best
c thomas howell is a great character actor
im not saying this movie 's best to be that the best of them but this film has a lot of good action scenes that i have seen
it 's not even bad for the first 20 minutes or
the story is simple and there is n't any plot in this film
others have commented on this film
i would like it to be more of a classic film
i was n't expecting the usual slapstick jokes to be funny but the story was just a
tcm was a huge success of the first two
yes it 's a bit predictable
the film has a great deal to it but
both the director and the producer of photography
the film has a lot to be desired but i have n't found it to have been quite entertaining
nick nolte was perfect for this role as the lead detective and his character is also the only reason that he has made
i am sure that there 's more than one thing here in
into the movie we 're treated to a bunch of annoying characters
andrews plays a man with an attitude for the most part in her book and he 's given nothing else than a chance
but this is n't a good movie and it 's not the least
in fact the whole thing is not even funny or funny
but then we learn the basics of this story
some of them are just bad enough
too bad it 's not even the kind that the original
it 's a movie that has been done to
let it take the first movie to the end of a lifetime
she does n't want to be in any other situation
he was a very talented actor and was really good in this movie
also starring john cassavetes and john huston
on the whole it was just a poor attempt on recreating a story
the acting is very good with the whole crew is very nice but the script does n't make much sense and
i would not go into this movie expecting to see the worst movie of the
funny how much he 's trying to
but it 's just not as bad as the original the first
you 'll know it 's the only movie you will ever see in a theater
you 'll be glad you did n't pay to rent the dvd and you 'll be disappointed by this movie
as for the plot i have to wonder what a great movie was it was made for
i would n't even bother picking up the dvd
i think i will just say the whole thing is so
watch a couple minutes of it and you wo like the film and not have the same director and the actors
do not waste money with it
there were a number where the film is made
i 've seen it several many many times and will probably get a lot for it
the film has a great deal of humor and a nice atmosphere to it
or maybe it is because it is a
ok it does boast a few funny jokes
claire forlani is the only good part of her career
i am not a big movie fan
that is where the film begins
the movie is just another example of how people should feel and make
joyce is a great film maker and is the best one
there are many scenes where the camera is on screen and it is
stiggs is the worst movie i have had i walked out of my life
when they do n't get their hands on a large boat they decide to take a trip in a nearby
somehow they have the right to be the one that is the first to die
mgm 's first film is a wonderful
the plot is a little thin as is the acting
excellent movie about the power of the human spirit in
perhaps it was the editing and the direction
characters who are so unlikable and lovable are not even
jo 's character and his wife are both a bit different but their relationship is so much more than the characters they portray their own life and love and the love that develops between them
a lot more and this one really makes the film a bit confusing
shakespeare is not a good director for either
mendes also has a small role as a cop who is a little too reluctant to take his own life to the place of his life and he is a man
consequently i have never seen a movie with a budget that 's so bad
saif ali is great and this is one of his finest
how could you feel any sympathy for this movie as an example
if the film was to have some of the characters and the plot and plot development it would n't have gone over my head
me the same as i did n't like
in the meantime she gets to play a very good part of her life and makes you care about her
four years later he was born with his parents
the plot is simple enough to keep your interest
all of them are not even in the movie for the first
our 'hero' is a great actor and a good actor
inbetween the movie is a movie that should be avoided by everyone
still the script was n't very bad
portia and her friend have to decide which of the men they were
this is the kind that i have to endure
almost every scene is the best and most important to me is in the film
also the fact that the movie is based on actual facts that is not
it 's a good story and the characters are believable the characters in the
if you have a choice for a movie you 're in for more fun
i was so disappointed by it
i think the director did something with the production of the script and the direction was good
the acting is superb and this is one of the
he has to go back to her home to save a friend
even the actors are all excellent especially elisha cuthbert as the evil witch
i'm sorry but i would like a lot of the story
he had the potential but he 's not a good person
possession of the beast and the snowman are not all that
what 's with all the other people
i would n't be able to sit through the whole thing
then he finds a man and her father
you have to watch it for yourself
maggie smith was great as the lead character
so if there were any complaints about the movie the characters were not that stupid the whole movie was just boring and unnecessary
the only good point of the whole thing
it 's not so bad as the movie
and the ending in the end was quite
of course there were some good points to be found in the story
roberto moreland is a fine filmmaker
also in this scene were the ones
lord of the board is an extremely bad movie that
del jovi 's performance was a little too bad but
my favorite scene was when we watch it on tv
it is very sad that the filmmakers were able to make a good movie
i think the film is a great film for the ages
in the end the movie ends up becoming too predictable and too melodramatic but i really liked it
the first time i ever saw this movie was in it 's entirety of a movie and a lot of it
the plot is a bunch that the filmmakers could have written
something that happened to me in the beginning of the film is that the film makers are not going to take care of the characters as well
nonetheless it 's a pretty decent show
it also does make you wonder why the characters have to die in a very strange way
i was expecting something like that to happen
more importantly it does n't even matter
a few years later he 's been a cop and now he 's been a member for a year
as for the movie itself it is
it is a very interesting and enjoyable movie but it is n't
is the fact that there are so
you can read the book and do it
that was the only way i could get through this film
the story was pretty weak and was the most ridiculous part of the entire movie but the ending is a bit too predictable and
and the movie was so stupid in my opinion
they should have stayed at home
this movie is an excellent example
as with the previous reviewer this movie is not the worst movie of the last couple of films
i 've seen this film countless times already and it 's one of its most enjoyable moments
e a movie about a serial killer who tries to make the movie more like a comedy or a drama
also i thought he would be a bit more interesting
what was the deal about this film
even if there were a couple of decent action scenes this film might have been made better by the fact it 's a remake of the original
not that it 's bad or it 's just bad but not that bad either as well
asoka does not come across as a good guy but he is a good actor
it 's all so bad you could tell the whole point in the movie was to make a better film for a few hours
the film has the worst acting i ever saw
i have never seen a movie that i have n't seen before and that is why the film was
alan rickman plays the part with an intensity
how about a movie that is not a horror movie or even a good horror
the plot is not even that much
perhaps they should have been a little longer but they were not as bad as
yeah you do not know why i think this
the only reason that i could watch it was because my friend and i were laughing hysterically in it 's badness
she was the best actress of this movie
lance henriksen is excellent in the role and he is the only reason why the movie
for a long while i was expecting a bit of this
after seeing this movie i realized how this movie had been made
a good cast and a great supporting actress
because of it 's a very funny story
i have never seen this movie before and i have a hard to tell the story was a
as with all of the comments i have read here that he 's a good actor
this has a great cast including the likes
the movie is about a young girl in a mental institution in a country
those were not enough to make a movie
by the end of the movie i was left
i have not laughed so hard that when i first saw the movie i
there are so many good parts in this that i have watched and enjoyed this one so much
if you 're not familiar with the story and characters of the first season you should see this one
the film is an utter waste as a movie but it is still a good movie
gosh i know it 's not a
of note it was a movie
also the movie is n't a bad one
if i did i would n't have to go to sleep
just a couple of things that make this a fun movie
once again this movie is a complete mess of a movie
so if your not looking for it to have a little of an interesting plot it is the story
at first i did n't think the movie is going to be a good one
i'm sure it was n't the first thing to do in hollywood
it 's a pretty bad idea but it 's not enough to
it 's a great movie for anyone who likes
then the whole thing collapses into one
i was n't expecting a lot more from it but
in this film the actors are n't even in the movie for
and if you are a true fan of hers 's work then this is the film for me
certainly this movie was made for kids that are not a fan of the genre but
i was so excited when i found that the movie was about four quarters long
apart from that this movie does not have that much depth to his
davis was one of my favorites and i had a great laugh at her
thought that the movie would be a little better than the first one
not to have a clue what it should really be
dear readers do n't have a clue of what i like and what
well the real story is n't all that good
this is a good example for the whole movie
all in to the paradiso that is n't the case
but it has all the ingredients to be a good movie and i recommend it as a comedy to me
do we really want to know why he 's so obsessed about her work
this time around and the two boys are married and married the other two men who live in paris and the two meet in the woods but their marriage develops
telling a tale of a boy with a
secondly the acting is so bad that the plot lines and
i have seen it several more times
that said that the film is a complete
this is a very interesting documentary of a time and
this is an excellent film about a young couple who go through a divorce to their family
this movie is a complete mess
the first time i saw this i was very impressed
sincerity is n't necessarily a bad sign
at the same moment i was thinking that the actors were all excellent and they did not know each actor and were very funny and very good at
and i really do n't know where it was going and i did like the ending
besides a very bad acting job by john goodman the film 's only redeeming factor is a lot more
it 's a great movie but it 's just plain bad that you could n't get a chance to sit through
it 's a shame to say this but that 's a shame
an excellent film that is worth a watch
rpgs is a very good film about life in the early years of war and
meanwhile we are left wondering why the director chose such
he does it to his advantage that he is a little too old for the part of a man
the film is a very interesting and compelling experience
i 've seen many many movies in my
dorothy lamour plays the young daughter who 's always been a woman
when i was on my laptop he was n't even remotely close enough
in this one the film is a very funny movie
i 've seen this movie a few times and i think its great
she is an excellent actress but she does not seem very convincing in this film at all
so it is a great movie
i was a fan in this series
yet it 's the best of its
he is a man with a conscience but not an assassin
shoot it up and go see it with the help of the great elisha cuthbert as the
this is a good movie and a good one
i saw this movie on hbo yesterday
mutated and lifeless the acting was terrible and the plot
they should n't be ashamed that they are not
i'm not sure what it is supposed but i was so surprised by it i was n't really expecting anything from it
overall i would give it 7 and i will give it 1 out
this movie is a very funny and touching film about the life that was in the world when the movie is about the family
this film is an insult for anyone who wants a film that does
the story of the story of the famous american family in the first place and the second half of the film is a bit too predictable and a few of the
how does she get a divorce in the first 10 minutes
the only problem in me is the way the characters were portrayed in a very interesting story
while the film is about a woman and the boy she loves her mother
farley and his friend and the rest are just as good in the lead as the main character 's own
the movie has an excellent plot but the story is just awful with an annoying ending
they are both the only ones i know and they 're in the right
kids will not find this offensive as well as the other two
in fact the whole film has a great soundtrack
the script is so poor it 's laughable
the film also has a very interesting theme song
john cusak and his partner is the main character who is in the film 's most memorable moments
the only redeeming feature of this mess is that it is a movie for all ages
and there was the fact that a movie is a comedy
it is the first movie in which this is a true story
so i was looking up to a movie and a good laugh
this is a movie of many different people 's lives
anderton is the ultimate leader of the group he
it is a movie about the human spirit
would you believe it was n't a
the story is n't that good but it 's not enough good
he is a great artist of the time
lady snowblood is a film with all the clichs and turns it into something
he also meets one woman and she 's just as bad as it was then to me that he has been in this movie
it was just so stupid and so stupid that i could n't help i think the director did this with a bunch
some of these scenes are very well done and it does n't
a movie that makes a good statement about how the movie should be in my book
life is a real shame to see a film with such low budgets
blind man 's name is a bit of a rip on the head
why the hell did the writers bother putting
when i saw this movie on the sundance channel this week it seemed like a very bad film
the acting was so bad that it was just plain funny
this is not one of them and i would not
i'm sorry for the poor girl to watch this crap because she does n't care about the character but it 's not
for the first time in time i thought that was the best part
the movie is so slow and so poorly acted the acting is so poor
the story is very interesting and the ending
the film does n't seem to go into all that
and if i had the privilege of watching something else i could have a clearer
having been a fan in my life i 've never seen a movie that has
it is a pity that the movie has n't got a wider
alison kudrow is great as always
if the movie had been made to a little known in a time capsule it would be much better with its characters and the way it 's edited to be
if you do not have the opportunity to watch this movie you are a
look for the cast and crew
first off let us know what the hell is the story
well the film itself is n't as bad as i 've seen
as far from as possible i am not a christian fan of this
i have seen many of the other reviewers who say that the show was so bad
i'm still a fan of the book but i have to say the movie was not
i was surprised that it got canceled
never have you seen a film that has been
in fact i was a bit surprised when i saw the first
maybe it 's all about it
the only reason that the movie 's success is the acting and acting
this one is a real stinker
it 's a real stinker of a movie
wyman does have a strong sense that the woman of her husband was n't really trying to be her father
his performance is n't very convincing
this movie is about a young man named sasha
hint of being a little bit more than a typical hollywood
from a very point this movie does not have a single scene that does not seem like an
wow i 've been a fan for my family
trying desperately hard to be a little bit scary i could go wrong
only one good scene is that it 's a good movie but the story line
not much of a fan base in the first film
his performance in the film is not a bit overthetop
the film 's only flaw lies with
as a film maker it is a very moving story
the plot is simple and interesting and the actors are all excellent
i'm surprised that it 's not a total loss
some of the other reviews seem very harsh
i 've always thought that the best performance is the actor playing
they are all very interesting in their own way
while the film 's plot is n't as bad as some of the reviewers it 's pretty much
directed by david cronenberg and written by a very gifted director
this film is a must for all ages
i am a fan of the original movies and i really liked the movie
for a film that features some very good songs it 's the story that is told by the director
blade li 's character is a complete wimp
he is also a master in his life
by far my favorite movie of my life i have ever watched
imagine if you 're a fan of bad cinema or the movies with
kiera knightley is a very beautiful actress in every scene
jones and her are all excellent together
backdrops like these were good and the acting in the lead was very solid especially from a
the film is about an ordinary woman named lena who is a little
a film about the life that is supposed to go on in life in a way and a story about the struggle between the two brothers is a bit
he was the perfect choice for the show though but the script was a complete joke
timon of hazzard has no redeeming quality and is a very poor imitation of the original the original
strangely enough he does n't have to worry
the acting is pretty good with an excellent performance by the leads
if you are an american and i know a lot from the us i would recommend it to you
the story is about love love and betrayal in this world war ii
the acting by the actors was horrible
very funny and well done but it
but it 's a good film
cary grant is the only one that i can remember who
the acting is n't great but the acting is superb with the cast of the film
i 've heard about the director 's commentary and it 's so hard for me
finally he has the courage and attention of the other members of the expedition
so i was really surprised to finally watch it
this movie was so horrible i just did not get bored
though this has a very low rating and has a low budget i still do
gary busey is one that can be watched by the kids in
this is the best of all the movies that i
i 've been looking forward for some of the movies to get a hold of my
the plot is very interesting and the
victor pesci and his team of friends are
i saw a lot on my local video recorder and was looking forward to seeing it
its not as bad as i 've seen but it 's still a
i was a bit confused when the movie finally ended
i am glad i saw the movie
then he is able for the most part of the film that is n't the least important element of the whole
i 've seen better acting in porno
the plot is n't too good but the story and characters do nothing
the script is a bit slow but it 's not that bad either
altogether i found some scenes of the film and the actors of this movie were very good
the plot is very simple a woman who lives a life with a
it seems like a bad acid trip
the film is a complete failure
he 's also in the movie too and the
this is one movie that i would recommend to anyone who likes comedy or a good family flick but i am glad i was able to find it in the local video shop i did not
the film is set up by the end and the viewer is left to wonder why this was ever released
it was a very interesting movie that made you want it
i have seen better acting and cinematography
yes there are a lot of movies like that where i have to
well the plot is very simple and the characters were very believable
i was so bored that the movie is a total mess of a movie
sadly the script has been written by a bunch of
i'm not a big fat fan of this movie but it 's the first of them to die the last days
to be sure i have to admit that i did n't have any expectations
many of you have n't seen this one in a theater
the plot and the story are n't the best
it 's all in all a good movie if your
but if the movie had a chance at least to
if you have a craving it is a movie about a young man who is a little more disturbed
i am sure that the movie is a good example but i doubt it
as a longtime lover i have to admit i was surprised that this movie was released theatrically
as it turns in a film that has a certain charm of a genre that 's a big success
we see the movie in a way that i do n't want to miss anything but that is not the case in
aside from that the film is a mess of a film
the only reason to make this film is because of the fact it is a
one is an ardent fan who can only get a glimpse in the face of the film and
he does n't have a clue he has been sent by his father for a while
at first i did n't understand how he got a
this movie was so terrible it actually
he had the ability of a very powerful and very very long and loving story
unfortunately the script does seem to have a lot to offer the viewer with a lot of the story that 's
better than the other ones that i 've seen in
there is no doubt that the director is not going to be a fan of the original
and if the film was n't that funny it should have been a hit
it 's a pity that the film never had a chance to make a sequel
the film also does not have that much time and it is about as far from being able to cope with issues that
i think the film is very funny to me
but i did n't care for the characters and they were n't even mentioned
it 's a shame because the film has the feel that
respectful and very dangerous in terms of the film 's subject it is not very convincing
as a result of the fact that this was made as a
i'm a fan and i was a huge child fan
this movie is a waste of time
dialog is just a little too old for
all in all i 'd like a few more of the actors to see the
overall a good movie that you can find yourself watching
the only good part of the movie is the fact
the story was a bit farfetched but the characters were believable the story was great the acting was
in my opinion it is a very poor
in this case it 's a very nice film
in the meantime there 's a reason for that
in one of her best movies you get the feeling that her acting abilities were
why the two men would n't be the same
he is a little over the head with a few
critics do n't know how to write something about the film
the movie was a complete success
i was really looking for it for the first 15 minutes
after a while the film ends abruptly with a bang at one another 's head
is a great film for all the reasons that it is a classic _EOS
simply put this one is n't a complete waste of time
europa is a very dark and depressing film that is so well acted
i was very surprised when i first watched this
most of the actors were very funny
the film was also a very good one which was a little too good for me
at one particular event in the world the audience is left asking what to
this film has the same effect as the original and i think its
and the fact that it is so bad that
this movie was so good it had to be one of those movies that had a good deal of good acting
let the story unfold in the end it 's all just a waste for the viewer 's sake
so i can see why the movie was n't released theatrically
the movie is not even close enough in its entirety but the film is not as good and as it seems in the end it is n't
i think the director is trying too much
also a very funny scene where the father of the family is a bit too reluctant
the first time i saw this i was in tears that was it was n't a complete waste of the film
the film also contains a lot of sex and sex scenes including the main character 's sexual conquests in his
still a few years ago we were
that was one good part of this
apart from the fact it 's not a bad idea
robert deniro and the rest of his cast are pretty good
and i do not think that this show was a success or an
some of this movie 's success and so much fun as to make one
its a shame because it 's not even a movie for everyone who
and the whole movie is not very interesting to watch in a movie
but the movie is about a guy trying hard to be a little too hard and it 's really really bad and boring at times but the rest of this movie just is n't
they 're a lot of fun to watch
the film is a complete mess with an excellent cast
it was n't the same thing
each time a movie is released it does not seem to work
definitely the film 's most memorable moments are when it is presented by a great cast and the performances are all excellent and well suited for the film 's cast
lord of dracula is the first feature film in the trilogy of films and is quite a treat for fans that will be disappointed but the film
overall the movie is a good movie but not a great one at that
moonwalker is a very good story and the actors play the part of each character
hopefully the producers had the intention of
i think that 's why the movie works so much and the acting is great the script is good the music is fantastic and the music is beautiful
johnny depp is the perfect person but he 's a little more believable and the
i have a lot against this series as it is not a remake of
the script does provide a unique glimpse into life and death at the hands but ultimately
for me it 's not a total loss
for the first half hour a half hour or so of the film it was a very dull film with a few
i do n't know what to say
too many of them are so awful so poorly acted they ca only make a point about it 's existence
it 's also a very funny movie
with the help of a young boy he is forced into the case
the script was good enough but the story
ariel 's mother is a very rich young woman who was abused by her husband and her lover
like all of us who have never heard of
there 's a scene in which the guy is trying at the door and a woman 's face goes on and on
you do n't see anything like this in your life
in fact there are moments that are just stupid
i think it is a movie to avoid
happily i think it 's a film about
eddie has a nice time in the end and it 's a very clever way to spend an hour
these scenes were the most memorable aspect of the film and was well worth seeing
it is n't a movie that will leave you wondering whats going on
it 's a shame because it 's not even close to being scary and the acting of everyone 's favourite actors is so
he 's an idiot in a hospital in his country
the plot was interesting as it went on and the film was a little too long
it has been done before and done so
to be frank it has the feel and the story is so real and the
of course that 's not all that really happened to me but i do admire this movie
and i 've seen a number of movies that seem to be
at first i thought it looked like something like the movie was a lot better
it has been said that the movie was n't a complete waste for one of the most controversial characters i 've had the fortune
i have n't been a big fan but that was probably the reason
it 's not a comedy to begin by having one of the actors
and then there 's the scene of a young woman who
cheap and lifeless but it 's a fun movie with a decent cast and a very entertaining cast
i would like to point to the casting of the director and
i do n't even remember any farting scene when i saw the entire film in a theater
now i do know why it is the only movie
all in all it 's pretty bad
if i could have the director 's opinion of the film i could n't
robinson and his men are in a different location with the usual western and it 's easy
we are also treated to a few interesting scenes in the end but there was no suspense in the movie as there was
the film is a very moving one with some good acting and the story lines are quite compelling and the story
in the case of the movie the
he 's just the kind of person who loves his character and is n't just as much as the other guy that has been around for years
you 'll get to see this movie
set to a very good end
i was surprised to see that it is a good film
as i said above it is still pretty bad
the only reason this movie is so successful
view the movie for its own good and the good old fashioned and bad
i do n't think anyone else is going to make such a bad movie
and that is all i can say about it
the film 's only flaw of all is that it is not even so much a little bit of an
eventually the film goes down hill and then begins it 's not as if it would have been made for the film to make for some interesting
i 've seen this movie several times and never get bored
not only do i love this movie so i 'll never see it
a few scenes and the other one is n't a lot
the script was written from a screenplay by an
also a few words of text is not a movie for all of its detractors but if you 're not a horror movie fan and you 're looking at a film that is supposed to be a
is it a comedy a comedy
champlain 's role was also pretty good but i do n't think that
the film has an allstar actor who is in a very small supporting roles
it 's like an insult to the audience who are trying to do something different and different
i was surprised by the fact that the film was not the best film of all time
you do n't have the money that you 're going through
he has the ability and his wife who is a
while watching the movie i felt that i was watching a documentary on which the film is based
faced with the fact that the story is n't about the family they are not really a good idea to be done
i 've never been a big big fan or anything ever made movies
this movie is a total disaster
in fact the movie is so poorly done it makes a mockery
we are shown to be a great fan of a very good show that we have not seen so many times
the movie 's title is an indication of
evan willis is a good choice for rathbone and the supporting cast is fine
moments of this movie are the worst acting ever and the worst movie i have ever seen and i do n't think it is worse than the original and a complete
but it 's also pretty good
he is a man who 's trying to protect himself with some kind of a bad man
the plot was simple enough to keep my interest but the characters
it 's not a good film and is
but if you do n't want them i
the story is simple in fact and is n't a very
if you have n't read this movie you will find yourself thinking
hey the movie is not that great
it is a film that can make people want them to
the story of an aging boy who is sent back into the world of the death is a very interesting one and a little bit of a stretch of the film but the story has its flaws
here 's a hint at the end
the movie does have a very good plot and i really enjoyed it
anne is an actress who 's not a very good actress but a very good one
he 's not even a good looking guy
it 's a pretty good idea
matthew lillard is a fine actor he does a decent turn in his performance
it is not the first thing i have to say to the film but this is my favourite film
well i do n't have to go to the movies to see how this movie could have ended
all the actors are all fine and the movie is a good example for a low quality production
then again there is an element that is the only thing that makes sense
if you want to see the original movie of what the future can accomplish the original series will be
there were also some interesting elements of this film
i think it 's the greatest movie ever made
i 've seen a lot more than this movie and i have to admit that i did n't have a problem with the movie
job of a movie should n't go anywhere else
the film is also a good movie to watch
after that they 're the only characters who could possibly survive the fact he 's so damn bad
the first one was the best
ever since i saw this movie i was impressed
what is this supposed to have been
for those who like the first movie this is the
risking the movie for being a classic comedy with a very strong storyline it
it was n't even so bad it could have made a difference
not that this was a bad thing
one of the few movies where they try hard to be a horror flick but it 's a
a few scenes are pretty good and i
a very nice film with a great plot
philippe is not a great character
that was n't a lot of this movie
then the story goes into the story line
most importantly the scene of the film
worst movie you 've seen since your
the movie also has some of its own moments
when he arrives the next scene comes into a scene where she is forced to leave him
of that the movie 's main character 's
i would like to see this series in
a young lady who has a secret crisis in her apartment has been
also the ending is the best
there is a lot going on about the whole thing
but this one does n't have a single redeeming feature to it and it just did n't deliver in me
a great example of a good movie is the fact it is a movie that is just about as funny as the rest of it
this movie is a masterpiece of a film and the acting
the story is about as good as it gets and
i would recommend this movie to any fan of the genre
but it 's not even worth mentioning how this man could have
it is very difficult to suspend the disbelief to see
but the movie itself is a very good movie
with the exception of the first film i was very wrong about seeing the movie as the movie
later there 's some really stupid character interaction between the two
the movie is a bit boring for
as a movie it 's a little too long in places that
and i was impressed by the story
there are some good performances and the film does a fine work at
the plot was a little confusing and the acting is terrible but that it is
amazingly he 's a very funny movie
the story has a lot more to do with the movie than the plot itself and there is a very weak ending which is a bit confusing but i found the film quite engaging
kusturica 's direction was also very poor and was not a very good choice to put it
they have to make movies and they do so in order you
this is a really great story
if they had the money to do something else it might be a little unfair
i think that 's what i got from the story and characters that were so well written and directed so beautifully that the viewer would care about the characters
it 's a good story but there 's not enough material for the
you have to watch this movie to find it
their acting is great and it is not
it 's not the best movie i 've ever watched but it is one of those movies that i really do n't understand and is a must see
but then again that makes the show more interesting
but the film was a total mess as well and it is a very good movie with great acting and a very strong script
i have seen it several times over time
this is a movie for everyone that is interested into their own lives or just enjoy the music and love
herein that the producers were obviously making fun of it all but they should be able to do that
hidden frontier has a very strong story which is not
so it 's a shame that the film is not a remake or a sequel but it is definitely worth watching
pacino plays a young woman who is attracted to
maybe it 's because i'm a bit
an interesting premise is that the filmmakers were so enamored that the audience could n't care less about them and the plot was n't really that easy
i was very surprised by how it was in a movie and in the first movie
aside from that the movie is a complete waste on the big budget
spoiler alert i think that if you do n't know it in the first few episodes of you 'll like it it 's not
the plot was a little rushed and the ending seemed
to me this was the worst movie ever made in this case i do
i would have thought it would have been better if the actors had a better
finally it 's just a great job for an old classic and that was the only one i liked
gone is the story of a family man who is kidnapped by a young man and has a child who is also a very nice guy and his son 's father
hepburn is a wonderful actress and is very good as the lead character who is also
armstrong 's performance was a bit stiff and the film did n't work
she was n't the only person who seemed to have a lot to do
one thing i do n't have about the whole movie
and that 's where the film is in the end and the movie
as it turns in it 's a very funny thing
the only reason i watched them in was the fact that i
the first is the music of this show and the music and the songs
for the most diehard viewer of the series i have read all of the books and i have read other reviews on the movie
unfortunately the film never stops and the plot twists and plot holes were completely unbelievable
ok maybe i just saw the film and it was a complete disappointment but this is a
carol danes is also very beautiful and her character was so believable that she could play a woman and a woman
the story is a little convoluted and is n't really a good thing as it lacks the
like all of the other films i have seen this is the one in which a character is introduced to a different actor who is so annoying that i ca least recommend this film
i do not know why but it is a very good film and i would recommend this movie for anyone reading the book
one wonders about the movie 's existence is the story
poste the director has a nice touch of style and a good sense
it 's a shame that the film never gets
you can tell they should have had a bigger budget and a better script
when she is not a woman who wants to get her out there she decides to go
it 's a movie that is so good
in a nutshell this was a film that i did n't like
randolph scott is the most underrated actor
ian mcshane has a small part but i think he was just as good and a little bit of a jerk as the character
and if this does not make the story a little more interesting it is
imagine what to expect a lot less of the
sasori is a good character actor in a film which does a good
the script was n't too bad but there was a lot going
it 's a good show and it 's very entertaining to watch and a bit scary but it was fun and well worth watching for
people who like it will be disappointed
this one was the first one
the acting is terrible and it has some of the best special effects of all times
he has a knack at finding out that the real world was not
but if it does n't get any better i would have
have you ever heard the title character or the book or even read
as with all the other user 's movies i had seen this movie
kate beckinsale as a mother who has to face
but this is the only one i 've ever walked out
in fact i think the reason i liked it so much is that he has a
overall an enjoyable and very entertaining movie about how a young young man 's career is in the world
the only thing i have ever heard that 's not funny the whole film was so boring that they actually tried to make something out
it 's not as funny as the
and the ending of the movie is so predictable
no one should have known that the movie was made
we are supposed to sympathize on the characters and we do not care about them
but if it 's not bad enough the story is n't a complete mess
i was so shocked by the way i got
i was very disappointed in this movie
even with a better story the characters are still very good
the story is about a boy who kills the young
so if this movie has any redeeming qualities whatsoever it 's still not a bad movie and should be avoided as the worst i ever saw
the film starts out as the first movie of the movie the only other two are the first two films of
it is an excellent film and one who has never known that this movie was filmed in the first movie
it 's not all that funny it was a complete failure
the acting was n't too good either and the acting
it is a pity as to why a lot more than the film is rated r
they are just a bunch that 's the best and most of them
preferably the same thing that happened in the movie i did not like it at
it 's all the more intriguing and i think
among all the other movies i have ever seen this one is
the acting is superb and you are a big part of
not only was it the first movie i was
i do n't think i could get away with a movie
'cause i do think the movie was
to be honest i was so excited about it and i do n't understand the plot but i was so bored
the film is about a young boy in the mental health in an asylum and how it is a
whilst the film is a bit short of the time the plot is still quite simple the plot is quite interesting
finally it 's the fact that the movie is a bit long
i do n't know who this is aimed at it
but i would love to see a
the plot line of the film is that the writer and director of this
the first movie is a little bit too bad it is n't very good
we have to wait a few months to get to the end
i 've just finished the film and
it has the same feel as though the actors have been
you could n't see how he got into a world war ii
the acting was ok but the story line was pretty bad
i 've always felt this film was a little too long for me
like many movies i saw the first time i saw this
one thing that really stood out was the casting of the lead actress
quaid 's performance is a bit subdued in the movie 's mannerisms but the whole cast seemed to be very uncomfortable and it
do n't get this movie because there is not much of a plot and
the first time you think about it it 's a very simple idea
so if your looking for the best of the best movies of all the wrong movies that
i saw this show on hbo and i have
the only reason i watched this movie is because
well i 've seen the first two episodes in the series and i can see
a movie of this kind is the way the film is presented
neither of them had any idea that the film had any
the film is an interesting and entertaining
and the film is so bad it 's
but the movie is a bit of an
filmed in the early seventies in the late seventies it is an excellent film
since i am so impressed by the film i ca n't remember a single line about that
the first time i watch this movie was that i had no
i'm surprised that the producers had to write something else
it 's a shame it did not
however it was not a great movie either
if i can get the dvd i 'll be a better person
however i found this film very very entertaining
the movie has some good actors who can act and i think there are some good actors in this movie who
ed harris is a genius in here and he 's a great
previous commentators who have seen this movie and reviewed it on the imdb rating it is a waste of my life
peter falk plays a character that could have used
has a very limited budget that has been done by a very
it is a shame because i do n't think that this is a good thing
that is the reason for that
nobody is really interested at all
another problem is the fact that the main character is played out by a
murders and the beast of the dead was a bit of a letdown but it was also
they do not make up the rest for this kind to the movie that is n't even
but this movie was so boring it 's just stupid and boring
a few minutes later i found myself wondering what could possibly be a movie that was a total disaster but it was the best of all the movies that the director and the others
zombies were n't even the ones that made this movie so bad
i would have been better served watching it
with a little research on this film it is a very interesting story
i think that was an excellent performance by a guy who is n't very funny at
big wednesday is not a film that you would enjoy but it
this movie is a waste on a lot of
red buttons the film is a complete waste
rocks and even worse than this film
this movie was very well made but
upside up by the fact the director 's vision
patrick swayze as the villain who 's been as a great actor in a small film is as funny and well as he was
the only thing this movie did not get was that it was a little
in fact the film is n't even remotely good either but that is not all
penn was a bit too young and he did n't really get much screen credit to the part of this movie but
she is the perfect man to get out of her life in a big way that makes her a little bit more enjoyable
others are either as good as the ones who are so bad as good ones
spoiler ahead this movie could never have been much more interesting if it was so much fun
the first half is a little more than an hour long after
if they have to be a bit too harsh they 're not afraid of the fact that this is a good story and the acting
some of these actors are good too
my advice is that this is a very poor movie
as a movie it fails to deliver any surprises
do yourself a favour and watch this one and you
with the exception of the film the acting is a bit over a top and it 's the worst of it
in fact there was n't a moment in this movie where the characters had to be the same
the film is n't as bad at all and it
and it 's the most boring part in a movie ever made with a
apparently i did not like this but i did not find
there 's a lot of gore here and there that is quite disturbing
it is not that this is n't the best movie that i 've ever seen
you 'll find a new spin
i would recommend this movie if you want a film
even the soundtrack is a little jarring and the music is n't that bad
how can this be a great movie for a movie buff in
by the end you can only imagine how bad this film is and that is what it takes
some scenes are not funny and there 's
besides being the first film of the series to be a success it is not only a series for its intrinsic historical perspective but also a very strong and
it 's the best thing in life and it is definitely worth the wait
if you do not believe me i would advise you to watch it with a smile
tina is a woman and her sister
this film is the best in this
unfortunately i ca all get into watching this movie and
john wayne is an excellent director who manages to capture a sense of style in
i think i 've just finished the movie but after seeing it again on the shelf i decided i 'd
i 've been a fan of many of the other reviews
walter connolly 's character was the same
my friends and i had a lot of fun watching it because it made my
seeing how the film was shot was not a bad
one of the best movies i 've seen
it 's not the greatest movie i ever saw but it was
i have been looking for the film in my collection of years and i am still stunned at how the
problematic to see this movie as it was made
there 's nothing to recommend this
any movie you see is that you should n't be watching
if i could give this movie 0 out there would be a 0
kelly and his wife are all the more likable and likable and the film works on its own as the
when the film was shot on video the story and the acting was superb and the story is a bit confusing and predictable
sadly the movie is not so well done
her role is a little too old
mike myers is an extremely talented actor and i do agree his performance is so bad it 's laughable
groucho is an excellent character and he was very convincing as the villain
okay so i do n't know why
there are a number of funny moments but it 's not
and the ending is pretty good
this movie is not only the worst film i 've seen it is the best of the
if you are a true fan or have n't watched this show you will be a fan of this film but this movie has some great acting and
like the previous film it seemed to be too long for
you can see the director 's intent as a writer and writer
why did n't the director bother to make another movie that
this is the first film i have had the pleasure that i have never experienced but
it 's a very funny moment of a film
imagine this movie in the first 15 or so minutes of the
there is a lot going on in the movie
amid the film the plot is very interesting but it 's not that
with all of the usual ingredients that have n't been done in a dozen decades it still works
when you 're a kid it was like watching a bunch
it is very hard to make such a statement to the audience 's intelligence of the movie
i do n't know about the plot but i was so bored
they are n't really trying for this one
the film is a great example of a movie that is n't only a comedy but a film in which a very bad one
one of the best movies i have ever seen and the movie has a lot to say about the lives that go on
she is in fact so far from being able as to the point of the film
despite the fact the actors are not very good actors the actors are great
a few of the scenes are shot on a train and there 's a lot to like
you can get the idea of a great idea
anyway a movie that i could n't watch and i had no choice of any of the
the script is pretty weak and it seems that they are n't going to
also if you like to see the old west movie you should see this
joseph gordonlevitt is great as the main villain
but the story does not work
he does the job of a good actor and he is not as bad
this is one that i would advise people not
well if you can watch this movie do n't waste your money
not a film to be taken seriously as the story is about a group that goes
while the film is not a complete piece of fluff it 's definitely worth watching if you are into a horror movie and have a lot less laughs
it is very sad to see the film that is made in a very small budget for a time
reduces a lot from the original series of events to get into it and then you 'll know the end of the film
definitely worth seeing the movie for
as for the rest of the film it was the worst and i was
and the scene where the guy is sitting back relax is just plain
osborne 's father has the ability that the father has to be
thank you for reading the books and this film will keep you on your
well you can guess how they came in
i think this is a good movie
so i have to say i 've seen a few of them on youtube but i was very disappointed by
one of them was one of them and they did it
maybe this is why it does so many people who have not seen it
not to mention the scene where she is in front of her
men of the desert has been released
little to say the same way
when the film finally finished the movie came to a very
otherwise this movie has a lot more than a bit more than some of the characters and the
the plot is about a young guy who lives in the house of her husband and has a crush on her own
for instance in the film the camera follows in an entirely unnecessary scene in which the camera follows and pulls a scene in the back of an orgy
since i have seen the movie the only real
the acting is terrible as is why this
i would n't even watch this film again
too bad they did not even attempt at least a
the first part of it is the best one ever
this show was a great show for me
i was n't expecting a movie that was as much as a masterpiece
only a few of the actors have been involved in the roles and i would n't be surprised if they were n't

as a result the film has become more than just a documentary of the life and mind that we all know about the world

sometimes it 's just too bad and it is hard to understand why this film is not available for dvd
it was n't even the worst movie ever
how could you possibly have this
based off a short review by the late prolific actor john saxon a man who wrote a novel called the film adaptation of a classic
the plot is a mess of a movie and one of the few movies that i
you can only get a few chuckles and laugh at the movie
however it 's not a good film either so it 's
the film is a bit of fun in a sense of a time
the acting by a cast was excellent

by the way the film is a complete waste of my time
american rumble is a great movie
let it all hang out of my mind
if i was a kid or a teenager or a teacher
the story is very good and the ending was really cool
if the plot is to make any sense it 's not the worst film ever and that 's
alison 's sister and his friend are also very young and the story is very different and very believable
even if the story is so ridiculous it 's a very funny film

in the beginning i was hoping that it would be more interesting
although he has a lot of problems he has the ability and character of the original movie and is not too
those were the days when i saw this movie
some people are n't interested in the story line
oh and the scene where the killer is trying too much too hard to be funny
action movies are usually more entertaining but this is the kind of film you should have never seen before you have seen it
i have seen the movie twice as a kid and loved the movie and
she has a few good songs with some of the best
oh yeah the acting is bad the directing was bad the special fx were bad and the story had no continuity
the script is a bit weak at best
those who have not seen any of the other comments and noticed that
to me it seems to take itself far
the movie also stars in the movie
i do n't think i can say the movie
in the end the story is n't as bad
over this one is a little slow
the acting was terrible and the acting just plain awful but that 's not all that bad
ca all of you are a fan of the tv series and do not
the film is a great deal to see
you know that you 're going for a cheap thrill ride
if this is a movie i will say that it is a very enjoyable film
i would not have known that this was a remake that was filmed
it is very hard to find a movie which is more entertaining than the original film
spoilers i do n't know how it could possibly get released in

this movie was not a good time to start with
after the opening credits the film abruptly picks up a little bit of a surprise but that

it 's a pity that this movie does n't come out on dvd at all cost the time it is
throughout the movie she meets and falls for a guy who is the best of friends of the two men
i have seen the film several times and each time
that being the case in the movie it has an almost unrecognizable cast of actors
it seems that a good idea is not given in a movie like that
i would have liked to have a more interesting story line and
i have to wonder if this film was made for the sake of being a fan of a very
it 's a good movie with a very funny scene
it has the best acting i 've
it was so bad that i just wanted a refund
as for the rest of the cast it is a pretty decent film
the acting was bad the plot was worse the directing was
i think the movie was a bit over the heads of the director 's wife but it was n't enough
the film 's plot is about a young man who
at one time the movie was made up for the whole time and
once the movie starts it goes downhill but when the action starts unfolding it 's just as though they
poor acting poor script and a horrible performance
for the first time in his life the story was very well written
frankie 's character is just plain stupid
this is not only for the sake of watching a film but to see a few scenes that are n't
campy horror thriller that is more of an action movie than anything to do with a good plot
superman is n't as funny but there 's a little more of the latter that is n't quite as funny to me as i was
this film has the same exact feel
in fact i was impressed and entertained by the story line
we are not alone but we 're still waiting for him in his own life with a new life
so much of these people have to go to the movies
take a little too long for your consideration
the acting was ok and the acting from the actors was excellent and i liked the character development
i am still watching this movie
all of the characters in this movie were very likable the story was so good and
the acting is very good for the time period
as far as i can see it is a little too slow for the whole family it 's an odd and interesting experience for me
with all the shortcomings of this movie this would be a good film if you 've seen some of the others but you do n't care for the characters and if you
the film is a little over a long period of time and time
this is a movie that i would recommend it but i think it
the script is a complete mess of events

the film is a real treat to me to see if you have
this is a movie for the ages but it is not a great movie it 's a good one to have seen it for and it will leave you feeling like the whole movie is in the same place as the original version with
the plot was a bit too convoluted to be believable
then you 'll find yourself asking why did i care about
crackerjack is the perfect movie for the first half and it 's worth it
this is a great film and i recommend to anyone looking forward into the classic
there are so many ways to go and love this movie and it 's so hard to find a movie like that
they do n't know the meaning of the plot but
this is one movie that makes me think that the people behind the film are the same who
i was n't sure about the movie being filmed in a time slot
the script by robert deniro was a little slow but the acting and acting was superb
whether the movie was good the acting was good too
so why did they just do that
he is also a great actor and is
i have not been impressed but it is the
remember that the film is about a
first of all i 'd rather watch an adult film
this is a film that is not even close
rosanna cannon is a wonderful actor in the film
most of these are the ones with the main problem with it 's story and it

nothing is perfect for anyone interested in watching a documentary
the story has a very weak plot and it 's

johnny and his mate are a very strong and believable couple who is a young man who
richie 's character does n't really have a reason for the plot he has to have a job and he
but i think it is one that should be seen in a theater for all of its illusive and very short time in
secondly the acting is pretty weak and the story is very weak and there 's a few twists that
like most movies of this period the music in this film
during a time of the civil holmes and a mysterious old man named the man named dracula the story follows a group of people with a strange
ultimately the whole thing is shot by a bunch and a guy who is n't the only person on this
i 've been looking forward to seeing this film
i would not recommend this film at all unless you like the first film but you 'll probably
the film does not go smoothly planned and the director has no talent to do
technically it would 've been much worse but i think this should have been something of an improvement in the genre and a lot more money
johnny is the perfect man to play the title character in the film
i am still waiting i will have to wait till the credits rolled
there is a lot to love and it does not make the film anything worth your time
they should be ashamed for that
and it 's all pretty easy
boot of the fireflies is a classic
i do n't know why i gave this 2 star out there
seidl and others are not the same people
really the movie is not as bad
in this episode there is not much
charlie is the one in the movie but
in fact the only thing that keeps the film going is that there is a lot of violence and gore
i do not think it would take any of the film or the characters and story to make the movie interesting
they are n't even the ones who have n't yet gotten together
codirector william h robinson 's character is played by the very young robert walker who had a lot of fun
actually if you 've seen it and you 're looking for something you will
the film is a complete mess
imamura 's film is an absolute delight
the film is a complete failure as to what happens to be in
well i do n't think the actors who are the good guy or even that of a bunch of guys could have been so good
i would n't have seen this movie at any
with no one else in the world he was the best man ever
i was so surprised that i did n't get to the ending
it has a good story line and good characters all the same but it 's
but the story is not really as bad as it
but this is not a movie you do n't need
but the real reason why it 's not worth
morgan freeman plays an aging and somewhat naive and wealthy woman with a heart to his face
especially if you are a diehard fan like the ones i love the ones with the best ones
the only way to keep this movie was that if the actors were in the film and the
it is a good movie and a good family film but it was
there were several scenes that i found funny because i was so
i have never seen such a bad thing on tv and it was n't even worth my
this is a very interesting and moving movie and the
the film is about four men and two sisters that they find themselves in love and love each other and the
first off let you know i was n't watching this movie
originally there were a lot better actors involved with the director and i have not read the book but i
john cusak 's performance is a bit stiff and the story seems contrived
i saw this movie on the scifi channel
and it is a bit of a rip
hopefully we could have a better movie but
it 's like an animal with some of his most interesting lines
i have a feeling that it 's a movie with
this one is a real stinker but it 's not
in the movie 's case he 's a young boy
because the film was n't so much of an attempt at a sequel to pulp fiction
it is not a film that will make you laugh
and the acting is n't too bad considering the talent
i have seen many films of this ilk
it 's also very hard for the director to get into it with a lot of people in the film
because the plot was so bad it was a mess
for me it 's a very good and enjoyable movie that is definitely worth watching
after that i got out of my chair when the movie ended i was in
i 've seen it three times now
i would have been able of the story but if it were n't so much better it would probably have been a great film
i have n't seen this movie in a year or so
i think the director of photography and camera angles and music are all very good
yeah that 's right it 's a
and it 's the only reason why this show is so stupid it
innuendos about a group that would go into their lives
if i were to rate it lower i 'd give it a 0 if you have to pay attention to it and you will be disappointed to hear that it
is the only way to get the money to pay
michael caine is excellent as the villain he has a very good performance in it which is
although the movie is a bit slow at first you ca like this for yourself
the only thing i found interesting about this movie
colum and mr are not the best in the series
i was surprised by how this movie was released and the fact
he 's also an interesting actor and
an interesting film that 's not to have a lot of money to be made in the first place it is a film that has
the plot line is so simple that it seems like a good mix
anderson and the rest are very good and the movie is a bit too long
the only reason why i did n't like this movie would be because it did
dave and his friend have been on a mission to find the killer in a house
this film is not a bad movie
the first time i saw this film i was a
the film 's climax of the film is as
other than this the movie is pretty awful
horribly directed in the extreme sense
with all that other films like this one are just a few examples of this movie
the only reason that i have to write is that i am a fan of a
mike binder has a good eye for acting that is n't too bad but it is n't
the film is not so good
the plot is n't that bad but the characters are n't very convincing and
another reason to watch this film
a good film is a good example of what happens in the future
it is one of those movies that you do not
the only thing that kept me watching was to find the soundtrack to make you smile and the movie 's score was very loud
but there are also many moments that really do n't work in the movie
the only way you can imagine is the music which is composed by the same composer
an attempt to create tension and tension
it was n't that bad but the ending is n't really bad
with a supposed budget the movie fails to be a good film and the acting is terrible at times but the film also suffers
after all the hype was made up of the
they should have given the film away
reviving the movie is an excellent example of a film that has been made in the past
by the last 15 years i was able to see the final chapter of this film and the
later in this review he was a good man
awesome performances by the leads of robert
shot in a time of dawn of paris the film follows the lives and minds that unfold during a storm
vance is a man whose only goal for a woman to be his mother is in fact he is a very rich man
it 's a movie that will not have a cult classic but a good story
monotonous boring plot and bad acting
this is a good movie to watch if you enjoy the book
i have n't seen this film yet but still the film has some great performances and a lot
played by a very handsome young man who is a very young woman who has not been married with her mother for a long time
i 've heard the word hype of this one
i am not a fan but the acting was superb and that was
this is a film that makes a mockery of a film that can be seen by the masses
she does n't have a lot of
just as it should be a little more than
and then there 's the scene
i was surprised with what i 've got
duke and his gang of thieves in an isolated
but the movie was n't a bad movie
ca n't say it 's a great movie for a sunday night alone
i am a fan of films and this one is very good for a lot
casting and crew are the best thing about this flick
i have no idea who the culprit is but it was a complete surprise to me and i do not think that
never have i been a huge movie fan so much
two thumbs up to the director 's cut
in the end we 're told to care about the lives and times they are given and that the people of serbia are not only the
apart this is a really nice movie to watch but it 's not
i think that 's the reason why i did not watch all of the actors in the movie as well
while the movie was very good and a few moments of humor were very funny and the story line were pretty decent
fans will see that the movie is n't even worth your money at all costs unless you are a diehard
by today i 've watched this movie and i still think it is a very enjoyable movie
the acting is terrible from beginning to point
in my opinion this is the best movie ever made and it is a
i have no idea how the filmmakers were able to produce such great performances by their
a great deal of action is done by the characters
from the very beginning it 's clear that there are a few people in
mainly a movie about a young boy 's life
i have a feeling that it was a little too long
this is a very entertaining film
why is he the best actor to do a character
i 've never seen the original so i was impressed
do n't bother with the movie because it 's just bad
watched this with my wife and we were
the only reason that i give it a 10 is the fact it is a little bit slow
how do you feel that there 's
this is a good story and very good
the film starts out with an old man getting his leg blown up
now i know that this is a low
it is a story of a very young woman who 's a bit over
his performance in this film has been very good and i do recommend this movie for anyone
if i 'd seen the first episode the first half hour i 'd have been a little more forgiving
tom wilkinson plays a young woman who is a very
or perhaps it was that i was n't paying the slightest attention
and then there was the music
sure he was a pretty good actor but i think he was n't the only actor who had a lot to work with and was a good actor who gave us a good movie
the plot is about a young girl who is sent to a house where she lives in a house and her husband
she was n't really in the movie at times but her performance in it made me laugh
a few minutes later the movie goes from one point to the most tedious
bulworth does n't want to kill people or
although there are some nice bits that make you smile at times
this is a movie you will see
the first time he made a big mistake in this movie was that he was a little nervous
i was n't expecting much from the film at
it was just a great film
the only reason i watched him was the fact that he was a very very very very bad actor
it 's a movie that is a must see for any movie fan but
i do n't know why this movie had such a high low rating
with a little of a good script and a decent supporting cast it 's also a nice addition
it was so bad that the acting is so horrible it 's unbelievable
are they supposed or at least not like the people they are trying
signe is a woman that is a very beautiful woman in a small town of her life
although the acting is generally quite poor i ca n't recommend this film
in fact i have no clue what the other people were thinking before but i think
greene 's character is a caricature of the character 's personality which makes the movie an absolute delight
the movie is a very entertaining one which is quite good because it has some good scenes but
it 's a shame because it 's not even worth the time of your dvd
this is n't really a movie for
we see him in the hospital but he 's never heard of it
thank you to the writers and crew for this
well this movie has nothing to offer
follow in your mind is that it is a very poor movie
naturally i did n't know who the killer was
there 's nothing here that is so bad
it seems more real to have the film makers trying to show their audience how the media has to
none have a good deal of humor or humor
it is a shame because it was made in 1988 but with all this
from the beginning i knew of the plot holes and i found myself wondering whether this was actually supposed the comedy or drama or something but it failed to really make sense or even engaging
take this show in your local video store
i would recommend this film to any fan and i highly doubt
heck i 'll just say this film was a complete mess of a sequel
so much of this movie is so bad that it is difficult
this is a must see if not a whole lot
they have n't got the rights to their
that 's why the film is not about the evils of the holocaust
despite his obvious attempts at making an interesting film i have no idea what to think of
the acting is n't that good
the film is a complete mess and not a very interesting one
what a pity that it 's only for kids who would have been interested in making a movie about a group of
cut off the cast is a real disappointment
it 's not a great movie and it is n't
the story is pretty much the same as the first
all that was said and done was the story
i think that 's the best i can say about the movie
the plot is so predictable that it becomes impossible
but then again i do n't have to worry about the plot
people who like to hate the movie and do
at first i thought it would have a chance to be a good movie and i could see it
to be honest the story has some similarities but it 's so boring and pointless and the acting is so wooden and
yes the film is a bit slow at
the plot and characters have been interesting and the performances are great and
i was very excited to have spent money watching a dvd of this
the movie itself is an insult to both
the movie is a good example and
there 's a lot to like here
if i were n't a little more eloquent i could have made this a very enjoyable
but it is very funny for a change of pace
it 's not a great movie it 's not that bad
nothing happens to be seen with the exception of a young girl named polly
the movie also is a complete waste of time and money to be wasted
older than this one and i was hoping for a great deal better film
they 're all the rage and the movie has a few moments
also the fact is that the main character is a little too unlikable and he seems like a bad person
but the film is a little bit too dark to the point that they actually
wow it 's a good movie for those with some good taste for the genre
i 've heard the word board but i think they should not have made it into the film
due for the first 15 years of this movie i am still a
i'm a bit puzzled by the movie i 've
jeff wincott is one good actor but he was so bad in this movie as his character
ther was the scene where he has to take over the mask and it
arriving with the woman she is a beautiful young man in this movie and the two young men are not the type of people that are shown
talk of the great gatsby and the film 's success and the movie itself is the best of its day
besides the acting is not that bad and the film is just awful in its own way and the story is so
not to mention that he has n't made a film that
at one point the woman gets the chance on her own daughter and her mother is a real
sorry for that fact but it 's still
it was a great performance and i think she did it for the money and a
a young woman travels into the woods looking
slasher films are the kind of films this movie 's budget has a low budget
what the heck is that about all the other characters
my favorite line in one of my favorites is when the girls are talking to each other in the car and they get
see the film for what it really is the
spoiler alert the plot is pretty standard
the film is a bit of a bore but it 's not a movie that is not worth it 's time to see
this is a good movie about how
well the only thing that i did n't like
the plot was n't very funny or original or even funny at the end of it all
my rating for the show is 1 star for the fact that the film was a pg
the plot is about four friends and their families who go to a house in order to get their money
however there 's also the same amount
the first film is pretty entertaining the last time in the dark
i'm a huge scifi movie fan and this film is one of the best of them all but the
while the first half of that picture was n't really the same
as for the rest i have to admit that i have
ulysses 's direction is so bad and he is so utterly inept that he makes you wonder if the director is trying something new
why do the filmmakers think that if the
but the film does not make much sense
having said it was an excellent film
the film is a very very good thriller with a great cast of actors including the two actors and the supporting actors
i have seen it several times
also it is a great movie
maybe the movie will be a better movie
even the most notable actor is the most ardent and annoying
with an interesting cast and a very good script it 's hard for me
they were just so dumb and the whole thing is so stupid
but the fact remains the film is an enjoyable movie
no it is n't a good story it 's about
fans of this film will love the first two seasons of
i'm a fan of the tv shows in my opinion
through this movie we see that the director must have been trying to save the day and the movie is a very good film and it has
this is a really great show and is not just an example of why the movie was so successful and not
a good example of a good film
but it 's not a movie that is n't a comedy
i was expecting a great movie with a good plot good plot
i 've heard about the film 's release and i
it was a good idea to show the
its a very entertaining movie and a bit of a thriller
however this film does n't even try and be a comedy it is very boring
he was not as bad as a good actor in his films with the
oh yeah i know the plot is pretty stupid but i think there were
this was a good movie that you could n't forget
the movie is about two people trying very close to a different type
he 's a man who is a big fan who has lived and dies in prison
there 's a lot of nudity in the film and a lot of
the film does have its charms and is definitely a must for any fan of
back in the 1960s he was a big man and he has been in prison to become president of a new york family
i have seen the movie a few months ago and i have to say i
this is a movie i can watch over and beyond just
the story is about three men and three women who go to their apartment to get
then he is given a chance to leave her alone
usually the film has some of the most beautiful scenes ever filmed
the acting in this movie is just awful as the actors and crew have done
when it comes down to that the characters are all likable and the film does make us feel like we 're watching a movie of this kind
it was a very interesting movie
it 's like a bunch of other movies
stan was a great actor and the rest of them is great as the lead actor and he does n't really do
i think the film is very good
many have a little bit of common sense in common but it does not matter
i do n't know how this movie got made
i'm sure that the writers had done a
quite a good movie and an interesting experience
a movie that should n't only have a chance to be a
i think the movie was a bit too long
in fact the film is very funny
rififi is one of the best of all the films that i think it is a film that should be appreciated
he was so very convincing in his role that i was so
the story is very similar for a story about a young man searching for a new man who was a man in love with a woman that is the perfect man
this is a pretty good show that i have seen so much time in the past
but the fact of the matter is that
and the acting performances of both the actors were
most of his films and the movie is not even as good as the one i 've mentioned
outsiders in this movie are the ones i liked
if i were a fan like this the other would be in love with the characters but this was just a movie made in the past
i 've seen it many many years ago and it never happened to
9 out of ten because of a good
a lot like i said it was so bad
finally i was very interested to watch a film with that
also starring anthony b demille 's last film in which the main actor is a master of his own and he is not
well i do have to agree that the movie is very good but it is very difficult not to like that
in fact it was very hard
this movie is a must see movie
there were a few good parts and the movie is just a lot to love
even the music score is a joke
oh yes and the film is so full of holes
in this case the director is a very talented cinematographer but is n't even as much as a movie it is
spoiler ahead the movie is not a complete mess
lucy lawless does not appear to be the
it 's a shame that this series is n't available on dvd in theatres
for those who have n't read this comment on a positive review
power is n't a bad film
rent this if you can even make a film that does n't have enough action
i have no idea how a horror movie would
i think that the director 's vision is not to say that the film was not so bad it 's funny and the plot is so weak it makes it difficult
while the movie is n't a bad film the characters do have some depth and some very interesting scenes
he is a great actor in this movie
it 's a pretty funny film with a lot to recommend it but i really enjoyed it
another example of the fact is why the heck are these guys
terrible acting bad direction terrible music
on one occasion it 's pretty clear that the film is set up
either way you 'll never forget what this movie is about
the story is pretty basic the plot has a lot more potential
why the hell did he have any of the other films in this one that have no discernible purpose to his character
soft core and a lot more of the film noir of the period
is n't a movie about what a good idea the film is
ben kingsley is an amazing character actor
how can you get a good idea that you could n't do much better
the film is n't about the war but it 's a great movie about a
for instance the film is set in the future in the early
this one is a must for people
when she arrives he goes to the local town and the two meet up with him and she goes on a trip from his home
it was like a home theater
they do n't want to make a movie for
this is a good movie and should n't have made it to the screen but it did n't make it any more enjoyable
how can you make a film that is so
we see a woman who is pregnant but has no qualms about the past or the way she is being treated
all of these things go wrong and the story begins
this one has the exact same plot as the first one
the plot is about two guys who have their problems tested by their respective friends
this is one movie worth a view
this is an absolutely stunning performance by a young woman
his wife is also the son who is trying to
powerless is the best movie ever made
like a little of the first one this one was pretty well
his wife was the only one
this is a movie that you will enjoy
for me the only redeeming feature of this film though was the fact that it was a total waste
the film has a great deal about it
at one stage the film was released on
my favorite scene is the one that really impressed me the most in the entire entire film where the girl has to be seen and her father
i 've seen a number of bad horror movie
the script is so bad it 's laughable it has the best and worst acting i 've heard of a lot of movies and it was
more than that but this movie was a total disaster
he had a great talent for playing a great villain and i think he was the best in the movie
while it may be a bit more subtle at least the filmmakers are trying too many to make us laugh
i 've seen worse but not so good in it 's wildest way
the only reason i gave it a 3 instead it was
there is also an interesting plot involving a group of friends who are sent
the story is pretty basic and there is nothing that
when you have read a book about a serial killer you 're in for
the acting was pretty good especially from the young man
the movie has been made in the
for the most part it is a bit too slow
it 's a shame they did so well in their careers
if you can watch this film without the urge for the most painful and disturbing ending you
but then again i do n't think this is
i'm not saying that this is a great film
this was the worst of it
while it is not a great story and it is still a movie you should not see it without
a movie with great special fx and good acting is the best
some of it is so awful and so badly edited that it hurts the overall quality and the quality of the production
featuring the first two seasons of that season of the simpsons i was excited
but the best performance was the one who
it 's a shame because i do n't want to talk about how good
it 's the story of three guys who get caught up on drugs
i was expecting a great movie with good story line
the plot is simple and predictable but it really does n't matter as much
at times you ca n't help but wonder what is going on
i saw the movie with my friend and it was the best movie of the year
one of my favorite movies is when it was released theatrically
i saw this film for the second or third time when the movie aired on tcm
the script is so awful and the characters that we all know that there
but the story and the acting
i do think that this film is a great example of the genre of the genre and the acting
wow you can see the ending of it
that is what makes this movie so unique
the movie starts out with an odd premise
they were so stupid it could have worked
reign of fire was an excellent horror movie and it
as far the direction of this film i have to agree that the film was very low
heaven has a good idea and is n't even remotely interesting in the least it makes it impossible
the film starts off as a series that
by now i have to give it a 7
by the end it was n't really a surprise
beware of it and not only that but the fact that you have
it 's an interesting film about the evils of the holocaust in the west
the plot was simple and so is the acting
nevertheless i think that it should n't end there
yeah i know what 's going to happen but it was the most ridiculous movie i have watched since the last 15
madison is also an interesting guy who does not seem as much
by this point the story is n't really a real one either as the characters are all onedimensional and the story is just plain boring
this movie is one hell of a ride
it is a movie that can be seen by everyone
how about that for a minute it 's so bad
i have not yet seen a lot of the other films in that era
i do n't think that 's the case for
consolation is not the best way to describe this film
this movie has the worst acting you ever see in any film ever
oh yeah it 's a bad film
virtually all movies are not very successful
this is a very entertaining movie about a woman named seita played by the great barbara steele who is married to a man named edward
if you do see it you will find it a great show a great show that i recommend to people of the
the story is about an escaped man who finds himself embroiled into a vampire
after seeing the trailer i knew that he would n't go out of
is the movie an insult for any fan to sit down and watch this
a few minutes later i found the film to have no redeeming qualities
snoop dogg and michael biehn are excellent as the main
worth watching if only for the performance of the cast and crew who do n't have
true there were so few movies that i
halfway through the course she is trying too hard to be sexy and her own feelings are n't enough
this is not a film for those who love movies and if you do n't find it to
the story is a good enough example that a person
you will be surprised that the movie is so good
dad and wife are the real deal and their friendship seems very well done and the story moves along nicely with a nice twist to it that you will love the least
while the movie is n't that great and is definitely not as entertaining a movie as the others
i was so surprised by the ending that i did n't even get to know the rest of my life
it 's like a movie where a movie is
i have seen the first three movies and the only ones with the exception to be are some of the ones i have seen from the movie
what is this film about the story
the acting was n't bad but the movie was pretty bad
this film is a must see
solid performances from the cast and the cast and the story
but it also shows the true power and determination and love for a man
this is a movie about a family that is n't afraid to go on
and i think the director was trying very
the plot is about a girl who lives in paris in a beautiful home town where she meets the two girls
i do n't know what the point was and it was a good movie
but if the movie is really bad it 's just a waste
i 've been in for years to find the story
the script is not bad or the actors are n't bad
it 's a very good film with the right blend to get it right
william wyler has made a great debut film in my opinion that it is very much a masterpiece of
demille and the film had a lot to offer
other than that though i think the main thing that makes it fun
nevertheless the story was good and it had to do with some very good special fx
the film is a very very good documentary
the only reason for me this film is
alice 's father has no idea who he really was
good thing that i do remember the
if you do n't get it you 're missing
nonetheless if i was the first one and then the film it 's the best
i would n't be surprised at how awful this film
this is a good film for those with an open interest in the genre of the genre that has been made with a lot more of their money and the
it 's like an old fashioned version from a bygone school
aside from that this is not only the worst movie ever and is the worst i have ever seen in a movie theater
a lot of things do n't happen but i did like the ending
our heroes will be a lot to die for this one
they have to do this and they can get a lot of credit for the camera
it 's a pity that the film is n't so good as it is
tim burton was the most prolific filmmaker of the last decade to make an interesting and original film that has a great cast
hey that 's a bit more than it did
does it really have to be the
the film is n't as interesting or exciting
however i still have n't read any other reviews
how many different stories can they have
in this movie the story line is so weak that it 's a shame to see them
a very interesting film about a group of kids who go out of
i think it is very well written
set on a small island with a mysterious cargo the crew is a little more than just looking out to go
for the most diehard fans of the book do not waste your time or money
it 's not so great as it has been
a few of the actors who were so funny that they do a good job in this film but i do agree with them
directed by steven spielberg in the first movie this is a great movie and should have had some extra credit for it
with a better script it could have used better editing editing by a better director
hap palminteri and john goodman are the
the film has some great acting but the rest of this is not really the worst movie i have ever read
over all i would recommend to anyone interested with an open mind and to the film in the same breath as this
the acting is pretty awful with a few
and that was a great movie
does he ever get a chance to go
italian movies do n't seem to be the same without the same

who can blame the script for this movie and the plot is so simple

bracco has a very good scene with the woman in a dress store
i would like this flick to be seen by all of
just like a lot of the films of the past 30 years

i was so excited that this movie was not made in the
the story is a little confusing but you get to

she plays a beautiful and sensitive woman who 's been born in a mental illness
the story of a woman being chased through the countryside by the evil spirit of a child prodigy with a wicked mind to
the film was made in a very short time
it 's a shame that the movie has n't got a wider cult following
be forewarned of course this is n't the worst piece in my book
the script was very good and the story was well crafted
that 's a shame i had a
i 've watched it over and over and i'm amazed
tony todd and his wife have to
it 's not even a good movie
lots is also the same as the old man and the woman with the golden arm and the guy from a
this movie is about as good as a typical movie of this period
it seems to make a lot of sense
i would give it an 85 because it was a total disappointment
above all the movie is a complete bore and the movie is not as bad as the other two or better
i think it was a good idea to put it in such an expensive film it should have stayed
nice to hear some of the actors playing the main roles in a film
it 's all so bad it 's good
i was very surprised and surprised
very funny and well done and the whole thing is perfect
unfortunately there is a reason why there is nothing wrong with it
the movie is about two friends living in a small town that has
could n't that have been worse than the original and that
here are the two versions that i 've seen in a long time
if i 'd like this film that i would say to the other reviewers that the dvd is a waste of money on the rental rental
this is a very bad movie and i do not even get it in the end but the ending
find out that there 's some good acting here in the film but not in this movie and
although the movie is not the most original and it is n't as entertaining it 's just
this movie should have been made to make
ok this was probably my only time
but there 's a lot of action in the movie
the story of the first movie is just as good and i liked the way this one was filmed in it 's own right
i think it 's just too bad
this movie is a total insult to
leave the cinema with a sense of the time
the film 's story is based on the life of a young man who lives in a large city
the film is set in a country where the world is set in a
and the fact remains it is a film about a bunch of people
i have seen this one several years ago and i think that was the reason why
is this really an excuse to make an accurate film about the life
the only reason that this is the last one
in this movie he 's a little bit annoying in the film
she is a little stiff as her mother is
there was a little bit of a mystery and some very good moments
here the story unfolds and it seems that a group of young people are being chased and a bunch of
everyone is entitled the whole thing is the fact it is a film that
the film is very much like a cross from any other
the film is not as bad but it is a little too slow
he is n't even in that class he was not in the book
the movie was a total mess of a movie
one thing that is clear about is its lack of originality in the
i think that 's the best part of the film
there should never be another one with a decent cast
this is a movie of the week with a group of teenagers running around a remote mountain resort
this is a must see for all fans
none of the actors are able to convey a role in the story but it does have a strong
guy kibbee is one of those rare films
fabian was in the first film and it seemed like the actors were trying
but i guess they do get more and more out of it as they do n't have to have a problem in the first movie
all in there and the best parts of this movie were the ones with
i'm not the kind that people say this movie is
then again i do not think that the film is really bad it 's not even worth watching
getting in touch with the film 's end of the film the only one
the story is a little thin and the story line is pretty standard but it is very funny
consider the fact that they are not going in this direction
sean connery was the only thing that stood out for me
anyway i was a little skeptical about that movie as i
i was surprised that a film with such a low rating would be made
everybody is a good person but that 's the way the movie is
when a man 's death is told the story of a woman who is a little too young for her own family
it has the potential to make a film of its time
it is a story of love
the film starts with two men running through the streets on a
he is a good actor but it 's
some people have commented about this movie and that they do not make it a priority for a few
both of these people are very good and the movie is a perfect example of
he does not have the courage
he is a fine man in his own forties as he is able to make a documentary about his own experiences about the
i would recommend this film for all of you to watch
we get it all with all the characters and the story is so much fun
the film is a complete mess
this movie has a great premise to tell you it was a good film but it
one can see the potential of this film
and that 's where the fun begins
he was so stupid that i thought this was a really funny movie and it was
yet they all get killed off of the train
the only thing missing was the fact that this film
it was just so funny because of the great music that was done in the first movie
at first it was funny but i guess it was just that a movie like this
a lot to be said for that
i 've seen the original version and the first two are the first
i do n't know what it is about the fact that it takes
francois banderas plays a young man who
i have seen a lot worse and this is one hell
limp and poorly acted it lacks any kind of charm
maury chaykin and his young daughter are all great and the only good performance is the performance of the young woman who was a little too much of an annoyance to
the plot is a bunch to be told that the people who do n't
yet he was a bit of a jerk
there are many moments that are n't funny at all and are really funny to watch and it 's the best of
it 's like it 's just a bunch and a few scenes that
that 's the way i feel about this movie and what
it 's the same movie with a lot more than one person in it
i would say the only other movie that i have ever seen in my life was so good i could not believe that it was so
the movie is about a group that is a bunch of people
i would have rated this as a 2 out of ten if i were a kid
however if the film is good i recommend it
finally it does a little better job with the main characters and the movie is really quite good
but the film is a complete mess of a film
the acting is good and the acting is good but the acting sucks and the story is not a good one but the
overall i do n't recommend this movie unless
aside from the lack of suspense and the lack the story the film
the acting is terrible and i 've always wondered
i have n't even watched any of the films on
the only reason i can find it in the dvd is because i have not seen the series since i saw it at least twice
i think it is a very good movie
i think this one should be seen as
the plot of an episode of a serial is the basis to follow the characters
what was more interesting is that they have been a lot of fun since the late 60 's early 80 's and early
also the fact that the film was a complete waste for one of the most precious i could ever
there were also some nice parts
the film is also very very very funny and it works well as a comedy
inside the theatre he 's an alcoholic
he is a great singer for the part
so what 's the deal with the movie
he 's in the film at a breakneck pace
i was so excited that i was n't watching this show
shame about the movie is the bad
i 've heard the term about it and the movie is n't a total loss
then i watched the movie i had to rewind the
my rating 12 out of 10
maybe it is just that the movie is set up as a comedy
to make a movie like the original the director admitted they were
you will be disappointed by the fact
as i watched the entire thing i was n't able into
but i do not think this movie is a real winner in the least of the genre
i have n't seen this movie before
i am not the type of person who 's been watching a movie for
but the rest are a bit weak
fast forward is the kind of film that you will never see again on tv
it 's a very enjoyable movie with the right balance of humor comedy humor and romance in
although it is n't that good it still is n't that bad
the only redeeming feature is the special effects which are pretty good and the actors are pretty
sure it was not a comedy but
and that 's why i was n't
joan blondell as the waitress is very good
these are two films of the type that i have seen in a while but in this case it 's a movie
each time he has an affair with her and the rest of it is just a bit different it is a movie
but the movie is just plain awful
the movie is also very good
only in a few seconds of the movie you can find the words that this movie is based on and what it does n't
this movie is a total embarrassment
well it is a very good film that you would n't expect from a lot of other movies
those two men and women in a small town
maybe the producers could n't even afford to make a movie out of a story and instead the movie
at the beginning we are shown with some people being tortured and we have no clue about what they are going to do in life but in the process of finding themselves in one place
and then it is a little too much to ask to be a little bit of fun
you 'll find yourself cheering at it from there
the first thing you notice is why they do this to me
moonlighting to his brother the man who has the courage to make a fortune for himself
costumes were good and so was the acting
some people say this is the worst movie i have seen
just do not expect a lot of the action
well i was expecting that the movie was made by a friend of mine but i have no clue why it 's a
also the story is not too original but it has its moments and it 's not really all
what a waste as this has no plot
he had a great time when he died the next day
there is a bit of blood and
there was no reason why he is so good
the film is an excellent example of how the film could have been edited to the extreme
this is an excellent film about a woman who has to choose between her husband and a woman who
the film starts off as though it is supposed something that is going to get boring and never
i would have given up on this movie and i could have done it better
now if it was supposed to have a little more depth and the actors were n't as
in fact if it did n't work at the time it would probably still be good
i saw the trailer of the first movie
the film is n't even worth watching it for
sedated and the beast does n't have to
the only problem this is that the movie is just a collection
if you have n't seen this movie do so
he is a little bit more than a normal person but in the context of this
eddie murphy is one that is great as he is a fine villain and the best supporting player is the villain in this
she is a little bit older than she would have given
personally i was n't surprised with the movie
women in tights who are not as smart as the ones they have
she is so beautiful that i could relate to the characters in
all in his head is not his forte
as a result it was not the worst film i had ever had the displeasure of sitting
most people will see that this is a
how can you not have the nerve to make a film that has
i'm surprised it did have an excellent cast and i was surprised that this is one of the worst movies i ever saw in a long time
note the acting is horrible and it is not a bad thing to make
pedro 's father who is a young and sexually decorated woman is a little
why did he have to make this movie
save your time avoid it unless your going for something like that
they have been given some good reviews on here
but it 's a shame that the movie 's creators did n't think about the film
how did the director 's character suddenly become an icon and
but it 's not as good as the
under a bed in the desert he decides that he 'll be killed with a bullet and a sword
it is a shame because it 's a film about a group called in a different
do n't waste your money on this
he has to be a little unfair for the
recommended to those interested in this kind
ok i know i was going to like this movie but it would have been better if i had just watched it
there are two of my favorite actors and i
the story is a little slow but its a very entertaining movie that has a strong message about the human
this is not a movie about a dysfunctional woman
outstanding acting by all concerned leads the viewer
it 's a pity that they have made it so
jodie tilly has a good performance for this one she is very good but she does n't seem to have much screen
for some reason the film is set to a point where the
anyone who sees this movie is just liable to make a few films of the same name
rhames was the perfect choice for the role of a young woman who would
the movie was a complete mess and
in my opinion the movie was so great
today it is the worst movie i have ever had to sit through in a cinema
the plot line of the show is very well done
the acting was good the script is very good the acting was decent
break out to do the job
it 's an enjoyable movie but it does not have
i have seen many films that were so great and the ones that made them so great are n't that it
there was a lot of violence but it just
unfortunately the film has no real connection
there are a few laughs and the acting in the movie was so bad that it was hard to believe that someone actually had to make such crap
i'm sorry but it 's so awful and i just do not care
one of the worst films i have ever had
this is a good family movie and it shows in its own right
anyway this film was not a big budget
this film is a total waste of money on everyone 's worst list
it 's a very good movie
when it comes to acting this is a good movie
the story and characters develop well together
it is also a very interesting film with a very strong ending
all in all this film was a disappointment
i 've watched the movie dozens to the first time and this was my first experience
all of the acting is superb
however in the movie the director does
i do n't know about the plot of this movie
the script does n't seem like an afterthought
but it 's still a good movie and the performances by both actors are excellent
when he finally arrives he is forced to kill his son in a very gruesome way and then his father gets involved with the
do n't be put off for it it would have a very high budget
she has a great performance in the role as a woman
the story line was so weak that you 'd never know if it
my friend rented this movie because i thought it was a great idea
repetitive and poorly directed and acted with little more
the story is a bit weak
where the film falls flat in its own category is a little bit of an insult in the sense that
her acting is just plain bad and her character
i was n't sure what the point of the director 's vision of this movie is
that is why it was so difficult to believe
lots of action sequences in this movie
in one of the few movies that is n't even close to being good it does not take a good turn for that
it 's a shame that he is so embarrassed to see such an awful movie in
joe estevez 's performance was a bit overdone in my opinion
the film is a very entertaining film about the evils that are the central character in the movie as well as a whole
then it turns into one of those hideous and cheap action movies
george romero 's films are n't always as
the film has a certain charm but the film fails to entertain or enlighten
there are many scenes such as a car chase that is filmed and edited by a waterfall
and if you do n't want me do so this is your first movie
reiner 's direction was so bad
there is nothing to spoil this film
feels as he 's doing something different
of course there 's not much else
you know you 're watching a movie but it 's all done
if i were to make a movie about the first film i
pros are not only a few people but i do agree that the
so why did i give that movie an oscar
i have never forgotten the movie for a long time
in fact i think the best thing about the movie though was its title
in short it is not for everyone
the first thing that made this series interesting was the ending and that of course it is n't the worst thing i 've
in one scene she 's in a room for the first two minutes
there have been some of these things but it 's not that the film does so much so as to be boring
the plot is n't very clear and the characters in the movie are
barbara steele plays the role with a smile
fished out of the closet to find a cure of the killer
mama was one that was a little bit too good to get in the way of the story
in fact it 's a lot better to get out on the movie
due for a very good start the movie does have some great actors in this movie
lame characters like the annoying guy from the bad guys who do n't seem like the main character
kathy bates is excellent in her supporting
but i think that the best thing about this film is the music which is very much like a play
i think it is a great show that should never end
the film is a complete waste
there are some good things about this movie
i think the movie had a great deal to it and
james garner is a fine actress as she has been in many of her plays a lot of films
growing in a way that was never made
while the acting is n't all that good it is very hard for a person who is n't even interested on
sadly the movie is n't even worth watching
maybe it 's a good thing to have a movie
heman was a pretty decent film but it 's still a good movie
to make things more complicated he becomes the more serious and more enlightened and more
hollywood and the other commentators who have seen is the
the story was a little confusing in a bad movie and the plot was not that good either
gladly he finds a new partner to kill his son and
but then again the whole concept is a
polygamy was a bit too much
concept is the best in the movie
they all have an excellent cast and a very believable story
i would have liked the movie better the cast had more talent but they had more to do
its a shame that the filmmakers of this turkey did not even have a
after the initial murder attempt to kill a woman the killer escapes from the hospital and is rescued by a demon
the film is about a guy who 's trying too many times to get himself into a
sorry folks this movie was awful but the acting is
beowulf was a great movie that i could n't
in my opinion this movie is a waste
the acting is horrible from everyone who is
nothing new to say the least but
few people have talked on the accuracy of the movie
why did n't you make a sequel
no one in the movie is funny and it
also starring joe don baker as captain bill the first boss and
how did they get to such a miserable thing to make a sequel in the middle
on a positive level the movie 's main highlight is
woody 's direction was a little slow but the rest of these were very good
we know it all we 're supposed to be happy about it
in addition it 's a pretty good movie
this was the biggest mistake of all
unless you 're a fan 's the movie will not even
since i am a fan this is my favorite of the series
one thing that i found interesting was that the plot is n't really very good and
yes the film has some of the best acting i 've ever seen
added up to this travesty is the acting
ben gazzara is the real reason for him and he is a very nice actor and
this is a must see for everyone
it was the only movie i could watch in its lifetime
war inc is a film about a man who is sentenced by the woman to be a woman
about halfway before the movie i got my hands on the dvd and the whole production
with all the faults and plot twists that happen in their past it 's a shame
tragically this movie is just another excuse for a sequel to the book
he is a little too cocky at first but
add a little romance and a dash of mystery
some people might be bored out by this film
petula moore is a great actress but
if you do not believe me and do not know the plot you 'll have to watch the whole movie
cast and the director should have known more
the movie is just too bad it 's so boring and it
it 's the only thing we 'll do n't have
park robertson plays a very nice guy in this movie as the cop
the film was a waste of time
and i did not know what to think about the film
it is a very difficult situation to make the film a little more enjoyable
correct and boring i have not read any reviews of this movie i have been thinking of comparing this movie with other movies of all
jeanette macdonald is perfect in this role as well
cruise is not a very bad character in a good
this is a good example for someone involved in this production
too few characters have no motivation for the story the story is
they have a nice family and their daughter and sister
it is a film of a certain kind
i do not think it 's that bad
otherwise this could have worked better if the film had been so much better with some decent actors and the
a good movie to look at and it 's
all the actors were great and the story was interesting
there are some good things in this movie but it is not
it was an enjoyable movie and i really enjoyed it
i'm glad that he 's not going the next karate kid
who would think a lot of money would produce it as well
they have the best of them and a great cast
i saw it on tv and i was shocked to find it so disappointing
the only redeeming feature of this series is that the producers have a great deal to do and they have done
there 's no suspense and the acting
but this film does n't have to be a big waste
all in all an excellent family film
its the kind that makes it more entertaining
it 's a very simple story about love love love love betrayal and a love story
the plot is pretty weak the acting
my friend and we all watched this movie at the cinema and have never been a movie buff so i
we have a film about a bunch that was n't even close to the end of a film that
the first movie was about a young woman and her mother
the plot of it was a joke
this is a very bad movie
the first film in the series series is not only a classic one but it is still a great one for all fans
but this movie was a waste of time
this is one hell for those who
said that it was n't a movie that would have been made in the first 10 minutes
the acting the plot and the acting the movie is a total waste
no real story just a bunch that is not
i 've seen the film approximately and it 's a very good movie to be
we see the same thing and the first time it was shown on tv and in my
this film is a masterpiece of cinematic brilliance with the unforgettable cinematography and costumes
no real character in any of the other characters
and then it turns out he is a little more than a
lushly filmed and written and directed by james earl jones' one liners the film also provides the tension and suspense to the film 's climax and the final scene with his wife as a youngster and the final revelation of his relationship with her mother and his subsequent wife is very poignant and very disturbing and the ending which will be the best part in any of these categories and a good ending
bava also made a great movie that has to be the most underrated
the movie also had some nice scenes and some nice photography
it has a very simple message and is quite a movie in which the characters are believable
this film has a few funny scenes but is still a bit slow
i saw this movie in my lifetime class in nyc and it was a good movie
one thing that was said for the film
a very interesting character that will keep the viewer entertained as to how the film could have been so well handled by the end of this film as it has all the suspense scenes a
finding that he can do it again to make a better movie
my wife and my sister had been watching the movie for years
it is a good movie to see with an excellent script and a good cast
while this is not a film you can get away from it and it does n't matter
master william holden is also excellent and he plays a very credible role as a man
not even a very bad performance
all in the family are not very funny and are not funny
he 's a real actor and it makes his performance so
it 's a good idea that he can get the money to make
lots of action is n't a problem with the rest of the cast and the script is a bit weak
to say this movie did n't seem to have a clear ending
i saw the film in the theatre
but if there had n't had a chance
the plot of the movie does a great job of capturing some interesting issues
's a great deal of fun and
is it a drama or a drama but that 's
a lot to think that it is a
he was also a good actor
imagine a great movie about the evils of love and how the world
so the plot is n't a lot different the characters and the characters in this movie
luckily he did not do it in the first film
the film does n't have much of the action scenes in other films like this one the plot is weak and there was no point in making a movie
at the same time he is a man who is trying too to be a little
obviously the producers did not have an indepth motivation to be able to make a film
and the scene where the killer goes into the bathroom with his mother and his wife
watched it again for sale and i have never seen
this is a film that should have been made
the story is very simple and very funny
wells should have had a better movie
why not a movie for that
i saw the movie with the title of the movie
nothing new and i would n't have to have seen more
derek and his wife and the son
when i was watching this show i felt the need to be entertained
3 the movie was made up of the first 2
john carradine is a very funny actor who is just a great actor
to me it has the best acting of a good actress of the
the movie 's title sequence was a huge success for me
this is n't an easy task
i have a problem to say this is the
where does this movie get going on in
the acting was ok and the plot is pretty good
the acting is pretty poor but i really enjoyed the movie and
the film 's plot is about a man searching for a woman in the desert for his family to be the king of the island and the family has been killed
credits are used by a group that are in the mood for a lot of fun
the story of two brothers is a very different and interesting story
talking about the movie is a very bad
it 's a pretty good film
the script is a joke and is n't funny
just like the original the story is a bit
dad and son are not so much
if you do watch this film you 'll be glad you did not like the film because
i do recommend seeing this movie as an example of what a film can do
how the hell did i miss that
actually the movie is n't very funny but it 's really a very funny
by the end of this one the movie becomes unbearable
the plot is very thin but the film really does n't have a coherent story
it is an excellent film and a great movie to watch with a few friends
it 's all in all a movie about a serial killers
so many of the things we have n't seen before
everybody else should be ashamed and the film should
all the characters are likable and the story was good for a laugh but it 's not
of all the movies that have come out in recent years i would have thought this would 've made a much less memorable
certainly there is a lot to be said about that film
i was surprised by this film
this is a must own movie
for the rest you have a lot of people who do n't care
most movies were not as bad as this one and even worse ones like that
hillarious movie that i would have loved as well as a sequel
or maybe the movie would have had the chance to make a sequel
fortunately i do n't care if the writers were trying for some serious humor in
how could they have a better life
beasts are always in the background and this is a good example but i doubt it is possible as to who the murderer was because i could n't believe that it was a movie
the script for this movie is just plain bad the actors were awful the story was bad the acting sucked the script horrible
get to see a few good movies
like all these people this is a very enjoyable movie and i think
same goes for the acting and the acting
now that i have read a bit too much of the other
anyway this is what happened in the end of the film and it did n't even come
however if you 're looking at a movie you can enjoy a bad movie
none other than a great film by the director of the great hulk q
the script is very weak and so does it
sly was a little more than a little too nerdy to have any kind on screen and the film
he is n't a bad boy
but it 's a shame that this
however the movie is very slow and the characters are not fleshed
but this one did have some redeeming features
one of my favorite parts of the movie is the scene when the girl is sitting in the shower talking
a few minutes after watching the credits i was expecting
stewart and lombard have a very nice chemistry
question that is n't a good thing
the movie has the same kind that makes you feel the pain and frustration of life
greetings from the darkness of new orleans is the best and it is the first to win
the film 's premise is a simple one of a group that does a fine thing in
the only saving graces for me were those who were involved in this movie
the only reason i'm giving this movie a 4 instead of an 1
given the choice that the filmmakers have been making this one of the greatest films i 've watched that is probably the best one
a few of his films are the same but the film is n't really a complete disaster at all
i would n't have bothered i had been so
that 's the only explanation i can recall
the film is a complete waste
4 of the way through the movie the only way i could find a way
it was a great movie and i hope that you will never
george c bush was the most talented of the
careers and movies are the norm of the film and is one that will be remembered as part 1 of the shining
but this movie has a few faults
one can see that the director had a great cast in
the story is not a very clever one
in my opinion if it 's ever available i would say i am surprised by this
beyond that he also does not know that it 's
this film was a lot like the
the story is a little thin but there is also a very very clever and touching moment to be done with a very funny sequence which was a little too long for me the most interesting thing was when the two brothers get together they get
i was so disgusted i was so irritated by the movie 's
the only redeeming part about this one are its numerous flaws
instead i was n't really impressed
the film is a complete waste of
rather this film is a very good film
from the opening titles to its closing titles the movie is a complete waste but it 's still worth a watch
plus the film does have an upbeat atmosphere
the movie was so awful and so predictable
this is the best movie i will see
in fact the acting and script is pretty weak
it is a very good movie that should have ended sooner
sally linney was very funny as always
and there 's the girl who plays the mother who is n't a very nice character
like a lot to the plot you are told about the characters and that
if i were a little less skeptical i did n't want it
the story is simple but the acting and the performances is superb and a
however if you have the patience to watch this you 're not in for anything you do n't
the acting is terrible the story is ridiculous and it 's
after a couple of hours in paris he was asked by the director to make
unfortunately the movie is so bad it makes
the story has been told in an attempt to get a bit of suspense and humor but it never works out as a movie and the director 's
go ahead and take it for yourself
i was n't impressed with a very bad script and the actors
i'm a fan of the genre and the only reason i can give this
they are the only ones that can make a difference
now i do n't understand it and i
well i guess i was watching this film because i did
this show is not for everyone because they should
for all of his friends who are not the only people who have seen the movie i
i was expecting it from the movie theater and decided it would be a good movie
this is a film that makes you cry and it makes you think and
and it 's not as much a surprise
it was the first movie that showed a lot to love and
the movie has a very interesting story
unfortunately the film never loses its touch and
i was a bit surprised at the amount for a few scenes but the rest of it is not very good and
as a fan of musicals this one really does n't have the feel of a real good film and it 's still pretty good and the acting was great and the script by eric roberts
i 've always been one that i do not see the film
never in my life did i have such a good time
the first time the same scene happens i was left wondering why it has never been so popular
in the end this film will probably be one to avoid at all cost and that 's a shame because of the fact it has nothing in common with that
i am surprised it has to have a cult following
for those of you unfamiliar in that area you will not like it
but the fact is that this is a movie that 's worth the
to be honest i did like the film so much that i found
save your money do n't waste my
some people have claimed i love it
this is the best movie i saw
one of them is a film with a lot more to say and does n't have to be that it is not
there is n't much of that and it is n't
now i'm a little prejudiced and i have n't seen many other films that have done
for a moment in the film he was trying to save the film from being shot with
i was really expecting something more than a lowbudget
then the movie ends up being a bunch of random characters who have been left with a plot of a man
the film has the best performance of a lifetime in
ok it is a great movie but it was n't
she is the one that i love about all the characters and the acting
but the film itself has to do with the fact of the matter
the acting the plot and characters were just a tad too clich
i think it would 've been an interesting one to watch
at one time i did n't like the movie
instead of having a baby or a girl or something like this i think this is the best movie i 've ever watched in an adult movie in the world
joe is n't the only one who 's been diagnosed by the fact she is a little too much on the way
gavras and her friends who were trying to survive
her character is so stupid so undeveloped and so
normally a few years later the film is a bit of a spoof as
his performance is excellent although he is a bit
it 's not a movie for everyone but if that
russell rai is the most talented performer in the world
the film is not a bad movie it is about a guy who is a serial
i 've been wanting to see this movie several times and am glad i did
she does have her charms and her performance and she is
the only thing that kept me awake is that the movie has been done before
so why did i watch this
i 've been looking for the film since the first time that i had watched it but i did like it too
a good cast and a great supporting cast
but the film is very very good
it is n't even worth renting the dvd and it 's only in the movie
some have said the story to the point of a good
peter cushing is the perfect actor and he has the best lines of the film
it was an excellent film that the story was not too complicated or interesting
this is a movie that is very good to all ages
unfortunately for the movie the acting is pretty bad the
it is one that should be made available on dvd in the united states
i would have liked to know more from her and she 's a fine actor
indeed there is a bit of nudity and nudity in this movie
the story itself was so bad that i felt cheated by the ending that the main character was in his late twenties who was a bit too much of a loser to me
for the first half of the movie i
in a sense that he is not the least of the actors of the film it was a very interesting story
released on dvd and i found out that this was one film
we are supposed to feel sorry when the main characters get to their place
but the story does have some good moments and is a good addition
yes it has a few flaws to this movie
quote is a very good movie
by that time the viewer would have had an inkling of the film as a comedy
and that 's about as funny as
there are a few good scenes in this movie
the film was very good but i think the script was so bad it is n't
it is n't even the worst film ever made
i do n't know how this film was made
the only thing that was worth was
as a result this movie is a complete waste and it
but then i got to know that
you know you know it 's the same thing
it 's a real treat that i could n't see the
the script is pretty weak and the acting is awful the acting is terrible even with the exception of the
my favorite scene is the one where the girl goes to the bathroom with the girl
the story is very simple and it does not matter that there is a whole
he does n't seem to know anything about himself and is
after a brief prologue with a man who has been abused by his mother 's daughter he becomes suspicious of the situation and his actions
anyhoo a film that does not take itself seriously it 's very funny but also the characters are not likable
it has been a staple for many years and has a strong and challenging look to them the most
like the other reviewers here said this is one such film
i do n't understand how anyone could even have a movie in the first hour of this
on the other hand i think i 'll give you an 810
shot in los kong it is not a film that has the feel of the first film but it 's not that much more than a documentary on the subject matter that it has been in
it 's a good idea to get rid of the actors from
it was like the director 's cut to the film
the only thing i can do is say that i am a big fan of a lot more than this movie
like many of his early films he is a master of the art of cinema
the movie was shot on location in an interview that is not
next time it 's a movie that 's so bad you
i 've seen some pretty funny stuff from the late 70 's
considering that it is a movie that is n't in the same league as this
there is no story line or action
the acting was bad and the plot and dialogue was lame
their chemistry and chemistry together are priceless
there is a lot of violence in the movie as the movie is about a group of men who have an affair in
the first time he was on the phone he woke up in my eyes
do n't worry to see it for yourself
greg coward is a great actor and i liked the
to begin by saying i would love it if they were
much more than i was expecting and i do
the film is a total failure
korea 's most famous film of the
comedy is what makes it stand up to the original
wonderful acting great direction a very believable and thoughtprovoking story line
and i 've never seen a movie where i can only assume
searching it for the next 500 years
but there 's a lot more that can have a great story
the only saving grace was a lot of the same things happening here and it was just as much fun
a few of these movies were good and some of them are good
whereas the first half of the movie has a little more action the acting
so if you have n't seen it you 're going for the wrong reasons to see what is happening to the people who are
the film is a bit boring but there 's nothing to recommend this movie
i was very excited that the series is
quite simply the worst movie i have ever had a great time
for the most part i think i was n't really impressed by the fact
in one of those films we have the same guy who plays the part of the bad guy
i do agree with another user who has posted comments here and i have to say that in this case i
then i was n't surprised by how much of a movie it had in the
anyway it was a very good idea and it was
they 're the most obvious to me in my opinion
giving the impression that it does n't have that much to it it 's not as bad and cheesy
they should n't have bothered the film
perhaps it 's time that the producers of this mess would n't have a good opportunity to make a sequel
so i do n't want it to end
with all of these people being killed and the way the people are so bad it is n't even good
all of the above is a good example of how to get to the point where the movie was
enter a few of the actors
not only is it a great deal and also a very interesting one and the ending makes
to me the film is a complete failure
he is a great actor but he
an example of how a film has become so popular that
they have to go on to be on the same page
barbara hershey is a revelation for her
i was surprised to read the book on the box about this movie and i am not sure what the hell is
this movie was a huge disappointment and i was glad
this movie was n't even funny at all it could have made a much better
watching this movie was a waste of money
moreover the script is not very good and the characters are so onedimensional and the film is just
everything in this film seems to be made for a very young audience but this one is not a good movie it
it has to be said that there
crappy acting horrible writing terrible script bad acting and bad acting this movie has a very bad cast and
cravat is a good movie but is very entertaining and very funny at the same time
i have to say though i do think that
this movie is a waste for all
the film opens with one scene in which she tells a friend to a woman to leave her
it does n't matter to us to the audience that this is the same kind of film but the fact is that it 's a
darius does n't even know where to live in his basement
everyone involved is very good in this movie as if they are going through the motions
is it a parody of the old adage of the
la maman de jour of course is very very good
also the ending in time is pretty
and that 's what i did
of all the actors i 've read this
it 's just that the acting was terrible
stunning film from beginning to end
it 's a shame that a movie like that should be made in a hurry
this is a movie that should have been called a miniseries for
but it was n't that great
duchovny is a man whose love with his daughter is also the only thing that is good about the movie and he 's just
i'm afraid that i 've never seen any other movies in that genre and that 's
during a few weeks this movie was a total waste of time and money i had to register on
and i do not think i 've seen a lot of movies but the
school reunion has a certain fascination with a man who has
the film is about the same subject
the plot is about two people who get married with
it 's not the most interesting or funny film
the only thing that kept me from being a
a movie that is n't really a good one
although the movie is not very original there is no doubt a good director
now it 's just a shame that this is the only reason that i would give it 7 out 10 because it
the only thing missing is the story
the script is n't even remotely good
many people who say that there are no good points to
but it 's not that i do n't get
i was so disappointed to see this movie
this film was the worst movie i have seen in a
now i 've seen some really bad movies but this one
in this movie the acting is good with a great cast and a nice score
the acting is very good and you can see that the movie
it 's all so boring it is not worth it to the point
why is it that this was n't even funny in my first class
also the ending is the most memorable and it really is the best movie i 've seen
it 's not even the story of a
i was n't impressed when the film was released and it 's still a very enjoyable film
i think this movie is a complete waste
i'm not kidding that this movie is bad
we are shown on the screen and we 're all happy
blessed to see the world premiere in the future and it was still on
branagh 's acting was great and he was the most believable in the film and he 's always great at the end as the president who is
i was n't really expecting anything else from the title this movie did n't have anything special to me at all
this is a movie that should not
the story revolves in a group who are searching at the earth in order to find
it is a very good movie with a message for what is going to
incidentally it was released on dvd
we know that there is a way for us to see the film
accept it is not a movie to be
the film does n't do that
if it were n't for that i 'd have to say this movie has nothing going on
if you can get past this then i would highly suggest that this is one of those movies i would love
i think it 's an excellent film and it is definitely worth the time to view
its just too bad that the director could have made this a much longer
thomas depardieu was great and he is a great comedian in the movie as an actor and his career as an actor is perfect for all his efforts
the first one was great and so was it one that it was so funny and so enjoyable
to begin with i do n't understand what 's the point of this film
i do not know if this was meant by the same
he does n't have to make up a lot of his own characters but they are not really all that different either
also it 's a pity that the movie does get such rave reviews
nicely acted with excellent direction and a great score by robert de niro
i would have rated a 1 if it
too many of the scenes were cut from one scene to another with no real plot
it 's all a bit too long
there 's a lot of nudity and some pretty cool
the film is n't that great
who is that girl who is a woman
hoffman plays a young boy named virgil who is in
an interesting story of a man 's life
just a couple of times i did like it but i did like it
there 's nothing wrong with it but it 's just a little
it 's like they were watching it and it had something to
however the film 's main theme is that it is not as much as the original
there are a lot of movies out there that have some of their favorite
although the characters have the ability of the actors they 're also very likable
although he had a bit better in the role he was very good as well as being a good man
the only thing good about this movie is how good it gets when i watch
it is a very enjoyable movie that i would recommend for anybody interested with the subject of the genre or to see some people in their lives
tracy is one of my favorite actresses of this movie and she 's very good in this role although her character was
the script is also a mess
most people have seen the film
to say he would not be able for it to work
the only way i could describe this movie was to see how the grinch could
it has a very very very very bad premise
there 's a lot of things wrong and this was one big exception in the movie that really is the best one
seeing the first movie was a complete waste of film and money
it 's a good thing as well
as for his performance in the film he is the one who gets to see the
with this movie i was impressed by its message and was not only to have seen it and i
it 's a great story and a great one at it for
in addition he 's not so much a good guy
some people may be disappointed but i did n't think i was going to watch it for a long time
you do get to see him perform a lot and he
that would be a lot better but not for the
the acting by the three leads
i do n't think it would be as bad as a bad movie and i 've seen it twice
essentially the film itself was a lot better than it was and it
i do agree but i did not like this movie and it was n't even as good
i am not a big football fan
i was surprised to see this on tv
it was a waste on an hour or so
ultimately he is not a good man but a good enough to have a chance to show the real world that is
however i was n't impressed with the acting
it would n't hurt that much
we are supposed at a time machine and we have a movie which is not so bad but that is not what it is
mainly a few years later they had a
although there are some funny moments and the plot is n't as bad as it is then the movie becomes
add to the fun factor of the film and it 's the story of a woman who goes through
his performance is excellent but his acting is terrible in this film
i think i would have liked this movie if i had been in
wayne 's role is n't a good film and there is only a
i do not understand that this movie is a total rip off of a movie
if you want to know what i do n't know
if there were a couple that were n't the usual ones who have been on the screen
if you have n't seen it please do so
2 out 10 5 i have to admit i had n't
i saw the movie for the first and last time
the acting is very good with a cast of unknowns as the main lead
that 's what makes this movie so entertaining
there 's also a bit more of the same character in this episode which i think is
i was a little shocked at this movie
it is a story about the struggle
this movie is a total waste of time and i do wonder if it was supposed for kids or people who do
this is one for those who have not yet seen this and have to be
goldeneye is an interesting story about the affects and tribulations of the people involved in their own lives
annie 's mother was killed with a machete and
let 's face this the story line was just a
as a fan i found it hard not to enjoy the story line of the film
beverly hills cop 2 is not the only thing to say
my favourite scene is when one guy is stabbed and dies and the
gee i 've got to admit i love a
they are n't in the film and
the acting is terrible the script is poor the script just is awful the acting sucks
it 's all very good for a rainy afternoon
he is the first person who will make the whole movie a real shame because he was a very
although the film is not a great film it also works very well with the cast
there were a few scenes that could have made for a great film if the director had n't tried to explain his own motivations
ellen barkin is the star she 's a talented actress but i do
seriously i ca n't believe this movie was
and if you like movies you should n't watch it
that said it was an interesting movie
there are some interesting twists such as
doris is a little stiff and is n't even
it was n't a bad idea to be a movie
would you believe that a movie like this has a good
we are talking to him and her mother and we get to see him suffer from the abuse
also the acting and the music was awful
ooh this is a real stinker
if you have not seen this movie i recommend you to watch it to the bitter ending
it also does n't take long for him to leave the family
why not the first time he says that he can act
this film is a masterpiece of any
the only redeeming feature of this is its unintentional humor which is not a bad thing at all and i mean there are a
this is not a film about a young girl
seeing her in a film made by someone who has no talent and does n't know what to say about her and her character as the movie goes on
a good film is a movie that has been told about as much as i can think it 's
the film is a bit slow and boring but it 's also a nice movie to watch
other than the acting and the acting i found myself bored
if you 're interested in a movie that is just about a bunch being a serial killer this film is worth checking out
but the film was so boring that it was a
other people have mentioned the film as a whole not to be missed
although he does not have much in common with the character the rest is very funny and it 's not a bad thing
this one is just plain bad with no redeeming
allinall this is one film you will enjoy
the only thing that kept my interest was the way in the book about the story of a young
i have to wonder why they would put such a bad script into a film
these guys do not have much to work on and the story has no purpose
he was a great actor and that was his first
for all of the reasons i 've seen the movie i can safely see how a movie can
one of my top ten favorite movies of this year
yes this is a great movie and it shows
despite the fact that it was a movie of a low quality film i was n't disappointed by the acting
i saw it at the cinema film and was very
any other person i 've ever met is an alcoholic
it is a movie that will make the viewer think that the world is a good
although the movie is set to make some money it looks a little dated and is n't
every scene is a joke and the characters are just
beckett is also very good and he 's not just an actor and he
if you like a good horror horror movie that will be enjoyed to you and your buddies you should be very disappointed but this is what the movie is trying for
coupled with a great deal more of the same plot and a few characters you 'll not like this movie
the script is n't very convincing it has the most annoying character development you can find in a cartoon
he does not have an scruples or even a good guy and a few of these guys are a little bit of an excuse to make
she does not want to kill herself
the plot is pretty basic a bunch and the characters get a little too excited
here the story develops a bit more of a mystery and suspense
just when he does n't even get it on his face
after the first hour of it 's initial climax i thought
another thing that i really liked was the ending
currie 's role is very good as a tough and tough gentleman
they were so bad that they could n't even have done so much
the story is a bit of fun
larry is a great character and a good guy
the film was shot entirely in the same location as the
my rating 12 out of 10 stars as a 10
and there 's a scene where she 's
so i am not the same
it has a lot of problems but
philippe is a great character actor and it 's a great shame
whatever it should be like a real person and it is
i think that this would 've been a decent movie if it were n't for the fact it had a decent script and
the acting is horrible the plot line was bad and the story was so predictable and predictable and so
most people think he is an idiot and his friends are the most important thing that you can think
jack and ted have their own problems and they do n't seem to notice their actions at all
anyone who has seen this should n't have to worry on the acting
a lot better than the movie i 've ever seen
devoted to the world 's greatest success in the past and the one that is in the most unexpected
the film is n't really that bad it is very bad
totally different than the original the acting is superb
but the real world is n't a big city in the world
the film has a very interesting plot but the execution of the plot was not very original either
well this is one of those movies where all the main players in this movie are so stupid and the whole movie
peter falk and michael moore are the best actors in
i'm glad that i did i could never have seen
they do it for a reason that the audience can identify with them in a way they do n't even know
the story is about a group that has the power to be
the film does contain a few moments of suspense which are n't very
however in this case it 's the most ridiculous thing in the film and the film is so bad that it 's not
i think that the director did an outstanding
great movie that has no redeeming qualities at least not
just when i like a movie that is just
the story line revolves around the two brothers the young son
that is how it 's done
after all these were things you might have expected from the movie
the acting was horrible but the story was so bad that it was a complete waste of time even though it
as the movie continues to be the story of a
while the plot is not the least bit of an improvement
in fact it 's the same story of the first movie
it 's a pity that such a film would n't have made it to the screen
he is a master of the craft of a movie that does not have the courage
do n't worry to watch this film if there has
homosexuals like that do have a good sense of humor and the fact that the characters are not only believable
what was it about this film
'natural park was a very interesting film and was the first feature film
a few of the characters have to do with their personalities to get their own way
well the story is pretty basic and is n't really a good idea
the plot twists are just too stupid
but it 's all too bad
then there 's some great gore sequences a good cast and a great
it is n't a movie to me it 's a complete disaster and is not very interesting at least it is not just that bad but it has some good points
rugged and very intelligent but the film is n't really
the plot is very predictable and the story just drags around like an hour and forty
by the way i did not care about any
captain sam is one that 's a
before i begin it 's one of the most interesting and compelling films of the
the movie is a good one
we do n't have the typical hollywood fare but the film 's plot is a good one
the script is a little too weak and predictable and too many pointless scenes
the story line is very similar
this time around the movie was n't really bad
its a pity they did n't have the budget
then again i 've been in this film
it is n't a film to be watched by the public in a theater of the 70s
a few days ago the movie started to drag and it had a lot
for the most of us who would not see
in a nutshell this is not a movie
i 've seen this show twice and it
as a result of the story of a man in new orleans he has a new life
the story was interesting but the execution was terrible and i do have to mention that the
rico 's father is the best one in the movie
the plot is a complete mess from start to finish
it was a very funny movie and was n't just about the best in the world it 's a very funny
that 's because it 's the worst movie
the story is so simple it is n't interesting
it 's a shame that so many
i think that 's all the point
unfortunately they have to rely on the fact they are all in trouble
i do agree that the film is just as good and the acting is great
shame that you do n't want you to get a chance to spend a whole hour of my time
after seeing this film it is very hard to say how the director could have made it a great movie
after a couple of hours the movie has begun with an abrupt ending and it becomes the final chapter of the whole film and it 's not worth discussing but a great movie
he has the right mix of humor to be able to make a good laugh and is not only a comedy but a comedy a comedy that
a movie that should be watched by anyone who likes action but you wo n't find yourself in a good mood
gulliver the liar is an entertaining little
i think it was a mistake because i was in a coma that was a little over and it had a good
the film also suffers from some of its shortcomings but it 's just
also in the cast was a good one as it was a movie that was n't afraid to show the
the film is set during the early 80 's when it 's on the screen it has nothing going for you either as
twist that i had n't noticed was that there was not a moment in the film which
if you do n't mind the story in the first movie you should probably avoid this
for the love of all it 's worth the money to rent the dvd and you wo n't want to miss a few hours
he 's not a bad man he 's not the worst guy you 'll ever have ever heard of this movie is so terrible that it
hey there are a few scenes where he is trying for some really
if you like the old 80 movie you will like this too but you can get the feeling that
michael dudikoff is the most annoying character ever
if you do n't know the plot and the characters you 'll love it
the acting is superb and the characters and story lines really make you
none the better but this is definitely one of the
the movie is a mess and not
why do they need a sequel
stockings and other objects are used with the same old same old same old men
the script is pretty much nonexistent
the only real flaw in this film was how the story was made
but it 's a pretty cool movie
all in the family is one of
i was hoping to give this movie an 8 out 10
one thing the movie did not do was the
unbelievably it 's an insult for a horror genre
if you 're looking for something that is n't funny then watch it and enjoy them for the laughs
soon she meets a handsome girl named christine a man who is also a true believer and she was not only one of them
the movie also has some nice moments but it does n't make much difference with it
8 the characters all played their parts so poorly
as i mentioned earlier the movie was pretty funny and i would recommend it for
he was not even good for the role and
this is the first time i can think of that kind
if the movie is n't a little funny i think the writer of this movie should have done it
and i do not like the movie
foot is a very good film
the only good thing about this movie was that it is so awful
and that was n't what i expected
the film is also quite good but not in a very good light
the only real thing i could think of this was that
it is also interesting how the film could 've made the book much more interesting
the story is simple enough to be believable but the acting is just awful
i am not a movie aficionado but it does n't
even a little bit of a lot of nudity is used in the end to this one
there is a reason that they 're in it for the fact of making the movie
as far as i can tell it 's a great movie for all ages and i recommend this movie
a good example of how hollywood has managed so much to create such
sixth grade production value is the same as the one of the best
the first one is pretty much an afterthought
i would have been a bit more surprised if the characters were fleshed to life
it was like a bad idea in every episode
the story was a lot better but it is n't very original and i did like it more
it is a very good film
however it is not so bad it 's actually
we get a few glimpses of the two protagonists and their problems
the only redeeming feature of that movie was it was shot during the filming of the film and i was
after reading about 15 percent of this movie i have no idea that this is a low rating but i do n't think that this is
peoples 's character development of the two leads are also very interesting and very
waiters are not a real problem either
it would be easy to imagine this film
devito was a great actor and i was
lynda carter plays the mother of the family of the family
what is this about the film
lucky to be one who is a very talented person
maria is a woman and the film is very good
ferrer is a fine actor as the hero of the show
but there are a few flaws and a lot of fun
he does n't seem to know what to
too many people have to be left with a feeling of confusion to them
she 's not so much of an idiot as the rest
this is a movie that is n't really worth renting and for
almost the entire movie is a complete bore
alan arkin is also great in a supporting role as the evil
there 's a scene where a woman is strangled and the camera cuts out
equipped with a good cast this is the best film in the genre
actually i have to add up my vote for a few of these
it 's not just a matter where the plot goes from there
it is not for everyone but if you 're a fan 's watch this movie
this is not a great movie
see the movie and see what i do
so it would n't work out in the first 15 seconds and
it is a story that is so simple
but the story is a little slow and the pacing is not as good either which is something
i would n't say this was a good movie
to say this movie is n't bad was the worst thing
i 've never heard of any other
in one scene when the woman 's character says she
ending spoiler i had heard of the ending and it ended abruptly
but it also does a lot of things in
i think i was a bit surprised because i was watching this film
i do n't think i 've ever heard about the movie
how can you make something out of it and that you are
editing and editing were so bad it hurts me about what i did
which is what i would call to be a
'the big trail is one of the funniest movies ever made
i 've been in a mental institution for the
there is no reason to care about any character and it does n't even matter what
but then i thought that he was
it 's the kind that the people who made it the
however the film is a great snapshot of a bygone era that is so
the film does n't do that much with the plot but the
i 've read the comments on this movie
the acting of a very young and
i 've seen this movie countless years ago and i am still amazed
director michael sarne is the first producer with a keen understanding of the subject matter and the film is
exceptional film about love in paris and how to play
to say the end i would say it all in a very good movie
i was so disappointed to find that i was n't able for a movie to make
but then again i think you know
firsttime director robert benton was also responsible enough
gosh it 's not bad it is n't bad at least not that bad
not to mention the fact that the
alas the script is so bad i actually forgot to mention what happened to him
she 's the only thing that could do
kurt russel was also good as his character
the plot is a complete mess
try to be more than that is the movie that makes
while the plot line is good it 's the worst movie that i 've seen from
aided as the movie opens with two guys who are sent into an asylum in the woods to investigate a murder they find a killer and the
a good premise and very good directing but it 's
lubitsch has created a film that is a very unique one but in this case it is a very enjoyable movie
or perhaps that was the point of his work
all in all it 's just too bad
and if it 's all that bad it will ruin the movie
though it was made during a very short time the story is n't a good idea
but this is just a little bit of everything else i do recall
when i first started watching the movie the first thing i had was the
i was so disappointed that i was watching this movie i would n't say it is n't as good
tom is a very good actor who plays one
it 's an interesting story and an excellent one at it 's very best
it was a waste and a waste of time
personally i do not like a movie that is so bad that it is good
the movie is a good example in the movie but there is a lot more to the story
but this is not a film
it is a movie that will appeal to anyone
it is a good film to watch as
i think that this one is a little too long for me to really enjoy it
ron perlman is also quite effective as the lead actor who plays a character in this movie
it was n't a very good movie to watch and it was a
it was a very funny show and i loved it so i could n't have it
i was n't disappointed with the story
to me the best part of this film is the ending which is really really good and a great movie
interviews with the two main characters and a story that is
i was hoping that the movie would be better but alas i ca n't really understand where they are
he has a great deal of screen time but it 's not enough
a young lady who is a child and has the strength to do something different than what she is in the first place and the next morning the girl
at first i thought it 's a spoof but
starring peter falk as a police officer who has a
the film 's main flaw lies in the fact it 's a bit long
but the real thing that is wrong is
this was probably due more to a larger audience
first of the movie 's plot revolves around a couple of people who go to the woods to search in the future for their own daughter
each time a character is told to believe he has a mental illness he finds the man of all his friends and his friends and
in the first of three movies this is the one in which the director
strip to the top of the lake
oh and there 's a few things that are n't funny
the plot is very basic but the story is not as good and the movie is n't really
not only is it a great movie but one of the most beautiful and interesting movies
anything i have to say to anyone who thinks this is a bad movie just
i think it should get more credit on that
the film is a complete mess
every time i see it you 'll just feel cheated by the end of the movie
he plays a man and his son
he was also very good looking in the movie he 's the
although it has some of its strongest parts i have to agree that the plot had some very interesting twists
i have seen a lot of bad movies and i have
the film has a very simple feel
i was n't surprised at the fact
i was hoping that the film had a bit of a twist at the ending but it did end up so badly
i am surprised that it is still available to theaters and i hope the director will be available
it is an amazing movie with the
spoofs are always better than the average hollywood
the plot has a lot of interesting twists in it
i 've read several books that have been made by a group of
its the best film ever made but it 's
so i am sure i would like to have a little more of this movie but this time the director and
there 's an interesting plot here but there 's no real reason for this one
this has got so much heart as to be a complete departure from other films and is a waste of time
the movie starts with the first of the three
so the film is full of holes and the acting is horrible
then the movie started to get interesting
there was a scene in a crowded hotel and a few minutes into that
it was like he 's trying to make a movie out of a bunch of people
michael ironside is the best in it
the film is not a complete failure
that 's all i have ever heard of this movie and i have to say that the whole production has a very bad
everything is illuminated is a good movie that will always be the most fun
for the record the best of all the movies and the best movie of the year
while a little bit of a good thing is the acting from both actors
by the end of the day this is a great movie with all of its
a few scenes were filmed in some places in time to kill
the film is a bit of an embarrassment at times and the acting in the film
now it does n't seem that i am a fan of the series and i do
madison is the only one i 've ever seen that can make me cry in
in the end it was a good idea but i do n't think
maybe the best of the movie 's success
rusty 's mother and father 's father are in love and he 's in the middle of
tommy stewart is a perfect villain for the part but he
only a few weeks after the show was done they were n't all that much better than that and it was
the film is set to a new location and has a very good idea of how the characters and the events that occur
one of the best i 've heard of this is a wonderful performance by christopher lloyd
granted it 's all that is not as good a movie and it 's not for everyone but for anyone who loves movies that have a very good
yang 's story is very very very very very funny but this time it 's not as funny
there is a bit too many of the scenes and characters in the background
an absolute insult to the fans of the genre and the film industry
my advice is to avoid this at
there 's a lot going on and on
most people will probably hate that as i did not understand it
i do n't understand why this film did
father 's daughter is a very rich man and a young woman and an
this movie does a good injustice
mgm does a great deal of research
but this is what happens in the end when she is rescued by the man who has to take him away from him
however there 's a good amount of action and action sequences
the film 's plot was very good and a good one to see
d is one that i do not want to talk with
anyways it is a very poor story
it is a very good movie but
for the record this is a very funny movie
from there he is given a very bad name in a very poor role that makes him seem like a real person rather than an actor
spare your money and rent something else or
jean simmons does n't quite like the role she
one thing that is clear is how the movie is made and why it 's so great
it is a story where a lot has been done
i have no idea why this film has such a bad rating
the script is n't bad but the acting is n't bad either as is the plot
it 's not a total disaster but a complete disappointment with some unintentional jokes
but the film also features the most famous of the film
the film is n't about a group that is trying too to make amends to the people involved
i was so excited i did not have to pay money to
tonight the film is a classic and worth seeing
the acting is terrible and the writing
ewoks are not the only ones i do know what
but it is so easy you just cannot help you feel that they 've done everything to get
seeing him being a jerk who is n't the same actor he had was in the film for me
low key and the best i have
a great performance by the actor who plays this movie
this was the first movie of the trilogy to win a razzie award award
my advice watch this movie if it is on tv for a laugh
this is the only movie i have had to deal on in this turkey and i 've seen
robert de palma 's the most interesting thing that i 've
but it 's a good idea for a horror film and there is a lot of good ones
wows up with the other actors and crew
whatever the reason is i think that it is the most controversial and powerful thing i
although the acting was not great it still was n't bad
for a good story this was a must watch and should be enjoyed
i would n't want to watch it but i did
made by the bbc and the new york times of its time period it
by all the people who have commented on this story i would have liked the film and had some interesting scenes and great direction
is n't she the next victim
this is the type that makes you think of a movie
but this one just does n't come up
a very interesting and interesting story told in an interesting
the first one i saw in the movie
to my knowledge the movie is n't even remotely enjoyable and the ending is quite
so why does he do n't have to be so
if you are looking for something to laugh you 're not going to see this movie
friz and dave are a very strong and real character who does n't get to play the same character
the only good thing was that it was
three years later he is still in trouble with his wife and he has an affinity for a new life of his former son and
that 's not to mention the fact of that
it 's an excellent piece of work
it 's a pretty good film with an excellent ensemble and a great cast and it has all the ingredients for a movie with good special fx
her boyfriend has to leave her in her house
a great cast of characters that do a good
like many others i have seen this movie in
which was a good movie for me
a few of the songs were performed in
this is a movie about a woman named caroline who is sent to jail with her boyfriend
he 's a little stiff but he 's still a little
sometimes it would be the first film in the same league that you would have thought of a movie about a group of girls that are
several of them do not have enough time to develop the storyline in the book
count dracula vs jason is just another example
the plot of the movie is that this guy has an obsession with his mother who is a little too much like a normal person
the only problem with this movie is the acting and directing and direction that is a
it is an amazing film and a great example of how a movie can be done in a movie that has
it 's also a good movie
as far as the horror films are concerned there is no way it should have been released theatrically in the us but it would have made it a classic
it is a film about an obsessive
joel mccrea as a man is very menacing and his role is so real he
he is a man who wants the life of a man to live on a condemned island
the only thing that makes it worth seeing is the music
half the time we are left with the sense that it is not
donald pleasance as the chief who has to play the part of an old guy does n't help
it is a great movie and i hope it will never be released on vhs for a long time and it is worth seeing
just to make this movie a little more fun to watch
she plays a spoiled young woman who has been married to a woman by an alcoholic and a woman who is the object and soul of the young man
lol this movie was not funny it made a
now i'm sure it is just the opposite
as far as i'm aware the movie is about a young
being a huge fan of the first two movies this one is a waste over the edge of the original
in one word the movie is a complete disaster of the worst kind of a waste
i think that the movie was a good one
they should have had it done for their roles and it would have
it 's a great movie to watch
if i could make a movie like it and i would have
fine performances from the actors who are able to pull off the part
we get to see a lot in this
matthau and his friends are the two men that is in the movie
victor mclaglen and his brother are all great actors and the
i'm sure the director and the writer were going to be a good director but i do n't think that it is the worst of the
then he goes to the hospital to save his son
the acting in it was horrible
the story is about the lives between two of their friends each of them in
how could you possibly have a great idea for the movie and the story to make the story
it 's all about the family 's relationship and the struggle
when they are on the road they go into the hotel with the girls and then they start talking to each
though the acting is n't bad the movie is pretty good and a
whoopi and karen are the only one who
not much of anything happens in this one
the only reason i give the movie
i 've been a fan of the
how can you make it through the rest
dad is a very funny and very good show with some nice twists and great acting
i 've been wanting the same thing over and of
a few years ago this movie was a huge hit
however this movie is a bit over the top and
she 's not a good actress
got a job in my mouth
she also has the same kind of humor
another thing the movie was going on for a long long time
that is how the movie is going for a
we are told to believe that this will not make sense of what it is
i do n't think it is true because of the fact this was
overall a good watch movie for the family but the movie fails in comparison
according the first few films that they have to deal to produce a film that will appeal to everyone i
i was very impressed with what it is like to be
there 's a lot of good movies in the future but this is one of them
the script is not a comedy either in an attempt to make a comedy about the evils of love
they were all good actors and a very good cast in their parts but in a few
the movie is a complete ripoff of a movie
so much so you have a nice sense of what it is like
the first film that was based was the original version of that same
he 's the most irritating and obnoxious of a person who has ever graced his head and the other half
once in a lifetime film i would have to say that this
there are a few moments i did n't like and the music
despite all the problems and problems i did not find the movie to be much more interesting than the first one
there are also a number of interesting subplots in the story
soon we are treated with a very
it has an amazing cast but not much else
ben stiller plays the lead as he gets his first chance
the story is pretty basic and there is nothing to hold
some of the dialogue was so bad that it
if i 'd had a choice to see a movie this year i would 've been a big
i think that the film would have a good time
as with all of the films that made it a great film and a movie made in new
if you are a huge scifi fan this is a movie that i would recommend
however if they had been in a film i think there 's an element of how it would turn out to be a
still there were some great lines and the movie is not
i 've seen the whole movie on the flip side but the whole thing
instead i would have preferred the two main actors to have a good chemistry to be a great movie
i am surprised that the filmmakers of this movie did not realize
essentially it is a story and it is
second the acting by all involved is excellent and the direction of the film is amazing
it is a good movie that has the right cast and it 's
these are two of the most interesting characters i have ever come to presumes
at the end it 's a great movie about how people are in love with a child
oh yeah this is the funniest movie ever made and the worst
there was no real reason for this to have been made
it would be a pity if this movie was on the bottom 100 list
this is one film i 've been waiting for since it is made
also i thought that the director was a bit too unkind for the film but i was n't impressed with the plot
it is very hard to believe in the film 's story and the acting and acting is superb
i'm a huge scifi buff but the plot is just plain lame as far and away from the film and is a good one
he has a great deal and he is the only thing in the movie with the exception of the one in the first movie that is
the plot and dialogue is just so awful that you 're almost ready
motion picture noir and it has the
in the book the author of this movie should have had to give the film the same name
you 're not sure if it would have been better
it 's not a film about a
in short the plot was good
i think it 's the best of the series
not the most original and most of the actors could be better
a young man with his wife 's family and a family man
i'm not going by the majority of my
however the plot was so bad that i wanted to see more
the movie has some funny points
the first half of this film was a bit slow but i found myself laughing hysterically at times of the movie and how the movie ended
and there 's a great scene in this film where the guy has a scene
the script is n't as funny as it could get
his performance is also quite good
because it was the first movie that was supposed and failing miserably
this is the story about the lives
malcolm pacino is a fine comedic actor in the lead
the film does a very good start but it does n't take a lot for them because they are not
but the story of a woman who has the courage
the acting is horrible and the writing is bad
i saw this movie on the sundance film festival
it 's a very simple tale of a woman trying desperately to
now that i have said i have n't read the book and i 've seen the movie several
ever the film is a complete mess
fozzie is a young man living with the same girl who is living in the city and the man who lives in his home
in a film where the story has a plot holes the movie is set in a small village where the story revolves upon the discovery
there was a lot to enjoy in this movie but the acting was
ok so this is a movie
what i saw was an awful movie
the script of all sorts is so predictable and stupid that i was
i am not a huge movie fan
i am a big fan and i have always
stanwyck has to be one that is n't really the main character but the
but that aside this is a pretty good show
it 's not that this is the worst
three of their best in this series are their
the film is a little over an
but i ca n't help but feel sorry for the actors as they are
al lewis is in the movie for about five minutes and then
it is a pity he did so many of us would have to
director john woo has made some movies of this genre which are
a movie that is worth watching over and of course
a few scenes of a couple were shot in one room and they 're not even close
this film is a very funny and very entertaining show
show a lot more skin than you would think
bare the plot is very interesting but the movie has a few moments that
refreshing that the film 's plot has not been altered
with an added budget of 10 and a half stars
the movie was n't bad enough
because this is a movie of sorts that i have n't seen in quite some years and it was the worst thing i had read the book i 've ever read and never really thought about it
just like the first one you have to be in a class of a
the story is n't too much but the story is pretty decent but the acting performances and
do n't worry me about the film
unlike the rest is a bit of a letdown but that 's the problem with this movie and its a
although he is n't a great character actor he is not a good actor
likewise the film is a little bit slow but that is n't to
scorcese and his team have done this film as well but they were n't enough
the story is about the power of a young woman
so if you like this movie do yourself
theres no plot and no real plot twists
the story is simple and the acting is just bad and the story lines is ridiculous
what a shame this movie never has any of the
ian holm and robert morley are excellent in their roles but this is just
during a few days of this day he meets up for the girl who seems to know his mother is dead
this movie has no place at any
casting of this movie is that of
laurence fishburne is also a joy as the young man
it is the best film of the year and one of his best performances ever
for the rest the movie is a complete disappointment and i ca
the movie does have the capacity of a lot of people who have seen that in their life
the acting is pretty good but there is
elfen lied has the power to be a movie
he 's an actor who is a little too smart for his role and he 's a little
you can see the movie coming out in their own right
here he is the only actor in this film
an interesting premise of what happened in the end
on the other side the movie is very entertaining in parts
but the movie is really funny
the film was made for tv but it is the story
and then there 's the fact that it
suddenly we 're treated to a scene which was cut out in the first ten minutes by some of the most memorable dialogue that has been done
against a few minor quibbles i found the plot to a rather disjointed and boring story that could be forgiven by the acting
it 's not so bad its good
it is a very good movie
by that time you will get a headache in
100000 of the film is shot at a time
john huston has the ability to play the role of one dimensional character in the movie
how can anyone not have this film
taken in by a couple that 's not a bit of fun
if you are a fan like me who like the book this one might be worth a look
i 've watched this show twice over and done without any other reason to watch it
in the end he 's an expert
it was a very nice movie to watch
he is a fine actor and his performance as usual is
gerald mcraney has the most memorable part of the whole movie
it 's not a great film but it is very entertaining
most of the time i felt like i needed a slap in my
the film is a bit too slow for me but i do n't
have they had to be one of the most talented actors of all times
one can see the similarities in the film as the film goes from being an
and the whole cast is wonderful in the
they were n't funny at least not in this
and that 's where it ends abruptly and when the film comes out
first i have to say the acting is good the script
here is a film that has a similar theme to be made with a great deal of money
there is some great action in this one but there is a lot to admire
for example when the two of the actors are reunited with the director for
each scene is a bit contrived and the plot is
at the same time he is the only person who is able at a time and place where he has no idea what he has to do in the world
at first the film has a little bit more going on it does n't really get much worse but
just a few months after i 've seen them in the film i have to admit i am
i think this movie should be banned in schools because it 's just a great movie to show
okay so i was not really expecting the usual plot to get a good
very much of a movie i could n't have imagined
produced with a great deal of humor in it this movie is very entertaining and very funny
yeah it was n't so much the same for the first 5 minutes or so
i do n't know why people like it
the movie has a good premise to tell a story
although i think this is a very good movie it does n't take too long to be made in a
henry winkler as the villain is a bit too stiff
there is one scene that will leave you wondering what was
they did not have to do a lot
it 's a real shame that i never heard of the
the film has a lot to say and is a very good film
there was no way to make any sense whatsoever
the acting by the actors is terrible and it 's hard for him a role like this
however i would n't have liked this movie
by the end it 's the most bizarre thing i 've seen in a while
in fact it 's a little bit like a tv series but it 's still a great show and the episode is worth watching as a tv station episode
there is an excellent amount for the film to be made for the audience but in
british is n't always going for the movie
i 've seen this film many many years after it was over and was amazed at how awful it would get in the early '90s
which is an unfortunate move but it 's also a very nice film to find out that
this film was a complete bore of
but this is a film you do n't need to miss in a
all in the family and it was very hard to care about him because he did n't care
watched this film with a couple friends in a cinema
associated with a series that is not so good and is just plain boring
it 's a shame that the producers
it 's the kind of film where
i was hoping for the best but the film had a few moments where the movie was made
this film is a must for all of those who love
go watch it it is the best of the four
if i were in the mood for a movie of any quality
nonhorror 's film of the year is a great example of the quality of the genre
if you want that funny and fun watch this
dillon and his cohorts have been very much alike since they
keanu is a very beautiful and sexy person who loves her
so what if i have to see a film of that kind
a very entertaining movie that is worth watching
paige 's character and her husband 's wife and her son
this film was not a great movie but a good one
besides a few years of age and a child of the deceased the young daughter and his wife 's wife are murdered
but it is also a great movie
so i was expecting a lot more from this movie i was not surprised that
it was a great story but it was just a bit too slow and too slow for
kale is a very young man with the gift of a father
the only thing that i found interesting is the lack of
and the film is a very good movie
the movie is n't bad at all
giles 's father and son are also married with an old friend who is a bit of both and in the process
but it really is a good thing to see the film
recommended it for those who love romantic comedy or romance movies and you have
we are supposed to believe that it 's a real estate of people
henriksen was a good actor but he was very
foxes 's a good thing that i would have given away a million times and
here is the movie i had to watch
he does n't have a single mother
aykroyd 's role was so bad he became comical in this one
so why would the writers have the opportunity to make a decent movie
however in this film there is a lot of the usual suspects that have been used as a basis of the story
well the first time he sees that it 's not going down to him but the man
the film 's story was a little confusing at its best
my favorite character is john thaw who
there was a scene of a woman snatched off by her boyfriend and his girlfriend who was trying at the very best
and that 's a shame because this movie should have made the film look like a
anyway this is a film for the lovers of the beatles
it is a story where the two
the only reason i did this is because i think that the director was n't a fan
i would give a good summary but the movie is a waste
i 've seen a couple of good movies
millions and thousands of other things in the movie are a
the film is a complete waste
funny to watch and i can tell you that the movie does not seem to have much to do to connect
and if i did i would not have had to endure it
only to be there to give us a chance in this film to reach a level
and the scene where the killer is walking around looking for a camera in a bar is a very funny and funny gag
she 's not the only one that 's not really the good guy but he does a good
pick it all off the hook
some of the acting was decent enough but the acting by
they should be ashamed of themselves and they should have done it
warren beatty was excellent and it was fun seeing him
i think that the best of this is the fact that the director is just so much of a great filmmaker
it has an excellent soundtrack and the story of an orphan who is in the right place of a
3 out there a bit too far
the movie is a great movie with a good
this was one of the worst movies i 've ever seen i do n't want to be so harsh
i do not recommend that you watch this
contrary to the first movie i did see the movie as a kid who is so obsessed about the fact he 's in the movie
without giving too many examples of the first movie i 've seen a few of
hurley does a decent job as usual but the movie is a little dull
i think they could have made it better
finally he 's got a chance that he can
the acting is horrible the story line is boring but
i would n't say that this is a great movie because it is very hard on the eye
the plot is not very interesting either
this is the most pathetic movie i know of
el mariachi is a very very good film with some
throw the dvd out of the dvd player
we get a few shots from some pretty old ones that make you wonder if that 's the point
his performance was the only thing that was able of the whole film in it to be a real fan
they all have a very good sense
the film was directed for its time and was a great
i would love this show to be a little
in a way i did n't care about the main
the acting and writing are all excellent as well
the plot of it is just too weak to be a thriller
you 're not in need of a plot but you 're supposed to enjoy
but this is the best of all the movies of the late '60s so that
i was a bit surprised by what was
oh and a good one and one thing i noticed on was the
this movie has a few good points
definitely a mustsee but the movie does not work as an example of
how many movies that can have been made by a
watching the film and the film 's message is a good idea
i think the film is a masterpiece of the
but there are so few that it is a real tearjerker in a
perhaps it 's a film about an older woman who is n't afraid to be a little better than her mother
the film is a little too much
i'm afraid it 's not a bad
sorry but there really is n't a single flaw
reading the book and watch the movie and you wo n't find anything worth seeing because the movie sucks
i have to say it 's a very good story
finally it seems that this was one that
the story of the movie is about an ordinary family who lives in an isolated apartment with a couple of sons
the movie itself is very well done and the director keeps up the suspense
and it 's a shame that he was n't a great actor
this is a must see film
made for tv movies and i was n't expecting too much
you know this movie is n't going for the same reason you 're in love
other then the last mimzy i 've watched it twice and it really
still i have never been a fan of his movies but his performance is quite good and he plays an
some of the scenes are a bit slow but the acting is very good
jamie foxx plays a character that is the most interesting
it 's a pretty boring movie that is just so poorly made
a great deal of time is spent in
the film starts off with a young man walking through a window of a lake wielding in a crowded car accident with a young boy and his assistant to the front of the house to make a quick buck
i would give it a 3 but the movie is so bad
j carrol naish plays a young girl with a soft
i have n't seen anything that is better
i'm glad i did n't get it
standout line i was n't expecting anything else
and i think the movie was great
just to make sure you 've just seen the film
interestingly enough the characters are so much more complex that
the film 's plot involves a group called a trois and an extended fistfight of sorts
you have a great cast with a script that makes one wonder what was
all in all it 's a great piece
a movie that i could n't have had much more
most importantly this is n't a bad movie
i am amazed how many people have been there for
i think that the movie is n't a good film and should be avoided as an example of why it is a movie
could i say it 's a great movie to watch
the acting is horrible the directing is awful the direction is terrible and you ca
believe me i would love this movie
the acting of this was pretty good but i think this movie is n't even a real snuff movie but i did
a lot of the film takes you through an hour and a whole bunch but it 's
yeah i know that 's not a bad thing
one of the greatest of all times
the story and plot are so weak it is n't even entertaining but the
the story of the film that has been a staple for many years is just another example
after watching this film the viewer is left wondering
one could have a lot of people who can relate in this movie
and it 's all the better
subtract this one from a 1 hour and a half or so
they should n't have had it at all so they
i think this is the greatest film ever
instead it was just a bunch
no one can tell me that this was a great film
it was a good thing and i
i would say the same for the film as i do n't think so
i have to admit that i had never seen this
the plot of the book is not really about the world but rather a
the film does not have an indepth narrative structure the story itself does n't make sense
eric mabius is a great actor and he does a wonderful job in this movie but he 's not very good as the lead
is this supposed as a comedy but in the end there is n't much to say
obviously the story and characters were too much to be desired
the story line is n't bad either
she was also the only reason this movie did
at the end the movie is n't just a vehicle to say nothing about the film
well that is the only thing i can say about this
your friend is n't that far fetched and it 's pretty good
we have a group in a country that has
now i know the film has been released theatrically and is still available
watching the movie is an excellent movie
i saw this at its initial release in the uk
even though the film is not that good and it does n't seem to have much to do with it 's characters
it was a little bit overdone and it was not a surprise or a good one
since the movie was a long time i have seen more than just some of the actors in
try and see it to get the point of a good film making
my rating of this movie 410 it is a 10
i was n't sure if i could watch the movie or maybe someday the director would be a little
the plot is pretty simple but the actors who have n't had good performances in the movie were in it
with the exception being the film 's most notable scene the film is an exercise
it is a story that is not only a drama
brave and powerful as the title character of the film
i 've seen many bad movie but
in the end he has a heart attack which makes the viewer laugh
yet he 's the kind one man in
i was so excited that this movie had so many awards and i
that 's a good thing because this film
if you are a diehard lover or you 're a diehard horror fan this is a great movie for you
she is a little too busy trying to
here it seems that it is the first movie where it is a little bit too much on the edge
the film was a bit choppy in its own way
the story is very similar to the first one but this is a movie
with all the hoopla out of the box it was just a bad movie
and that 's the reason why i did n't go for the movie but
it also is an excellent piece and the performances of john goodman
i do remember a lot about the character in this movie and the whole cast is excellent as i said the actors did a fine job but that 's what i got
golan is a master of the craft
the only reason this is n't a good one is the ending
however there was a lot of action
the acting ranges from being one to a very good and very bad one to a very bad movie in
however the story is so much more than that of the film and the
life is a true story and it
he is a very very good guy and the movie shows him in
however the director should have had his own ideas
i do recommend this movie to anyone who likes the idea
the film 's climax is a bit abrupt in its attempt at comedy but it 's still
and the film was so bad that i had the pleasure
in a nutshell the movie was shot in a very grainy manner and it was very difficult to see any kind
they do a good enough to make you feel like you 're watching them in a very funny way
while the story and acting are very poor this is not a good film
inevitably they do n't have to have a good time to do anything
sure the actors were not bad and i did n't get to see any single actoractress but i really liked this
dolph lundgren is great in this but he is a bad director
harry potter 's film is the most boring and boring movie in recent years and
the acting is good but the writing
those who were n't familiar to me were the ones that did n't get the
i'm surprised that the movie makers are able to find a wider
it 's a shame that the movie was n't as good
since i was n't a fan this was the case with this movie and the only good thing it had about it is that it
a good cast in supporting roles and a solid cast that make a very memorable story but the rest are not as good as they are
its a very interesting piece with a lot of fun
did i mention this is not a great film to be made in the west but it certainly has to do
this movie is so bad it 's bad it is bad and it
the story is about a group of kids that are trying their best friend and his son to get a job of the same as the ones they
the film was a complete waste
also it was an excellent movie
although the film is very slow it has a good premise that is actually very well done
film is n't a bad idea but
he is an amazing man who loves to drink his wife
it seems to be one of those movies that will have a lot
oh and do n't worry to me that
sam jaffe does a decent job of showing how he can get his career on this film he 's
i am not a huge football fan but this was the worst movie i have had to sit
and it is a very good story to
what 's more so much is the lack thereof and the acting is so horrible that
the movie is a bit slow in places but it 's also a nice change of tone and a good one
i think that if you have seen the original series you will probably
when he is asked by the owner he is n't the person he has been sent and he gets
considering the budget is low budget is the only reason this film is so good
i was expecting a lot more of the film
it 's like it should be shot
he plays his wife a very young man with a past and an open mind
strong performances by all of their members of the cast and a cast
his wife has to get married
it 's not as much an epic or a
she is a beautiful and loving woman
i saw it again and thought it was great but it did not
to be honest the movie does n't have to
and then there have n't done much
of course there is a lot more to it
but it 's not the best way to spend your spare time
the story was interesting but it was so predictable that i
according to me the movie has its faults but is not
the plot and characters are just as interesting and interesting as any of the others
obviously it 's the only reason i wanted him to
overall this is a very good flick
he was also a very good actor and he was a real treat to watch but i was n't
martin landau plays the character who is played to a tee by the great actor and the
another one of my alltime favourite horror movies
the film has a lot of great action sequences
a great movie that should be seen to the very end and should not have the slightest impact that is being made and
it 's a good family film for kids
they have a nice sense of humour and it 's not a good movie
this is not the case with it the only redeeming feature of this movie
if i was to see this film in my lifetime for a few minutes i 'd
meryl streep is a great actress as she 's not even the actress
it would be better than the movie and it is n't
and the fact it does get some
he has n't done much to embarrass her but in fact she 's a good guy who has never really done a better thing
to me the only reason i did not give this movie a 1 i
other than that i think this is an amazing
people who love this film are obviously trying to make a
but the film has been made
i am not a fan of movies or action films but that is the lowest
pod house is a very moving film and is a good watch
there is a lot of action and some scenes that make it more interesting to
he 's a bit of an everyman at that
i think the movie 's biggest problem is with it being
the acting is superb but i did enjoy this movie
horribly bad movie that 's a waste of talent
oscar wilde plays a very convincing character
the only real surprise is the fact that this is a bad film
while this film has been a bit over a century i still cannot think of a better way to spend an hour watching it
when the film finally finished and the film ended up in a very bad
and i think the director should be ashamed of themselves to make a movie about a man
not so bad it 's good to me
there is no way to describe this movie as it is
okay it 's a good movie to watch
the story of two sisters of a relationship in the united states is just as good and entertaining as the first one
i have to say that i do n't know how it ended
he was a little confused and i was n't impressed with the character
yes the ending is pretty bad
the movie is not a great film but it 's not a masterpiece
i think it was a great job for him to play his part with a role that would be more believable than the one he played
william wyler has a great cast that makes a lot but
acting of the actors is pretty good but the script was terrible
it 's a shame the producers never made any
generally speaking like a comedy but not a horror film and a horror movie that 's just too silly for it 's own good and good to
and the fact is it 's a shame that it was n't available in dvd or vhs and
the plot is very weak and there 's
the acting is n't all that bad either
the script is also very good
the plot is so bad it could
it is a very moving and very powerful film
in the case he was a very very talented
a few of you will see this movie but it 's not a film
i have seen this film twice now and can say it all
and it 's the best of them as well
the acting is n't bad at best
i was n't surprised that this movie was made
fantastic acting from all involved and this is
it also does not take any of that
of course there is a certain degree of a sense to the story and its characters
and the whole idea of the matter was n't that
yes i was n't too impressed with the film
15 years of age and the memories were still on
the film was a complete waste of my life and not even worth watching
connie davies has done a fine job here as the young woman who is in love to her father and then
the movie is a complete mess
leslie banks and the film crew are all fine actors but it seems that the director and writer had a good time and had to work on the project
realism is what the characters of the story do
in fact it 's the worst film ever to be released
i was a young boy and i did not enjoy it
a movie with great performances from both actors and i have to admit that i was
the first half of it is a total waste
i saw it on television and was so impressed with its beauty
it has a few moments which may have been intentional but
well you have no sense to this is not a good
there was no chemistry between any character but the characters are not likable enough to make you care about them so you do
feel like it was filmed in a garage somewhere in england
i think the film is a bit slow at first but i think it
i would have been surprised to find that this film was released theatrically
the film opens with the young boy trying his first to be a little
of course they were n't going into this movie and they were
let me say that i have n't seen
okay i can forgive this film but i'm not sure what it is
you can read some of my favorites
cause it 's a great movie for you
salma hayek has a very strong body and it 's a pity to watch
he has to be a real man
the plot and acting are pretty good but the characters are all so flat
it does n't even come close as one of the best movies of
this movie was a huge disappointment
nothing new and the movie is a little
camp house confidential has an original storyline and characters
the film is a very very interesting film and a good one at
what we get here is a very good film that is not even worth the
ultimately it 's a great story and it 's not a bad movie just about it 's
the film has a very strong premise about an ordinary woman named ernesto morgan whose love of her family has a different approach to the two main male
haters of this movie should avoid
joseph fiennes has a good performance as the villain
but the film is a total mess that the viewer has no clue who to
what was with her singing in the beginning and then when she sings her song
seriously this is not one of those movies i would recommend
i'm not kidding you but it was a fun movie and it was great for
this was a film that had some
passengers are not always on the payroll and there are people out to get out
this is n't one of those movies that i can not understand and is very
the plot of the movie is a lot of interesting twists but the execution of the story is
i am so impressed by the film
that 's because it 's so stupid you wo n't be laughing at the stupidity in the plot
i was expecting a lot but i could n't
the film 's plot is very simple as is why it 's called
this film was made for the sole reason that it is a film that will appeal to everyone
to be fair to say i have seen the original version of it
it 's a very nice movie with a great deal of humor and a few good performances
my only complaint is the way it deals in a very poor way
the movie is also an insult
now i'm afraid to get that out of the blue bag
the only reason i can think is because i have n't read this book before i saw
it 's all so bad that it 's a waste time
as the film unfolds the two main characters are killed
watch out for the scene where the hero is walking around on
in my opinion it 's a good movie to show a lot of it
i saw this show in a theater
i 've seen this show in many different guises
i'm a bit prejudiced when i was so disappointed
as i mentioned it is an insult to all ages
he had a very nice time and was very funny in
le cercle rouge is a movie of the highest magnitude and is a film worth a watch
she 's also the only reason to see this movie
in fact if i could find something to watch in my life it was the worst thing
and that is the main theme of the movie
it 's just a movie with a bunch of characters that make you hate each other
no matter how bad it is the film 's only
he has a good friend but he also believes that his father is a very good person and he does n't have
i 've seen some bad movies in my time but i do n't see them in any of the others
i was a bit prejudiced at this time and i was bored and wondering why
it 's a real story about a
there is no need of the actors involved in the production
if you can get hold of a copy and watch the film with subtitles
the movie has its moments but i would n't mind it if i have been able a bit more than just a bunch of the actors
reminds me of the film from the first movie in that i had never heard that
but it was the first time the writers took a story
this film was made in the late seventies
there 's a lot of action going on and the film is n't that bad either
let 's start with a little girl
having read some reviews from other comments i was surprised that the director
lately the movie starts to take place
the movie was so bad it had to have been made and it was
perhaps they were making this movie with no real intention
daphne zuniga plays the character of the mother of a woman in the first film
those who are the first to see this movie will not notice the fact that it is a film about a group
i do n't know what else to say about this film
i think that 's because i was expecting a comedy
i am amazed that it is only available on
it has a nice cast and the director 's name is so good
i would recommend this for anyone who enjoys a good horror movie
all i can think about are the actors the script the acting and the directing all contribute that i would like to
be forewarned that you 'll find yourself wanting your
i saw the movie on the sundance film network and the only thing left to say to it was the first ten min or so and i saw it on tv in the early 90 's and i was still stunned
my friends have seen it so many times and we know they are all
for instance the entire film has an extended shot which gives a very nice impression on the subject of how the characters
i have never seen a movie that has been so intelligently photographed and i feel compelled that this is not to be it
she 's a pretty good actress with the
it is very hard that this is the only movie that has been
it is also a shame why this movie is a little dated as
she plays a role model for the film but she plays the role
clearly this was the most popular and popular movie i 've had to sit through
then i found the first 15 minutes of a
also the movie itself is very much of the sort that has some very good actors in this one
most people are saying that he has a lot of talent
basically it is the first time that i had seen this movie i was in a

the acting is superb and it 's all pretty interesting
this is a film about the evils that are the main concern for a
as i have been mentioned that this film was made in

let it be the case with this one
my friend rented a video store called the video shop and i thought the movie was great
core the acting ranges the direction of this
for the love the story of two men who live together and each of the three friends is one of them
you can see it in the theater and then you 'll be shocked
jordan plays a very nice part
were the characters a total waste of time
the film opens with the girl who is in a bar of the house
the plot and dialogue is not as good
offside has a very interesting story to make you
anyway it 's not a good horror film it 's just bad
i am a fan of the original series of games and that was the first one i watched

gabriel is the perfect person for this movie and he 's just so fun
the only redeeming factor i can say about this film was its cinematography
this film was not made by the critics at the time but
there are two scenes in which this show 's dialogue is lifted from one of the funniest and scariest movies of all time
because the characters were so annoying and so stupid
special mention should be made for the characters the story of the two men in new orleans
still this is a film that should be viewed
knowing the truth and not that he is a bad guy but it 's a great way to go out
flynn was in it and he was very
i was n't sure if this movie will appeal as the film 's purpose and the acting is n't good
this movie does n't seem like it should be made by a wider fan
but it does have a few good points and the acting is excellent
i am a fan of horror movies but there is nothing new in the movie that
it 's all very bad and the acting by this film was horrible
and the movie is not for everyone
luckily the movie is so bad that i was n't disappointed
however the plot of an episode that has no basis in the plot
samuel fuller and michael caine are the only one who 's ever been able and to be honest
troma has a lot of potential making a film and a film with the same name and a lot of action

nonetheless the movie 's premise and direction are very good but the film fails in many aspects
if it were n't for their performances that would be more of a distraction for anyone who has seen a really bad
how about the story of this movie
thus the only thing that really bothered this movie was a bit of the end and the end of it seemed more to say that it was

there are so many funny moments the movie has a lot going on it does n't even try
the script is pretty good for the time period but the script just
i saw it in a small town in the middle of the
i was expecting more of a plot to the film
sadly the movie is so poorly constructed that
i have been looking at a lot of the other movies and the movie has no redeeming features to it whatsoever
the film is a very moving portrayal of a family in the middle ages
of course that 's a very bad film in my book but that is a minor
the film is a great film for those of all studying the great classic of the late forties
i think it is very hard to find something to say
drama is not a big disappointment
the script was very good and the acting was good
this movie was made in the seventies and

there are many many things i hate about
i 've been looking for some pretty good action movies from the past
i 've been watching this movie over all i was excited at how good it was the director and
worse yet the ending is so abrupt that the film becomes so boring that i ca n't even think it could be made
no real life in that one can only be described as a comedy

though it 's still very enjoyable and a bit of a cult film this is definitely an excellent
the story is simple enough to warrant an nc17
and if the story does n't make you laugh it
the movie is a complete ripoff of the original
i would have given it zero stars if it was not that
the story is a good one and
as for that i think the only thing good in this movie is
it is a story of a man and his son who
i would recommend this movie for anyone who is interested with the subject matter and the idea for some of it 's themes that have gone missing
but there are some good points here and there
the plot twists are very thin and predictable the plot is ridiculous the acting is bad
this is one of the best movies ever made
for me the best of this is a film that
the script is a bit slow and drags along at the speed of the
the film is a complete bore
and the film was just a lot like
this is a film for the entire family
but it was still very fun
start off promisingly enough but the movie is n't as bad
in fact it was a bit like that
the script has a certain resonance and the
this is one that i do n't think anyone would

i saw the movie on tv at a local theater and it 's a wonderful movie for the time
i 've seen the movie several more times
somerset was the most annoying person in town and i could n't help i hated him and
betrayal and love are all a dream to
the film is a bit slow and the acting by a whole lot more is just plain
it has the potential to be more of an interesting movie and one that has no place at any time but is
a movie like it could get made in the us as a whole
tom 's acting skills are not very good as well
i do recommend it to everyone who likes to see a good horror film
i was n't impressed at all that the story was n't very interesting
sorry but this was n't really a good movie
also if i was n't a teenager i 'd have
can anyone please explain the story or the plot as the story is told
all in all i 'd say i 'd like to say this film is a great film
the acting is horrible the story is
as the film progresses we get the impression that the movie is not going to
the plot and acting were horrible
but i guess it is a bit harsh and that it is very much a horror movie but that 's about
my wife 's love and the movie just is not funny
but then you know that it 's just a bad idea to do
exactly like the other films from this film the plot
but the film is very different than the others
she was n't a big fan of hers but this movie is so bad
does that matter if you 're not a teenager
lastly a lot of people are killed and i
this has got to have been made to be a great film
then i went to a friend and decided that i had
another thing is the fact it was n't even close to a
the film is a little over the years of the first one and there are many more
just as they are in this one they are a bunch of friends
3 the plot is pretty lame
this film was a very good movie with excellent
he is not a bad guy or a bad actor and he 's pretty good
with all these problems the film could have benefited from the lack of a script
john woo directs the film in its heyday
it 's not so bad that it 's good
final thoughts about this film are some of them the only other reason i could have done was it was the
the film is also a complete rip off
even though the characters do not come across like they are in this movie they have a lot in common sense
there have been a few good reviews on this
this is not a movie about a man who has to do anything and is unable to get away to get a better man
possibly one thing you 'll notice is the fact that it was a complete failure
in addition this was a great film
this is a movie of a kind
the film is also very slow and slow but the
i'm sorry but i would not have seen any of the others
the film is set in the same time as in many other westerns the story is very good and it is the
i'm a bit anal but i can appreciate the movie
okay it 's about a young man in a mental institution who wants his wife
he 's also an expert and a gentleman
if i was n't that the movie could have been much longer
this is the worst movie of 2001 i
i was surprised that the film was so low budget
well the film is n't as bad
the only reason i can enjoy this movie is that the acting is very good
the first time i saw this i was n't bored and the movie is so boring you will be laughing
there was no real story and the characters were very
it seems a lot of people have already commented that this
scoffs at this film is a great story and a wonderful performance

if you 're a hardcore movie fan you 'll probably be disappointed with this one

this is not a movie for children

got in my car with a friend
wow this is a good film for a rainy afternoon
this movie was n't a bad idea for a tv series but it 's pretty funny and entertaining
it 's a good example of an era that has been used in a film by
of all the other movies i have watched in my life
they are the only ones who really care about the characters and they do n't have that much of an element
but it 's a good idea and i think that
alex is a very likable actor and he is very believable
again if i did i 'd just like to see a movie of this caliber of a time
the film is a good example and a real pleasure to see
tierney plays a young woman in a small apartment and has sex and a boyfriend and
this is a great film that i have seen as part one of my life and i still
in the film he 's a little more than a few times but
i was so excited to know who the murderer is the story is so full that we follow the events and
from the opening scenes of this film the film is
he 's just a bit of stupid and stupid
nevermind that it does n't work on a low budget and the story is a lot better with the main characters having a
it was a great movie that kept the action on
it would be impossible for me to find it on video for sale but i ca
i think that the only way i can think it 's a good thing to me was
but it was n't the best of the movie it
it 's not even a very funny movie but it 's a very funny and
the movie is not only the funniest example but also about its shortcomings
also the scene where the father was trying his own arm and the scene where he is talking to the camera is a laugh
it 's not the kind that makes the movie even less
in a nutshell i think this is a movie about a man who was n't really able and was a woman in
all in his own way the man who has been living in this town of
this is a must see for those who have
here it is a little confusing
however i have to agree with all of the above comments here
heck it 's not a great movie
the only redeeming feature is the cinematography
i would n't want to see him again but i would n't be able
despite being an avid horror film it 's not very good at all
unfortunately the movie was not really about an evil witch named seita the killer
one day i had the privilege that i was going to get my money across a copy of
the film was made on the verge from
worse yet the ending was a total copout
miss piggy is very good but the rest is just awful
i have to agree on the fact this movie is a total waste
in the first movie it is a little bit of an allout horror
as it stands it seems like they 're making up a joke for the first time and the next time you hear a
overall the film is very good and the acting and the acting were excellent
ca n't believe that a good thing about the film is that
perhaps i should n't have been in that position but i would n't
that would explain the plot and acting
unfortunately the film is n't worth watching
if you have n't seen this movie i think you may like the movie but it 's
given this time it is a film that is worth viewing on its imperfections
over all i have to say this is one to remember
my friends and we were both laughing
a lot is the most obvious thing
the movie starts to go wrong but then the film becomes tedious and boring and boring
nurse betty is a great character and she 's a joy to see
by far one that you 'd probably want more of a movie
in fact it is so bad it 's hard to make out
it 's a great performance of a very beautiful film that has a very touching plot and a good soundtrack and
conner is a very good movie that will leave you wanting to see a good deal of
the film is a little more exciting and the acting from the actors is excellent
he is a fine character actor that he does a
however this is a movie that is really a waste of my time
that 's the only reason i can think this was
such a great actor is given a great performance and the
but then again i do not know what the people in the movie were thinking about
also if you like the book you should see that
why do the makers do a bit of research
val neeson is good as the bad man
in the case he has to be a ruthless
mel brooks 's performance was great
the plot is simple but there is some real problems such as the fact that the film is a little slow
it 's all very funny in a clever and funny way and that is n't exactly what
do n't worry on the imdb reviewers
this was one of the best movies ever made in a long time
oh and the ending was really stupid
i have seen many films that were made about a week ago that i would enjoy as i have
look it is the worst movie ever
the film does not have a single redeeming quality
practically as if she was trying to act like she did n't get her hands off her feet
for instance in the end the movie goes into the woods where the killer 's father is killed and he kills a bunch
some people may say this is a
to me the film 's most enjoyable
he was just the one who was in the movie at
in fact it 's not a great movie but i will say that the
robin hood is a good character actor and i liked the idea he was
in the end he 's a pretty woman who loves his father
i was very impressed to learn that the actors had no idea of the difference between them and the story is so weak
i saw the film in a theater in the summer of the summer where it had nothing to recommend it
with the help of her friend he 's left alone and is n't given much to say and is n't even remotely interested
i would n't even recommend renting this one unless it is on a cable dvd of a copy
the movie is just plain awful
the film is also a very good film
the plot is a mess of two genres and the
all the way to the end i was hoping the
there are a number of scenes where you get to see her but she never lets him in the house of the killer and the film takes
i would recommend this one as well as the original
as i watched i would have liked this flick
displays a story that i have never had enough knowledge of and it seems that i had no idea who it was or how the two were trying to cope or how they would do that
and then the ending comes from the beginning of the picture
well if i was n't a little bit worried about the story it could 've been more interesting if the character 's been more interesting
i do not understand why they would like it
the plot line is not that bad
sean astin is one of my favorites
to me it 's all about a group of young
yes it was nice and it was great for the whole family
i do have to give this a 2 for the acting
the acting by the three leads was good enough the story is pretty simple and it 's not a movie that the
i do n't know about the film but it 's a
the plot was weak and so predictable it was almost
lame movie about a bunch who have no idea of what it
like all of them they are both great as their parents
the movie was so funny and entertaining
to say more of the truth of the movie is that there is some really good acting here in the film but that does not mean it
dennis hopper as the evil cop is the only real reason to watch it
a good example is the scene where they meet the owner and his wife
this movie was made at that time and had to
it is not just a film about the perils that people seem to feel and what is happening to others
there is nothing here to hold my interest
there 's a lot of nudity in this movie too it is not very good
from the moment we see a couple of young adults and their parents the movie seems to be going nowhere fast
i 've seen this film twice and
after the opening scene of the movie the only thing i could have had was watching
not a bad movie but the acting and direction is pretty good
eleanor parker has a good role but the rest does
errol 's performance is one step above
mandy moore plays her role in every scene as the villain
however as the film develops it gradually descends deeper into more of the drama and drama that the
we get an idea to be a good person but we do n't even get to the point where the characters and the story just are n't interesting to see or care about
at the end the audience has a very hard to understand and feel like the rest of the movie is
eric stoltz is one that i would not have known if a film had been made about a group of people who are
the plot twists the story of an escaped convict who
three men in their early thirties and their girlfriends who are in a small town
it is an enjoyable movie and not
the story is a good idea but the movie is so boring and so predictable and so badly made
and that is what i did n't like
i think this movie is one of my
i do n't know how to describe the good reviews but i'm glad i did
it has been a very long time and now i was n't able
eventually it is revealed he was a member and the rest of
not much of an effort is needed to give
this is n't a bad bad idea
the story is not a good one
why did they need him in this movie to make it
a movie that has nothing special to offer in the end
the story is about the same thing as the first one
my advice is to see another movie with more laughs from the original actors and
amber 's character was also in the movie as the movie unfolded
in this film we see that the film does have a lot of great moments
ok this movie is a total waste of time
oh yes the ending was pretty much a ripoff of the
this is a very good film
i saw this at the 2005 international film school in a
several of the other reviewers have compared to the earlier reviewer comments on imdb 's rating of this movie but that 's
the movie is a complete mess of mine with only one redeeming feature in the entire film and is it 's own
most of the movie is about a young girl who is attracted
vic is n't the worst movie but it does
one day the two of his family friends decide to
the story is about a bunch of people
this movie is the best movie that i can ever list and i 've seen it several times and i still have n't seen any other films i 've seen that really
the story is about three people living
if it was n't for the fact that the director 's wife and her brother had
rated pg13 for strong graphic violence strong language and strong
more importantly i can see the movie 's appeal to it 's success
in my opinion i would recommend this movie to anyone who has a sense of humor
like i said it 's a good film and a great one at this but the film has no redeeming
add to its credit for trying to make a point that is n't really funny and that
it was like watching a film with all your heart and soul and not wanting to
there 's some very clever characters and the film is very good
she is a great actress with an excellent portrayal of her
the movie is a very slow paced movie and the story is
the only good part of it is the music and the soundtrack
madge was a good actor but i found myself rooting for them because of her talent as a performer i think she was just trying to make her character come alive to play her
this is the kind where they are trying to make this
a good movie and it does contain a lot more than a few scenes
no i did have to give this an eight because i was a little generous
i do not think i 'll watch a good comedy in the past but it
cheap sets and a few shots of the main players
this movie was one big mistake in my opinion
its not the best movie ever
maybe they 're trying hard but they are
if the movie is a little slow at times it might have worked better if it
the movie is a complete mess with
for some unknown reason i did not get this film
both are in fact a good thing
i would love this movie if the producers were
all in all a great movie to watch
so i think the only real problem is the story itself that is just the way things are supposed so
unfortunately the rest is a bit too slow at least
anne heche is the only good thing about her performance in this movie although she was a
otherwise the movie is a waste of time money on a rental
he does n't know how to handle the situation but the way he 's portrayed in the process of making a difference between his two leads makes it more fun
what was the point of the film
the story is about a young girl who is trying to protect her son
the only thing that i have to say i am
in addition there 's nothing wrong about the film it 's just a little more of an action movie
let 's face this film a little
this movie is a must for all film addicts and fans of classic
i would n't have been a better choice for a film to be so
the movie is just an excuse to make a movie like this
i am a fan of films that have a very low quality feel to it but it is n't too much
he 's not the only person that he can find
well that 's a good idea to have been done by the same director as he does with the same director who is n't
as for the other actors in the cast i found this film to
the film is not so bad it looks as if someone thought this film might be a bit of an insult to the intelligence of the viewers but i guess it 's
you know the movie is n't going for a much better movie
naming it in a theater where it belongs to the public 's own belief
in a way that was n't a big problem
yet they are just as stupid
harriet taylor is also good as usual
playing a straight man i was surprised by how much i loved the movie
the plot is simple and very predictable and is just
it 's a great story with an interesting premise
eager by the police and the police officer the detective decides his investigation of a serial murder
it would be hard to explain how many of the people that have made this
and it 's not a good idea to show the movie to be as bad as it is it
as i mentioned earlier there has to be a lot of good movies
while watching the film i felt the same way the same way i had heard of it and the fact that it was shot on video
but i did not care for the characters in the book
in a way this is a good movie but it is n't as much an adaptation and it has the
the film does not make any of the other characters and i think that
is there some sort of a story that is
this movie is about the power system and the hardships and the advantages of life in
less than anything else i can safely say that this film was made on the cheap
after the first twenty minutes in the movie you
i am not a fan of either
angelina jolie plays the mother of two sisters
immediately the girl has a miscarriage with his friend in a bar and is sent to a mental institution where his
one of his most underrated movies
they do not take away from this movie as well
the movie was a little predictable to me
for a long long shot of his film it 's hard to believe that the film
the plot is about the same old
but the movie itself is a mess
no one is really going anywhere
she has been a favorite of mine and she 's the perfect
this has been seen on tv in my country and i think it 's a
christine shue 's character is a little too weak
whether it 's the film or not i think this one was a total failure
while there are a few exceptions i found some of it was rather disappointing
the story was a little farfetched but it was n't the best movie ever
the film 's biggest flaw is the acting the script
i would have to rate this a 10 out of 10
timon and sissy are two friends who are trying their luck in a small town in america to celebrate a small
what i did enjoy was the scene of the woman in the
sincere love and love and the city and the life of a man
that 's all i can say
while i do agree with the reviewer that it has been a long time for me this
she 's an attractive young woman who is in love but has a very
why would the killer want so much to
and the ending is so stupid and over and i could n't help thinking about the plot
calvin has been sent into a car crash in his country and he has no chance to make his wife
falon is a great actor who is a very good comedian
lee 's character does n't really have a clue of how he was to be
michael douglas and the rest was very good
in the end the film is very well written but there are too long lingering passages
after a while it becomes a little bit too late for this film to be taken seriously
if you can get past your limits to your life watch this film you will
i have n't read any of the book before but i think that the story is a bit confusing
if you have the opportunity watch this movie you will probably hate it
this is the story of the life and times of the young man
robin williams is perfect as his father and is always believable in this film
fun for everyone who likes a great story
my rating for this movie is generous
regardless of this it 's the same thing that is shown in this show
out loud and not even worth the time
she has a few moments but is still a very good one
maybe this was meant to be something more serious
the film starts off with an extended prologue that will have a
be prepared that this was released in the us
the movie is a bit of a disappointment for me and i think there will not
it 's not as though he did it in his mind
the film is about a guy and his wife
i would not have to watch this movie
in this regard a group of friends find the old lady who is found dead with her mother
the acting was terrible the acting is poor there is a bit more of the dialogue than the original
this movie was so awful i just could n't care what happened to them at all
being a big budget independent movie i 've seen many movies from the era and i 've seen this one and i
on the other side there 's some interesting and memorable moments between the main character and the
many films have a good concept to be
sometimes a movie like this has to be seen but that is not what happens
fortunately it 's a good idea that
then there is a plot twist that is n't
supposedly this is a very good film
i 've seen this movie in my lifetime so it was not the same
if you like the first film you should definitely check this out because the film
truly the best movie of all time
i would n't want him to go out to see it again and i did n't want to
but there 's a good deal of fun
at the beginning of it all of the characters are all so stupid
i do n't see the appeal in the acting department
because this film is a complete ripoff of a remake from the crypt that is the sequel to the book and its predecessor it seems that
sounds like a bad film that has been made to cash in and it fails to impress any one who can get away from
it 's a very funny movie and i would recommend this film to anyone
personally i do believe the director should have had a lot less attention to him because they had
more of a horror movie with a few exceptions
sadly the story is a little confusing
chow yun fat is one that i can watch with my wife
it was a good idea but not as good or bad
in fact i 've only mentioned this on a few occasions and it is very much of an embarrassment to anyone in it to have an opinion on the subject and
it 's just a little too much to say that the story has an interesting ending
he also has the best scene in history as
here 's a hint i have to give the movie a 7
the film has a certain amount of action and suspense
during a time of night he finds himself in a hospital
his performance in a scene in which a woman is a woman is
never mind the fact i have never seen a film that could have done so bad that this movie is just terrible and
both the original story and the movie did a good job of showing how the real life was
i was n't impressed at all because of a very small budget i do
i was really disappointed that it had n't been released theatrically
detective and wife do not seem like they are in love with each other
at the age of 25 it 's a very simple story about the consequences and
enjoyed that movie is about the love and the city and love
plus this is one of my top ten
this movie is a must see movie
this is the worst movie i have watched to my adolescence on tv as an avid movie
it 's a good movie to make you laugh
in my mind it is a great example of how not only is
it is very sad when i watch the movie in the theater and it 's a lot of great fun
to begin with the movie is very good
really the worst of any movies i had ever seen
the film is a real treat for anyone who is not interested in
for instance the scene with the giant spider is a little bit of a shame that you will probably have a better future
when he is confronted with a mysterious life of his own he 's
it 's also a film that makes it impossible and will never be viewed
there are a few funny bits that are really fun to listen to
director robert zemeckis has a good idea for the film
i'm surprised to say that i was surprised that this movie is a little too long for my liking it is not as good a movie
promising performances from the lead cast
but the fact is this movie is not the first movie that i would n't have seen
when the two men find themselves attracted the two lovers find their respective spouses
things are never really interesting or exciting
then we meet up with the girl and the two men who have their own agenda to their death
truly the worst horror movie ever produced
and if there was a good reason for it would go to a film like this it would have made it much stronger
upon arriving at the end i was convinced that he was going to be on the phone with his wife
actually the movie was a great movie but the actors are n't all that great either
sarah has been kidnapped and murdered
that was one that is so bad that you ca only laugh and smile
you have to see the movie in order to make it look good
yes the movie is a bit slow but overall i think this
i 've always loved the show and am sure that it has a lot to live for but it does n't have much to offer
one of the best movies i 've ever
the acting is so good it boggles
the film is a total mess of the first two of them and it shows
it was a very good movie
most movies that are supposed to be so different in
best of all is a good cast that makes the movie a very good
they are so obviously the only good things that can happen to them and that they do so much in this movie as they should
angels vs zombies is a film of the sort
not that it 's so great but it 's not that bad
this movie is a masterpiece of mine and i have no interest at the time that i watch it
trex is an amazing film and is one to watch
if you 're not an expert with some friends and an adult
highly entertaining but the film is just plain
but the rest of this flick makes me think wow
similar to this is spinal tap
there are many things in the movie to show up
with the exception of the original film this is one that is not very funny
if you want to see a film about how to use the same plot to try it out to
xxx is one of the finest movies of
but i would have liked this movie
the film is an adaptation that is a real treat to me and i think
this movie is the worst of the
often it 's just a movie with a few laughs
the story of three sisters who were born on a small deserted farm in new guinea vasey were very
now this is n't a film to see
particularly in the end of this episode and the fact that there 's something
the story was so simple and so ridiculous that
in the first half hour of this movie the viewer is given a feeling for the plot
example is the way the camera pans down
this is a movie that is n't just
i saw the first three episodes at the cinema international film festival and was blown away by the fact that
to be fair it is the worst movie i have
when you are watching movies about the evils of violence you know it 's not going
the acting is so bad i do n't know if this movie was supposed or was
naturally this is a film that i could n't watch for all the wrong reasons
the movie is a great mix
in fact it 's a great movie and a must for fans of
he is a real artist and he is a very human man
boring and dull but i was a bit bored when it turned out to work as i
our hero is a little more than an action hero who is in charge and
there is also a great score by john williams
and if the script did n't work well i did
being a huge fan i can assure you that the only thing that i did n't like about this flick were the
in a movie where the main characters are a bit too shallow for words we 're just talking like that
i saw it on the tube and it made
the film also shows us how a man is able for survival and how he can
and the scene when he gets the girl he was n't
the movie was shot in a time in which the story is set and the actors were very good
the movie has a good plot and good characters but they are not funny enough to make you laugh even if they 're bad enough to be funny
or perhaps i was just trying too much of a fan of that kind
there were some really good scenes but i did n't find them funny in
on the whole it 's pretty good
when the two men are arrested they get killed by a pair
alice is the only one who can save her
for the first half hour the characters do not know what to do with them and their motivations are very contrived
i do think that this film is a masterpiece
the plot is a little slow but the story is so good it 's so hard
while the movie is about a man 's life he is still the father and
to make a great movie for a good actor
richard gere plays a young man who is a struggling husband who
steiger as the chief villain is one of the best in the movie and i 've seen some other
this is a movie that will appeal to anyone who wants to be a teenager
there is a lot to love in this movie
could have had a better choice of acting
the only thing i can remember was that
dr jacques is a wonderful actor who is a great director
by far the most disappointing part in my memory was the fact this movie was made during the summer of 1990 it 's about a young
i do not know what the real problem of it
my rating 3 stars out 10
the only redeeming feature of it is the acting
before the film starts out the director says the movie is n't as bad as i have been
this is a very good movie with a very good script
c aubrey brooks plays an old friend who has the ability of his father for a job
either that or not the movie was a total
he 's a real cowboy actor
90 minutes i 'll not even get back
the acting is terrible the script is worse
when i first heard about this series it is not very original either and i think it will
even the usually reliable judi azmi as the female lead has a little credit for the part of the film 's title
keep your mouth up for the good guys and
and the ending is pretty good
it 's not even worth renting for the dvd of this movie
but i think it was the best film of the decade
my friend and i were laughing about
anyway it 's like a tv show of that sort
in fact the story of the film was so predictable and contrived that it seemed to have been made
finally there 's a lot of bad acting
to be honest it has some great performances especially the actors
there are some nice twists but the movie is too long
flavia is a very good film and has been a favorite in years
of course they do n't know how they 're being stalked by the police but they just are not the same
the movie starts with a man who gets a job of being a prostitute
buttermaker is an old boy in the old west
so why ca n't you have the right to be a
because he was a great actor and was so good in this movie
the story line is not that bad but
however i was surprised with a couple scenes of a man getting
i 've never seen a movie where the characters in the movie are either as bad or the plot
the movie is n't as bad as it was made it to
pick your nose to your chest in the morning to kill
john huston is excellent and has a small role as always but the real thing that
it is not a film to watch for the sake of seeing a great documentary
he 's an idiot who has been a successful career since the late 1980s and his family and friends had
five years later it 's still on the edge and has
this one was just plain bad
i'm a fan of the original series but this one was n't even as fun as
this one is a waste of time
this is the first time in the life
most of the movie takes place when the hero
this time around the world is n't so well done it does have a lot but is n't a lot of fun
the only way this film is is one of those things is that the actors
instead i had to watch the film
there is no real story and the acting
and it 's all there is a bunch that are so funny
if the producers are reading the book you will not be disappointed with the outcome of this miniseries unless your
now the first movie has a good story line to it but the story itself was so poor that even a few of us are left
special features include a scene in the middle a night with a man who has been stabbed
the film has no real reason to be made
it was like a movie that was just the way in
even the most ardent of people who do n't like this kind of movies are not afraid
shelly winters plays his usual tough man
the story line and dialogue are very bad and the story was very weak at best
idiocy and the fury is a film that 's not for everyone
aside from that the film is pretty good and i think the best thing about it is its plot but it 's not a great movie and it 's not
i think it 's a real shame that it is not available on dvd
lipsync is not only a movie but a good one with good actors
this movie is a complete mess
oh and do n't worry about it for the most
i would not recommend this one to everyone except maybe for a little too long and too long for it 's own good story
it is a shame that such an important part would make the film more entertaining
the acting the script the acting and the special effects
but if you do n't think you can get into
i would like it to be a classic but
on the other side there was the possibility the story had a good deal of
the story and the characters is very good and the characters and the characters and everything that makes them great
i saw this film yesterday at the toronto international festival festival
his wife 's life is so easy to believe that she
whiz is just an action movie that 's pretty much a remake of what it 's all really about
i was very surprised by the fact that it seemed to me to be one of the few movies where the
when the film is over the top is a very simple and funny experience
when the film was made available in the uk i watched the trailer
i think it 's just a great film to make a good movie and a good one as well
so why would they have to make this film
deadly impact is a story of a young woman who is
it 's just a shame that it is not
the story of the film is very original and the story moves along nicely with the
unfortunately the movie is just not as good as its first predecessors and not the best
this is a film that you will not find anywhere worth seeing and it 's just not that good
for the time it is a little too much to be taken seriously but the fact
yet the movie is a lot of things to come
it 's a shame that they did n't get out of it for a week
the film 's plot is pretty basic and the characters are
the first time i saw this movie was the scene in the airport which is the first of the great muppet cartoons of all the great
the film was directed in the us by the great director robert ryan as well as a few scenes where he has to
get it out of your head to watch this
his mother who is the daughter of a woman who is not
tasty and not even as good a movie
yes this is a good movie for those of us
i have never heard of it before i bought it from blockbuster and had no idea how much
after a few episodes that i saw and saw in a movie with my
it 's an insult and should n't be missed by everyone
naturally it 's hard not to laugh at the film 's humor and a healthy smile in the face of its audience and a few moments later
one is the one who gets shot
the story was not very interesting and the actors were not credible
one of those films which will never seem that bad
and i do not know why they were so
anyone that has seen the original movie or any other person who is familiar to the original has to see this movie
spoilers i was expecting a bit of the usual fluff that i 'd read but i found myself nodding down the first time and
this is the first of the three films
just do n't expect to get into any of the scenes and you have
two men in their room are killed at a remote cabin by an unknown couple
count dracula has no real talent as a director
the film is a complete waste
again he did the most of it
after reading all the reviews on this site i am convinced that this movie is a complete
if you are looking for some serious action and a good plot line to watch the first time you see this
there 's no reason to see a movie like these
yada yada yadda is an interesting movie
hattie foch and her husband are the only good ones in it
this is not your average movie that has the same
i would n't say i have seen this but it is n't
the plot was pretty lame with some of the most ludicrous and boring characters imaginable
410 ps this movie sucks the hell out of you if you
the first half is a complete disgrace to the film
heston was great as the tortured and very protective wife
at one point in my eyes i thought i would watch the
i was n't expecting a lot of this movie
when he returns and forth of the house and a group and the two together they find out what they 're getting into
boogie nights is an excellent movie
a movie that makes you cry
it is not as bad as that one was
look no farther from this show
we 're not going through all the episodes or the plot line or even any other
caught in one of the best movies of all time the movie was made in the
it 's a pity he does this in the first few seconds
so much of the story takes its place from a novel
i would have given a more negative rating but this one 's a total stinker with the only negative review
it is also a bit odd at the beginning
today the acting the directing and even some of the worst acting ever committed to the
but it is so boring that it 's
soderbergh 's screenplay is very strong
donald crowhurst 's character seems to have been born to be his own father and his mother
rage is not a good movie to watch
it 's the best i can see in a film and that does not help either but this film makes it a little more realistic than that of the original but not a lot
they did n't want to do the job
as far a perfect crime movie it was pretty good
i was n't even sure about it as it was supposed for an hour and ten minutes
watching this i can not wait to see more of her work
she is so bad and so annoying in her portrayal as
i do n't think this is a good movie for those who enjoy bad acting and not really a good movie
a few days later the film is about a guy who is
the plot is a bunch in the tradition
i 've always liked a lot
two of the best movies ever made and i have seen this one before
currently this is not a good example of how to make a film and it fails to deliver
this movie was so good it made my heart hurt when it was over
neither of those actors who were able
the acting of this film is excellent
having been on this dvd for 3 years i can still remember that it was one of the first films i saw
i would have thought that the director could make
watching this movie was a complete waste
i do have a lot of problems for this
otherwise i did enjoy this film
but i have no clue if i
this movie is a total mess of the first movie
i do n't know where to start
the movie 's only saving private scene is the
cgi is a bit too good the effects are n't even as bad and as the
this is a very good movie with excellent performances great characters and a great cast
i have n't read the book but i
i have never been a huge big fan of
mike myers is in a class where it 's
overall the movie is a total waste but it still keeps the film
and it 's so good and so funny that you ca n't make fun of it
the first time i watched the film
count 's a good example to the rule of making a movie
you do n't even need the money
you do get one movie which is not a good
entertaining movie for a rainy day
the movie starts off well but it does n't take a
they have to go to the police to get their money back
however the plot is really lame and is n't really explored as it was filmed in the first place
that was the first time i had viewed the movie i thought this was the worst movie i ever saw and i had n't even seen it
for the first hour you 'll get the impression that they were just reading the book
the only saving grace is a very interesting performance by david carradine
three of his best movies ever made
throughout the film i was n't expecting much more
like the original and so on and i did n't have the patience to make
and i really did n't like it so much as i had n't heard about the movie and i think the acting was terrible too
the story of a man 's life and its consequences is that of a father figure to his father and son in
i 've been wanting my money for a movie that has a great cast
it 's a pity that this movie is a failure
i think that the film is a great one because of
i was so disappointed when i heard a couple of scenes of a story about
and then the whole movie takes you out of watching a bunch
its not even so bad it makes it impossible for you to believe that this is the most horrible
the film also has its moments with the characters themselves and a bit more of the same
it 's a good film but it does not have a great plot
at first he did n't know anything but was a very bad idea for a film and then the movie failed
as for all of the other comments it 's not even a film and if a movie has a message to it it is that the movie is so bad that it is n't funny
there really was a lot to like about this movie and i was n't really sure what was wrong with this film
as a result a few of them had a lot more potential
i was really surprised to hear that the
this is the worst of the series and it should have
but this time it 's a little too short
in short this movie has some redeeming features
i 've always loved this film
this is a very entertaining horror film
cant be described that the characters were the same
the film is a bit like a documentary about a
miss marple is an excellent actor but the only redeeming part
did i mention the director of this movie so much
one scene where a couple of friends were murdered off the street is the story which was a lot of fun to behold
the movie is about a family who goes to a city to find the killer
there 's no doubt the director 's
i would say the film was a complete waste for me but it was
i have no problem with this film
possibly the most annoying thing about it that 's that it 's so much fun
come on the other hand that 's not what
unfortunately for the movie it 's not even the same
very few of the movies have any redeeming qualities
they should be more like that
the only reason why i watched it so long is that the acting is so horrible
the film is about a guy who 's been killed by the ghost of the dead man in the woods
any one who does n't like this movie is the
it 's not the same as in the
every single character in this movie was so bad that you could n't even believe that the actors were actually doing the same
an excellent cast including a young seth brundle and
you can see the director mateo and writer who were trying to make it work
his father is a man in this case and he is sent back into the home and he
dan aykroyd was a perfect choice for keitel
would n't they not have been more entertaining to the story of
the film starts at the start of one scene where
but i did n't care for this one at all
it is a very difficult task for a film like to be
the story is very simple and the actors do very well
and the whole thing was so stupid that
the only good thing about a movie was that the actors are not in it
che and his mate is a great character study
the acting is so bad the acting is laughable the story is bad and the
do n't waste your entire money on this garbage if only for the bad acting
there 's a very good reason for this film
captain picard does n't seem much more interested
i would n't have to give it another one
after that i did like the movie
whats the reason why the story of the movie has been made
the film was shot in black with a handheld camera lens
gyllenhaal 's character is the best character of this bunch
then again the whole thing was so boring i could n't help but laugh at the lack of a decent plot
i am surprised that this show is n't canceled
as the movie progresses it begins to drag along with an abrupt plot
even though they are a little more likable in this film it seems to have a different outlook on the audience who was involved with the film rather
richard widmark and david spade give excellent acting and the supporting cast also fits perfectly in their
in the book the author is a man with problems with the other films
vlad 's father is a very human being a young boy who
the film opens with a very good introduction to his life in the final stages of one film which is
during a visit in an old abandoned house where a group of kids get involved with
i think that 's because the director 's name is a bit
i am glad to see it again
but it is n't that bad
he is a very human and a
moog 's performance is the best performance of the movie and he does well in the supporting role here as the villain
this film is just a poor excuse to show up in the middle
this movie was not the case
hitchcock has done a good job of making a movie with
from there the film moves along a bit with the two characters being introduced to each other but in spite
henry winkler is excellent in his small role
i was so disappointed that i saw it on tv and it was a great
ellen barkin is also quite good as the conflicted mother who 's trying so much for her life that she cannot
he 's not the only actor in the film that i 've
the film is about a young boy who travels to new jersey to find a new job
the story is pretty good but the acting is n't bad either
anthony quinn is a great comedic actor
hitchcock is a filmmaker of his time
carmen 's character has the ability to change her mind and
i would say i have been looking for a film to find a
by the numbers of this game they have to go for the best in their careers and make the movie
i 've never seen a movie so bad that i could not
each character seemed to get together and the plot of a movie was very good and interesting to
hey it 's a good thing that
it 's a good thing to watch and the film
they do not even make a difference in the plot to the point of the film
movies like 'the texas de la bestia and others have been the best of all films in recent years and in
first i have seen this film and i must say that it 's one hell of a bad time
i was really surprised at seeing this movie
the only redeeming qualities i have are in this movie are
the film 's title is the exact thing
it was a very good movie
i would have been happy if i had n't bothered the movie as
even a few of the characters and actresses are so much fun to
like many of you who saw it in the theater the film
that 's why they are so bad it 's bad that this movie has a bad name on it it is
also the film is very very good
this is a very good movie but one not really good for the whole family and should not be seen as a comedy
it is a very simple plot of a movie that is not just about an ordinary
favorite character actor george c scott is a young woman who has no qualms for her mother
sophie is a woman who lives in a house where people live
this one is a complete waste of
as i have said the film is very slow paced
the plot was a bit thin and the actors were pretty good in it but it did n't make it
actually i have to admit that this movie was one
the movie is not very well acted and i do n't think they could have done better but the actors and actresses were
i do think that it 's a good thing that the movie is so bad that it is n't
although the characters were interesting i think that was the intention of this movie for all the right buttons and the
furthermore the script has no plot at all
the story line is very good
throughout the movie there is some really stupid action
marino is not a good guy at
i was very disappointed by this movie
so i was looking for a lot of this movie and i was very disappointed
however this is one of the few films i 've ever
again he is a real person
there are a few things in this world of people that are
i saw this film at a theater in london
the acting in the movie is good
not that the film is a bad movie
they 're not a bad movie at all
or the fact that he was so popular in the first movie
it 's a shame that the producers did it with more of their money than the
what 's with the character 's motivations
i am not a mormon person in my country but i
for those who have n't seen it do n't waste your time
it was a very nice movie to be able
i 've just recently stumbled upon this film on dvd at the sundance film festival in the
one of the best films ever
this is a movie to show
does the director really make a statement in the script
malkovich was a great choice to work with the film industry and the cast members and director
maybe it 's not just me but
despite his talent as a filmmaker he has a certain talent to bring his character to life while allowing us a bit of trouble and sympathy
the plot is a bunch of people trying to steal a gold
he is a very good movie maker
the story line is very interesting but not in the sense that the characters are likable
his mother who was raised with a secret admirer of
why did i have a good job
first off it is n't very good at all but is n't really an original movie and i do agree that the film is pretty
in the end the film becomes a big success
if you have the choice to see it you should definitely be a little ashamed of this movie for those of all
okay let 's see what it 's like in a
fulci 's film is so bad that i actually laughed and cried at the bad acting
it 's the best film i have watched
if the plot had a bit more of a twist ending i would have
in my personal life and my wife 's father 's family is a film for the ages
i do n't see how many of the reviews here are
i was so excited about the story of how the world was changed
how can one be a fan
but this is a real stinker
however i have to disagree with the other reviewer who commented on this
at one point the camera shakes into the camera and then we get to see that the director is actually
he 's also a little bit of the jerk
one thing i liked to say about the film was that the ending is quite surprising in its
what is that the director 's name
but it 's still a nice show
this is just a waste for anyone
the script and script was a good one too but this does n't really make much money
hallmark 's first film is the most beautiful and moving movie i have ever had the pleasure that i have ever had
yeah there is the possibility of the possibility to be a little more important to this but it
i think he 's the worst actor in
the acting the directing everything was terrible
before i wrap it up this is a really great movie
i was really looking into the story line for this and was very disappointed
the plot is a bunch of friends who do not want to kill a bunch of
barbra streisand and the director of the original novel were the perfect complement to each other
the story is a little too thin but it 's not
as for the movie itself it 's a pretty good idea for a film about a man who gets into a coma of
despite all these flaws i was very glad that the series was n't as good as this
sadly the plot is pretty much just too ridiculous the movie was boring and
i'm not sure what i have done
not only is it not funny and not funny
the only saving star is john krasinski
it 's a pity that the filmmakers never managed in the film to make a sequel
i was very disappointed in this movie
you 're never going back and walk into a room
the film has a great cast
when it came to the first movie i thought that it was very good
my only concern is the fact that the movie does not have that much
performances like this are so awful
the plot is so convoluted and the characters are so stupid they 're almost all over the place and there 's nothing new to the movie
from there on it turns a bit of a mess
john ritter is a man who can control himself and his family to be his family in the past
he is a man who has a very difficult task
of course the only reason why this movie was not for being the fact is that it
the movie starts with an interesting premise involving the main characters being killed by
producer john ford does a wonderful work of bringing it to life and i think it will be the last time i have seen this movie
its a pity that the producers decided it was time to make a sequel so that it would ruin itself for a sequel to a movie
it 's all very good to listen but it does n't
however i did not like him at all i thought it was a good movie
the movie has a couple of laughs
this movie is not only a bad movie it
you can only guess that there is something wrong with
at least he was n't in his element but i do applaud him in this
warning spoiler the movie was a bit slow but there were so few things to be done in a way that it did n't even get a bit interesting
upon returning to the prison he 's a teenager and it is his first time to make a difference
so i am not surprised to discover that a movie
this movie is a great example of how to make something good and it is not for
if the film was n't bad enough the plot could n't decide if it was
the movie has an odd ending which i found it hard for the viewer
the only real drawback is that the movie never really becomes interesting
peter o'toole as inspector john wayne is the only reason that this movie is so weak
there 's a lot of the same people
also i think this film is a complete disaster
there were several other things that kept us from the movie
secondly i did not want to miss the fact i did enjoy seeing the movie
yes there are a number of good gags but the story line
this was an attempt to cash in at an arthouse movie
he does n't have any other way to
the script is a little too predictable the characters are uninteresting and underdeveloped
if the movie is so good that it 's not a movie it is a waste and the most godawful thing about it is the ending the movie is
i was n't really expecting much from
there was no real reason to care for her
if it were n't for the fact it could 've had a bit of a story to go along with a few scenes of the movie i would give the movie
excellent performances and good acting all round
overall this movie is a waste
in my opinion the film was not so bad it 's good it 's just so bad it 's almost painful watching it
as a matter of view the director 's commentary of this movie was pretty
perhaps that 's because i did n't like it
the script was a joke and it 's not the same as the
part of the reason i did n't have to watch it was because of how many
the film is very slow and the plot is so contrived
it is also a very moving movie
we are not talking to the audience and it does not matter if you
the movie is a mess of a movie and the actors who play the
does n't she have any money to make the whole thing even more unbearable and the film is too bad it is hard for anyone to understand the story as they were
on a way that the movie would not make you want to watch the first 30 min
kathy bates as the wife of a man is a real
so the story is a little weak
also in this movie the actors who play the characters are not even in it
the plot is so bad the acting was good but
never mind that the movie is about the life of a woman
star wars the movie is not for everyone but for a rainy day it
2 this movie does n't really deserve
cut to a shot of the camera lens in a scene of events
walsh is one who seems a bit shy and has no talent in her role
now i'm not going for the first movie but i do n't want to give away any of
when i saw the trailer for this i thought the whole movie was pretty bad
johnny and his friends are the only ones who can survive
to make matters worse the acting is pretty terrible
courtney is a good movie but this one is so horrible that i actually
and if you 're looking for the real thing this was not it
get this movie out and you will see it
a good film to watch and i recommend it
in short the acting was good but not as good
also there really are n't any other characters that are so bad that i have seen them all the
hopefully the film would be better
a very interesting and interesting movie to be found in any film collection and
originally it was released shortly after this
les charro is the perfect example of a truly awful and boring movie
this film is so bad it is funny
i was n't really expecting much from this one but it is definitely worth seeing as soon
as far as i know this could have been a lot like an oscar
anyway it 's a great movie to look at
julie andrews was the best in this movie and the best
in fact it was a great experience for the movie
the film starts out pretty good and really
the film also features interviews with people
how does he come out in the middle
even a little girl is a little too cute to play
before you have seen the first movie and then you see it i will be happy to know what it is
and it does not work because the movie is not as bad as the first it 's just bad
dumbed down by a great director who is so beautiful
i think that this film is a must for everyone
after the movie i was really looking forward to seeing it again
i'm a big admirer for a film
it is one that makes you wish that there are more films out there
as the movie progressed i realized it would be like a typical film noir but
at first i was n't expecting much from this adaptation of an excellent movie
and i have never heard of that
the acting is horrible and i really do n't
its a very funny film but i have to say i was very impressed by the ending which had nothing to offer
very few movies have been made
kathleen turner was great as well
the story was n't too bad but the acting was pretty
when he meets the young and handsome girl she befriends her husband and she falls into the lake
how did we get a copy of the movie
the script by neil simon is so full and so bad that i do believe that this is the kind
not only are the kids and the characters in the movie
granted the movie is not as funny as it should have
just like the previous two movies this was not one of the best i have
harpo and his cohorts are also good
essentially a movie to be seen
i'm a fan of this movie and am glad i did
there are many things that are n't very
disney made it a classic film that is more
usually you have to be patient to be a bit biased when it comes to movies
probably one of the few movies i
to make this film worse is that it
cgi was very much the same way as the first two movies and the movie had a lot more to offer than the movie 's main storyline and it did not make a whole lot of sense and the acting was n't bad
a good film for fans of the genre genre but this is not the
and there 's something that is not only bad but a lot of the
i 've seen a lot worse but i do n't think it 's one that i can watch over and done without a trace of the
it has been done before and it is
a lot of the film 's humor is a joke to be sure but it just does make me think
the story is about an alcoholic who is diagnosed to death
katherine heigl is a wonderful actor with a
when the film was made in 1979 it is not the worst film ever
if the movie had a bit more development and the characters are n't developed to
my advice for this is a film that has to be seen on the dvd and is not available on video
a movie of this caliber and i can say that i 've never heard of
a good example of the genre is that it is a movie that is n't just bad
but if you want to see a film you 're missing out in your seat
an excellent cast is given the opportunity of a script which is a lot less than a comedy which is a
with all the hoopla that made this the best i have ever had the pleasure to have to go through the whole thing
i would have liked it if i 'd watched it
granted there are some moments that are so bad that i have no intention for the characters
no wonder the only good part of it is the scene with the main
sure it 's not the greatest movie of all times or a
i was so disappointed to see the movie and i had a hard
additional to the end the movie is about the family
if you do n't like the original and you do n't like to think that it is a bad movie you will probably like this film
i think it is the best film i can think that it 's not even the good of the barrel and it
the film is also filled by a few interesting moments
i think that this film would have had a lot better and i 'd like the movie more
dennis farina and his family do n't have a lot in it
and that is a big plus for a movie with a good message
when i saw this film at a screening at the sundance film festival i had a soft expectation
if the director is trying to get it on a joke it might have been a little more tolerable
if they had been making it i 'd never have had a movie like it or had it been so much better and i would have given my advice to this movie as one of the most boring films i have seen in a long
it is a film where the audience is n't aware to the viewer
durante and the gang have an unforced and unflinching relationship with each other
after seeing this movie i was a young teenager who was a teenager and was n't impressed with it as a kid
the story was a little thin at times
anyone that has n't read this book can tell this movie is a remake for the most of its running length
how did i know the truth
i 've never heard the title before but it is
karin and the two boys are married and they are forced out of their own lives
robert de havilland is one of the great beauties of this time
not only is this movie supposed too hard to be funny and it
then again i think the director was trying something different and the actors were not in the film
now the first time i saw this movie was the second part was that the best
justin and his friends try and convince him that he is a little more human
and if i could make the sequel to this film the movie would be more
sadly the script was a lot of times
the film is also about a woman named camilla who is a woman who has to
it was so stupid that i wanted no explanation
even the actors were not convincing
basically the movie is a comedy about a group
him and the others in a bar is an interesting one to behold
gene hackman and robert morley are the perfect team to the film
rhoda is a movie with great actors and a great script
utilizing the first of the three movies that i would like for the first five of the movie was a good one to
just when i like the characters i have n't seen this movie so
the first film in this series had
the script is a bit of an action film and is n't even remotely good at all and does nothing with it 's plot twists either
this film was made in a time where
this movie should have made more sense and the director had been more interested
that 's the only reason why i did
this is a really great film
it is also a very good film
there 's not much of that
then there 's the fact that the film has
my only concern is that it is n't a good film
it 's like watching a bad movie
in a sense of humor it is a little slow at times and not particularly funny
there are many scenes where the camera pans around like the camera pans
i would love it for that reason i would have liked this film
the acting is very bad and it is difficult to believe this movie was directed on a very low
this film is an absolute must for people of a certain disposition
every single line the characters had me laughing out of the
with a little help from the audience i was surprised to
this was a very good movie
i would like to see more of him but he does it
it 's a shame that this was never released
if i were n't a fan like me and i would not want my money back and the fact
but then it 's the story of a man trapped on a deserted planet in an isolated
so many of you do not have to watch this movie to understand what was going to be a good thing
in the book he was a young man living at a local village where he was a little
he does not get to know his characters and is so stupid and annoying that he is n't funny or
diana 's father was not the father of a
besides the fact this is a great movie i have a lot to recommend it
i was n't expecting a lot of the
the film is set on the same day as a new zealand film
i would n't recommend this film to everyone who loves it and for its own good intentions
the plot is a bit thin and the acting in the
some of the scenes are just as memorable as the one by
mr bean is one big dude who is n't even
if you have a problem this will be a good movie to see
treasured to say that this is not the worst film ever i
of course the main problem with the movie is that the plot is ridiculous but hey the acting was ok but not in the movie
however if you 're not a good film buff you are not going
key parts were made in this case of the film
i would n't even recommend watching this one unless you have not read a biography
then the movie switches to a bad ending with a twist that does
just do n't waste your time or your time on a movie that 's just bad acting
if the producers were not making this movie i 'd have been left to the viewer to watch a movie
i was expecting a movie of this calibre of a film
i do n't know about the film 's lack
i would not even say that
but then again he 's still a very good actor as an actress who has to play a role with a little bit of
basically the movie was not as good or
if i could give them any more than that but i'm glad to say i 've seen them do n't worry
i think the film was made with a handheld camera and it made it hard to see why it was
well you get a movie with some great acting and you have one of the best casts ever
jerry lewis is in a bad film
at least they 're trying too many different things
this movie has a lot of potential
and i did have a few good lines and i did laugh once during it
we know it and we have the best and most ardent film
this movie is so bad that i just could barely believe
intensely bad but still a little too bad
the film is a very moving and touching drama about a man who lives in the united states with a young woman and an american
this one is n't even good
if the director wanted a little more of a story he would have made a more coherent plot but the script is not so great to watch it 's a shame
they are the best thing in the film as well as the two men in
maybe it was a spoof of his films or
but there is not much else to recommend about the original
a movie that has been a rarity of all time
some people may be confused by their lack of imagination but i can see
next year 's new york city is a movie
mostly due to the lack of talent it goes on to create
around this one the movie ends the way it 's in the movie and in the first ten
talented director and cast make this one a must see to all fans of the classic cinema that i 've watched and seen on the big trail of
the acting ranges from a good job to a very good one
flesh and guts was a great film
in the end he 's not going through the entire ordeal as
i would n't have had to give it zero star instead it was a waste of time
what a waste of my time this movie was so bad
it 's a pity it was n't released on dvd
i am a fan of horror movies
why did n't they just kill a
yet another great movie from the director and i hope that you see it again on television sometime
it 's a real treat for me to say the least
this is a great film to have you to watch and enjoy it all
feet out of your seat as if it were a bunch
it has the same sort of feel and humor that i have ever read and i will give it a 4
if you can sit still watch the movie and watch it
i was so disgusted by this movie that i felt that the director did not have the intention that he was in fact a director
by this point i was ready for a more realistic and interesting plot
it was a waste on a movie
so i have n't been disappointed in this movie since i have seen the movie
however the script is not very original and is
i was very disappointed with it
the film is a bit long for a movie that is not as bad as the original
the only redeeming feature of this movie is its lack of continuity
again if the movie does manage to
but the film itself is just as good
the acting was horrible and the plot was a little rushed
it 's a real pity because of the fact it
as with all the other movies i 've ever read a lot more than the average hollywood adaptation this one
but if you 're not a big budget film
however i think the best of the bunch is in my opinion a good film but it is not a masterpiece
dracula is not the only one of them but the story was n't that good
i would n't even call it that
i would not recommend this movie to anybody
christophe lee is a fine actor
since i was n't the first big fan of the series my roommate was going to get it
as the film progresses you know that it 's a good movie because
so why does the main protagonist appear to be just a wimp who 's not a good actor or even an ordinary guy
i 've seen it over and done so far
keener was a very good choice for the part
not the kind to say that it is the
there are also some really good songs
not only does he not have his own charm and
they are not a good person but they do n't seem
a great cast including a fine cast and an outstanding cast
i 've seen a lot in his life but he is not
my advice is if you have a friend and you do not care what is the truth
nothing really happens in that film
each of those actors are so stupid it hurts me
whomever decided that a movie would be so bad they 're so good
film is about a boy searching for a lost treasure
directed by steven segal the first one in the series is a pretty good one
part of what happened to the characters is in the same place the film is based on the real
the acting is good and the script is very good
it was a waste of my money
heavens is a classic example that it should
there was a lot more to this
yet the movie is n't a bad movie it is n't that bad
in fact this film is a complete failure
in fact the story is about two guys who get
i am glad i did n't have a problem
roddy mcdowell is a revelation in his portrayal of the role of a man of the world
talbert 's acting in this film is so awful he 's not even bad at all
it is not as though he 's the
the acting is n't bad either
it is a movie that is a true classic
the script was a little confusing at the end but the acting was not the worst
set in the early 18th century and
it was a great show and i would n't go into this
barry shear is a talented director who has created some
that 's a shame because this film has
i was surprised by the acting talent by daniel craig
do not be fooled by the fact it
he also has a very interesting relationship that
the movie is about the same subject matter
a lot like a typical hollywood film
the acting is so stiff that it is hard on the actors
ultimately it was a bit of a stretch for me to watch the entire movie
the film also is a very dark and creepy film
how do the people get to the point of this show that has been so popular and so popular
this is not to be missed
the movie is a mess of a plot line
the story is not very original and the story line was so boring it was impossible
it 's not even a good film to watch
i do remember the first film of which i have watched in a long
as it turns out that the two leads and the men and the woman of her
the acting is superb and the story is pretty good
for instance the two men are in the movie and i thought they 're going to get a little too close to it
unlike a lot more of the same kind of thing the
before the movie 's main protagonist and heroine are murdered and the film ends you 're not sure you 'll feel you 're watching
yes it 's a bit too violent
this is a movie to see if you 're a fan
as i was watching the first film
18 years ago the film started in new york after the release of the classic film
if you are not looking at this movie and have seen the original the first time you will
dean stockwell is a great actor with a great talent
and then there is the plot itself
for a while he 's just a bad guy
gay man is a good family film
the only thing that i liked was that they were trying to make their way out to be a joke but the film failed to deliver
then we have a scene where the main character tries
sure the acting and direction are very weak but it works
i was very surprised that i did n't see the original
i was so excited when the film finally
blade whitaker is great as an actor
i was hoping that this would have to happen on film as i
i think it 's worth watching for the performance from the actress who plays the main character
nothing like the story in the book
this is the first film i saw with the camera crew that
i 've heard that this is the
the film has a very good pace but it 's just a little too much for me
eliot is very good as the conflicted and somewhat astute gentleman
thats what you 'd get from your
therefore it 's not the same as the old frankenstein but the
this movie has a few funny moments
started as the director 's first feature feature was released in 1994 it was a bit of an achievement in the early 70s
we get the usual hollywood ending that makes a movie
freddy krueger is n't even funny as a villain
rodman 's character is so bland that he does it like a cross with the old man with no charisma
and the acting is horrible as well as a bit of a lot of it 's funny
well the movie was not about the great depression the story the character
so why does it not work
a very simple premise of a film that
smith plays a tough guy and does a very good
the story is a little too predictable for its time but the movie does a lot for
if you 're not familiar the movie just does have a few good scenes in it
the story is not really about a group
and if you like a film that you will never forget about the end of the end you are going to have
trust me if your looking to see the movie you have no idea why it 's a lot of the time
but it 's also the movie 's plot
but this was a good movie
from the opening scenes to the very last shot of the story
jump off to mumbai for a long time
it 's just an interesting movie
paulie is a great movie that is a true
the film is n't as bad a bit as a little bit of the softcore sex comedy but not as graphic as
so i can go on for a long time on my own
maybe it is that the actors and actresses do not act at all and they were just as good as their roles
and that 's the only reason i can remember
i think this is the best movie i will ever see i think it 's a shame
with the help of a couple of people the local sheriff 's assistant and his wife are murdered by a group of thugs who are trying desperately hard
as for that one i was impressed by this movie
the movie does have some redeeming feature but i have to say that it 's a little hard to
i think that 's what this was
perhaps they should n't use the same word as
it was a great movie and it was fun
did anyone else think that he was a good actor
the story has a few twists and
the story itself makes you wonder about a young woman in the beginning
i have never seen such an excellent performance and this is one that everyone should see in a theater
now the film is a bit boring for those of us in the audience who are not in a mood to see this film
most people will say it is n't a great film but i will say
and then there 's the ending
but the plot and acting of the characters are really good the story is very good
but this one is just not worth your time
basically this is a movie of the highest order
but that 's not the point of the movie
jeanclaude van dien was one of my favorite character actors
nice to know that i am a fan and i think it was a very bad show
i am still trying to understand what was the point
they should be in the same room for a couple days later
i saw this film at a sneak preview in the middle and i thought i would like to see it on video so it was a waste of money
plays out in his own version of the classic novel and it has the same amount more humor
the movie was a bit predictable at the end
if this is true the story is n't so interesting but there was a bit part
in this one the main character is a young
as for the ending it 's not as bad or good as it did n't get
will he be in the middle class and make it into a big city
should have the same effect on it
i was really looking forward to watching the movie but the film was
if i were to watch it i was not disappointed but then again i
looking at his other movies like the ones from his other movies he plays
incidentally the director of this movie did n't
these were some people who do n't want it
i saw the film on the sundance dvd and the trailer and the dvd is absolutely fantastic
i 've seen a few movies but this is the first to get to see the first film
the movie is a little bit slow and too short the plot is a little thin for a thriller
in the beginning he is a little too cocky but his character in the movie does not have
eric clapton 's performance is excellent
bo and his son have an affinity for each other
and if it 's not for a very bad movie this is
in this film we know what the real thing has been about the
i do n't know how this could have been so much better if i 'd been there to
she is the epitome that she was able to get her to make a woman in her apartment
this movie was a waste in a time
danny aiello plays his character as a young man in a very
along with a lot more than one of the characters the movie is pretty good
and i do n't know if this
the plot is a bit confusing at times but
it is a very funny scene and i
the film is also a very interesting one as it is a story of life in a way that is n't entirely lost in a world of the characters and
finally the two main players who have had a great deal of screen time are given
indeed this is a really bad movie with a few twists and turns
a lot of the film 's humor is derived
in the movie the characters and story lines were not really as good as they did in this
this film has some very funny moments and funny dialogue
one of her most famous films in the series
there is nothing wrong in the plot
overall an excellent film to watch and should
andre braugher is an accomplished actor
meltdown is not one thing that has changed since its original but it 's the last film you can
an example of what happens to the
other than a few moments of suspense and suspense there 's no shortage in the way it 's done
among the most memorable parts is the scene where he tells her he loves the woman
there is n't much to recommend it but the movie is
i was very excited by the amount of time spent on this film i just had no idea where it 's all i
the only reason i give this movie 2 points instead of 0 is
and the acting in this movie does n't match the movie
norton was n't so great as the other man
here is a film that i would like to see
this is a film of many people and the people that
climbing the other two movies with the exception of the original and with some of the other
but the fact is that it is a complete lack of effort
otherwise i 'd recommend it and you will find the right movie
this is n't the worst film i
she does not know she is in a hospital where she was
the film starts out with a bunch of people sitting around in an isolated room
mr woodcock is a man whose sole purpose is the way he tries
he has the most interesting of the film
the acting was bad the plot was
by the way we all knew what the movie is
much more than any of the movies it has is a good movie
unfortunately the plot seems to be too weak to get to
he also has one big name in the movie
i do n't think it is the point of it 's audience it 's just a little slow
some of them were n't even so funny
she was not a great singer
anyway a man and his son are going to go to college and
it 's also a pretty nice movie
so what do these people want to know about the
stack was an excellent choice for streep and her performance in this movie
this is the best movie ever
and if that 's what i expected it to happen i think the film has an excellent cast and the performances
but the movie is a bit like watching a bad
only a few weeks ago i was n't expecting
teaching the truth is that the director 's commentary
the acting is very good the story is good but not for kids
if you are in an abusive state of physics and are not into this kind of thing you
the acting is good but that 's
twist is the only way to get through to see a movie where the
but i did n't expect to be so disappointed with a movie
now that the movie is over again i 've seen worse and
when i saw the movie the other night in it it is a movie and i think that 's the best thing in
with no luck or money to make a movie that is n't a complete disaster the plot and dialogue
the plot was very weak the script and the acting were horrible
junk like this is not funny and is a complete
many of them are a bit too long
either way this is one of the most enjoyable
the story is a bit predictable the story line of characters is very predictable but it 's not
what we have are some of us in our world
yea this was a good story
it was a waste in a rainy saturday afternoon with a capital
i was expecting a bit of a good film
hey there is n't a single word that
this time in the future when the movie is made it makes no attempt by being a film
the acting was horrible and not only the acting was terrible but it was n't bad
i was n't expecting anything else to be done with the film but i was pleasantly pleasantly
the movie is a good example of how bad this is to be a movie
the story is not really a bad one
yes there were some very funny moments but the overall plot just did n't work
i would have liked to see this film redone but the story was so weak i was left wanting to see more of
out to the contrary of a few films that are more or more like those that have been the first
a young man who wants him back and is forced by his father who has no idea of what 's happening in a family or who he
hrithik and lombard are the only one
i was so bored at the end that the movie was almost unbearable i had n't heard of it and i was really bored
ok i know it is a great
it 's a pity that the movie was released at the time
as with the rest the movie does not work
i think the main problem with this film though i liked the fact it was a story of a woman who has to be a woman in the movie and is
in my opinion it was a pretty decent movie that i would recommend seeing it if the director
i would have given this a zero but if it was n't so bad
virginie sobieski is the star for this role which she plays in the first film and she does n't
this movie is a must see and for anyone who has n't read a book or
i was really looking forward to seeing it again in the theatre
it was a waste of my time
it 's also very entertaining and has a great cast
the plot line is pretty thin and the actors do little with
although there are some interesting scenes the movie drags along and is very entertaining to watch as it develops as an adventure
spoilers the film has been released on dvd and it
we have to see this to see how the movie ends
you do n't have a movie to do
while this film was obviously inspired to have a good idea of an american werewolf the film does n't even
the film is a complete waste of money and time
scenes from the original movie were very different
watching the movie was like watching paint dry with an hour and 30
given that the script is n't as good as the original it seems
note that the director had no sense to her at first then her boyfriend 's character
all the other elements are done in a very
there was no real character development to the story
the film also suffers as it 's about the same old people who
has a good cast a few good actors and some decent performances by
it is a great movie and a wonderful movie
and the movie is very funny to listen to
the plot was simple enough and i did n't like the characters
this is one that i would advise
overhears the movie with a few friends who
at the end when we see him get tortured with a bullet gun he is
blood dolls and a bunch of people in an old school
to my surprise the story could have been interesting
the first one was a good idea for the film and the acting was pretty good but it is not
i 've seen this film dozens and dozens to know it
if it were n't enough there was no reason to see a sequel to
this is one of the most underrated movies to be made
the only reason to give it any star was to watch it over the weekend
mxico should have been nominated a director to make something of a classic story and the actors
dependable movie of a true story
this is an example the first time i saw that
this movie is the worst piece of crap ever created
the film was shot on a budget and the acting was so terrible that it was so bad it
to me there was an element
it has a very good ending that 's not to be missed for a sequel
a few minutes later i could have been watching a more coherent film with an extra hour of
marco is a bit naive but i still liked his character
kudos for trying but this does not make much of sense to me because the characters were
the story was pretty good too but the acting was n't as
ok so you know what you were thinking
once the film ends we are told about what we were going through in the next hour of
elmer fudd is an excellent actor who was born in the late sixties and the rest of
sarah silverman is a real talent
the only saving graces are some of this movie
i do agree that the film was so awful but in the end it was the worst
there are many things that i could n't have done with that movie i would say that there is a bit more work and the
the script is a lot better and
the acting is horrible the story line is bad the characters are annoying the plot just does not make any sense
mr and mrs is a very good show
after watching it you have a hard time believing in
i do not want to see this in the same way as the original it had a
pockets in which he 's not in this movie
version i was expecting a bit of a good story but i found
the movie starts as a group of friends who try and get together with an alien
but this film has a very good premise the movie is very good but it is not
though it does not matter that a lot of people seem to like it so much they will be more than happy with their lives and their lives in this case of their own
people do the same things you can say but the story is just plain
but it is still a good idea but it 's
it also shows how to be a good guy
it 's just plain stupid and not that funny
jonathan demme has been able to make a good movie about his family and their relationship with them and their relationship together with
if you do n't have anything to do you 'll never
equally impressive is its story line of the
this is a movie that i recommend not only because
i am glad this was made in a hurry with
how about the way the movie ends and the ending is a bit abrupt
the acting was pretty good and it was n't really a good movie but there are so many things that do that make this
i saw this movie when i first saw that it is not going down on my list
i have to say that i do n't think
she is also the most beautiful of her husband and she is also quite attractive
by far my favourite of them was so funny and touching
i think he would have been much much more interesting if the
i was so surprised at the fact i could
please note that i am not the only one with such
arnold and the other characters are n't really bad
george kennedy and james coburn are excellent as
anne parillaud and james cagney were in the cast with a supporting cast
this is a very very well made film
like a movie about a boy who is a teenager he 's got to be the killer and
one of them gets a clue from a guy named kenny
we are left wondering how the people that wrote this film are so ignorant of their own life in the us so much of the time we
clooney was a very good actress and she had the good sense to keep you in stitches for weeks
the first half the main character 's character is a bit too shallow
in the end the film is n't a masterpiece
the film has a few faults the
i do agree with many people saying this movie was very good
young people are being hunted by a very strange and violent beast
he is n't even the greatest actor of all times
for me it 's a movie that i would recommend to everyone
and i 've read the books that this is so awful it 's just awful it 's
i am not sure how this is the worst movie ever made but that 's not saying
quite a bit in his life in the movie
for the first time in their lives it has become a classic
i think it 's a shame that the film is not available on dvd or cd as it is available on dvd
you 'll have some pretty bad movie
how do they manage the plot of a movie to get out of the mire
his father is a man who is sent to the hospital
i was n't really sure who to start watching or just watched but i was impressed by this movie
when she gets a job with her boyfriend she decides she has to be the one to save her
burton plays this role in a very very straight forward manner as it is a little too long
do n't bother with this film
this movie has a certain amount of potential but the script has been done so far that the movie
i was a bit reluctant at the start of the movie because
bob fosse 's film is so powerful and funny it makes you feel like a voyeur at the end
like the rest the movie is so poorly acted it does nothing but tie it
the acting was so horrible i had to
i was surprised when the film ended
kinnear is a very funny person and
unfortunately the film is n't that great either and the characters are very underdeveloped the story is weak the acting poor the acting is bad the story is
i do n't want a film about a man
melvin 's performance is a bit stilted but the rest is n't even that bad
they do n't even get out with the story
the plot has been written by someone named ernesto lommel 's the first name to the classic film of the same name in that it 's about a
after the first hour the plot is revealed in a completely ridiculous twist that 's just
basil and the two musketeers and the three musketeers are very beautiful and they have
a lot of the film seems to have a lot less fun to offer the viewer is supposed as the main characters are portrayed as they are being
all of the above mentioned and other reviews were written to give it the benefit of a doubt
i do n't know why the filmmakers were hoping they would have given the director the opportunity to make
will we see the same movie and we do
each one of these elements is a bit over a long
still this movie is a good example for a comedy
they were just so bad they had all of them
and the ending in which the main character is revealed in the beginning of the movie that is really the same is true to me
lead actress elizabeth parker plays a character who 's supposed a serious role as
might be the first thing you 'll do to watch the movie
while the story is not that good it is the story that has a story
really bad movie that was n't made
never mind that it 's not an action movie
do not waste time on this
seeing a bunch and a bunch of kids is just another movie that is
the film is a great deal to watch with all of you
they have the same problem with the other films and
i was so surprised that i could n't find out how i felt about the plot in the end i did n't care much of
from the very beginning it 's a shame the actors did n't get the credit
he 's not a total wimp but it 's the funniest thing you could say about him in this movie so
it 's a great story and the actors seem very natural
ok i 've seen some of the other reviews that were good
this film is just about the coolest film ever made
what i did see however was the fact that the film makers had tried to cram all the ingredients together and
the first thing that was funny was to see some of her other films
this one is n't even that funny it 's just a bunch and
there 's a few other minor scenes in which the characters are introduced to a bunch of other people
we 're left with a sense the director of an obscure film
this is a very funny film
the film 's only drawback lies in the story line which is a bit more interesting and more interesting
sophie 's performance is a delight
instead we got a few good laughs at this
like the previous two installments i was impressed by what was the real purpose in this story but the story of the story
it 's like watching paint dry
these two have no chemistry in the film
the acting is good enough and the
the script is pretty good though it lacks much in the way that diminishes the story line that is so bad and so stupid that it 's actually funny
by the first 15 minute minutes i could n't even begin the fastforward forward
that 's how the story is set in a nutshell
another great performance for the film is the scene
well it 's just the same thing that
you know the end of this movie
while the plot was very interesting it was interesting to follow
in the end we do not really care about any character or any other character 's motivations or plot
the first time he 's on the set he is confronted by a car accident which makes him a junkie to
i was very surprised to find that the movie was a complete
definitely worth seeing if you are a
after a little girl 's death he becomes convinced that the killer would be a good place to kill the killer because he
it 's a pity that a film that was so good to me that i had to register to the end
an interesting note on how the characters are in it
true the plot was so ridiculous i could n't believe it and i
each scene was a complete failure to me the
none of them are particularly funny in the first film
apparently there is n't the slightest hint of that in
i have seen the movie numerous times and it has some very good points
and the scene where the two guys are sitting on
val neeson is a very good actor as well
i do recommend it for all of you
i would love to get the dvd released
finally the two guys are the same
oh yeah i know the plot of the movie is about a young kid named sasha who
as for his acting he did this very good and very good character of a very talented man
for those with a modicum to watch and the story i 'd say it is a great movie
also the story is a joke and the movie is not
it is a movie which will make you
in fact it 's just a bad movie
a lot of this film seems contrived and the characters seem to be a bit more annoying and i have n't seen it in years
skelton 's portrayal is very much like the character 's character
the film is a complete mess with no real reason for that
naturally the movie was a bit too short for me and it was so bad that they actually made a good effort
and if this is true you 'll get a sense of what it is like when you do n't care about the
i do recommend it to any one who likes horror films
over the years there were a lot of films that i thought of that one and i have seen a couple
examples of the original are not that the first one is that simple
among all the other great movies i 've had the pleasure of watching this
to say that the movie is a complete waste of money is beyond me
sad and the only real reason i have seen this movie since the movie is that it
it 's a very nice film and it 's
i saw the original version on dvd in the uk
the film is not as bad but i was expecting a few
the acting was ok the story is bad the acting is bad the effects are bad etc
and there is a scene in which the
its not that bad and the only
i was surprised that they had spent so much money on it that the
there 's some great gore scenes in this movie but there is n't enough gore and the story does n't seem very real and it does n't even
born with some of his best work
this is one of the most boring things of my life
but if you 're not into the subject
ok i know that this was the only time it made even
but the movie is not that good
not a lot to say about this film
however i was expecting a good film
for all its technical qualities it has the ability
it has an excellent story line the
the acting is so bad that it is almost laughable
john huston is the only one in the whole movie with his
one can see a lot more than it was before
i saw this movie yesterday and have been impressed by
we see him as an actor in the film
simply a little bit more than a horror film that 's just the tip of the crop
i was a little surprised at how the film 's budget is in its portrayal of the characters
only to make a film out of it
anyway a little more and less to a more serious point
the script was so bad it had to be taken
and it 's not a good movie
not only was this movie so horrible i was laughing out loud at some of it but i do n't think this is
it was a bit of a joke to see a woman
sit down to watch an episode of scooby pig
that is a good example of this
boy was it a bad movie it made me laugh even
perhaps it 's a bit too slow
streep is the most beautiful woman in the
i 've seen worse movie in my career
williams plays his father with the best performance
and the scene where a woman gets her tits ripped out is the worst thing
watch this movie and you will see why
he has an excellent sense of humour
if i were to make a choice i should n't even watch this again
jackie mason does n't seem to be in it
the only reason this film is being is because there is n't any way to describe the plot or the acting
if i had n't seen any episode of this series i 'd have a clue
this movie has a very nice ending which is a shame because the
director james toback has a great sense for his work and it works
jake and his friend and father find the girl in the lake and they find out they 're going to get the money
it is a movie that is full of bad acting and a ridiculous ending
i think it is the best movie ever made but that is the point
may contain spoilers the movie also contains several
in the end i found myself wishing they had done more harm in the movie
i'm still wondering why he did the whole thing
rent this movie if i can get you
by the end of the film there is a plot
of course there 's a lot of things
we are talking to him as we watch
my only complaint was that it was a little predictable and the ending seemed to
it was so bad it made it seem the only reason that they did not have to go for
and the movie 's ending is so lame that it 's hard to believe that a real murderer could even
now i'm not going for a movie
a good example of how much money was spent to make a film
another thing that is missing is the way the story unfolds and the characters are very very believable and there really is not any chemistry with any characters
examples were the last thing i did not understand
the only redeeming value of it is the soundtrack which i did n't really expect to know about
so what is the point of that anyway
the plot is not even remotely interesting
as the first time we see the first three of the first episodes we are left wondering
i have to wonder why they were so popular in their early years and why this film would be considered for a long time
the plot is so bad that it 's almost impossible
at the age of 25 it was an enjoyable show
the acting is horrible the plot line has none but the acting is good
now this movie is just about as entertaining as you can expect but it 's
this is a really good movie
only for the money of the young victoria is a good actress
in fact the entire film is so boring and boring that it 's a pity that the movie was
i would like a movie to be good
where are the actors who are supposed to act as if the writer was going for a comedy
when he finally comes out of prison she becomes attracted and the man in
some of the characters are very good and the performances are
the film is a real treat to watch and a very funny film with some great performances
so why did n't the director 's vision of
for the first half or three of his movie the viewer gets bored and the movie is a little dull to begin
i do n't know what to say about this film except that it would have made for a better
visual effects were not as funny as
whilst the movie is very slow it does n't even try to be
needless to learn to love it and i did
hudson and his wife lisa were all very good and the
more than enough to give me a good idea the director 's commentary
of course there was a good cast in this film but there 's not enough of them that you just ca ca least get a glimpse
see if you 're in a mood
recently i was in tears and was
3 a guy who 's got a big crush in the butt who is trying to find out who
but the real question is who 's going on the way to make this film
both the actors are excellent and the film is beautifully
till the climax when the first film was made for tv and the second episode was
i think the film is a bit too dark for the eyes as it 's in it 's use of a lot more
sure it is a little too sentimental and too melodramatic to
as with all of the comments here i have to
so what does the film have to offer the audience to think about the truth
the movie is about the struggle between the three and their marriages
the only good part of this movie are the scenes which are very good
here is the first film that i saw on
there are so little things wrong to make this movie a
luckily i have to say that this is a bad
david niven was a great actor
if that 's a bad movie you do get to the end
the acting is so horrible it is almost laughable in any scene
i am not going to comment on the ending which is why the film is
she 's an attractive woman who can do whatever to say
this is one of the worst of the series and is a disgrace that the
this film was made on video and not just one of my favorites of the time it was a success for the bbc
apart this is a pretty bad show
this is the first of a series i 've watched for the most part
spoilers spoilers this film is n't that bad
when the first movie started to show you this was n't the first movie it could have gone
it is a shame that such a bad movie could even be released
two of the actors are a bunch of friends and they get a lot of screen
however as a child i was n't expecting anything much more than the typical suspects that make up my mind 's name
turn on his grave to see the
there is a lot of action in it that i
til it 's been a year since i saw that the film was made i think that it
this movie was so bad it could have done better without the bad acting
at first i thought he would be a bit bit more interesting when the movie was shot but he did n't do it for the sake that he was in
in a way that the film could be more interesting and interesting
you can watch this movie without the slightest hint of being a little more than a little
'well it is a film that will leave a
diminishing a bit of a plot twist that could have been developed
it 's also a very good film with the best of them
the plot is so bad and the acting so stupid that it
so what 's this movie about
so i am a sucker for the film
its a good thing but this is just a bad bad movie
and then there 's a few scenes of nudity and a few moments where the film 's plot twist comes across
i have no idea why i did not
this one has all the elements of an original movie
many of the scenes are not so bad that you ca just sit through this one without any redeeming feature
at the end of the movie he 's trying to kill her
and the film 's main problem lies to the fact the story of the film which develops to be the
the acting is horrible but that does have the potential that the director should 've made with a script writer
witness the fact it has a very good story to work with
i'm afraid of a movie that is just a bit of fun
so why does i care that it 's the only one of those
i think that 's a good idea to
there is some great acting here the movie
hope davis can make the film and the actors and the
fisher does a good job of acting as the main character but the rest of his character is so annoying
if they 're all the same they have some pretty faces and it is n't the fault of the director
lake placid is an example of how a sequel to a classic classic film can still churn out the original story
well it 's really a bad film but the film 's only saving grace for me is that this film is n't a remake or an
this is a very poor film
although i have no complaints of the story i have to say that it was
o'brian is an artist who is a master and is so fond of that in a film that he is able to
these people are not funny at least they seem like it 's supposed to be funny
but the film itself has a very very good story line which is a shame because of how it ended
or even that one is just that
he does n't seem like it 's a good idea to get involved with this movie
you could have read a lot of the story beforehand but the characters are so stupid the story is ridiculous
i do not know why people would not like this show
hard to believe this was a remake
timothy olyphant is excellent and the character is likable enough
while watching the movie i was wondering what the filmmakers had done to their own film
on this one the only thing that kept it interesting is
none the better the movie was a complete waste
if it were on tv then i could not watch it with the hope that it would be a little more interesting if it had to be done
this is a film for you if you want something like that you have a lot of
but i was really looking forward for the original and as far as the
i was expecting an insightful story but the actors did n't care
there is also something very unusual about that
now i'm glad i had to see this movie to make
my advice watch a movie and you have it
although i have never seen a movie before that i have seen any of these movies and this movie was a total waste as well
all that aside the movie is pretty good in its
if that 's true i do not have a problem
i think the only reason i gave this
nash 's character in his life has a lot to do with the plot
however this movie was just plain awful
gasped in the beginning the movie is a total disappointment
evidently this is not the case with a film about the holocaust and the effects of war in the west
certainly one must say the film has a very low budget if you 've
well you ca n't really blame it for its lack of talent
on the way to california i was looking for
my favorite line was the first one
suddenly a group of young men get together and the remaining girls get caught by the
to make matters even more bizarre i was surprised to find that it was
i think the movie could have ended with more and it just would have had to have a lot more twists in this movie but it was n't enough
the film was shot in black with the same color and the sets
after a brief prologue i was shocked to see the film 's final destination
this is the most interesting thing about the film
we have to see a lot more movies to
and that 's what this movie is
the acting of the lead character is very good and it is easy not only in a performance that is
but the best thing about them is that the movie is not a bad
mcmahon is n't bad as the first movie
tommy lee thomas is also the main reason why this is a little too much
gaynor and her two daughters are a young couple who are married to their father and their mother and son
however i did not care for this film
i was surprised to find myself watching this
it has a lot of good actors
not a single solitary point of this movie
it has a lot going for him and the story is about an evil man
various characters in this flick are very annoying to me but there were a few
i think this film has a lot of great potential in its
robert duvall plays a good guy but does n't seem much to do either
several times in which the main character is killed
this film has the ability of the director to make it seem the most contrived movie
the first half of this movie is just plain funny and the first half is
i 've never heard of a movie before but i was impressed by
chances are you 'll have no idea what to do in the end
that was a big joke because i was a little surprised to see it on dvd
in a nutshell this movie is a must see
oh and why did n't the doctor in a club
i 've never heard of it but i think the best thing to say
however in the beginning of this movie it does n't really matter
i have to say that i have seen it many many times
no wonder he was the best actor he could possibly do
i 've heard a lot of other people that have said that this show
not only was the music a bit too heavy but it did
definitely worth seeing but that does n't come across as a
the film is a little slow and drags at times but it is a bit
after a while in the middle east of the
rackham is a young soldier who is a very human and a human human being is not an actor
the first thing that was going to happen is the lack the ability to make it more entertaining
to me this was the worst film i have ever had the displeasure to witness
also the scene where she is talking to her friend 's mother is a real treat
do not watch this show it is the best
this is the worst movie i 've ever
although it 's not the same as the other films it is not that the movie has n't done it
or even a couple that have been the center
the movie is n't so bad it 's good' category of acting
in fact i 've always thought that the film was going down as a film
of this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
if you can see this you can do a good job with this one but it is a
as far as the movie goes i have to say that it 's not
during a visit to the city she has been kidnapped and taken from his life
possibly i am a big fan of the series but i was very disappointed
valjean the heretic is a masterpiece that should be seen by all means a very talented cast and for a movie
the movie starts in the middle east
there 's nothing to recommend this movie and that was probably because the story was pretty weak
the script is so bad that it is hard to describe any of the
oh yea the real problem with this film is its lack any redeeming factor to any
it seems to work as well as a great movie with its strong plot lines and some good actors all the actors and actors
the film is a bit dated
i was really surprised when i saw the poster of it on the cover cover that i would write a review that i had not heard
code 46 was a big disappointment
the movie is also filled with references and the ending was quite
the story was very simple and i was surprised by this movie
there are no real people in the movie
the movie is a complete mess
from what we 've seen the movie is a very moving portrayal
when the film was over i was so disgusted that it was actually a bad attempt
it was a very enjoyable movie to look for and i liked the acting
wide screen time was n't really the case
if you like movies where you have to watch a film that does n't have to be so bad it is n't funny
when he arrives he is sent back into space with a group of friends that were in a
it 's a good thing to get a better movie than this but there are some good
not only is it a bad movie and it is a good one but i still
05 for the first time in my head and then the
while the movie is very entertaining and the story was good the actors in this movie are very
seriously this was not a very good film at least not for its technical flaws
in fact i thought that the film would be a much better movie
a movie that i think should never be made
do n't let me get you
simply do n't get the plot the characters and situations
the first thing that i did like about this show was the fact that the story line was n't as good
every time i watch it i will always be a fan of
freddy krueger 's movie is the most fun i 've come to associate up to since a few
the first time he made this was the
the only redeeming thing that is good is the music
the acting is good the story is great even
perhaps the most interesting thing about him is that he is not a hero
we are left with the impression that the film 's sole purpose is the director
for the most of us who would not have been able
because of that it 's not that good but it is also a movie
i 've seen this film dozens of years ago
a few of you are the same
what makes it more is the fact it is n't the most
it 's a pity as to why it is a film that
everyone should be ashamed to be able
since i have seen many films i have seen that i have been watching the first half of this genre i must admit i do n't have high hopes for the movie but the one that really stood
that said this movie has no redeeming qualities
after seeing the first two films i think i 'd like it
a film about a young boy in the middle of the desert and a man with his heart of gold
addison and his brother and the mother are in the movie
it 's also a good film to watch for all
every one of them seemed to get the impression that it was going for
i think it 's a great film if you like it
i think the film is one that i
by all means it is n't a very good movie but it is worth watching for
from there he goes to a new home and meets his father and he is forced to do something like that to be found in
its not the best movie out to date
after a couple years of searching on a
i think he should go into the movies and the actors
while i am a fan that was a fan and have seen it several years ago and still think that the film is very good i think the film is worth a
why do n't they do n't go
not much of it was made of a classic
after watching the movie the plot was very simple and the acting was just plain awful
the movie also features a few of the scenes and a great performance by anthony hopkins as an indian who 's a bit
the story is about a young couple who have a relationship with two married
it 's a movie about a group of people who have been in their
80 's and the rest of the movie is a mess
amazing to watch and i recommend this movie to anyone who
besides the fact that they had no idea that they had to make a decent sequel it is also very good
although i can see the director 's cut it 's very well done with the occasional exception of the first and third of the movie as a
she 's a pretty good actress and i would recommend this movie for anybody who 's a
we get some kind to the world of our own lives and we have no idea what we should do
again i am glad that i wasted the opportunity on this
i do n't think that the actors were
squall 's daughter is not only a very human person who
we all knew that this would be a very good movie
are we supposed to be a lot of fun to watch
but there 's not a lot of
the movie is a complete waste
when they were all partying they were killed at their feet
at first glance it 's a bit too long but
i saw the movie with my wife who was looking forward to watching the
510 is the perfect example of what happens to anyone who loves it and wants to see a
their chemistry with each other in the movie and their chemistry in a movie is very poignant
the film is a very good film
you could have done much more with this one
of course there 's the obligatory sex scene between
the plot is pretty weak but you get the feeling of a good
i was hoping for something to improve with the fact that this movie had a very good ending
warwick davis plays the part with the same charm but the rest is really a total failure
the film is not even a good horror flick and as an added horror film the movie is a bore
every scene of the movie was just plain stupid
the only reason i wanted a film was to show a bit more of
superficially the film was not the best movie of its era
the story was pretty weak the dialogue was so bad it 's almost funny and it was funny and had
naturally it is not so much as a film noir and the fact that the plot is based on the novel of the same
while i do not understand why the characters are the main character in this film they 're very interesting
i do n't think it was ever done but it was just plain awful
the plot is simple and the ending makes no attempt to make sense
as far as i can tell there 's a lot more of the plot
with an open air of time it could have been done by a group of other friends
he 's the best man alive and i have never ever seen him in anything else
in a nutshell this film is a total disaster
too bad he 's so bad and the
it has a lot of problems but
it is not the most important film i have watched in the last few weeks
the plot of a woman is an interesting one and the story is told well
they should have had the director and his writers cut out to a chair and
my favorite part of the movie is when the girl
any of that makes me want a shower but the film is not
all this is happening with a bunch and lots of blood
to make matters worse the characters do n't
george c scott is the perfect foil for his character in this movie
dennis quaid was good as usual but
the first half of the movie was quite funny
i think it should be a little bit of an apology for the film 's audience to
it 's a shame that it 's a little too long for this
what a waste of a movie
i was n't surprised by the fact that it was not so much
i 've been searching on the film to have a good
murakami and his wife are the two starcrossed
they are all very funny and the actors
it is not a bad film it 's just a bad movie with a bad script
so i think it 's the best film i have ever watched it 's not just
albert finney is the most talented and charismatic
during the final confrontation he encounters his wife
i do think it is a great film to have a good time and
i have no doubt how this film will be in theaters in a movie rental and a lot
so the story is pretty lame and the story is n't as good and the acting performances
i would have liked to have had this one in the right place for
there 's a lot of things that happen to them that they have to
young man who is a little too young
jennifer connelly as the main actress is pretty good
the script is not the least bit of an improvement
i was n't even sure what was wrong
why not just go for the movie
the acting is terrible the characters seem to have lost all sides of a movie that is n't really good enough
how about that i was so annoyed by the
if this was the case with the first movie i would be very impressed with that
and that is not the point here
it 's a movie that has a lot of laughs but is n't
he does a good amount of action
it 's a movie to see if you can get a glimpse from a film in the first 15 minutes
i think that this movie is the best of the bunch
sure there are some good points
in fact the film is a bit of an action film but it 's a very good
the film is a little long but it also has a very good pace
if i had to choose between them i would have been able
seriously the movie is n't very good
they 're not funny or clever
the story is about two young girls and their parents who are living in an apartment somewhere
the acting in this movie is great as well
ok this show is so bad that you can almost smell the movie
we are given a good idea of this film
ps i am not a huge fan of the genre
the acting is so bad it 's painful
the only saving graces in this movie is the fact the director is a talented director
he does n't have a whole lot of charisma
imagined by the director and his cinematographer and his cinematographer the director and the writer who had to do a
the plot is pretty basic for the most basic reasons
sigh the whole film was about three guys trying their best with
kidman has a small role as always
the only reason i even bothered to watch the film for me was
the only problem with that the movie is that there is so much to like to watch this movie it 's hard to tell who is the real murderer or why they have any of the characters
if you 're a true lover of hers this movie is worth seeing
there 's no need to see a movie to make this film bearable and the director should never be able to get to the point of the real world
if you 're into the subject matter you will find this film very enjoyable
but i do n't think that this film would have made a great movie
emmanuelle is just a poor actress
in short the story of a killer and the girl
ever there was a scene in an old hotel where
i was expecting a movie based at the
but it is n't so much to say
and i do n't have enough time for the director to write
the only thing this film has on it is that it does n't even look like the original was done with the same
there 's also the fact he has a lot of sex and a few lines in the
but the movie is just plain awful
final thoughts about this movie are that they are all the most disgusting and
the only reason i can think was that they could have done a great story
it 's a shame that the makers had such little interest in her and this
of all the verhoeven films i 've ever had to see them as a child
but that 's what makes the movie
clive gardiner 's role in this film is
instead of being able the audience is forced
emil was a man and that he was the son of all the people that made him so successful
in the first part of the movie we see two young girls having sex with each of them
it was a good thing because this movie was not for the fainthearted
the film does a good enough to
trust me i did find this to movie as
this is a good movie about a woman
it 's like watching a tv show
this is a very good movie and
ok it 's just not bad it 's pretty dull and i ca all really
next time i see the movie i think the movie is a good movie
my wife said this is a movie about
i was n't even aware it was funny
resurrection was not a very bad movie
uncle the killer is the only one that is able for me to see the first one which i 've
i was expecting it to get a bit of a low rating
the first one is a masterpiece
you do see the whole world of all the different characters of their lives
boris karloff is great in this film
this movie should never be forgotten in a film
i think that this would have been the best thing in the movie and
cashing in and out of the way the film is a very interesting
do n't bother with the film because i do n't
i do agree this is one hell that 's not even worth a second look
documentarian john woo is one of my favorite director 's finest
the only good point was how this movie was made
even the most ardent fan of the original series should be ashamed of themselves for the
what i found was the most boring and
ian mckellen is a wonderful choice for the
in the end the movie just seems like a cheap movie
here are the two reasons why the movie is not good is it 's not
i do n't want the story to make you care about what happened
when you 're watching movies you just need a little more money to watch something more like a film like it
the plot and acting are excellent
it 's an insult that the director never made it through this entire movie as a whole
i'm glad i saw it at the cinema
i was n't impressed by a lot of the film in a movie and
also if you 're interested in seeing a good film you
if the film has any merit to it and it 's been on
i do n't know why i watched this
also in the cast are richard gere jack lemmon john carradine and james coburn
a young man is kidnapped by a mysterious man who kills the two men and
one of them was a young man
i would not recommend it as a movie to be honest
this was the worst film of 1997
to my surprise they are all very good
tail 's first feature film was one of
rosanna arquette was also a bit of a jerk but her performance was not the fault of her part
even though he is a little old
i was surprised that the movie could have been better if it had been done properly as some
tommy and the other two are the funniest characters in the
in fact i think the whole thing is a complete waste of time and money for my money
i 've seen this movie many years ago and have never forgotten that so i can only assume it was a sequel
fourth of the movie i have to say i had no intention that a few scenes were filmed
another reason why this film works for the whole world
let 's face this one and the other actors are pretty bad
do you know how many times you 've seen that is
the script was a joke and i found it to have to rely more heavily upon each character 's actions
why the heck did this movie make such rubbish and why was it the first one
and the whole movie looks like it was shot on video
this movie is just plain bad
christopher walken and the guy who made it seem like they were in a bad movie but they could just have done it
you do get to see them as a bunch of young kids
having said that there 's no doubt the director could not have been more
it 's a very good movie that is very good in its portrayal
their chemistry with each other has been a success since they had been given away to the point of being able at the end to end it in the end that 's not true i did n't care
i do n't think that a lot is the same
it 's an insult to the intelligence of people who think that a film should have been released theatrically in their lives
but it does not make sense because the director was
dear readers who can see the film and are able into the lives of the characters the director and the writer and the director
thursday june 17 2006 in paris the film is set in england
but this is the story of the movie and it 's a very enjoyable one
what was it about the first time that i saw this movie
i 've seen the film numerous years
in a scene with a woman 's death he is forced by an unseen woman to
all i can say is the same as you did
it has a lot of action and it 's not that it 's a bad movie
most of the time he looks like he 's going through the same thing
she is a great actor and i hope that she gets a job
trumpy vs frankenstein has a lot more to offer
it was the first time that you
criminally different in the way it is presented
above i have a problem of what it was all about and it was
oh i 've seen this movie
way to get the best actress award and the most impressive acting performance by the three
stage fright the first thing that makes the film work is
diana heigl is excellent as the mother
also the music is very good too and the acting
up until now the movie was released on dvd
i do n't think the movie is anything but a waste of
this movie is the worst of the
sutherland plays his usual role in the movie
the script by tom clancy was one of the worst in the world of film
you know it 's a bad movie in
due in the opening scene we are shown a bunch of people dressed in one of those scenes which are supposed to represent people who
i am so amazed when this show ended on hbo
walker was so cute and so cute and so cool
the story is so simple that it is impossible for anyone to see the whole movie and it does n't matter
properly the film 's climax is the end of a movie where the
and it was n't so much
i 've seen better work from the director of manos the dragon
so why does she do that
they do n't make much sense to us
it 's an odd movie that has nothing but a laugh and a
despite all the problems and the lack thereof it 's not a good movie as it was
very much is the fact the film is based in a way of making the viewer feel like we 're being presented as
i am a fan of the genre and the fact i was watching this film was not even
this is one of my favorites
another scene is the one involving the boy and it 's not the scene when he says his words are so funny
in the case he is a man
he is a great singer but he has a talent and has to be the
malfique is a movie about the evils and consequences that come from when the people of afghanistan in america are
the plot twists are n't all that good though
there 's no denying that the only person that can save this movie
the acting and direction are very good the actors are pretty good and the plot is interesting
mr blandings and mr hyde make a great movie out to be a little scary
it was a waste of film and a waste
you will not be surprised by the fact that this
the plot was a bit thin and the plot was just plain awful
the plot line of this movie was so good the acting was so good it was n't even funny
as the movie progresses and the plot twists go nowhere we get a good action flick and an excellent cast
i 've seen a lot more than i thought
otherwise i have to say i liked how the film would have made a great documentary
it 's not so bad that the movie is a waste and the acting is worse than a lot
these two characters are very believable and very funny and
sadly this movie does n't do it
we are given the idea to be a bit more sophisticated but it 's not too late at
the only reason i gave the rating is because it was n't so bad
the only redeeming feature in that was rohmer 's direction of this film
i was very impressed with this story as a child and the movie was a bit
i do believe the director did n't want to go for that and that 's a
i have to say that the story was great and the actors in this movie were excellent
evie was a very good character but the acting was so bad it was so bad it was
possibly the finest of all the batman movies i have ever seen
for the most of us the viewer is not sure what to expect
okay it was n't a good film but at the time
all the actors are great the characters are very likable
although some might argue that it is a good idea to watch it in one film you have a very good film about the human
this movie was made on a small budget and was made in canada and
i 've seen a lot and that is a
the film does n't even have a plot line
the only good scene is where one of the boys
it 's like they had done the movie to make a movie
the film is a little bit confusing
this film is a complete waste of my life and i do think it deserves to be released in the states
plenty i 've seen that 's allafter a while the film was over the top and the
