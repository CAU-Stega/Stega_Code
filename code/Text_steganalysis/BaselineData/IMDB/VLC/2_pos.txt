since this is a film i would n't want it to end
i was surprised that the movie did n't get a theatrical dvd release but
what i did n't like is the fact that the
a good cast of supporting characters and the cast
it 's a shame that this was n't released on dvd
the acting was horrible the directing was worse the
title o e o o t
tom and matt are the only people on earth who will have a clue of what the movie 's
literally this movie is just another bad movie
and the film is a little too slow to be a complete mess of a film that is
babe and the beast is a film about an unhappy family
crutches of a good story is about a man trying hard to find out what happened to her
it 's not the worst movie i ever saw
for a movie that was supposed for a
some of them were so funny that you could forgive the actors
not to mention the fact the movie
those two have a very good idea and i do n't know what they were thinking and how it was possible to
i do agree with the other comment on the acting
the story is about a bunch of friends who are trapped on the same island
instead the movie is about a man named sam who tries to make his life
after all the story and the characters are all there is n't much of a plot
she has the most convincing role and the
it 's a shame that this movie did n't have to rely on the fact the film had to have a cult status
maybe it was the fact i was n't watching the movie but i was n't sure if it was a comedy or a drama
i have never heard a thing so much about this
this is the best of all the films i 've seen
i was so bored by the movie
some have criticized this movie for the fact it has been released theatrically in a local video store
ok the movie is n't that great
someone who has been a huge fan of his work should be aware of how the director could have made this a classic
miriam hopkins is a very good actor and is a very talented comedian
i have never seen any of these films
marion davies is a very good choice to play
this is one of the most enjoyable movies i have seen in a very very
films such a shame as the best of them
you 'll see it coming from the same angle
but it 's still a great film for the whole time and i recommend you check this out
if you 're looking at the end of it you 'll find it a very
this is a great movie and i recommend you
this is the kind of thing you 'd want in an early 80
my friend was a little girl in a mental health facility but i thought it was the worst of all the guinea pigs
since i have n't seen this one i can honestly say
the acting and the script are horrible the script is terrible it is n't even that good
surely a movie that is n't even worth watching
the movie is very well made with a
what i got was a movie about a young boy who
will smith and his wife have to be a complete jerk
so i guess it 's a good movie
i have never heard of this film
moonstruck is one of my favorites
this was the first time i have viewed this show and i think
but the film is not so bad as a whole
when i saw it i had to watch a film that is a complete waste
let 's face it this was n't a movie for me
the acting is very poor and it is a shame the actors did not get involved in it
his performance was the worst thing i had ever heard
i have n't seen the first film
they 're not the best of the gamera movies but it
i have never read any reviews about a film which was n't as bad
why do i care for the main
i'm a fan and the movie 's soundtrack and cinematography are very good
it 's the story of a woman who is a little girl and the girl in
noticed the film 's success of a film noir and the
1010 the movie is n't as bad as
ernest is not a good actor and he does have a lot better to work on
the story is about a young boy who has
listening to the title character 's character and
i have seen the movie twice and
here 's the story a group of people who have no idea about each other is the same way
the movie was a complete failure in the first place the second was a lot of
it 's the story about an aging family who is trying their luck to find
the film is a complete failure
and that 's not a problem because the movie was so bad and the acting was terrible the plot was horrible and i did not care for the characters
the story line has a lot of holes but
the movie is a complete mess of a film
makes it a movie to sit down
anyone with an interest at the end will be able to relate to what the director is trying and failing
this is one movie that is a complete waste
misguided but not the worst film ever made
stylistically i do n't know why i have never
the story is about a bunch of people who are trapped on their honeymoon in a remote island
if you 're going through the whole thing and you have to be a fan of the book you will probably be disappointed
the film is a bit too long and it 's too hard to find the characters and the story is so contrived
version of it 's a good idea
hanna barbeau is a great actress and i hope she
well i do not know what it is
while i was not impressed at the beginning the film was a little too much for my taste as a whole
the story is simple enough to be a comedy but
a good film that i would recommend for anyone with a sense about it
so what if you 're a teenager
so i have to say i have seen a
i think the movie is very funny
i do not think this movie is worth seeing for its historical value
the film is a little slow and slow paced
the acting in general are pretty good
we 're talking to each other in a different manner
not to say that it was n't a good movie
the film is not a documentary about life and its subject
the story is very interesting and the characters and the situations are so real
this movie is a must for anyone looking for something like
the movie is about a man who is in a coma and his father is killed
it has been a very good movie since
visually the acting was superb and it was a good idea to see a good
this is the kind to show the world of war and how it is going to get to the point
so i guess i 'll give it a try
having read all the negative reviews on the imdb i thought that this was a great show
she 's a little more convincing than the
the movie is a very interesting one
i'm a fan but i was not impressed at all that
for the first time i saw a preview that was made to look like
overall i would say that it is
the story of a woman who has to be one of those movies to make her a good person
however the film is a bit too slow
personally i would n't be surprised that this was a sequel
the story is a simple mix of comedy romance romance drama romance and drama
handsdown the most interesting thing in this movie are the characters
that is the only reason i can remember the movie
everyone else has their head broken down
shortly thereafter the film is a bit of the spoof
if you have n't read it do n't bother watching it and you will find yourself wondering
this movie is a great movie for those who want a fun movie
a few years later the film is still very entertaining
multiplayer has been done so many times in the past few years and that
distributors have been on the lookout for this show since it is the only show that is so funny
every single person who has ever read this should
i do n't know if this is a
this film is a must for fans
the acting in this movie was very poor the directing was terrible the directing
the movie is about a man who is in love with a young man who is trying too
the movie is a little slow but
my favorite parts of this movie are the ones where the girl is talking with a guy and she says that the movie is funny but the
but this one was n't that good
while the film is a bit long and a few scenes in the film are a bit long the film is still a nice little thriller about a man
that 's what i would like to see a
but the story is a little too long
this is one of my all times
try not even get into the film
why does n't anyone else think that the movie 's main aim of a movie to
and the ending is a bit anticlimatic
but it 's not as much fun
if you 're going through a whole lot of time to see this film it 's not worth it to get a hold
i was n't impressed when it was made
one can only imagine that the film is a very poor movie
drowned in an automobile accident by a mysterious stranger
someone who was n't a huge child of the gods who saw
most of the time the film was made up for a long time but it was n't a complete waste of my life it 's just a waste
this was one of those shows that i did n't know what to
like the first film the characters are so real it 's almost impossible not like it was made on an island
it is a shame that it has n't been done
20 minutes into the movie you get to see a bunch of the characters interact with
i was n't expecting much from the first film but i was expecting a lot of
purists of the original series should steer far far away from this movie and not even get a glimpse of what
tricks are not the only thing you can do to make
once in a movie you see the same movie as the one that is in the book
or maybe it would n't be too easy to make a movie like this
it is n't a movie that is not a good movie
now i know that this film is n't going anywhere near as good as it was in the first place it was a good one but it was n't
a lot of it is the same
once again this is the worst of it
it 's the same old story about people and their lives
raptor island is a great example
when i saw the film it was a complete disappointment and i could not help thinking
the film is a complete mess of a film
there was no plot line and the acting
of course it 's not the same thing as this movie is
the movie is very slow moving and not very exciting
the story was a bit thin but the characters were very believable
you know what i am getting
i do n't understand how this film got such a high score
the acting is good and i really liked that movie
on the other hand the movie 's plot is a
the acting was terrible the script is awful the acting is bad the directing awful it 's all there
i have n't read many of the other comments on the film but i think that the film
as a result the movie was very good
read the book the book and the book
it 's a shame because it 's not a bad movie
first of alli the film was a little slow but i was n't really sure how it was
and i do agree that i have
a lot of it has a lot to do
hence that the film is not a total
to make matters of the same is not true
this is the best movie ever
the movie has some good acting but the story is not really that great
at one time the movie 's main character was the only actor i could see in a film
abominable and boring this is a great example of what happens when you 're a kid
if you want a film that 's worth seeing this one
the film has a lot to offer and the film
he has the best role in this film and is one that everyone should see
i have to say that the acting is good and the story is very believable
melissa is the most beautiful character in
but the film has no real plot
how many people do the movie makers have done
i have never seen such a movie
of the three films that i 've watched i 've seen this film
this is a film for all ages and i would recommend this movie to anyone who loves the genre
read the book for the first half of the movie and then
without spoiling this i have a hard way of saying
its just a waste of my favorites
truly this film is not worth watching for any of the actors
the acting and script were terrible
once again the film has a lot of fun and it does n't have any
and it does n't matter that the story
god knows that the film is a complete mess of an action movie
one thing i noticed is a very interesting story
the story of the story of a man named sosuke who has been
that 's what i would have expected from a movie
leonardo dicaprio as a tough man in a supporting character is an actor that is very funny as a villain and is a likable person who is always a good actor
eventually the two men get involved in a
kal penn plays a young woman in this movie
a few scenes are just too much
besides it 's the worst film that i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through and i would not have had
my favorite scene is the scene when the girl is walking around a table talking about her boyfriend being raped by the camera
on the other hand it 's a very nice movie and the actors who
in a way i did n't like the movie because it was so
the acting and script is very good
scientist is an intelligent character who 's a real person and is a good actor
it 's a shame that it is
i think that 's what it is
at first i thought it would get better
the story is about an ordinary woman who is a woman and is a woman who
frustrated to say the most of all the characters in the book
overall i give this movie an 8 for a
none is that this is a good movie but it 's a good film that is not only the worst movie ever but it also has an intriguing
i do n't think i 've seen anything like the other films in the genre
but the movie has some of it
african americans were a very popular group of people and they had to
sheba 's character is the best of the bunch of the film
noah and his friends are in the family 's home for a week
and the ending where she is a little
because of the fact it was a remake i had the feeling that i was in the movie for the first time and it was the
brown 's character in his first movie is a great actor but he
but the film does have a certain point in it that makes it worthwhile
the acting is good the writing and directing is great and
this movie is a great example of how a movie should be
just a few minutes later the story of the
to be sure that the director has done so well that
but it is not the worst movie ever
a few years later she has been a successful woman in a long life and
all the while the film is set up in a very simple manner
ok so the movie was pretty bad but it was a
it 's just a little too slow for a movie to be a comedy or a drama
but i have no problem with this film as a whole
he has a good sense to make a movie
well the first half is just another
not only is he a bad actor but his performance was also quite good and he was
later the film becomes the most annoying and boring movie that i 've ever watched but i have to say that the acting is good and there
the acting is horrible and the plot line seems like they had been thrown together by a drunk
the story was very simple but the movie did n't make any sense at all
i was n't expecting much from a movie that was n't bad
the film is a little slow but it does n't have a lot
well i was n't impressed with this film but this one is not for the masses
so the film is a complete mess of a story that has nothing new or interesting to say
and the film does n't seem that much
you 'll have a lot of fun with this one as it has the best elements
he is the only person that could be a hero or even a good man but he was a good actor
this is one of them that is
overall this movie could have been better
bark of a hat is an excellent movie that will keep your interest in the end of your seat for a
there is a scene with a guy who is a little bit too busy talking to the camera
this is a very bad movie
it has to be said to make this movie
now i know that i do n't like to watch it but i do not know what to do with it
she has a lot of talent
i have seen this movie and the only one i have seen is that of the great hulk
there 's also some great music in the film
i have never seen such an awful performance of hers
if you are a fan and have read that it is the best movie you can find this
there is nothing wrong in this one but it is not
well i have n't seen the movie but this was just a great movie
chaney is a very talented actor
from a technical point of view i was surprised to find that there are
it 's a shame because this movie is a
they are both a very talented and capable actor and i would recommend this
the story of the story was a lot better and it was n't a good idea
oh yeah it 's not that bad either the actors are good and
ok so i was a bit skeptical about this movie and
on this one the film has an interesting story and a very strong story
there is a scene where he 's a little girl in the car
in fact the only thing that is missing is the fact that there 's no real explanation for the story
i think the reason for this movie is because it has been done so much better
his acting was n't as wooden
mary is a good actress and is the only one who has to play
the film is a bit of a
it is a very good movie
the film is a bit too dark for words and it
my advice to the director for the film 's title was the fact i saw this film in a cinema and it
and the movie is not a bad
the movie was shot with the same name as the first film and that was n't a good
when you watch this movie you can feel the pain that the director of the film had on the audience
please avoid this at any time if you
they have to go to the movies of the director to make a movie about a bunch of people
we 're not talking about a film that
this is a film that i recommend to everyone interested
i do n't know how it got made in the early 80 's and early 90 's but that does n't make for an excellent movie and it certainly has some redeeming
considering this is a film you should watch
and i was surprised that the movie is
unfortunately it was n't a great movie
marking the movie and then the film has a lot
with a lot more to say about this film
also the scene in which a girl gets her tits is not even funny
the film is about a young woman who has a crush on her
sadly i have never heard that the director was so pleased to find the original movie to
i think it 's one of those movies that i think is a great deal
for those of the us who are looking for the movie to be a little bit too
however this was not a good movie and it is not
could n't they have had the money
thank god i did n't get it
the movie was a bit slow and boring
anyone who does not know this film was a little more sophisticated than the original movie and the first half of the film
he is a very nice guy who has no problem finding himself in the
i have never seen any film that has been made as much as this but it 's not a good movie
like i mentioned before it is not a bad movie and it does n't make sense but i do n't think
you know the story of a man who was killed in the end of this
a very good movie with great actors and an excellent story line
old man who is a man who has been killed by an evil virus and a
either way it was a very nice film to see and i would recommend to anyone who likes to watch the movies and enjoy the movie and enjoy it
he is the most talented person in the film
yes it 's a great movie
another example that this movie could be made for a razzie award nomination
she is the one who gets to do the best in her
clive is a very talented character who is very
i think it is the best movie ever
on this one the actors do not seem like they were reading
did n't you think that the real world would ever
firstly it is the story that makes it a great movie
no wonder it 's not a great one
the story was n't very good
it 's a pity that the movie
somewhere along comes the first half of the film is the same as the first
as i said earlier this film was not a total waste of money it is a waste of my life
well it 's a little too long
ive never heard of the movie and it was
whole movie is just a bunch of
it 's a shame that the film is so bad that it 's almost impossible for me and i do recommend the whole
the story was a bit confusing at first because of the fact there was
he is also a very good guy
then the film switches to a very bad
and the acting is horrible and the acting is awful and it 's not really funny
either way it 's a great movie
i think that the best thing about this movie is it is a complete waste of time
boy i love the movie and i think it is worth seeing
her acting is very poor but she
the movie was shot in a cheap digital style which
this film is a must for anyone who wants a laugh out
heston is the only one who is able for the role of the
loc is not the best character in the movie but his portrayal is not a bad one
because of that i was n't expecting much of the story and
do n't worry about that but if i were a little bit of a fan of this movie i would have enjoyed the movie more
with a lot of money this movie has a lot to say but i do n't want to spoil it for you
still the movie does n't make sense and the story line is
i think that 's a shame because the film does have a lot to offer
he 's the kind of guy who has to fight for his own life in order
if i was n't that i 'd be in the middle of this film as i was
i was so impressed by it
this was the best film that the
if you have a masochistic stomach and are a bit more masochistic than you
kevin spacey plays the part he 's in
i was so excited to see this movie in
i do n't want it to happen in my head
wife is an excellent character study of a woman
walsh is one that makes you think
this film is a very bad one
his character is a stereotype of a woman who is in love with a man who has a very troubled husband to do the same things she has to do
it is a very funny movie
it 's not even the same
labeling this one on the imdb is a waste
the movie is a complete mess
you can see the director 's cut and the camera angles and lighting and lighting are
when he finally finds a way he is killed and the police officer is killed by a
as a result i found the story very engaging
in fact the film was so bad that it could
to be honest it 's not the greatest movie ever made
it 's not a good movie and it 's a shame that the film never
it 's not that i do see a film like that of any
but the film is not so bad
now i know that it is a movie that is so stupid
there are so much better films out in the us
the film has some good points but it is still
carlos mencia was in the film and
the movie is very good in the beginning
it is a great movie and i recommend you do n't watch it
we are supposed to sympathize with the characters
a very interesting movie about how it is about a woman and the
a good film with an excellent script and an interesting
brown is one that is n't a bad movie but is
as a matter the film has a certain charm and a sense of realism
he is a very good character actor who has a very strong role
despite the fact it 's a movie about a young boy it 's a very interesting film
and it 's a shame because the movie
he has the best lines in the film
the story is about a man trying his hand at the world and the
really the film 's biggest flaw is to make
the acting is horrible and there is no chemistry between characters in any other movie
jimmy fallon 's character is just plain stupid
physically he is n't the best actor of the bunch
outside of a few of these films i found it
he is the only one that has ever seen him in this
he has a good time and his character was a bit more likable
anyway i think the movie has a
sure it 's a great film but not a movie for everyone involved
the story line is a bit confusing but the movie is a good
the film is a little bit of the first
you have a great cast and an excellent cast
it 's a shame that this was not released on video or dvd
i do n't know what the hell was going for it i guess but
the movie has some great scenes
it is not a movie that i can only recommend to anyone
now i do not know why i did n't watch a lot
i have to wonder if the director was trying too much
the story is about an ordinary man who has been sent into a life by a young woman
mateo is an alcoholic who is sent to prison with a group of young people to help the poor boy who has
so i guess the movie is a bit slow but the acting was pretty good
not only is this movie a complete waste of money but the whole
i think that it is a very good movie and should
the acting is good but it does
what 's the deal of the plot
after all this movie is n't about the people who have to be the best way to get out of it
she 's a very talented actress and she 's not a
andy griffith 's character is a caricature and the story is so full of holes that it 's impossible not to feel the need of attention to the characters
i was n't really surprised by this one
sands of the seat and his work is the best
as a result it 's not a good movie
this movie is one of many times that i would
but it does make a lot of sense to me as the story is told in
penelope raines is a great actor and i hope she gets more screen credit than this one is in the beginning
most importantly the scene where he has a little girl and a girl in his bed was a bit of
in fact the only thing good about this movie was the fact the
i think this film is a must watch for anyone who enjoys
all in all a fun movie with a great cast
it 's a shame that such movies were never released on tv
everything about it was just plain awful
the film has some of my alltime favorite actors
this is a film for the whole world and should have stayed away
just do n't expect much to this film
the film is a complete mess and the film does n't make a whole new sense
why do we have to be subjected to the movie
corey haim 's character is so bad it
of all of those movies this is a great film
simply put this is one film you can see in a movie
i think this is the best movie of the year
that 's a very funny thing
john huston is a fine actress
needless to believe the movie 's main
the acting is good with the exception that it 's not a good idea to show
put it this is the kind of crap i 've ever heard about the movie and
they have the best actors of the day and they 're all good
it 's just so stupid that it
it 's a very funny movie that is not funny
coop is the one that makes him look good and his voice
if you want the movie to get a bit of a message you 'll love this movie as well
hook and the film 's story is not a very interesting and interesting story
if i were to watch this movie again it would be a complete waste
but this is the worst movie of the year and the only one who has a good laugh at all is not that bad
the acting was good the story was ok
he 's the kind of guy that gets a lot of trouble with him
there is a very strong scene between the main character and a woman who is
apparently the film is n't a comedy
the story was a bit confusing and it did n't make sense but it was very entertaining
comic book is a great show and it shows
it 's not that i would n't have to watch it to see what it is
most movies have a good cast and the characters were believable and believable
much of it was made in 1980 the film is a little dated at best
while it 's not a great movie i would recommend this movie to anyone
it 's the same kind that i would have liked to
everything else is just so bad that you ca n't help but laugh and enjoy the movie even though you have to be the most annoying person
but the film is a very interesting one
so what i did n't see was that this movie is a bad film it was n't
then there 's a few scenes in which the hero is trying to get a few
the film is a little over the top
at least that 's what you 're thinking
as the movie goes on its own the story is a bit too simple for a movie to
endless spoilers ahead there 's no plot
this film has the same basic premise as the
if you want the movie you will find a lot of fun
when you watch it you can tell you that this movie is just a bad movie and it 's a bit of
i was surprised that this film was made in the early 80 years
if you have n't already seen it do yourself an favor do n't watch
whether or not it was the same thing that was in the book i thought
the story of this story was a bit too much to follow and it did
i think this is a great example for the film 's creator and the director for making a movie about the holocaust
really it 's a good film but the acting
the acting was horrible the script is bad the acting is horrible and the writing is just bad
the film was shot at an angle of the film which is the most important aspect of the movie
how many movies can you tell you that you 're in for
so what i was looking forward for
she is a good person and the movie has some good moments but
throw in a couple and a half of a bunch that 's
how did the director think this is a good idea
the acting is pretty good with the two leads being a bit better
naturally this is a great movie to see if only because it
the story is simple and it is the same story
she is a very talented actress and is a real joy
she is also the one who is the
i was so disappointed that the film was n't even nominated for a academy awards
alan rickman was the best of the two
like i said before the movie is not very good
other than that the movie is a little too long
was the first of the three _EOS
let me start by saying i love this film
surely it was the director of the book and the director 's name was
it is a very simple and moving movie
i have to say the movie did have a lot to offer the story line and the characters are believable to the point where they are trying to make the story interesting
we are shown to the audience and the viewer is left wondering
i think the director 's cut is a bit too slow
this is the worst film ever
just like the other two films
mr bean has a very small part as well and the acting is pretty bad and the story
he is a great director and a good man
like the previous reviewer said this is a good movie to be watched by a young audience who would
the movie starts with a very promising opening sequence where a man who is trying a cure in a bar in
at least it is n't a good movie
i was n't really expecting the same thing to be said about the movie
arau 's character is a very likable and likable person
but this is a very good film
he is the most talented actor of
finally the movie is a little too long and the story is too predictable
so the film is a little too long to be a good
at the end of the movie we learn how to be an outcast and
saturday night fever is a very funny movie that i would love to see
he is the only person in the movie and he is a great fighter
by the way i do n't know why
and that does n't make a movie a bad one either
on the other hand if i were to rate it 0 i would have
matt dillon 's character is a caricature
the acting is good but the script was so weak that it was almost
the movie was shot in color and the camera pans in the background
so what do i expect from this film
i was surprised by the ending and i was really surprised by how it ended
i do agree that the film has some of
the story is very weak and the characters seem to have
outstanding and a very good film that
the film is a complete mess
often it 's the same story and the acting and directing
it 's not even worth renting
sonatine was a great show that was a lot more enjoyable than it was and it is very well done
a good movie to be seen by everyone
what is more important to the story is the fact of the film 's title
the movie has an allstar actor who plays a young and very young boy with the right guidance
it 's a great movie and it was a joy that i would n't have to go
that was a good way of making a movie
has a very strong cast of people in their
this film is one of the worst movies ever made
basically the movie is n't really a good movie
all of these are the best i
but the film has some very interesting moments
in this case the movie is a complete waste of time
part 2 has a very good plot but i think it was a bit slow and boring
the movie starts out as a typical
not to mention that the acting is bad
everyone involved in the making comments should be required to make this
with this film he has to rely heavily on his own
we get the impression that the director is trying to make a film with his camera
shah rukh khan 's performance in his career is a bit over here
you have to be a bit pushy and have n't read any of these other reviews
as a movie it fails on many fronts
apart from that it 's not even worth watching
this is a very good show
this was a movie for me to be entertained
it 's the story about the life of two friends and their relationship with each other and the way they live in the real life
i was n't sure why the hell was n't so much
eventually he is a very good actor who is a good actor and has a great voice to play in his films
regardless of the plot the movie is very entertaining
so if the movie had a good plot and the acting was so bad it would n't have helped
granger and dunne are a pair of characters who
the film is about a man who is trying to get
sure this movie was n't a good film
historically the film has an interesting plot and a great cast
aboard the other hand the film 's main character
instead it is the worst movie i 've seen in a long while
now that 's a little bit too much for it
though it 's not that bad it 's still a great one
frankly it was a waste for the film
i have seen the movie multiple many times before and
oh yes i know that 's the only thing i can remember from this movie and i have to admit that i am not going through the
but the story was a little too thin and the characters were just too stupid to be true
the acting and directing was superb and the direction by the director was great and the
it 's not a bad movie
whereas i have to admit that i was n't impressed by the fact that this film was made on a shoestring budget i could only give it a zero
the movie has some good acting in the cast which is a pity because the story is so bad it 's almost painful
cliffhanger was the first time i ever heard of it
season 3 is a classic example of why the
not to mention that it was the first movie in the series of films
in the meantime of the movie the characters were
its a very good film with a good story good actors good story great acting
the film has an excellent soundtrack and a great score that is not to be taken from the film
momma is a very good film with a lot
a lot more than i expected
i have to admit i was n't impressed
zap 's father is the best of all
catherine deneuve as a woman and her husband as the mother is very well portrayed
another thing that is missing is the acting and the
and the acting was horrible the script was horrible the acting is bad
but this movie is so bad it makes you feel like you 've wasted a hundred dollars on
both films have a very good cast and are great
there are some very funny moments
it is not a bad film
and it is a very nice movie
it 's a very bad thing that this is not a movie for
great film and good acting great story good acting good music a good script good
and it was n't that good either i would have liked it if i had a little bit of fun with
honestly the movie is not as bad as the
despite being the first of the two films to be released on vhs
the film has an odd plot line
nobody seems interested to be able to make a good
i was so bored by this movie that it was hard not only for the first hour
i'm not sure if i am not a good person and i do not understand how the story is told
of this is how it is done with a great cast of characters
for me this was a very funny movie
rani silverstone was good and i thought she had the best role
he is a very talented man with his own unique
my favorite scene involves the scene with the woman
a lot happens to be seen
cinderella 's mother is a great movie that is not for the kids
but the movie is n't as good as the first two
the film is a complete mess
kelly is a great actress and she is very good in it and is the only real standout character of all time
this was an interesting movie to watch
elsewhere it is a very good movie
you can watch the movie with the lights and it is not a bad thing
after all the movie is about a woman 's life
i have never read the original novel or read the books but
rather the film is not a documentary about the war
but it is a great movie and i think the movie is very good in its own
asoka is one such a great film and it is the best of all
if it was a little bit more of an old movie i would have been surprised by the story
i was so excited that the movie ended up being so boring
that 's what makes this film so good
most of the film is about a woman who has been killed and has a crush on her
i do agree but the movie is so good that i do not know where the film was filmed and it was n't
its a very bad movie but it
instead of the usual suspects of the world we have no idea what to do with
even the music is n't very well chosen to
here we have a film about the lives between the two main players
seagal is a good actor but he does have some good lines and a great deal to work on
if you have a choice for a film you can appreciate the fact that the story
in the end the movie ends with a bang
watching this movie i was a bit skeptical
if you are a fan you will probably like this one but if your
it 's just a bad film and it does not work
also the scene where he is in the bar with the girl
the acting is very bad and i do think this was a very bad movie that was n't even worth the effort
my favorite part was that the movie was made in the early 90 's
but the film is a complete mess of the original
both films are a lot of fun
and it does not take a long to realize how the movie was made
while this movie was made in the us i was expecting a good film with a lot more than
every scene is a little overdone
in a nutshell this is a very funny film with a
no one could ever accuse the director to make
filmgoers who have n't watched the movie are either missing or reedited
the movie was made in the seventies but the film is very slow and the characters do nothing to dispel their motivations or their motivations and motivations
it was so bad that it could n't even be called a bad movie and it was n't even worth a dollar ticket
jessica tandy plays the mother who has a heart attack
most of the movie consists of various elements of the movie and the plot is a little confusing
i have never read the original novel but i
toby is a young man with his wife
it is the best movie of its genre and is one of the most underrated films of the year
i do think it 's the funniest movie i have ever watched
the movie is a complete mess
with the exception that he has been in his own for the most part the
it has a lot of good moments and it has some good points
you know that the film has been a lot better than the average hollywood film and it 's hard not for the first two
a good cast of characters and the plot was very interesting
leonard maltin has a great talent for this
russ meyer is the only one in the film who can act as a villain
as a result i was a fan that was the only way i could have seen this
do yourself a big favor and skip it
she has to be a woman
well i do not know how to describe the movie
if the movie is a good one you can tell that it has the potential of a good story
the movie was shot on location in the same year as
i have n't seen this film in my life since i was in the theater
produced to be a film that is a must have been a fan of any of the actors and the story
not that i have any idea how this film could have made a good story
a lot of the film was filmed on video
this is a very bad show
there was no real plot and no plot
the story is about two people who go to a house to find a new home in their home where their
the movie has some great moments
he is a great character and is a great actor and i love
it 's a shame because the movie is n't really a movie
there was no plot to this movie
and i was impressed by the story
carey 's acting was so bad that i was laughing hysterically hard
it 's a shame that this movie did have some
the movie is a complete bore
while it 's true that the story is not as bad it is very very
some of these movies do n't make sense but it was fun seeing them in a different light
at least it 's a good movie and a good movie
maybe the film is just about the only thing i can think of that
i think that the director should be commended to the director to give us the
it 's a very simple movie
jean gabin is a great actress and the acting in the film was very
this is the best of his career
the movie was shot with the same budget and
i have never been a fan of any of his movies but this was a great one
tv has a very good story and is
although i was impressed by the acting i found myself asking myself what was that
boring plot twists are not enough to make me want a refund to be made
so if i had n't been able for the most part to
experiences and the fact that the film was made in the early 80 's was a bit of a stretch
the acting is horrible the story is worse the dialogue is worse
burton is a great actor but he has a very bad role
after all it 's the best thing in a good movie
not only does it look like it is made in a very cheap way it looks pretty cheap but
i have n't laughed once and i was very impressed to find that the movie was not a
it 's not a movie about an evil killer who has a crush in his
whoever wrote this movie should be banned
the story line was a little confusing but the movie is a bit
of all things this movie is a total waste
what i did n't realize was that the director did so much
i have to say that it 's one of those shows that is so funny and
the movie is about the man who is a loner who is a man
but the real problem with this movie are the acting
this movie is a great example of a good film and it has some great moments
towards the end when the movie is over and over and over and over and over
other than that the plot was pretty weak but the acting and the
its not a bad film and the actors who play their roles are not very convincing and they do n't seem to be acting
how did they manage to get a movie that is so
abandoned in his own life and in his life he is the most powerful person of our time
you can tell that the film is not a comedy
as a movie this is a very bad movie
the movie was a little slow but the ending was very good and the
congrats for the actors and actresses
the story of the movie was a little too thin
i have seen the film numerous times in my life
it was so stupid that it made the movie a bit more interesting
the film is a very good film
i think that 's why this film
the acting in this movie was horrible
like the first movie it 's a little more of a drama than a horror movie and the ending is pretty predictable
i do n't think that this movie is the most original film ever to be made
there 's no reason for it
let 's get back on track the film is a total disaster and
the acting in the first movie was so good i was surprised that the movie had been released in the uk
his character is a stereotype who has been a loner and he is
even the music is n't as good
anyway i have a soft spot on
one thing is to say the least of it
scorsese is the master of this film and the film does n't have any of the elements
the story is very simple and very simple
all the while the movie is set in the middle of nowhere
now i have seen this movie and i'm
the story of the movie and it 's a little bit complicated but
this is a film for the lovers of the late forties
for the first half of the movie the acting is superb and there are a few good moments
so the film goes nowhere and it is not even a good movie
guiness was a bit of a loser in a movie that was a bit more than a comedy but it 's not a good movie
interesting and interesting and i do n't think that it
it has the most interesting character of the entire
shortly afterwards he is a young man in a small provincial city in the early 1930s and early 1900 another
slander of the plot was that the movie was shot with the lighting of a car
after seeing it i could n't help to get to the
in a way it is a great show
to be honest the film is very good
he 's a very talented actor and a great actor
i was n't impressed by it
but the film is a little too long
i think the movie 's main flaw is the fact that
jessica alba plays the daughter who is the only person to be
an interesting film and an excellent movie for anyone
before i wrap up this i have the displeasure of watching a film with the same director and director
ok i do not think that this is one of the best movies of the year it is a great film and a good one for those of us
i think it is a shame
people who do n't know the difference between them but i have no
near the end of this film i thought it was a very poor movie and i would say
but the film 's plot is not as
not only does the film have an interesting message but it is also quite entertaining
slowpaced is the only thing that i liked
it 's the story of a girl in a mental hospital who is trying to get her son to go to a school
the movie was a bit too long and the ending was too
a few years back i have a 35mm video of the show
reporter sam raimi is an excellent actor and he 's
and i have to say that the movie is very good
this is a movie for the whole generation of people that do n't have a lot of fun watching this
this film is a complete waste of time and money and time to waste your life on it and
the film is a little bit too long
grease is a movie that will appeal to everyone who likes a good movie
4 a group that was in a car accident
well i have n't seen this movie yet
the acting and direction were very good
the movie was a waste and i was surprised to find it
the story was n't very bad but the acting
however the movie is a complete waste of time
i have to say the film has a good deal of humor to it that is not only for
but it was not a good film
this movie is not for everyone
all in all it 's a great movie that is a must
the film is a little slow paced with some really
bruce dern plays a character who is not only an action hero but a very likable character and is a likable character
wonderful performances and the story lines
rita hayworth was a great character
the film has a lot to say
the acting is horrible and i have n't even mentioned it
if you 're going through the events in the first half you will find a lot more than just a bunch of other movies
it 's a very good movie
this movie is so bad it hurts
based on a play by the author of the famous novel the film was written by a man named john a man in the same cloth as he
the acting is horrible the story line is awful
this movie was so awful it was funny
as a fan i have to admit that the film is a little too long and i think it 's a very good thing
the movie is a very interesting one
i think that the best part was the ending
5 the acting in this is pretty poor the
lame acting bad script terrible direction
i'm not saying that i am so disgusted that i have seen it in a movie theater
mccool has a lot of potential to make it and it 's
now that i have seen it i have a hard time figuring out what it was about but i
i was expecting a great story and i was surprised
general tanz is a very good film
it 's a shame to see a movie like that in this movie and it 's not
it 's just so bad it 's good to me
the story of the film is a bit confusing
a good cast is wasted on this one
2 the acting is n't bad but i did n't think it was the script or the direction
it 's a very simple movie with the
so what do you expect from an independent film that is so bad
like many other reviewers here have mentioned this movie is
however i think the movie has been a lot better since the
based in the real life story of the famous american family the story of a man who is
the movie was a waste of my favorites and i would have to say that i was disappointed
if i were n't that i would be able to overlook that
this movie has a lot of action and it 's not a bad movie but it is n't
the movie was a little slow but the story was very good the characters were well
he is not a good actor
my friend was in the movie and i was n't impressed at the same level
i think the reason why i gave this
people who have seen this film are not sure who it is
but it is not a movie that you 'll watch over
the film is a bit slow moving and the plot is n't that bad either
beethoven is not as much an action hero as he is in
to be fair i have n't seen it since the first movie i saw in the theater and i
i do not think the director should be allowed to write an essay for the movie
suddenly the film becomes a big hit and the film ends abruptly
maybe it is the director 's fault to the point of view of a movie
there 's a lot going on here that 's the point of this movie
while the film is a bit slow paced and the plot has some holes there was a lot to be learned
some of them are not as good
as a result the movie has a lot more to offer
it is not a film that will be seen by anyone with an appreciation for film making and the most
he 's a good actor but his character was so annoying
matt damon plays the character who is a real cowboy
only a few people will be able to
the story line was good but the characters
so if i were to make an elaborate movie i
silly and pointless but the movie does a great disservice to its subject matter
it has a very good ending but it is not a movie
all the actors were very bad and the story was just stupid the characters were n't believable and the plot line had a lot of holes
i think that it is a shame that the film has
13 out of 4 stars but not enough to keep you watching
i think it 's a shame because the story is so
but this is a film that should have been released in the us
the story is simple but it is n't
frankly the movie is n't as bad
i was so excited when it came out
over the course of this film there is an odd and unnecessary scene that will make you jump and the ending will probably be a bit too abrupt for me
there are many many things in the movie that i did n't like about this show
lieutenant is a man in the army who has a small part as a young girl
an excellent film with great performances from the
as a result the film has no plot and it just does n't make sense
it 's a shame that the film
this is not a film that is a complete waste of your time and a complete lack of a better plot and a better storyline than the average hollywood movie
and the movie is a bit too slow for a movie like the matrix
i was surprised to see that the first film was a bit of a disappointment but it was a great movie to watch
well this was one of the best movies i 've ever seen
ok i do n't know why
in fact the film is not as bad but it is not a good film and it
to me it is a great movie
i do agree with the reviewer that the movie does n't have a single
the story is about a young girl who is a woman who wants a child and she 's been married to her
this is a very good and very entertaining film
all the while this movie has a lot
in a nutshell the film was a little too much of an insult
brady is a good actor but i
mental capacity are the most interesting things to come out of
by far the best of it 's kind
and i do n't know what the hell was going wrong with this movie
a very interesting story with a strong message about how the world of the war is going
the acting in all this is good but the plot is so bad that it is impossible
first of all the movie is not about the story of the characters or their motivations or actions and the events in which the characters interact
get to the bottom and you 'll find a new version of
haig is an intelligent man and his mother who 's been kidnapped by a man in a mental institution is a very good idea for a movie
i was surprised to discover that the director was trying hard to
seeing this movie was like watching paint grow and the devil 's rain in the same
the film 's main flaw is to have a few laughs
additionally the film is not a good movie
the story is very good and it
after a while the movie is a mess
by far the worst thing about that was that it did not even have any of
do you think the movie is supposed to have
the story is a bit slow but
it has a very funny and funny scene
second the acting is pretty awful
are they all that really really really bad
as a movie it is not a great one but it is a great movie
i do not recommend this movie
to me it 's just another film
it 's a very funny movie
so what if it were a good thing
although the movie is about a man who is trying and tries hard on his luck it is
the movie is about a bunch
i do not think that this was intended as
sure it is a little bit too long
is this the worst movie of 2008
kind of an old fashioned and the
this movie is a complete waste of time to watch
it 's a very simple and funny show with the most famous cast members
they were all very well cast and i was impressed
as for the acting it 's a good thing to say
these are not a bunch or two of the other
once you get past this you have to be a sucker for
this was a movie that i would n't watch if it was on tv and the movie was just plain stupid and i
instead it has some of the worst acting i 've ever heard in a movie and it 's the only reason i even considered it a 9
death bed was the first movie i saw that i saw as an example for myself
why do i give this a 1
the story is very interesting and it is a great family film with a strong story line
he is also the only one that is able to survive
it is not even a film it was a waste of my money
and that was the only way to make
something about the film is that it is the first movie
she is not only an actress she 's just a little too cute
this was the first time he appeared in the movie and
the movie has an allstar actor and it
it 's a shame that the movie did n't get more
though i was expecting something more than the usual hollywood blockbuster i 'd say this
but this is a movie about the real life
i do n't understand the appeal for this movie
it has the best of all the great actors and actresses
hmmm the movie does n't have a good cast
this movie is so awful that the viewer will laugh at every joke and
regardless the movie is a little too slow and slow for the
and the acting in the movie is just plain bad
the film has a lot of good points
the story is simple and it 's a bit of an adventure to the point of the story
the story is a complete mess
a lot of things are happening in the movie
after seeing the movie i thought the movie is very
the story was very weak but it was a good movie and it was fun
you know what to do with the story
one of the best movies of the last decade
as a result of a few films the movie has no sense of reality or purpose whatsoever
katt is one of the worst movies of all
always the worst movie i 've ever watched
the film is about a young man trying to find out who his father is
the acting was n't bad but the plot was n't really bad
if you 're looking for something that 's not bad enough you 'll be bored and bored
nearly all of these are the same people in the movie
instead it has a very weak plot and an interesting premise
a few years after this one was released i saw it
i think that the best of the movie was that the film was n't as much a comedy
so the film was a complete failure of the first movie
i have n't read the manga but it is
what 's the point in this movie
it 's not a bad movie but the acting and
seeking to get out the door and get rid
but the film has the best of the three
ratings 1 the movie itself is not very bad
unfortunately the film is a complete waste of film
the story line was good and the acting was good
gosh the story was a little weak
it is not a film that is not for everyone but a good movie
a few of the characters are good
edna 's character is so unlikable
something about a man who is a little more than
the film was shot in color and
to make matters even less ridiculous the film 's plot becomes a convoluted
so i have to say that this is a very good film and i think i 've enjoyed it
this' is the most important aspect in this movie and the acting is excellent as the story is set in motion and the characters are all over
yes it 's a bit slow and the acting is n't bad either
not only is the acting bad but the actors are n't really bad and it makes the movie unwatchable even more
this is a very bad movie and a complete mess
of the few movies of the same genre i have n't
outside a film with the same title a woman is killed
we 're told that the story is not a good one but the movie has its own unique moments
the film was shot with no imagination and was a bit of a stretch
another thing that is so bad was how much the acting
last but still not that it was n't
the story is very simple but it
i'm not sure why the film is a bit of an insult to the book
ca only have the same name as the first
this movie is a great film for
lucas 's character in this movie was a bit of an idiot who has no idea of what happened and who he
he is the only person who can make it through this movie that has a few lines and a few lines but the film is not
considering the fact that it was made for television it would have been better
i do not recommend watching the movie
first off i was n't a fan like me but it is n't that good
patricia clarkson is a delight in her performance but she does
the film is about a young man who has his
don knotts plays the role of a very wealthy and humble man
in this case he is the most beautiful woman of her generation
i'm not a fan of the original but i have a feeling that this movie has no redeeming qualities
this is the kind that the film has a very low budget
the story was so weak that it could n't even be described as an insult to the viewer to the audience
this was the best movie i have ever seen
it 's a shame that the director of this film never got a theatrical dvd release
when i first read the comments on the imdb page for this movie i thought i had to read some reviews
however the movie is not a comedy
if you want to see a film that will leave you with the feeling you should watch this movie
i do think it was one that was n't even close in any other way
a few of them are not so good they 're all so funny
after the movie i thought it was a pretty cool movie
as the story unfolds we are left with an almost unrecognizable feeling of emptiness
another problem was the ending and ending the story
did anyone ever want the money back
but this movie is just plain awful
bunuel has created some of his best films and he
i have to wonder how the director could have been so much better with this movie
hazel clayburgh was great in the role of a lifetime woman and she 's not just a bad actress
perhaps this is the best film ever
maybe the director was a genius
this film has no redeeming qualities at any time and it 's not the best of the bunch
this was the first movie i saw i would like to watch
a lot of it is the first time that we see a movie about the life of
an interesting premise to be found in a film about the holocaust
i think this is a great movie
as for it 's release i was n't sure what was going to be a bit of a spoiler but
unless you 're a diehard collector of the original and have a great time with the film i
immediately the film is a little over a long time and the end is
there are a number of other films that are so bad it is funny and
by the time the movie reaches its conclusion the movie is a bit of a letdown to begin
although i do n't know what to do with this movie it is n't that bad either
he is a very talented actor
i do n't know why this movie is n't available
now i have a fondness on the film and its a good movie to watch but i do n't think i have ever
the movie starts out very good but it 's not
to be honest i was not impressed by the story and the characters were n't believable
it is a shame to hear a song in the
this movie has a very good story and a
i think that this is the only movie that i could
the movie was shot in black
we have the first film in the series
but i think the film was a bit too long
the movie was n't a complete waste for the whole family
the film is not a documentary of a book
so what do i know that 's the
but it 's a shame because this movie has a lot going for it and
this was the first film to make me
i have never seen a worse film in the entire film
this is a great film for those of a certain type to be a good movie and
now i am not a fan of this movie
from the opening shot of the movie the film is a complete waste of time to watch
catch a glimpse and enjoy a great deal of time
in fact i think that the film was shot in a very tight
this movie does not even have a plot to make a good film and
i do n't think that the director
i have n't seen the first movie but
i have n't seen the first movie but the first movie is pretty good
i do n't know how it got going but i guess it 's just a movie
the film 's premise is a bit of
even the actors are not the best actors in this movie
he is a man of sorts and he has been in love with a woman who 's not a good
the film is about two men who live in the same house and have a different relationship with each other
the movie was shot with the handheld cam
or the fact that it was made on a shoestring budget was the inspiration for this film and
the movie is about the man who was
a few scenes are very good but they 're
i do n't know what to think of the movie is that it is a comedy
well the film has an interesting premise
the film is a complete mess
there is a lot to like about this show but it is still a very funny movie and it 's fun
as i watched this film the first time it was shown on television and it 's a very interesting thing
this film is a very good example
scalise 's father is a very nice guy
it is not a movie that is so much of a cult classic it is an
i think the reason for this is that the film is a complete waste of time
since this is a movie i do have to say that it has the best actors and the best actors of all
assume that it is n't a movie for the masses it is a very good and very entertaining film that
a good movie to be seen
i have never seen the original but i 've seen this movie twice in its entirety
either way it was n't that good
a few scenes are very good but the rest just did n't work at all
the acting and the script are horrible
christopher walken is excellent as a man and a very funny guy
the story is simple but not very interesting
this was the worst movie i have
for those who have never read a biography of the original novel and
i think this is a very good film but it 's just not
problem with the movie is that it 's so bad it 's funny and the actors are all
in a nutshell it was a great movie for those who like the original
the film has some good acting in the supporting role of david
even if you have a yen for the original and do n't know what to think and enjoy this show
none of the cast is good and the script is
and the ending is so bad that you wonder if the writer was going to be
whereas this is not a movie i think it 's a great film and a great example to the genre
being the first to be a classic film in the uk and a new one i have been waiting for it to come across as a
john wayne is the most beautiful character ever
it 's a pity that the film has a few more laughs
i have seen this film and have seen many many other movies
there was no need for the characters and the characters were just too stupid
i was expecting something better from a film like this one
this was a very good and funny movie with the usual
instead of the typical hollywood clichs they have a lot more money than
what i liked about it for the most is that it was a bit of a bore but that was the only reason i gave it the
the story is a simple mess
this is a great movie for everyone who wants the story to get to the bottom line
ok i have n't heard of this show since i saw it on cable
recap the first one is a bit slow and boring
the film has some good acting
we get to the point when we get to the end of this movie which makes the movie more interesting than the first
it 's a very good story
one thing i noticed about it was that the story was so weak and the acting was so bad that it could have done much better
i think it is a good movie to
mattei 's the film is a classic
the film is not about an evil family
the movie is about a group of young people trying to get married and have a very difficult relationship to the life
yet the film has a very strong and interesting look at it 's own
the story of the movie is about a man named benjamin
but the story is a little too long
the film is a little bit of the same for the whole series but the film has an
i think that 's why i liked it
it 's not even that good and i ca all agree with those who are n't
a few scenes of dialogue and dialogue were n't enough to save this film
left behind this film is the same
i do n't think i have any qualms of the plot
spoilers the plot of a man who is a young woman is a very interesting character
apparently the film has no real purpose
this was a great show that i was able to watch over and over because i was so excited when i saw the movie and i
and that 's the only reason to watch this film
we get an idea of what the movie 's plot is like
so the movie has its own problems
she 's a great actor but the movie does have a few
it is not even worth the time
or maybe it 's a good idea that a movie can
the film 's premise is to be commended
both of these films are not very successful
but the film is not so much that i ca n't believe it
not to be missed by the end
helen hunt is a very talented character and is a very talented actress
everyone in the movie was a caricature of the film
i do n't think this movie is a good thing
the movie was a waste of time
this is not the best film of the
the film 's main character 's motivations are not
pick up this movie and then get a copy
and it was n't that good
she was n't in this flick but she did a
all the other actors are all excellent and the story is
it was so funny to hear that they
we 're supposed to sympathize and sympathize with a bunch that is n't a good thing but that 's not enough
a good movie for the entire cast
they 're just plain bad and i think that 's why i hate this movie so i did n't see it in the theater but the first half was very good
the film is very well done
who would think the film 's title character
there is a scene where she is talking about her mother and she says it all
the film is about a young boy who is sent in prison for a life of his own
to make a long movie about the real mccoy the film is a total failure
i do agree but the movie has a very good plot
the acting is very poor and there
this movie was not a good idea for a movie to be made
rather it is the fact that the director and his wife have a different understanding of what it is like to make it through the film
in the end it 's not a movie to make a movie
some people are so stupid that you ca only have a movie that is so bad that you do n't care if the movie has any redeeming value
i have n't seen the original series but i do recall that it 's a bit different from what the original version
i have n't seen a more recent version and this is the one that made this so
the story of the movie is a lot of fun
she was so cute to me that it 's hard to believe that she
it 's just a shame to have a movie that is n't worth renting
this film is a very bad attempt at a slasher movie
christopher plummer is a fine choice to play a woman who has a very good role but is a little too old to play a character who
the story is about two young adults who go to the
we 're supposed the crux of the story but we are told that we are in for some good reason
basically it is the same thing
kal penn is a great actor and he plays a character who does n't seem to have any range of emotions
this is a movie about a woman and her mother
too bad they do n't get to show the real story in the first half
there are a number in which a character played with a depth
the film has some of the most memorable sequences ever captured on film
i think this movie is very good and i would like to know what the hell was going
heck i have a soft side of this film
at least i would n't have had a refund for this
i think this is the best part of a movie
the movie is a complete mess
also the ending is so ridiculous and
to be fair i have seen the movie and have to agree
also a few moments are very interesting
i think that it is not a bad movie and it 's not
in this case it is a film about two people living with their
he 's a very talented director
no matter how bad a person who is supposed
it is a shame that the director
also the film is a complete waste of time and time
another example is that this movie is not a comedy or an action movie
and i was n't impressed by this
while this is a good thing i think that the movie would have been more interesting had the director been
however i do have the feeling it was the intention that this film is so utterly
because the movie was a little too long for its own
it is a very funny film
there are some very nice moments in the movie but it is n't
i have n't seen a movie in my life so much as i have seen a lot more of these films
poor script and direction of the film and the actors are all very amateurish
some have commented the fact i have n't heard about this film
what is this supposed for a film
there 's no plot no action
the movie is a bit slow but it does have
overall i would say that this is a very bad film
amants a mano is the best
but this movie has no redeeming features at least it 's not
sure this is the worst of this movie
one of his most underrated movies was the one where it was filmed in the first film
this is a movie about how the
attenborough 's direction was so bad that he had been reduced by the director 's vision to the story and his work
the acting in the other actors was good the story was ok but i was surprised at the end and it was
to me this is a very funny film
your average viewer is a little confused and
big brother is a good guy and a good actor who can do the best
instead of being a little bit more than the sum we see
sunny is the most beautiful woman i 've ever
this film is a must see film for all ages
same as this one is the first
tunes are used as if they were written on the wind
unfortunately the movie does not have a lot of
i have to say i have seen a few movies with a similar sense
this movie is so awful i ca n't believe it
yet it 's not the most important movie of all times
granted there is some good acting but there is no real story
the story is very interesting and it
half the time you get to know what 's going to be done in the end
until the final showdown scene we see the two of them go on a road trip
no it 's not a good movie
the film is very well done but it is not
all the characters are likable and the plot line has a lot of
anyway i think the film is very good but i think it is very
the film has an excellent soundtrack and a
this movie is a must see
although the movie is a bit dated it has some nice twists to it and some nice scenery
also i think that the director and his wife should not have to have the same problem with the story
i'm a fan of this movie and have never heard of the film before
all the actors were good but the
i think that 's the best part of the movie
the film 's story was a little weak at the start and
i have never heard a movie before but i do not understand why this film did so many things
from the first scene of the movie and how the film ends the film abruptly builds up the
until this film is about to go to the cinema
two of the most memorable moments were the first time when a man and his son were sitting in a chair and the camera
eddie murphy was a great choice
if you 're looking for a good movie with an excellent story and great actors you will love this movie and
mckenna is the most beautiful character in
the movie is a bit slow but it 's a great film to see if not
i was surprised that this was a film that was made to cash in on a career
the story is a simple mess and a few of the actors are very good
our hero is a hero who is sent into a prison and is forced
what i found interesting was how the movie ended with such poor acting
as a movie this is a good film
wow i have n't seen this movie
obviously this was the case with a few people in the movie
not to mention the fact it has no redeeming qualities
but the film is so bad that i ca n't even begin watching it
it has a good cast including a few of the supporting cast including a young seth green as
his performance is a joy to watch
it is not a movie about how the people who made this movie
but it is a very good film
i do n't know why but i have to agree with
immediately he 's a little suspicious of himself
the movie is a bit too slow for the
this movie has no redeeming qualities at all
if you have a masochistic fascination with it you should definitely see it
swept away from a mental breakdown in the first film the story of the film was very interesting but it was not
so if the director is a real person he
like the other reviewers here mentioned this is a great movie and a great one
i was n't sure what was going on
when the film finally ended the story of the film 's success
whatever the case i would recommend it to anyone
columbo 's character does have the same effect and the same character
it 's a very funny movie and
just like the rest i was surprised to see the movie
john goodman 's character was very funny
you have to watch it to believe it or not it was a waste of my time
for those who do watch it i would have given it an 85
the acting and directing is superb and the acting is great
i do n't know how it 's possible to get a good laugh when the actors do
in a way it 's a bit more than
i was surprised to see that the film is not only
i was surprised to learn that this movie is
the acting was terrible the directing was
this film does have some redeeming quality
i was expecting the worst of this movie to be made in my
the film is a complete mess
overall this was an excellent film and i recommend it to anyone
i'm a huge fan of movies but this is the worst
however it 's not a good film it 's very very
the acting was good enough but the script by a different director
it was the first movie that i
i was so excited to find this one on tv in my library
but the movie is not so good as it was made for
i was so excited about the film and i was
it was a waste and i was n't sure whether it was a comedy
jack frost 2 has a great soundtrack
i do n't think i have seen a lot more than this
i was expecting something like this
complimentary is a very funny movie that
i have never seen the original series but it is still a very enjoyable show
however the story of a woman 's life and her life as a child is very different than the film itself
all the other actors are excellent
kutcher was a very good actor and he is a great actress
i have never seen any film that has been made as much as
i was expecting a movie to be done with some
while i was n't impressed by this one the film seemed very very very
imagine the film 's success in its own right
these were the two best known films i have seen in a long long and long
and the acting was good and the
she is the only one to have her name in this flick and i hope she
this was one to see in the first film
but this is not the movie for you
yet the film 's main flaw of it was the fact
her acting skills have been so bad
and the acting is so bad
by the end of this show i could n't believe the movie was n't even made in the slightest time
the movie is a very good film and it has a very
this is a great movie and i hope it
the movie is about the struggle of a man who is trying his hand at the
it 's a great film to be sure
how can a woman like the one that is the only thing that can happen in
as a matter of fact the film is a bit of a bore but i found it very entertaining
the acting and the script were terrible but the movie was n't really good enough to give it an 8 out 10
why is it so stupid that this is a very
pg13 rating pg13 for violence and language language
all the actors and crew were good
the story line of a man who is in the
this was an interesting movie to see in the
my friend was in the theater and i saw this movie on video and i have n't seen a movie so many years after seeing it
writers of the movie are the ones who
and the film does n't even have the feel to it
the film was shot with a handheld
it is a very interesting film
the film is a little slow and boring at the end but it really makes
once again i think this movie was just a waste for the first half
i do not recommend this movie for all the kids who have n't seen the movie but it 's a great movie for adults
even when the story was n't a little farfetched the movie was just plain boring to me and that 's not
one of the best movies i 've ever watched and the best thing about that film
what is more interesting about it
most of these people are so bad i do not know what to think of
the acting was n't too bad but
this movie was a complete waste of money and i would rather spend
at least it 's not the best movie ever made
but the film is a very good movie
actually the acting was pretty good and the acting is very
do yourself the same ol and worn up
i'm not saying this is a great film
they are both the same and that is the
raiden is the best character in the film and
censorship is not the case here but it 's still very entertaining and
the film has a great cast and
but it 's not a bad thing it 's just
he is a very funny character and he does not disappoint
i think it is one of the best movies ever made and i have seen it twice in the past 20 years and it is one of my favorites
nick nolte plays the lead character
i was n't impressed at the time and the story was very weak and i was n't really sure if it was going to be a comedy
on a technical scale the film looks like an amateur film
you have to see it for its own sake of the story of the characters
nothing really happens to be the same
the acting is good and i think the movie is very entertaining and very funny and i think it 's a good thing to watch this film
yet i still ca n't believe that this is the best of the three
basically this movie has no real story
yes it is true the story has some holes in it but the story itself does n't seem very
trying to be funny and funny is just a joke
on top this was a pretty bad movie
her character has a great performance as the mother of the young woman and the daughter
when you see this film it is a very long and boring film
the film is a complete waste
later on he finds out he has a brother and he is trying to save
fondness for that is that this movie was made in canada
there 's no reason that the film
learn a lesson and a woman 's life and her own life in
i think it 's a shame to hear that this is a film that is not even available
there are many things that are so stupid and pointless that i ca n't even describe the movie as a bad
with the exception being a bit of a stretch the film does manage
from there i found myself asking myself why i was in trouble with this one
the film is a complete mess of the original movie
freeman and the rest of his gang are very well cast
i think that it is one that i can watch for a few days
i think this is a very bad movie
in the end the movie has a good cast and a nice pace and a good story line but i do n't recommend the movie as
this is not one of those films
the movie was a little slow
c'mon i know that the director is not going on but i
obviously the director of a lot better than this film is but it was n't the worst film i 've ever seen
jody is a great character and she does not seem to be the only person who has to be one
the story is about two people in love and a married
but it 's not a bad idea it 's not a movie to make
the story of a young woman named anna 's daughter who has become
any one with a brain will find it impossible and the film has
i think that the best way to go to the movie is to see
how can you make such a good film
so the movie was n't bad but it 's just a
i do not know why i have never been so annoyed by it as the last episode
i do n't think that the actors are good enough for their
in the end it is the most beautiful and haunting film i ever seen in the history of cinema and in my humble opinion it was a great film that is a joy
you can tell that it 's a real stinker
do n't waste my time or time watching it unless i am just a fan of hers or i do n't want the
as i said the only thing that kept me interested was that it was n't a comedy or an attempt to get a movie
the acting was good and the story line was great but it 's not
i have seen the movie several times in my life
has the movie makers been a little more creative in this film and
together with the first one the film is
ravishing and very moving and the film is not a total success but i found myself wanting more than i could ever imagined
but the film is a little too long
whereas the plot has been done by many of its other characters it 's not a
evil dead man was one hell
regardless of the fact the director was n't able
this movie is not even worth the money
i was so bored when i saw it
it was a waste and i would
otherwise it is n't worth the money it takes
in the first film the main protagonist was in the first one
it 's just not a good film
also i think that the actors are very good and i think they
some of them are not as good or as bad as the ones in the movie which are pretty bad
if you are a fan of the genre and you like the original then this one is a mustsee to anyone interested
i think this was a great show for me to be able into
i was n't really expecting much of the plot and i was surprised that it did
it is n't a film that 's not
lucia is the best thing about this movie
this film is not a good movie but is
there are some great scenes in it
why do n't we have a movie that
when you see the movie you will be amazed by the
if you want a good film that will make you want you to laugh at this one you 'll be disappointed by this
this is the worst movie i 've ever had
it has a great cast and the acting was good
it is not a good movie
i was surprised to discover the movie was a success
we 're told to watch the movie
the acting and directing were excellent but the story and the script were very weak
through the years i have been looking for something more to the show
in the meantime he is a young woman and a womanizer
i was surprised that i had wasted my life with this one and that was the only way i could ever see it
even though it 's not a bad movie it does provide a
firode has a good sense of style
maybe it was a little too long and it was n't that
did i mention the fact that it is a
arthur 's father is a bit of a jerk and the rest of his character seems to be a bit too unlikable to be believable in a movie where his acting is a bit stiff
i think the director and director have done some research in this film
the movie starts off ok but the acting is n't bad at
in this movie it is a very simple movie
not a bad film to watch but it 's still pretty good and worth
i have to admit i am not a big fan but i was impressed to see that this movie is a waste of time to sit
he is the only one to be killed by a car accident
willem defoe is a very talented director but this film is n't even worth seeing
in fact it is n't the worst movie of the decade
now this is the first of its kind of a series
neither of them is particularly convincing
rated pg13 stars out 10 stars
the movie starts off with a bunch and the usual action scene in the movie
and that does n't mean that it was a complete failure to watch
it is not a film about a man 's death or a man who is a woman
shortly thereafter the movie has a very interesting story
i was surprised by this movie because it was so stupid
if you 're not a big floyd purist fan you 'll enjoy
this movie is one that you should
so what i did not see was the story
well this film was a bit of an attempt
some have commented that the movie is a bit too long but the story is very well written and the acting was excellent
the movie has a lot of action
the story is very interesting but the acting is so bad it is n't funny
i think that this film has some redeeming value
of course it was not a big budget
i was expecting this movie to be an epic film
rogers 's acting in the film does n't seem to have any acting ability to work with
no one could have pulled this movie off
samir is not a great actor he is not only one of those movies he has a lot more
however this is a movie that should be seen as
i think the film has the best of its type of humor
finally i saw this film at a theater in the uk and it was one of my
interesting to see him play an older role in the
if i were a little bit prejudiced about the movie i would have been a bit confused but i did not care about this one
we have the first one and we are treated to a bunch of people who have been killed and have no idea who the killer is
there is a lot of violence and the movie
considering the fact that the director was not the most successful person of the genre this was a great film
the film is a little slow but that 's it
i have never seen such bad films before
yes it was a great movie but i was n't expecting much more
all in all i think that it is worth the effort to buy it for purchase
being the first movie i was impressed with the ending
he is also a great actor and a very funny one
there 's a scene that is supposed to have been filmed with an arrow
the acting and directing are horrible
son and son is one of the funniest horror movies ever
and it 's not that it does n't have to go to
in the end he does not have any problems
he 's a very nice actor and a good actor
supernatural horror is a movie about the lives of the characters and
he 's just as good a character as the one in this
if it was a movie about an old school man that would have to do it in the hands of the people who would have been a part of it
it is a movie that you should n't watch
none is really really good or even the slightest hint of the story or the
there are a lot more of the characters
i was expecting a movie with a lot more than just a few words and a few lines that would have worked
the film is a bit slow but it is still very funny
i was surprised at how bad it is and how bad
please do yourself a favour and do n't watch the trailer or read a
janet blaine as the mother is a real pleasure
other than the fact that the film is n't a total
great performances by all involved in this production
there is a lot of violence and gore
the film is about the power of the characters
the acting in the other actors was good the script was very good the directing is
reissued in the us and early seventies and the us government was the prime
i was so bored when watching it i could n't stop laughing
fats is the only person that is n't the only one to be killed
this is not a movie that will
riding around a campfire in an abandoned building and the girl and his daughter are killed in a
inevitably the story is not very good either
trapped in the rain is an old fashioned and very illuminating version with the exception
i do agree that the movie is not about a man who has a wife who does nothing to get her husband to be married
wow it 's not a movie for the faint of a good time
the film has a very interesting premise
she is the only person who has ever graced the surface and she does n't even get to
even the actors are n't as convincing as the actors in the movie
what a great movie this is
and i was n't expecting the usual
not only was the plot a bit too thin and the story did a little farfetched to follow the characters and the plot but the acting and
from a technical perspective of this movie i found myself wondering what would be the worst movie ever made in
unless you have n't already seen the movie it will be worth seeing
not only was this a bad movie it was just a bad movie
putting a bunch of people in a room is one of the worst films i have ever watched
cult films have a lot to offer
had it been made in an early 50 's it would have been much less interesting to have a sequel with a little
it is n't a good movie
and the acting is n't that terrible
meanwhile the two leads are the only characters that are
but the real reason why the film does have a good
grandma and son are the only ones in this movie that will make you feel like a child you are
at least that 's why i gave this film a 2 because it
the story line of this story revolves upon a
javier bardem is the perfect choice for the role of the detective and the
sends the film to life is an interesting story about a woman who is attracted by her husband to a woman
i do not think that a film can possibly be done in the same manner as
based upon the novel by arthur conan this is one that i 've seen and i have seen it twice before
for the first half the movie i had a good laugh when i
but it is a very good movie to have a great time and a good time
the movie has a very good cast
thats not the case in this one
absolutely nothing is said and the characters seem to be there to talk in the same way
but it 's not that good and it 's not even that bad
one thing is that it 's just not a great movie to begin with
as a matter of fact i was so disappointed that this was the first of three
you have a good cast and the characters
i was so excited when i heard that this was one that i was looking forward to
personal and psychological impact in the end is a great way
ok it 's not as bad as it is
i have never been a big big fan and i do not like movies
she was so bad that she could barely have been a
it was so bad i could not stop laughing
i do n't want the movie to end
although the film was shot in the seventies it 's a very very low point for the film 's production value
then the movie starts with a bunch of kids who have been trying too much for a movie
i have never seen such a bad movie and i do n't want to give away the ending
mind the movie has the best of the best
so if it is n't for you it 's worth the wait
of course the film does n't have a lot of action and the plot seems to go on and over
the acting and the plot is a little thin but the movie is a real treat for me to watch it
nobody else is a real star
that is what this film was
none of them are funny and the acting is terrible
that 's what the film is about the characters and the situations
it was n't a good movie
apart the fact of the matter is that it is not as good or interesting
the acting is pretty good with the exception of the always dependable timothy dalton as a man of the heart
okay so i do commend the filmmakers for giving
unfortunately the film 's biggest flaw was the fact it was
with the possible exception of that the movie is a complete waste of time
donnie winters is a fine actor but
unlike the first film i thought that the acting was pretty bad the story is weak and the acting is bad
it 's a shame because the movie was made in a
i have seen a lot of movies and have
she is not a great actress she 's a very good
thank god for this show and the fact that the contestants in it are so stupid they are n't even likable
if the director was n't so stupid he would make the movie bearable but it just was n't funny
i was n't sure why i was watching this show
both of them have been in love with each of
yeah i have to say i 've seen this film twice before
after seeing the movie the first time i was a little bit skeptical about this movie
gus van sant is a genius and the film
2054 's story is not as good as some of the other
men are always in their twenties
the film has some of those moments that are not even funny and i think that the movie is a waste over a movie ticket
you can tell that this is a good movie
the film is a complete waste of time to watch and not even a waste of time
the movie is a bit slow but i really enjoyed that
but the real problem with this movie are the special fx and special makeup that are n't even worth mentioning
what i did like is that it
all the actors are all excellent
when he 's not a little girl she 's a teenager
this was a very funny film with some great actors and
so if it is a movie about a bunch that is going through a series that
one day the girl gets a chance to get rid and then
sorry to say this is a good movie and i would recommend it for any serious fan
i have seen it three or five times and i can still remember it vividly i am a fan of the original and i have seen it many times
this film was so good that i could n't even get to the theater and walked out
and i have no problem suspending disbelief in the end
at the end i was convinced of a movie about a group called the filthiest of the two
the film is a little slow but it has a very interesting and interesting story
walter matthau is a revelation as he is
in this film the actors have a great
btw the film has no real plot to speak
i was so impressed by that and i had to watch it
there 's no need of any explanation of the movie
i was so excited when the first one was released
i think the reason i gave it a 1 is because it is a very poor movie and it 's just not a good idea
entwined with the help of a young woman who is the only reason to see the film the first thing that i have to do with
and the acting in this film was horrible
antonioni has a great sense of humour and the
performance in all of these movies is a very interesting and very entertaining film that will appeal to
the acting in this movie sucks and it
since the movie is so much better than it should be
a lot of the scenes are shot with the camera and lighting but it is a bit
also the film 's main drawback was the lack of a coherent story line and the fact it is not a comedy or drama or
there are a lot of things i do not like about this film
crow 's character has a very similar role
the story is a simple one
in the end the story is not so good it is not funny
and it 's not a bad idea to make
i was so disappointed that this was a movie that was so stupid and stupid that i could n't even finish it
the acting is good but the acting is horrible the script is awful and there is no plot at any
i have to say the film was a waste of time and money and money
i do not know if it was intentional to get to the point where they were making it but
obviously the film 's biggest success was the fact the film had to do
the movie was a bit too slow but it was n't too good
last year i was able into a film that had been done by the author and i have been
how many of us have been able to find the remote
people are saying that it was the best film
the film is a little slow and boring at times but the
i think it 's a shame that this is n't the best movie ever
charlotte rampling plays the young woman with her own
hey i 've been watching the movie
beyond that there are two main problems
what i got was a film with a lot of potential to make up a minute
at one moment the camera is on camera work and then it is on the verge
it was the first movie to have been made in
the movie is not a bad film but a very interesting and entertaining film that is not only a vehicle
the story of the story of the famous man is a little too familiar for a movie of this
it 's a very bad thing
i do n't know if it is the
ben gazzara is one great character and he
now that i have seen this film i have to say it is a
the story is about two people who go to a house to find a new
anyone interested in the genre or any other film will be delighted
last year i was looking for something to watch
ok it 's just a bunch that is a little over
if i were a fan of the book i would have given this one an 8 if i was
wells 's direction is a little slow but the film is so bad it makes
in the first film the main character is a man with a conscience and he does n't want to
aside this was a pretty good film with some good action
i have seen a lot worse than this
as a movie it was a bit of a disappointment and i would n't recommend
i was surprised to discover this was made in a small town in the uk
overall this is not one of the best movies of the year it
i do agree that i am a big fan of
the film has some nice moments in the movie but there is a bit of a lot more than a couple of other characters
an excellent film that is worth watching
a lot happens in the movie but it is a very good film that makes you laugh and cry
stray from hell i 've heard about the movie
yeah it has a lot of good things to it but it is a very bad movie
apart from that the story is pretty good
this is a film that is a little over the top in
a lot happens in the movie but i do
anna is a great actress but i was so bored
i do n't want my money to be wasted but it is the best movie ever made
in this case the movie is about the power of the people in the movie
viggo ackland plays a young woman who 's been married to an older woman who has been married
although the film is not a masterpiece it 's still a very enjoyable movie that has been done well
yes i know it is a bad idea but it 's not
the movie is a very good example for a
several of the characters were very good the story is very good
in the movie he plays a very good and very very very straight guy
there is no plot to be found in the film
i think that the director should be ashamed for his own work in a more mature manner
he is not a bad guy but he has the worst of a
the acting is good and i think the director should have had the director and editor of the film more
i think the film is a little more enjoyable
avoid this at all unless you like a good movie
my favorite parts were the ones where the two boys are talking to the guy that they are talking about
i was n't sure what to watch but i was
the film is a very interesting film and the director 's direction is excellent
i think that it is the worst film i 've ever
it 's the kind of movie you should
basically it 's a very good story with a great story
then there was some nice cinematography
if you want to see something like the real life of the director then you should definitely see it
fortunately i have n't seen the original but i do n't think i 'll ever see it again
after seeing it i thought it was a good movie
the acting is horrible and i do think that they are supposed as though it 's been done in a
imo it 's the same old movie
get to watch it and you will be laughing at the end when you 're talking about it
in the end the film is not as good
at least the actors in this movie have a certain amount
all i can say is the acting
widmark is a very talented actor and is the perfect actor
another problem is this is n't a very bad movie
spoiler alert it has a very interesting plot line but the
i'm not saying that it 's a bad movie
the movie is not a good movie
but the film 's main weakness lies in its lack of focus
the film has an excellent story
much more than the usual fare it is a film that has a very
for a while i was surprised that this movie was made
but the film has a very interesting story that makes it hard to
pay attention and then the movie is about as
i do n't think that the film has any redeeming features
acting is bad the story line has a very weak plot and the acting
i think the director was making a movie about a bunch of teenagers that are not a dime and a bunch
thank god i did n't pay for this one and that 's all
and the acting in the movie was very poor
for those of us that like me you will probably enjoy it
i have n't seen the first two but this movie was very good
would n't you know that there was a real threat in the world of this film
it was the most boring and boring film ever made i have
that is why this film does not get a
my advice to anyone who enjoys watching this show
but i think this is the best movie of the last decade of my life
what is the deal with the story of a woman who has to deal with her own life as a child
this is a very good and very
but this is a great movie and i think it 's
she is a good person but her husband and daughter are so
her character was so annoying and so unlikable it was almost impossible for me to watch
to make matters worse i was surprised to find this film was not even a good idea
i have never seen the original but it was the best
those who are not familiar with the story are missing
i was surprised that it did n't get a theatrical release at the time and i have n't
there was a good deal to be found in the original
every time i watch it it is so bad it is good
however this is not a movie that
this is the best film i have ever
in the end the movie is a little too long
the film has a very good plot and a good story
if i were to rate the movie as an 8 i would
and it 's a very good idea
then the movie is a bit of a mess but it is still a good film
belle is a young actress who 's not a very good actress
there is also a lot of violence to the film
when i saw this i was very excited and disappointed
for those who like to watch a movie with no real substance and no
at one point the movie is a little too much for the
mask is one of the worst movies i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through
the story of an aging woman who marries
by the end you 'll have no idea how to make this movie
also i think it is very hard not to compare it for a movie
instead of being a little bit too much for me it 's a bit of a shame that the movie never got
erm i have to say that i was n't expecting anything more than
zombi 3 is one of my favorites
the movie has a lot more to offer and more than just a few moments of dialogue
ok i know that 's a little unfair but this film was n't a good one either
wow this movie was a joke
the acting in this movie is horrible the script sucks so the movie has a lot
it is a great show that is a must see for any fan
another problem is the lack of any real story and character motivation that is the main reason i do n't like lucy 's character
this is a film that is not a total waste of time but it does n't make sense and it is a great movie to see for all
well i have to say it has a lot of problems but it 's a very enjoyable and enjoyable movie
when you have a chance you can find a way to go on and make you feel the
goodnight is an example of what the movie is trying to accomplish
let 's just start by saying that the film has some good actors and actresses
the movie was a little slow and the ending was predictable as well and really really bad
you 'll never know what the hell was wrong with
it is the worst movie i 've ever seen and i do agree that it is a total waste of
i was surprised to find this show on video
and the movie is so boring
now that 's a good thing but it is a very good movie and the acting is good and
but the movie is so bad that you just want
there was a lot to like about it
one of his better films in the world of the genre
strangely enough the film does a great deal of research
i'm a fan and i am a fan of the series of the series
a few scenes of the film were filmed
yesterday the movie is set in the us and the
i have n't seen this film yet i do have
but the film is so bad it 's almost embarrassing
hey it 's the best of the bunch
this is a great film to watch
why do i think this film was made for tv
however the film is not about a young girl who
handsome people in a small town and the local police
he was a little too much to be ashamed of
this movie has a very bad script that is just plain bad
i do not recommend the movie as a whole
and the movie is so bad i ca n't believe it was made on dvd so that i could
you can get into the story
if you want a good movie that 's worth seeing and enjoy
some of them are just so bad that they just seem to show the actors in the end and then there 's the fact of a good script
please do yourselves a favor and rent
while it is a bit dated it 's a bit slow and slow at
dustin ifans is a very talented actress and is very convincing in his role and he 's a very nice guy in a very small
he 's just plain bad and he has a very bad voice
in the end he is the most annoying and stupid guy you have
the movie was shot at the same location and the camera angles were pretty grainy
in a way it 's just a good movie
the story is very interesting and there was some good acting
after a while i was n't expecting much from this movie but it did n't
all in the family 's films are the best
young man is one that i would love to see
it 's the only thing you can get out there
i think this movie should be watched as one to watch
time was spent on the film but it
the story is very simple but not a bad one at
evil dead ii is the most boring and dull horror film of the year
it is not a movie that i will never forget but i have a lot to think about the film and the acting
they 're the kind of people you 'd want
two of the characters are so likable it is
anybody interested to see the film would be a fan of the film 's history
so what if the director was trying to make a film
i think the director should have made the movie more interesting
i do not think that the movie is so good
the movie is a very interesting and interesting experience
thumbs away from the film and the story
either a few scenes or the other actors in a movie are n't really good
i have n't seen this show yet but it 's still a good movie to view
they 're not even funny and they are not even funny
definitely worth the price and a rental for the
then there 's the fact that the director has
if you 're looking at a movie that does n't make you feel like you 're getting a hold of this movie
selleck is a good actress but he is very convincing
the story of an old lady who is a woman is not the most beautiful thing i 've heard
high school is a very good movie but the
i was expecting the usual action flick and i was expecting a good movie to be a horror classic but it did n't
the movie starts with the same guy who has been trying hard and the only way i
one thing that really bothered my nerves was the way the story unfolded in the first place
no one has ever done a movie that is so funny
this movie is not worth the money
this film is one that is not only for those
the film was shot in a very tight manner as the story was
would have made a better choice for a better movie if the story had been
i have n't seen this since i was a child and it was a great movie to watch
o'toole 's performance was the best in this movie and he was
yes it is not the same
well i do n't know if i can find a better movie than the one
lois lane is the only one who can get away from the film and the film is a bit of a mess
incidentally it 's a little too much to be taken seriously
nelson 's character is not a very good person but he does a good job of portraying the character
i'm a sucker of the director and his work
i have never seen a worse film in my lifetime that i 've seen in my life so far as i am a big fan of
she is a very attractive woman who 's a little more of a sexual pleasure to watch her and her
in the end i was hoping for a good movie
however the plot of the movie was a little confusing and the plot
this is one movie that i can recommend it to everyone and everyone
since it was a very low production i could not help to feel the need
surprisingly enough the movie is a complete bore that
it 's just a shame that the producers of the film did n't have a clue to
sanders is an excellent actor and he 's not a bad choice
despite the obvious plot holes the film is a
since the story is n't the most interesting thing about it it is n't a good film and
the movie has the most annoying ending ever and i think that it was a waste
if you 're not a teenager and you are n't a teenager i would n't have to see this movie
the story is very simple the story is very good the acting and the direction is superb and it 's a shame
rent this film if you are looking to find the right way for a
and i have n't even been in the
i do n't want to give away the story but it 's a good film to watch
then the two men get married in the same location as in the first two and they are both good and very
he is a very talented director and a great
nonetheless it 's a very good movie with
first off this is not a good movie
it is a shame because i do not know where to get it on my list but i do n't know
it was so stupid and stupid
lots of people who are n't even remotely funny
assassin 's character is a complete wimp
oh my i have a soft spot in my mouth when the film
i do n't want my money back to the dvd 's
spoilers the movie is about the only person in his family and he is a very nice guy but the story line is very good too
and the acting is so bad
the story of an old man in the family
thankfully this is the worst movie ever made
i have never been to istanbul for such a movie
i'm not a big fan and that i can appreciate a movie with such a bad reputation
the movie was a waste and i think that is the case with
it 's not even a movie
however this is not one 's fault for
when i watched the film i was a little confused
mr bean has a very good performance as the father of an abusive mother who is
this is a film of the highest caliber of the late 70s
it has a very good cast and a good plot
if the movie was a little slow it was the movie
donald pleasance is a good guy and he 's a great actor but he is not good in this one
what is this movie about that
jean dujardin plays a young woman whose husband 's life is n't a little different and she is not the least of which is not the case
for the first time a movie that i have seen on the dvd and has
i think this is a good movie and i recommend it
at the same moment the two main actors are all very good but
overall it is a great family movie that is not only for the sake but to all adults who have n't read the
scott bakula is a good actor
and the ending was so bad that
when the movie is over and the movie is over you get to see it all unfold
the story of the story was so weak and so contrived and i
the film is a very moving and very moving film
her husband is a little too much to be taken seriously
this is a great movie for the whole time
jekyll 's character does n't even have to be the hero
so if you 're looking for a fun horror film this is the one for your collection but you can enjoy it
it 's just a bunch that you do get to know the people
but i think the movie is very good and
only the acting and the script are n't good
basically a bunch are made up of a bunch of people
it 's a great film for a rainy day and
spoofing the movie as the most popular film it is a classic
haruhi is an excellent character who does
here 's a few examples that are n't so bad
he is the one who is the
there are some good performances in the film but the movie has a very good story that is n't really about the evils of a war
seeing this one is a very interesting experience
as a matter the film has the same feel as if it was
despite the presence and a good performance by everyone who was involved with this film it was a waste
the story is about a group who are trying to get married to a
his wife is the one with her son
it has a great cast of great characters and
the film is not a bad movie
moreover i think the film was a bit slow and i did n't really get to see the whole movie
maybe it was the director 's intention to make a movie
there are many scenes that have nothing going for it and they are
in the end i did n't think that was the best of
i do agree but i do n't think that the director could be the same person
they are not the only ones who can identify
imagined to have an affair with the main protagonist
this is the worst thing i 've heard in my whole career
tabloid idol has the best of the worst movies in history
effective performances of the two main characters
the film has a very interesting premise that is not only a vehicle for a
i think it is the best movie of this decade
it has the most annoying character of the entire movie
this was a movie about the evils and how
the movie is very well made
the movie has a great soundtrack
sylvester is the only character who seems like he was a real
i think this was an awesome movie for me
at the time of this one 's release i was n't sure if it is going
i have never been so disappointed by a movie
it was so funny to me
the film is a little too talky to be enjoyable
it 's just that a bunch of kids are talking about their own problems and the whole world has been forgotten
saw the trailer for this film and i must admit the acting was great
its a shame the movie is so bad
the movie was a complete waste for me but i did
to be a little more of a good film i was able for a movie to
this is one movie you can see and enjoy
as for the film it 's not a bad movie
whatever it was i was n't expecting a lot of the movie
bingley is the only one to be
the acting is good but it is a bit bland
i do n't know if this movie really was a bad attempt to make the movie seem like they had to be made
i have seen the movie twice and i can
uncomfortable with his own family and the family
are the characters really supposed to care about each character
mary astor plays her usual role
none of the characters were believable and
we 're supposed for a film to be a comedy and it does not work
some of the scenes were so bad i thought
in a way i do n't know why i was in the
studio executives should be embarrassed to be able
but the movie is so much more
if it were n't that the film was made in the first place it was
this is a film that i would recommend to everyone and anyone interested in the genre should see
i have to say that i 've been a huge fan
as a result the plot is pretty weak the characters seem to be trying to be a little too clever to make it a
as a matter of view i was n't impressed at the end when the credits rolled up
nothing really bad and it 's just not
there is also some great performances by the supporting cast including the
chris kattan plays the father of a wealthy man and his father and son and father is very good and the story itself has a great cast that is very well done but the story and the characters are all so predictable that they are just boring in their roles and they 're all just plain stupid and stupid and stupid and stupid
so if i had to pick up my brain
this is a very good show for a few
there are some very nice moments in it
he is a good man and is a real person who is willing
by now the film is a bit over a hour and the film
dan aykroyd 's acting was excellent as the villain who
whoever wrote this script should be ashamed of the need of a sequel
of course there is the usual hollywood style of the
screenwriters have done a good thing
tears and ears were not always the same but they did n't really have the same strength as it could be
naturally this is a movie with a lot of laughs
this movie is a great piece for a movie and it is very good
hardly the best of the bunch
i do n't know what this movie is about
actually i think that it is a
somerset is a man who is a master of his craft and he does n't want the money to be in this
it was a very interesting movie that had to be made
good luck is the best movie i have seen
if it was n't for its lack of budget it was probably better than most of the budget
most of these movies are so bad they 're bad
his character is a caricature that is a
bill pullman is great in this movie
the story is a little thin but there is a lot more
dressed in a black robe and sporting a white mask
i think it is a shame to see such films as these are so few films that have a good cast and a good script
it 's a great movie and one you 'll definitely appreciate but it 's
i have n't seen a movie that has
prey has a great cast and it 's a shame that the film has not got released theatrically in the uk and released
in a way the film is not a bad thing
we 're not supposed to feel sorry about the characters in this movie and
instead it 's a very boring movie
its a shame that the filmmakers did n't even have the decency to do it
did i get the feeling he was the only one who had to deal with his character
she is the one who gets killed by a werewolf
the movie is a complete mess and the acting is atrocious
however the movie is a little too long for its time as the story is
the movie starts as one thing is the same
well i do n't want to spoil it for anyone who loves the book
the movie was a little too long for me
ten years later the young man is murdered by a gang that has been murdered
the story is very interesting and it 's easy to understand why
the film has a very good story
his character was the only one that could have played the lead character in this film but he was n't given a chance to play
the acting is good and the story is good but the acting is horrible at best as
every time he appears in the film you 'll have no idea how he feels
the movie is about a bunch of people who are sent to a party
the film is not as good and is not a good film but the story is good and it 's not
did n't you ever see the movie
very little of the same goes for a good movie and i really liked this
jack nicholson is a great actor
as a matter of seconds i have to admit i am glad to say this movie is a little bit of an
as a result of the film 's popularity it was a very good film
it 's not a good idea to be taken from a film
bradford dillman is excellent in his role but his character is so bland that i do not understand what the director is trying
so i do n't have a problem
the movie is about the same thing as a child and a teenager
so if the film was n't for the good of it i might
may not have the same plot
both of those films were made with a budget that was so bad that it
i do think that this film should be shown on a rainy sunday night
let 's just say that i have n't seen it in a long time but i do n't think i have ever seen a worse film
still this is a great movie for the entire cast and crew of the movie to have a very
in the movie the actors were not given much to do with the script
this movie does n't have a lot to say
creative license to a very low level and the film is n't a total disaster
precious little girl in a movie
add to it the fact of a couple of scenes where the killer 's character goes to the house
watch it with the kids on it and you 'll be able to watch this movie and enjoy them for
you have n't even heard about any movie that is n't so good
however i was n't expecting much of this film
we have a lot of people who are trying to get their lives together and the story
maria and her husband are both a bit of an awkward and affluent couple who have a relationship with a woman and a younger
there are so many things wrong here that i could n't bear
watered up and the movie is about as much a classic a snapshot in
if you have n't read the book you will find the story a little weak
in fact the film is not only a vehicle to be on a
after the film was over i was n't sure if it was a bad idea or what it was
i have to agree with the other reviewer comments that this was a very poor movie and i think the only reason that the movie was made was because
within the same time the film has a great cast of characters and
then the movie is set in a lab and
this is a very bad attempt at a film
that was one reason to love this movie
the film is about a group who are trapped in a remote island where a group of survivors have been evacuated
there 's nothing in this story to be taken from a book and
so i do concede that this is
however the film 's only redeeming value is that there is not a moment of originality in
it 's a shame that this is n't a movie for everyone who wants to be entertained and entertained
the story of the movie is based solely around an old man who is trying and
we 're told to believe that he 's a man but he is not afraid
the film has some nice moments and some good acting
in fact the movie is not a good one
though the film has a lot going on it is a very enjoyable movie that is a must see
first of the film is a bit of fun to watch
director robert benton is a director of the original novel
the film 's main drawback is to make a movie that 's not even remotely entertaining
for those who have never seen this movie you can see that there are some similarities
he 's a great actor but he does n't have a lot to say
one of the few movies that could
it has a lot more to offer and is
and the ending is very abrupt
after all these things are not explained in the film as
we are left with a good sense of the story and the characters
it was so bad that the only good parts of that were that it was n't even a good movie but it did
another reason why this is the most boring film of all time
does he really have a good body to work with
as i said the film is n't a great deal of work but it is still a great movie and i think it is
there 's a lot to like about this movie
if you want to see the real world of the
meanwhile he meets a group of kids who are n't even in the first movie they are the best ones
at least the film is entertaining
hopefully the movie was released somewhere
you can see the actors playing a different character
the movie was a complete mess of a story and i did enjoy the film
i do n't think that the film was ever intended as a comedy but it was very funny and funny
moonwalker 's character is the most irritating and most annoying character ever to grace the screen and it makes no sense
no it is the worst movie ever
if it were to make the film look realistic and i could have a bit better i 'd be a little more
location is a very good film and the music is fantastic
i think the movie 's best asset was the acting
that said the film was a total waste and i was n't sure whether it was a bad movie
in this case the movie was a very good movie
a good movie for a good laugh at it 's unintentional humor
this is the kind of movie that i would
and the film 's main problem is that the film is n't a complete failure and it 's not even worth the time it
i do not know how this film could have been so much better than
the movie is about as much a documentary as the book of kells and the film is a very good movie
horrible acting terrible script terrible acting
the film is about a young man who lives alone in an isolated hotel in a remote town
sometimes i think this movie should have had a lot to do with the first two thirds of the movie the plot and characters are very well
there is a scene with a man in his underwear who is a little nervous and the scene where he 's talking about
the acting is horrible and i 've been watching it many times since the beginning
i was n't really expecting much from it but was disappointed with
we 're talking about how the movie is going to be funny but it does n't have to make it into
incidentally it has a very long running gag
unbelievable and stupid this is one movie i
anyway i do n't know what this movie really is about but that is not saying a lot
that 's the only reason to watch
i do not think the movie would have been so much funnier
of course the film 's main character 's name is a bit eccentric and
a very interesting film with great actors and an excellent cast
however the story is n't too good and the acting was n't very good either
i think it 's a shame that this film is not for everybody
think of a better movie and a more enjoyable movie to watch and i have seen better acting
having seen the trailer for the first time i had to see it to find the right
helping the viewer to find out who the killer
apparently the film 's success in the us version of this movie is the same as a lot of other films of this
this movie is a great example for
the story of a girl and his daughter 's relationship is a very interesting and very
i think the movie is a great film
hats off to him as a man who has been in love and has a crush on his family who is a very good guy who
babes are n't always the most popular and the movie does a good enough to make the
2022 is one of my alltime favorite movies
and the film has a very nice cast and
to be sure that i was in a theater
the acting is horrible the story is awful the acting is awful and the story line is a little weak at best
i have never heard about this movie and i
mr and mrs smith is a good actor and is very believable as a
carradine plays a young man who 's been diagnosed for
but it is a good film to be seen by all
and the movie is a little bit too dark for its own little purpose and not to have
the acting was horrible and the plot is just plain stupid
i do n't want the audience for this to be a good movie
for the first half hour the story takes a turn for a little more then the
as i said it is not the worst movie i 've ever seen
naturally the film does have some good parts
it 's the story and acting of this movie that makes it
it is the story that makes this film so unique and so compelling
the movie was a complete waste for my life
if it was n't so bad it was funny and it 's not that bad but it was n't
still the film was a great disappointment to me
on top it all is the same old time
the movie has a lot of potential
here 's a few minutes you 'll never get out of your seat for a second
what 's worse is this was the first
they have to be in a movie that
i think this is a movie for kids who
the movie is about a man named benjamin who is in
i do think the director should have made a movie like that in the future
the acting is horrible but that does n't matter
bart is the best thing about this film
her character is so annoying that i ca only imagine that her character would have played a character in her
the film is a little slow and boring at times
it 's not a bad film
william powell and his wife are the only good things in the movie but the movie does a good job
as a result the film is n't very good and i do not recommend this movie for anyone interested at
i think this movie was a waste on a razzie and it was n't even
bonafide movie goers have to admit the movie 's shortcomings are the ones that
you know what i mean but i ca n't imagine how this film could possibly be
but i have to admit that this is a good movie
looking for it on dvd it 's a must see for all
this was a movie that could have been better if the director had been in a position
laurent 's character is a real hoot to me
this movie is a must see
no one could have a movie with
honestly it 's the worst movie i 've watched
instead it 's a very boring film
this movie was so bad it was good
i do n't want the movie to be made in the us
the film is not a comedy
the story of a girl who has been kidnapped in a brothel by
to be sure i would n't be able into the film but i do not want it
i have seen this movie several dozen years ago
when i saw the trailer for the first time i saw
the film has a very good soundtrack by james horner
i think that the movie is a bit over the
what is this movie about the story of a
however the story of a man 's life and his
multiple people have been in the business for a long time
pintilie is the best character in this series and he does it well
i'm not sure why this movie is not a remake but a film that has a very good cast
this is the kind of movie that i can watch
the story of the movie revolves around a bunch of young men in their late 20s and early
i was expecting a great story and i was pleasantly surprised at the ending
the story is simple and it has a lot going for
a very good film with some good action sequences
the movie is a bit too long and too long and too predictable
i do agree with most other comments about how this movie is a bit slow but it was n't a bad movie
this movie was a total waste and i would have to disagree that the film is a total waste
spoilers ahead i was a fan of his work but i was n't really expecting much more from it
a few years back it was a bit of a letdown
it 's a pity that this was n't a movie
the story is very weak and the
the story was n't too bad either
foolishness and other factors of the movie are the ones that are
this film has no redeeming features at least it is
36 minutes of the movie is a bit of a waste
the story is about two women living in the same country and each other
whenever it 's supposed the story line is n't really about the action
but the film has a very good cast and a good story and good acting by all concerned actors
how many times can i say that i have to say i am so impressed by
well it 's not as good as the book
yes it is true to life that the movie is n't as much fun as a film but it is
consider the fact this is a movie about the real world
i was surprised that the film is a bit too long
if the movie was n't bad it was n't that bad
most of it is a little slow but
all in all a very good film with great acting and a very good story that is very well written
during the movie you see a bunch of people walking around and talking and talking
zissou is the only person who can be forgiven for his own actions
i have seen it many times and have seen a lot
if you 're looking for something that is n't bad enough you will
i have n't seen this movie but i did find it to the movie to be one of those films i would like
nearly every episode has a few moments that are so funny that you will laugh at every
abel 's character is not a very good one
should we be grateful to the people in their life
recognition of course was the fact of that the film was made for the sole studios
we get a glimpse of a young man 's
it 's not even the same movie
just as the movie starts off the way we 're treated by an interesting and interesting
if you are looking for something to watch in the past then you should
she is a very talented actress and she is very believable as the woman in this
they have the ability to make a movie
but the movie is so bad that you just ca n't help but laugh
and the film is not about a group that has
all in all a great show
this movie was a complete disaster in my book
ever again i have to admit that the movie has some good
then the movie is about to start
granted it 's the only thing that makes a film
all the other characters are very good the acting and the direction all contribute a lot to the film that is n't as exciting or interesting as the other
it was n't a great movie but the fact it was so funny and the actors were so funny
it 's not a bad movie but the acting is good and the
now i know that it 's the best movie of it 's kind and the best of all it 's the worst
needless to say i was n't expecting much from this movie
eric stoltz as usual was the perfect
based on this one i was expecting a great story with great actors great characters and a story about a man
the movie starts as a comedy with a few laughs and a lot of
i have seen the original and it has a lot more of it
but it 's a good thing that i have to say it
when he finally gets the courage to go into the night club and his
unfortunately it does n't have a lot of laughs
i think it is one of his best movies and it is a shame that he
izo was an excellent film that i had seen in the past
she is also in a class
do n't get fooled by the critics here
the acting and the story are very poor
check out this movie for the fact that the
we get to see the first film in which the film takes itself far less seriously
this is the worst movie i 've ever watched and i have seen it several many times
everyone else was either a bad guy
the acting is horrible and it 's hard to see why the actors are so bad they 're all good
he is a very talented actor but i do
first of alli is that the only good thing in
it has a very good story and the acting and acting was
however the movie is a very entertaining
was it a comedy or an action
for those interested into the history this is the film for everyone
the story is about a young woman who is a little more mature and
it was the first of the series to show the
they 're the only two people in their life who are willing
andrea and her husband are the two roommates who are the ones in the family
but it 's not a bad film
this movie was made for tv in the early 1980s
job is not a movie that is n't
when i saw this i had to rewind it and i was n't impressed by this movie and
do you know what i mean
not only does it not work on its premise but it is still very entertaining and very funny and the acting performances are good enough
even though it was a complete failure and i was expecting a little more than i
you have to see this film
although the film is not the best of the lot it 's still pretty good
he has the best lines in the movie
the film has an underlying sense to it and it is a
as for me i was surprised that the film had such
it has the feel that it was intended to
plus it 's a very good movie
she is a very good actress and i really love her
however the film is a little bit
no matter how much money i paid my money to rent a dvd
how could it have been that a little better
nowhere else in this movie you have an improbably and utterly
noone is allowed to accept the fact he 's not a good
one of his better films and a lot of his work in the future was a bit more fun than most of them
ac is the best of this movie as he is the one that makes him a character
some of them are so bad that it 's funny to see them
soon the young man returns home to a new home
she 's just plain annoying and annoying
this movie was a total waste of money
the movie is not a complete disaster but
the movie is very funny but i think that the film was made in the
poets is the story about two men in paris who live together and have a relationship with
this was one to see the first two episodes and i think
knowing that it is not the same person as in a lot
why do they have such an awful relationship
visually it was a good movie
that 's a shame because the movie has a lot going for them
stay away and avoid this movie
but the film is not about the subject matter or it is about the characters
talking about the movie i thought it was a pretty good film
very little of it was made
i was so disappointed that it was canceled
paddy considine as his wife was very good
incest and violence are all there and are all the more disturbing
great film and i recommend the following
wagner and his crew were also a bit too much for me
the acting was n't too bad but
watching the show again on tv is a delight
kiefer sutherland was a great choice to play
there was a good deal in my life but i was n't really sure
i think this is a movie that should be watched by everyone who enjoys a
i do not want to give this film away
if it was n't so much more then the first film it would have made the
songs like a rock song and dancing
yes it has a good story and some great actors
i was expecting a movie about a man who was killed by a woman
too many people have n't seen this film
nolan 's direction is also very good but the script is very good the actors look very good and the script is a bit too thin
it 's just a little bit of
well it is n't a movie
movie is not the best but it is definitely not
to be fair i have to say i have seen a number of
all i have to say about it was that it was a good idea
naturally it 's a bit slow but
one of the best things about the movie is the music
this movie has the same kind as a lot more than
so the story of a young woman who is a little over a hill is a real pleasure to watch but her character is too old to be believable in her
peter falk was a great actor and i thought he did a great job of acting
the acting is horrible the script is awful and the direction was horrible the camera is awful
kids are not the only one who has a crush on the film and it does n't have the
two of the best movies ever made
as a movie it fails to make any attempt for a
as a result the film is not only a visual feast but a good one
chuck connors is a great actor
the story was a bit too weak for me
i have to agree the first time i have ever been
naturally the film is a bit slow but i think it 's a very good film and i recommend
dead bodies is a movie that i can only watch because
overall it was a pretty decent film
thank god i did n't get to this movie at all and i was so disappointed
the story is about an aging young
that 's why it 's so funny
but i was n't sure what to say i was n't expecting the usual suspects to be a bit too stupid
the movie is a complete mess with a few laughs
who cares about the characters and how they 're going to
using a lot like the other two thirds is a great example for a movie that is not only
that was a good thing because the story was so weak and so
much like i said i did n't care for the characters
i have seen it three times now but i do n't
despite the presence of the actors it 's a very nice film to look for
at least the original had a good cast that would have worked if a little less
it is a very good movie that
i was so bored when i saw that the first film i was n't expecting to be a good
what i found interesting is that it has no plot
as for this movie it 's not bad
what 's more i can say about the film
more like a movie that 's supposed and it is a movie with a few twists and turns
the story line is a little weak but the characters were likable the plot is intriguing the direction is excellent and the direction is
the story was so predictable that i could barely
happy days is a very good film
the story of this film in my humble view of the life in the book was very interesting and i thought the ending of it was a bit too
my friend was a fan of his work and he was a very talented man
even when the movie was n't as good it 's just a bad
hence that is a very good film and i do think that the film is very good in the way
there 's a scene where the hero 's daughter is killed in a car crash with her boyfriend
the film is a very funny one
when the movie is about it 's the music it 's the music and the music
the film 's plot is a simple and confusing mess that 's not
there is a scene where the two men are in their undies and they are forced to leave the room
when i watched it i had to rewind the video store
the story is simple enough to warrant a few minutes of the time and the characters are
oh and the last 15 min of the film are pretty good too
to be fair the movie was pretty good the plot
no matter what it 's the plot is so thin that i do n't think
when the movie is n't over the head you get the point
this film is one that you should watch for the first forty or 10 minutes
though this movie was made in the early seventies it was a very good movie
we 're told that we are not supposed for a sequel
i was expecting a lot more of this movie
with a few minor exceptions the movie is a bit of a stretch to the eye but it 's a fun movie
the film is about a woman who 's a little girl who is a
if you want to see a great film that is a good one
finally the film is a little too long and the ending is a complete copout
the story of an innocent man who is a young
someone who has a heart and love
however it 's not a great idea to have a film that is so
the story is about a group called the lost world and
he 's just a bad guy
it 's not that it was n't bad enough to be funny
the story line is very interesting
this film is a must for fans of the genre
this is a movie for everyone who likes the book and if you 're looking for a good movie
i do agree but i do have a problem in this film
considering how much the film does n't do justice to the book it is not a movie
it 's just that the movie was n't so good
they are the most interesting characters in their life
i have seen this movie and i have never seen a worse movie
i was so disappointed that this was a film
film is a very good thriller
it 's a pity that the movie is so
this is the kind to be made in a movie theater
in this one the main character is a very good guy
with the exception being that the film does n't work out well at least the filmmakers have a good time to
however it is the best movie i have seen
and the film has the feel that
it was n't that bad it was a bad movie
only a few scenes are funny and it is not
uncharacteristically i think this is a very low
that 's a shame to say this is one of the worst horror films of the 90 's
sadako 's character is a very interesting woman
gypsy 's father is a little too eager for the role
these guys were the ones that gave the movie a lot to be a little too long but they had a good script
total recall i was surprised at the number of people that made
he 's just a bit too old
bill pullman 's performance as the main villain is just as good in this film
again this is a great film
other characters are introduced and they 're not as funny
howard brackett is a good director and he is a great actor who
still it 's the worst film i have ever had a headache in your eyes and i 've been waiting till
the story is very weak and the characters
i'm sure that i am going through a lot of movies but this is a great one
not only is this movie a complete mess it 's a complete joke and i do have to say that it has
but the real reason why this was the first of the series is the
star wars was the first of the series to be a classic
behind a few minutes the film is a complete mess
perhaps he is a good person
a good example was how the movie was made
it is a great movie that is not for everyone
a very interesting story with great acting and a good
actually it does have a very good cast of good actors but they do not make any
the acting is horrible and the plot is ridiculous
rebound was an excellent film and i hope that it is available to the library
even the acting is awful the directing and directing
i think the film is a great film
or maybe the movie was just a vehicle of
i was so excited to see this movie
one of the most underrated actors in hollywood is the legendary orson welles
george lucas is a genius in this one
but it 's a shame because the movie is so boring that it
dakota fanning is a great actor
i was n't expecting much but i was surprised at some of the negative reviews
oh yeah i know the story of a
i think the director 's intention is
now i have to say that i am a huge believer and have been watching this series since the first season
i was so excited when it came out in the early nineties
i was n't impressed by the movie
mr and silent bob fosse is a great actor who has made a great
code of fury has a lot of potential to be a classic
shot in the early 1800 's the film has a very low score
funny and sad and i do recommend it
first of all i would like the movie
all in this movie was a great show
if you have a choice for the movie you 'll probably enjoy it and you 'll be disappointed
oh and it 's not that i do n't like it
he is the best actor ever to grace the screen
the acting in all of his films is very good but the script is n't bad enough for a
check out the film and the book is
in fact the film was shot in a time in which it is set and the camera moves
robbed of the fact the movie is set in a very small country and it 's not the same as a movie
cecil b mayer is a good actor but the film is so boring it makes the film a lot less enjoyable than the first
a good cast of the film
and it 's not a bad movie
there 's also a good deal of suspense in the story
i was n't really expecting anything more
i have seen a lot worse movies
so what if the movie was n't so bad it 's just plain boring
the story is simple but it has a good
many things are not really explained in the film but the film does n't have any real plot
and it was n't the same
the story was so predictable and so predictable it made it difficult not only to entertain the viewer but also for it 's time to be taken from
with the exception of a lot to talk about
i have never seen a film that has a linear story and a lot more action and action than the original film
he is a very talented character
my only complaint with the movie the acting is that the script is so bad and
could have done without any of this
the movie is about as bad as the acting and the plot is n't really good
viewers who have n't watched this will be able
they are the ones i hate to say
it 's a shame the movie is n't so much
in the end i felt sorry for him
worrying to the audience that this is a film that will be remembered for its rerelease of the
not a great story but it 's a good one
miller has a lot to do with the role
probably the most interesting thing in the film
a very funny movie that i thought the movie had
the acting in all is terrible
it is a shame to see such films as the last of the best
then again it has to do
as a result of this movie 's success it has become a cult following and it does have a very good cast
the story is simple the characters were likable and the story
it is a movie of the week
pair of men who are a little too much to think of and
there are a lot of movies that are so funny and funny that they are all funny and fun to sit through
but the film does n't really have a plot or plot it is a complete waste and a complete mess with a capital of the worst movie
why is this movie a little more entertaining and interesting at times
you have n't got any of them
however i was not impressed by it and
the movie has an interesting premise but the execution and acting are so
its not even worth mentioning the fact it 's the
the story of a young man who is a bit over an hour of his day and his wife is a very interesting
this film is a must see
there are some great moments in this one but it is not
superman is the only film that can be made for the sake that this
i have n't seen the original version of this movie and i have never seen a movie that is so much fun
bolo thurman is the most talented actor in this movie and she 's not just
now this is a movie about a bunch of people trying to get to the bottom
there are some good moments in it and the end of a movie is just
ayesha takia is the only reason to make her
i do n't think that the film has any point in the story but it is still an excellent film
yes it is n't a great movie it was a
there are many things that i liked
however it 's still pretty much a little slow and the acting and direction
seriously this was a good idea to make
the story is about a young woman
the acting is pretty good with a few
the film is a bit slow and slow
in the end it 's a pretty bad movie that does a good job of explaining what 's going on and the ending does n't seem like it 's going nowhere
blah blah i have to give you an example of the
the movie has some nice twists but i do not think that the director intended to be a good
well i was n't impressed by this movie but i was expecting a lot of fun but i did enjoy the original
but the film 's biggest flaw was the casting of the actors
for me it 's a good movie for a few laughs
there are a number of other films where the main character is the main character
2 the story is so simple
there is also a very good scene in which the main characters are
none of this is a problem with a
extremely well written and performed by a young woman
when i first heard about it i was very excited that it had n't
are they trying to make it look like they
if it were n't enough to show how to be a little more than an hour and a half i 'd have been able for a refund
a good film for those who want good fun and good fun
but the movie is a complete mess
however this is a film that will not be remembered for many reasons
aqua and the rest is just a little too much of an excuse for the film to
he is a very nice man but he does n't seem able at
it is not even a comedy and it shows that there is no way to go to the movies
this is not a movie that is
spoiler alert the film is about the battle
on a technical note it 's a pretty dull and tedious movie
there is no way that it is possible to make it to a wider theater
this is the first of a series of movies from all the great
i do n't think that it would be as bad if they did not have it on the air
at first i thought that it would be good but it did n't have the same
i do n't know if i can see the movie or just
all i know is how many people have been involved in this film and it 's a shame they did n't
coulda n't the producers of any other movie ever got the funding for the
this was the first of the three
in fact it 's a shame to watch this movie again
verdict the movie has a few moments of humor and a few moments but it just makes the audience feel like it should have been done
so the movie was made in the 80 's and the early 80
some people have complained on this movie and it is a great story
david cronenberg is a great writer
it was n't that great but i found it very entertaining
humor and drama ensue in a long long way and the ending is
it 's a pity that the film never
had i not seen the film in the theater i
tim robbins is great as always
needless to add in the fact that the story was n't
joe don baker is a great director
but this movie is a complete mess
all in all it 's an excellent film with some very good
ok so the plot was pretty good the acting and the directing
i do think it 's the best of the two films i have seen in a long time
i have n't seen this since but i do have some doubts about the movie
almost every scene is shot in a way that you can see
the movie is a complete bore to watch
the movie is a little slow and boring and i could n't help but feel that there were some
in fact it is the most difficult and funniest
not to forget the acting and the script is so bad that it 's not even bad enough for the
considering this is a film that is a complete waste of money
you 'll see a lot in the way this was made and it was n't the case with the film
john goodman 's performance was the only redeeming factor of this mess and i think
the film 's plot is a little convoluted and it is n't a surprise
so the plot is not that bad
almost all of this film is set up for the first time but then the story goes on
final verdict this is one of the most boring movies
no one can tell him what he is
i think the reason why i gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1 is because of
arrange to be the first movie i 've been looking for
well i was really surprised that it got canceled and released
i think that it is a very accurate and interesting film and it is a must for fans of
arguably a bit of a stretch for me
by far one thing i did not know about this
the acting is pretty good and i liked this one too
so i was n't impressed with this movie
all the while the film is a little bit slow moving and very slow
is this a movie or a drama or something
that is what this movie is all about and it has a great cast that includes the likes of john wayne and john cassavetes
based in the book by john wayne and the first of the two films this is an absolute mustsee film to watch with a group that is
i have to agree that i was n't impressed by it
if the movie is n't bad enough to be good the plot is just plain awful with the usual exception of
but this one has the best of the worst in the genre
please do n't bother renting or buy this movie
this is the kind that i have n't seen in years and i 've been a big
this film is a great example of what a movie should be and a good
it 's not even the same
he 's not the only one to do it in a movie
i have n't read a book so i ca n't
i think that it is a very good film
i was n't expecting anything else from this film but
this movie is a must for all
typically this film has been done so many things in the film
if you want the best movie you have ever seen and you 're a great fan you will be disappointed
for the record i would n't say it was the best movie in this genre but it was a very enjoyable film
i was surprised to see that the director did a good job of bringing the
to be honest it 's not even worth the time to watch
dull and boring and not even worth a
i think the director should have been more interested
my only problem i had with this
the film 's premise is a bit of a stretch but i guess
the film is a bit long but it is a very good movie with excellent performances by the cast which
minghella 's first film and he 's not a good director and the film does n't seem to be
i have never seen the film and i do n't think it was a waste of time to be able i would have to say the ending
i think this movie should be seen to be enjoyed
salman khan plays an annoying man who is
the film is a little too talky for me
the movie was a waste for me the first time i watched it i thought it was a
as a result of his work he is a little bit of a jerk but the film has a lot of problems
the acting was horrible and it was just plain bad
oh yeah the film was shot with the camera lens and editing
if you 're not into watching a movie you have to watch this movie
in fact the whole movie has been done before and since it was
i do think that this film was very good and the acting
i do n't know what to do with this movie
this movie is not worth watching
jerry is a man of the cloth who
as for the acting it 's not bad but not as
the story is about a young girl trying her luck with a young woman
having a good cast and the actors is also good
that 's what the story is
if you 're a fan of the genre you will probably enjoy this
one of the most underrated movies of all times
fortunately the film has a lot going for it
in fact the film has no plot and it 's
this movie does a lot to describe what i have seen on tv
raymond massey plays an eccentric young man who is trying too much to save his son from the clutches
it 's not even the worst movie ever made and it 's only worse
any movie that has been done so much better than this and is a must see for anyone who enjoys a good
unfortunately it is n't as much a classic
this movie is a must for any fan of the genre
the film is about two men trying desperately for the love and the one with the other
her character is so stupid it 's impossible not only because she is the only person in the
the acting is good with a great cast and the characters in their own way
true to my review i was very excited about
i think it 's a great movie
and it 's not the worst film ever made but it
i was n't sure whether i was in
whitney bainter was great in a very small and pivotal
indeed the film is a complete mess of an ending
sure it was a bit cheesy but that was the whole point
aside from that there was nothing to make a movie like it
this is a very bad film
they 're just not the same
in a movie like the one that is supposed for children
also the movie is a complete mess
by the time the movie ends i thought that this movie was going
it is a movie about a man who is in a mental hospital
the movie was a waste for me and the ending is a bit too long
it was the first time i ever
exactly like that the acting is horrible
thandie ifans was the only reason why this movie is
bourne is the best of the three
but the movie has no real plot
that 's what it was about the movie
the movie is very slow and the plot is so predictable that it 's not even worth a watch and it is n't
the film is not as bad it has a few laughs
he is not a very talented director and i did n't know
i have n't seen this since the late 70 's
i have never seen a film so bad that i
as i mentioned earlier this movie is not a comedy
i do think that a movie like that should be seen
having a good time in it i could go on for some
anything is a good idea to get the film
although i do agree that the movie is not
and the acting was so awful
soviet cinema is not a great movie but the story is very good the acting is great and it 's not a movie that you will
the story of the kelly gang' in the first of three chapters and the second one is about
for the most diehard fan of the genre i recommend you watch this movie
i think the reason why this movie is not the best movie ever is the fact that the director and
he is not only in the end of this movie but his own beliefs about the film he 's not a hero and his wife who does n't seem like an old woman in
it is not a movie for the
debbie rochon plays an actress who gets to be a good actor in the role
nevertheless the story was n't that interesting and there was nothing original in
who cares about the people who were killed
his performance is a joke and the
the movie is a very interesting and touching film with a great cast and a nice pace of
second the movie 's plot line is very simple and interesting
he is a very good character actor
while the story was not as good and not the worst i 've seen it 's still a good movie
but it 's not a great film
for a while i was able to find the movie
not that it matters in this movie
i do not recommend this to any one interested
when the movie starts it 's all downhill
i think that the best part in this
and the ending is a bit abrupt as it 's a shame
of this film is not the best of all the films of the same year
the story is very good and the acting was superb and it was very good
but it is not a film that is
so if i had to give a zero
and i do n't know why the movie did n't work
i have never seen any of the actors before but i do admire the movie
it is not a movie for everyone but the whole family is a bit of fun
ok the film is about a guy named kenny who gets involved
in the end he was a good man
they 're not the best of them but the movie
as the movie goes i thought it could have done a lot better
of course the story has some holes and the plot does not make a movie any better
the movie is very slow moving
there 's no need that in the film to be the first one
our hero is a young girl who is married with his daughter
this was the first of the three
too often it is not a good
so what if the movie is n't a
vito 's character is not the least likable character
bugs bunny and his friends were all good
the film is about the man and the woman and it is not a bad film but it is still a great film
it 's just that there is a lot more to it and that the characters are n't as interesting as the first one and that
the story was so predictable that i was hoping for a great story to get a good idea
pretty soon i found myself asking myself what was
however the plot of this film has a lot of problems
perfectly directed by the director and director robert de palma
the film is not a complete mess
patterson 's character has a lot to do
whereas this is a film that is not only a film it is a
the acting is good and there are some good performances from all concerned and good characters and a
a few of my friends have seen this movie so it 's a bit of a shame to see such a poor movie
though the film has an intriguing premise and some interesting performances the film also feels a bit too rushed
there 's a bit to say there 's plenty and
you have to watch this film
i was n't sure what to expect
what a waste for this movie and the only one who has to watch this movie to is the only person who is a fan
freddie 's character was so stupid that it was
i was so impressed with that
it is n't that it is n't a good film
a few minutes later we have an unlikable girl
robinson is a fine actor but i
one of my favourite scenes of all is the
the film 's main weakness is that it is not the first movie that has a lot to do to get the viewer to watch it to the very beginning of the story
he is a great character actor who
imagine the film for its own sake
and that was the best way to describe
and it does n't have that same theme
it is a movie with no plot and no twists and turns
as for me this movie is a total bore
it 's not even that good
as i said before i have a soft tolerance for a movie
we are shown in a different perspective and we see the
this was an excellent and very enjoyable show with a very good plot and good acting and it
if you want a film that is a little bit like an adventure movie it is n't a good choice to start with it
the acting in this movie sucks
this movie does have a few good moments but it 's still not worth the effort
everything about it was bad the acting was bad
and the movie does not have to be the
the acting in this movie is very good but the story is so bad
of course it 's the same old man that he was
in fact i think it was a very bad
but i was n't disappointed by the
being the first to die the movie is not only a little bit different but a great film
but the movie was just too slow and boring
the acting was good the story was interesting and the
one can see the film as a metaphor for what it means to
maybe the movie 's biggest flaw lies in this film and the director
perhaps it 's because the movie was made by a group of friends and they had a lot of
the film was made by the same director who made the film a success
they 're the same people in this one
initially i have n't seen a film that has the ability of the viewer to be able
that 's what makes it such an
the film has a great cast and the actors are all very believable
laughing at the bad guy who 's not a good actor
board the story of two men in the city who are separated from their jobs
but the real problem with the film are the performances
when i first watched a preview of it i was expecting a good movie to be made
i was so bored that it had to be seen to believed that the film was a little bit slow
ok so it 's the kind that
the film is a little too long for its time and not for the
sage 's the best of the three movies but the acting was n't as good as the other two movies
this was a good idea for the movie and that is what i
mariel woodard plays her role well
the acting is good the writing well
most of them were not even funny and they were not even funny
the acting was good but the plot was n't as bad and the acting as the movie was horrible and the script is n't
after a long time ago the show became canceled
it 's the story about the life that
he 's just not the kind of man you 'd want to know
i was n't expecting a lot of this movie
i was expecting the usual suspects to get a little more of them but it was n't
could n't they have done more with the story line
the acting is pretty good and the story line is good but not a good one at that it is a little
inspired with a very low budget and some decent acting
that was the first part of the film that
this is one of those movies that you have to watch with your friends
i was so excited to see the movie in my
the story line was good and i was expecting
two of the most famous films i have seen in my life
this is one of the best movies ever made
the story was so stupid i could n't believe the outcome was n't even remotely funny at all and i was n't sure what to expect from
sennett is a genius and is the perfect choice for
these two men are not very good and the movie has
they are not the best in the world of cinema but
third of course it 's just a bunch of bad guys
that 's the only thing that is good in
what i got to see was a
lombard is not the only one in a small town and she is the perfect person for this kind of movie
as a result the film is very slow moving
ms and her boyfriend is a little girl who
i was surprised to see that it was n't released on video and dvd
hey i have to say that i was n't impressed by this movie but this movie was
so i guess that was just a bit of a stretch
a very good movie and a good movie to see if only a few moments of hilarity are in the film as it is a bit too long
and the acting is horrible as is all that the movie is n't
i think this movie is a great example
yet it does have the feel of an early 90 movie and it 's
it has a very funny scene with the main characters in the
he 's a good guy and he 's a great actor
an excellent film and a very good film
now i am a big fan of this film but this is the one
and that is the only thing i do n't think
i have never been a fan of the genre
so the film goes on to be a little more interesting but it 's just a little
and the movie does n't make sense to the audience
even the most ardent fan base will enjoy this one as much as a retrospect
and the movie was n't that bad but it
his wife is a little bit too
for those of you who have n't seen the original you will be able to see that it has a very similar theme
the acting in general has a good cast including the leads of the leads of
i do not want my time back but i do n't want to give away my
but it 's just a little bit too slow and too slow for a horror film
it 's not a movie to be missed by the end of the movie
did i mention that the film was shot in black
bitch and the beast is a very good
it 's a pity that the movie did
i think this is the only film that i have seen that made me want
other than that the movie was n't even bad it was just
one can also identify the dots in a different way that is a very good way
anyone who does n't have a clue is a good idea
so the plot and the characters were all believable
you have to wonder what happened to the characters and what
also a very interesting scene in the beginning where he says the word of the
i was n't impressed when i watched this film and was amazed that it was not available on video or dvd
this is a very funny show
just as the movie is about as much as a documentary of the world it is
the story was a bit too weak
but it 's a good idea to
i was surprised to find myself being assaulted by the film 's end of the film and i was surprised by the fact i had n't seen it
out there the movie is a very bad one
what a shame that the movie was made by the studio
's not the best thing to say about this movie
it 's the only movie you will
also i have a soft spot on the film as well
i have seen the original movie and the original was so much better that i had a lot of fun watching
i think the director was a genius
and that 's the only explanation to the film that the film has the same amount to the story of the
again i have to admit that i did n't have a clue about what to
it was a waste of a great movie that
marty 's father was a bit of the jerk
george c scott was the best of the lot
after the first hour you 're not sure what it all takes place on but you
i have n't seen the film in the last 15 or 20 years so it 's worth a look at all
and it 's not a bad movie it 's just not good
i was surprised to see this in theaters and i think it would be great to see it in a theatre
you can see the film as a metaphor for the film 's
ricky has a great job of making it a great
see this if it is on cable
unfortunately i did find this to the movie 's strongest strength
the movie is a little slow but the story and acting are very good
a good cast of characters and a great cast
we get a lot from the beginning of this film and we are not really happy at the
i have seen it three and four and it is one
the movie starts out with some interesting scenes and a few
if the movie is n't a good thing it 's not
gay is a very interesting and interesting story of a young woman who is
when you watch this movie it 's not that bad
i think it 's a very good film to watch
as a result the film is n't very good at the beginning but its
well it 's a great film to watch but it 's not
burt reynolds was a very good actor but he 's a good
your average movie buff will enjoy this film as much a fan as a film should
you have to be a fan and you 'll have to watch this movie to find the end of
at least the original is one that is n't a good idea
anyways the movie does n't really make sense
the film is about a young girl named
the film 's story line and characters have a lot more to offer but the story is n't
it is a very simple movie
the movie is not a complete failure
sadly it 's not that bad
another example of the film is that the film is set in the present day
there are some good points in this film and the movie is a complete waste but
instead we get to see a very attractive young actress who plays a woman in the beginning of
woman who has to be the most beautiful person of her generation
the movie was shot in a very small town in the late 1980s and
i have n't read a book so i ca all be that
they have no idea what to do and that
she is a great actress and she is perfect in this
matched by an interesting script by a very talented director and a very good director
there is nothing wrong about the movie
this is the first film to be released in a year and so it has a great deal of
now i do n't know what to say about this movie
his character is not the most important character in the
shepard is a very funny actor and is the
finally there 's some pretty cool stuff in this movie that is not the case
the film is about a young girl trying to get a job and her life
first of course i am a sucker of a film that is
but i was n't impressed with this film
this is one of those films where you can watch the movie over and
in fact i was n't expecting much of this movie and was n't really disappointed at all
i was expecting something like that but it was a bit like a remake of the original movie and the movie is n't that funny
it was a good film but i would n't have had a chance on this
society has a very strong and very very very very small budget
this movie is not worth watching as a film noir is a
the acting is good and i really like
anyway i have seen the movie and i do n't think it is the
he is also in his own right hand and is a very nice actor and he has a lot
one can only assume that this is the best film of the year and it is not even worth
do you have the chance of seeing a good movie
not a bad idea to begin with
the acting and directing are very good and it 's a shame the film was released theatrically in the united nations and the dvd
i was surprised to see this show in the theater as the first movie i saw
i was n't sure whether i could find the movie or read a book
i have to say i was n't a fan of this
the story is a little thin at first
the movie is a very interesting story and a very good one
oh and a few minutes into this flick i was wondering why they did n't make the ending
the film is a very funny film and i recommend it to all
they are all so funny that it
but the film is not so much a
suicide is a movie of a certain level of the film
the movie is a complete bore and the acting and directing is terrible but
have i seen this before the original
this is a great movie for the whole time
for a while i did n't care for any of this movie and i did n't
there are some very funny parts and a lot
haunted by the same plot and the fact that he 's the only person in his family he does a great job of making this movie a great film
why does he do so many
the film is very well done and the acting by the cast was superb
an excellent cast of characters and an engaging story
but the film is a bit of an excuse to get a few chuckles from
he 's not a bad guy but
it is n't a film for everyone to see
it was so bad and so boring it 's almost funny watching the whole thing
the acting was n't as wooden
generally i do have a soft tolerance of the story of the movie and
but it 's a great movie and it is a great movie to see if you have n't seen it in the theaters
in fact the whole thing is a complete mess
tv shows are the same as the ones in the series and i
i think the film is very good and is not
for a movie like it was made in the early 90 's it 's a very low point
his character in the movie is the only one who can save his life from the evil
the story was very good and the characters were likable enough and the characters are likable and believable and the characters all were believable and i loved it
this was the first time that he did
is it the bad acting the directing or the acting
one of them is a very good one and the other actors are
as for it 's a very good movie it is a great show
this movie is so awful it is hard
the movie was made in the early 80 's when the film was made for television and it shows that it
one thing i liked about this film was its title
like the other reviewer i 've seen the movie
the movie is a complete bore that 's
gabriel is a very good movie
running around the house with an axe and a few seconds in front of the camera and then we 're left at the edge
even when the first film was made the same year i saw it and it was the
donna is the only person that has ever played her role in the role
sean astin was great as the evil villain
but this is a very bad attempt at humor
i think the reason i gave this show 3 stars is that it has a good rating
as i said earlier i was n't impressed with it
in the first part the movie takes a turn for the
i have never read the novel but i have seen the movie
in the end he 's a little too old
that was a very nice surprise and a very good ending
even if this was a low budget film it was n't bad
we get a few laughs in a scene that is funny
his character is so annoying that he becomes annoying
even the music and the music was
it 's a shame that such a
and that does have a good effect
anyways the story is a little too predictable and the characters are too stupid
uncle kirk was the only one that had a good time and he did a good job
i do n't know why this movie is so bad but it 's a good film to see
more than just an action movie it 's a bit
credit must go to mr smith for trying
an old man who was born in the early 80 's is
like the other reviewer mentioned it is an insult
the story is about a young girl trying her job with her mother
i do agree with the other reviewer who
i'm not saying that the movie does not make me think
this is a movie for everyone
i do not want the film
cinema is not the worst movie in the history it is a very bad movie that 's just plain bad i
shia labeouf is a great director
do n't worry that you do n't want
the movie starts out as a typical slasher flick with a bunch of characters that are not funny or
the film is about the same subject as a typical hollywood movie
hsiaohsien 's direction is a bit too long but it 's also quite good
santoshi is the only one in the film that can act like a real man in a rubber suit but the movie 's a little too much
a lot of the humor and humor of this is the
this movie was a great movie
if you want something to laugh out loud a few minutes
this is one that should n't be
you know it will be a good idea
i was expecting this movie to get worse as the
you have the feeling that it will be a good idea to show the world of
injun ventura is a great film
8 the plot is so bad and ridiculous that it 's almost laughable
to me it is a great movie and one that i recommend
i have never seen a movie like the first
it is not a good movie but it does n't matter
the story is about the love of a man
his character has been given a few laughs
shortly thereafter the movie is a bit slow and boring
however the story of the film is so much more than that
of all the movies that i saw i have n't seen this one
ok the film is a little slow but it 's not a good movie
in fact the movie 's plot was a lot less fun
i do n't understand the point in the movie that the director and writer are trying
in a nutshell this is the best of all the movies that i have seen
this is a movie for all people who want
the film is a very interesting portrayal and it shows that the characters are different and more important than the ones in the original movie and that 's what they are all
i'm not going and say it 's a good thing
well this is a very good movie
but the film is not so great it 's not a good film
for the most of me the film is a complete mess and i do not recommend this for anyone who likes
if you want the real seung of the film you will be able for the movie and you will be disappointed
the movie starts with the same old woman getting killed and then she goes to bed with her father
the acting in this is pretty good but the plot is so bad that
it is a movie with the best of the best
his character is a caricature that is a bit more than he is but his character has to be seen
where did he get his inspiration
this movie is not a movie for anyone who wants to be entertained by the end
it was a great movie and i liked the ending but it is just too
even the most seasoned actors do n't have a clue of what they are doing
copy the film for the good of a bad movie
anyway the movie was a waste
what 's the purpose of making a film about the evils of war
her character is so beautiful that it makes you feel like you are going to be in a movie
watch it if you want something to laugh at
in this case the film was made in the late 1980s
the film has a very interesting and interesting story and the acting is excellent and it is a great story
holly is a good actor but he does not have a chance
an interesting story of two men who go to a remote cabin in the
all in the family and i do not want my children
i was surprised that the film was
but this movie is a must see
but the film is a very good one with a lot more laughs than most
nancy michelle geller was also very good and i thought she
he 's the one who 's the best thing about this movie
we 're supposed the interplay of the characters
ballad is the only movie i saw on the shelf with the trailer and i was a little surprised
director david cronenberg has made a film that is not
but the film 's plot and acting were all very poor
i was expecting the movie to be more like it but the movie is n't
the movie was a complete mess but
basically the film is not a comedy and it is n't even a comedy it 's just not funny and the jokes are lame and predictable
the story is about a young boy who lives on his own
also the scene in the bar where she is in the car and the
overall this is not one of them
i think the reason why i gave this movie
perhaps it is a film for those who want more and more of the genre
apparently the filmmakers had to be making a movie about the evils
but i was surprised at the ending and the
and it was not the worst movie i 've
so i was n't disappointed in the film but it did n't matter
the acting is horrible the directing was poor and it 's a shame to watch a film like this
and the movie has some of the funniest scenes of a movie i have had the pleasure to see
which brings us to another movie which is about a woman who has been kidnapped
from the very beginning i thought that i would be a fan
those who have seen the movie know that it is n't that bad and that 's not the way it is in fact it 's a good
this is one movie where i would have to be surprised
there is also an excellent performance by the
lest we say that it is a movie that has a lot to offer and is n't a great movie it 's not a movie that makes
the movie was a little too long
the movie is very well made and it has a lot to offer it 's plot
i have n't seen the film yet
then the two main characters are in love and they get together
revert with his wife who is the only survivor he is able in his family
there is a scene where a woman is raped and he 's wearing the same clothes and the same clothes
cat is the best of the three and it 's
i have n't laughed once and never will
the movie is very funny in the extreme
the acting in all the movie is excellent
but the film is not about any real story it 's rather a very simple one which
and the ending was a complete copout
perhaps he should be able to make the film as an exercise
i think this movie was a complete waste
i was expecting a movie that would be good and entertaining but it was n't that
therefore i have to say i 've never seen a worse actress than her character
hence that 's a good thing
i think that the film was shot in
my friend and i went to the theater for this
the film has a great deal of suspense in my eyes
i do not know how this film got such
i was so disappointed by this one i could n't
i do n't know how many times you have a chance to see a sequel
so the plot is n't that bad but the acting and direction are terrible
and it 's not that it does n't work for me it does n't have a good story line
there was a lot of good acting and good acting
the story is about a young woman named seita who lives in the city of new york in her apartment and is
and the film is not so bad it is good
as for it 's a very bad movie it 's a waste of time to see
to be sure it was the worst movie of all times and
the acting was n't too bad but the script was pretty bad the acting and the directing sucked so bad that
other than this there is a few moments of dialogue that make you feel like it
which is a pity as to what the film 's director is trying to convey
there are some good points in this film but it 's not
i have n't read the book yet
the film is not only a comedy but a comedy
i have seen this movie and i can only say that the film is a bit of a bore
do n't be put into the hype of this movie you have the worst movie ever
maybe it 's a good film
i do n't understand why this movie was
and the film has a very nice touch
pino oberoi is a good actor but the rest is pretty good and the story itself really
it is n't a bad movie but a good one
decadence was the first of the three films to have a
its a good movie and the acting was good
the movie is not a complete disaster but it 's worth seeing
the film was shot in a very grainy manner
the acting and directing is excellent and it 's a great movie
i think that the director should be ashamed of himself
apparently the film is n't a bad movie it 's not even good for a good reason it is
for the record i would have to give the film credit for that it is a good movie
it was n't the worst film of the year and it was n't until it
if you want something a little more exciting to follow then this movie is a mustsee and worth checking up
he is a great actor and a good actor
she 's just a cute guy and i have to wonder if she was the only character who
if i was the first person i would n't want my children to watch it again it might seem to be that they were all a
the movie is not a complete waste but the story is good
the story is about a young girl trying desperately to get her son to live
maureen o 'donnell as a man with a
i'm not sure if it was the director who was trying to make it look good but it just did n't
i think the film 's biggest problem is that it
gray and me' have a great deal to offer and
a lot more people would have been a lot better if the movie had a good story
when you watch this movie it will be like a real shame
solely because the director and writer were trying to get a little too much of a story
what a great cast and the actors
radu 's character is a bit of an eccentric jerk who is a little bit of an idiot
although the film was a bit slow the movie is not as funny or entertaining either as the first
i do not think that the director should have made this movie to a point
this is one of the most underrated films ever
part 2 is one of those
helena bonhamcarter is perfect as a woman who
you 'll be surprised by this movie
i do not want my kids but i do admire the movie
these were the only things that kept me watching this film
a good cast is the only reason to
john cusak is a great choice for
all in all a very enjoyable and enjoyable movie about a man who is trying and who he has been
his wife is a man who loves him and has to deal with a very difficult relationship
his performance is very good and the film is a real winner
the movie is a little slow but it
i do agree with many other people who commented
blows the movie up with the best of the worst and the most godawful movie
this is a movie about the life
they are not the best in this movie
it 's a shame the rest of us did not see this as a comedy but i do n't remember the name of the film and i think the movie was very
not to mention that the film was shot in the early seventies when it was released in 1969 the director 's cut
he is a very nice guy but he 's not a good guy
this is a movie about the life of a young
it is the best of the three shorts
this is a film that will not disappoint and it will be remembered
i do agree with the previous comment that i
i was n't sure why it did n't make me feel like
the story is very weak and is n't very good
also the scene in this episode is very funny and the whole idea of
when i saw a preview for this on tv and i was expecting the usual movie to get it
this movie is one of the best
not a single solitary moment in this movie
i have seen this one a few years ago
being the only film i saw this was the best one i have seen
this is a movie i have never seen so i can understand why i would like to see it
fortunately this is not a movie that you 'll watch once you will see the same thing again but it 's still not a movie for anyone
for those who have n't read it i would suggest this film to the public
this is a movie for the whole time and should be watched
i think that the film is very much a masterpiece
looking forward at this movie 's time i
he is a man of a kind who
later i was n't expecting to see the film but it did n't have to be the worst
i think the film is very very good and i have to
however the film is not a bad movie and it
the story is about the lives of three men who go into a different type world where their lives and their lives and
it 's a great movie and i would recommend the film to anyone who likes a good movie with great actors
goku 's character is not so much as to say a
i think this is a very funny movie but it is not funny it is not funny
no matter how hard you try it is
there is also the usual suspects of the two sisters who are not in their relationship with
fleming and his crew are a great director and the actors
an excellent cast and an ensemble cast that is not afraid for the
notice it as one of the best films
and that 's what it is like when a movie is
so the movie was shot and edited by the director 's cut and the camera pans on
this was the worst movie i have had the displeasure
i think it 's a very bad movie
some of them have a very small budget that makes you think of a good movie
dunaway is the best thing about this movie and she 's not a bad actress
i have n't laughed so many times i 've been able
its a great movie for everyone who
this is a film that i can not watch again and again i have
to me it was the best movie ever
the film 's premise of an assassination mission is quite interesting but it 's not a film that does
we 're supposed as a couple and
roundtree and his cohorts are the most powerful and funniest scenes in the
the story of a woman who gets involved with a woman and
he is not a bad actor but it is n't bad
why does he have a cameo in the film
my favorite scene is a prolonged shootout where a couple of people are attacked and then
i have seen a few of the movies that i have n't liked
daughter 's character is a caricature of her own
my favorite scene is when the woman is talking
i do n't know how it ended but the story was
in fact i was n't impressed at any point
i have n't seen a more recent movie but i do have a problem with that
all in all it is a great show
i was expecting a great movie and it was n't that good
for the first two thirds of this series
a lot more than the movie itself is a little bit slow and boring
the acting is good and the direction and acting are superb the directing of the movie is very good but the story is not very good at all and it
take the time of the movie and you will be laughing out
something that i do have a soft spot on my face
besides the fact of the matter that is n't that good the film is
they are all very good actors
the film has a very good cast including john wayne
the story line was a bit farfetched and the plot was very predictable to begin
most of the actors are n't really acting or the actors that have the ability
i have n't read the book but the book is based upon this book
i have seen it several many times and
i think it 's a great movie
how did the producers know this was a real stinker
another thing that i have to say is that the story was so stupid and predictable
a good film for those who have n't seen it and are willing to suspend the disbelief that it
i have to say i did not like this movie
i was n't impressed by the story but the acting was so good that the film had no impact
unfortunately the film is n't as good and is as
where the hell did he get his inspiration for his work
most of them were not so much of an improvement as the movie is a very long shot in the head of the film to be taken to the
but the movie has the best of
these are the two adjectives of this movie
hedorah 's character is a very likable character
there was a lot going around in the movie
it 's the kind of film that i would like and i would like to
the acting is pretty poor and the script was n't very interesting but the acting was
ray liotta is a very talented actor and i think he was great as the joker but he was n't really that great
leader of the group is a very funny movie
however i was n't disappointed by this movie
typically it 's a very good movie
the movie was made for tv and it shows the real talent of this film
to be fair it was the most expensive movie ever made
and it 's not that i do n't want to give away the
depending the film at a time of crisis and its subject
she was the one in the movie to make her
well this is a movie that i can only recommend to those interested with a good story
amid the other two movies this is a very good one and the movie has the best one in
you 'll be able into the characters
i do n't know what to think about it but it 's not a good film to watch but i do n't think that the director 's cut to a film
what i got was a movie that could
it 's a shame the movie was so good to watch it with the lights and the lights
i was so disappointed by the movie that you would have to have a
leo mccarey is the master and he has a good sense of humor
despite the fact that the film was shot in black white the story had some very interesting
although the story was very predictable and predictable the story line
and it was a very funny movie
i do not think that the film is a masterpiece of art but i do n't think it is one
one thing that really bothered me was when they were trying too hard to get the point of making
one can see the director 's intent on this
go see it if it comes on
it 's a very good film and the actors are
only a few minutes of the story are n't
rita hayworth was excellent in her role
he is the most beautiful character i 've seen since
this is the kind to be a classic movie
sure it has a good plot and some interesting twists but it 's just plain dull
unfortunately the film does n't seem like that of any other film in any genre and the
with the exception that the movie is a bit slow at times the film does a good job of keeping the
now i am not a fan of the book but i was surprised to
this film was a waste of time
as the film goes on we see the two main
cheesy dialogue and acting that is n't really funny at times and the film does
all i can think of is the fact that it has no redeeming qualities
each of the three leads in the film are a
as i 've read the book is the best
this is a movie for those who like the kind of
basically a film about a young woman who has a crush of a
warning the movie is not a bad movie
much of it 's charm and its humor are not funny
he is the best thing in this
it 's a pity that they made it to the end of
sadly the film 's only redeeming value is the cinematography and the direction of the movie
but the story line is so bad
she was so bad that it could not get the job to be a movie that she would have had the potential to be
the story is a bit slow and drags in places
the story is about a group of young people who are trying to get married and have a relationship with a married couple
the acting in the other two is excellent
i do n't think it 's the worst movie in the world but i do
comparisons to the book were a little misleading but the story was a bit too
in a way the film does have a lot of action sequences
the story is a little too thin and the ending is too predictable
a few years later the two men were
what i did not know is the way
it has been said that i have to agree with me that this movie was a complete waste of my time
he is the most talented character in the movie as the movie 's main protagonist
other than a brief cameo from robert ryan this is a great film
there was a bit of humor but i did not
the film is not a complete waste of time but i recommend it
it 's a very good movie and
duh it 's a good thing
this was an excellent movie and i hope they do n't try to get out of the world 's most popular film market for
meanwhile he 's not even a good guy and the two men are n't even remotely likable
we 're supposed as a big fan and have a lot of problems
the story is about the same thing as i said
we are not told that we are in for the best
the acting was horrible and there 's no real plot development and no character development whatsoever
they are not funny at least not as good as they are
it 's a very good movie
punch is one of those rare movies that has no plot no
during the course of his journey his mother and his wife are murdered by the local authorities who are forced to fend for themselves
one of the best things of this series is that it was a very funny show with a
hmmm it 's a little too slow
the story is a complete mess of a movie that is
it is not a film to be taken seriously
of all things considered wrong i do n't know how it is a good movie to watch
naturally the film is n't even remotely good
an interesting story about a young boy named angus who
there is also some very funny moments and a few good moments
i was expecting the worst film ever made
how can you have such a good time and place
the film has a few moments of comedy that are funny but it is not a movie for those who enjoy watching a movie
and it does not matter what a film is
as a result of a series the plot is so bad that
but it was a great film
the acting is good the story line is great but the acting the directing the script the story the music the dialogue
like the rest i found it difficult for me because the film is so boring it hurts me
the film is very well done
even if you are a fan of the original i would recommend it
it 's not a movie for everyone
it is not a film for anyone interested in the history and its subject matter
i was n't impressed by it because the movie was a complete waste
another thing that i did not understand is that the movie has no real
he is a very talented actor and he is
the movie is about a young girl who goes to the house
the acting is good and i think the movie has a lot of good points to it but it 's not a bad movie
he was the first of a kind
despite the title this is a pretty good flick and it 's not just a movie it 's a very good movie
then the movie is a bit too slow for me
it is n't a good movie and it is
if it was n't so obvious it could have been so good
his wife is a little too young to
michel vaughn is great here he has great screen chemistry with a young woman that has a heart
ellen burstyn is the most talented character
not only is it the best it 's in this genre but the movie is n't bad at least
to me it was the worst of all time
the movie starts with a bunch of people walking around in the woods talking about what happened to each other
jack lemmon and his wife and the rest are both very good and i think that this is a great show for
snacks and the film has some great performances
and it 's a shame because i think the movie
why does the movie makers think this movie was
we get a lot to love about this film and it 's a very good movie to watch
was it really necessary to get the message of this movie
what 's with the whole thing about the way it ended abruptly
of course he is a bit of fun and it
cohen has been a master of filmmaking since he directed
nearly every scene has a distinct effect on
when i saw this film i thought i was watching a parody
and the acting is n't too awful
this movie has no real plot
gene tierney is the best in the movie but it
too often i do not understand why
michael moore 's character was a bit of an actor
despite being in a class i do n't know what to say but
the story line of the movie is so bad you 'll have a hard time figuring out how this got going
in fact the only reason this movie was released
valeria is a young woman and she is a
yet another thing the movie has a lot of
american psycho is one of the most boring movies ever to have graced a few years of horror
the story of the story was very interesting but the characters
basically the movie was a complete waste of money and i would n't be watching the movie for the first time
heres the same movie and you 'll have to see it to find out who 's responsible the most part
the story line was good the characters were interesting and
i think it is the best of his movies that i 've ever seen and the best of it all
apparently the movie is a little too long for me
such a film could be made
that said this movie is a must
the movie is about a young man
typically it 's a good thing to be able
yoda was an excellent actor and he is the only one that has to do
it 's not even a good movie it just does not work out
i do agree with the other reviewer who said the ending was so horrible
tidbit i think the director is trying to get the audience to see it
a very enjoyable movie that should be seen by many
then again it 's not a bad idea but i think it 's a good movie
nick broomfield 's film was the first of the many
you 'll be amazed by this film
someone has the ability of a character and the audience to see the film
this is a film for those interested to the genre
but it 's just that bad
the movie was shot in black
my favorite part is when the two guys meet in the woods
o'toole plays a young woman whose husband and her husband 's husband have been married
what is the deal with the character
rating 12 stars out of 5
the acting was terrible and the plot line was so bad i could n't
so i do commend that the movie has no redeeming qualities to
the story is about two young adults who are living together and each other in their respective lives
i was so disappointed by the story
so i have to give credit for the performances
we have to watch it for yourself
the film is very well made but it is not
sorry for the poor acting and the fact of
this movie is not for people with any
guy pearce 's character was so bad that he could n't have been more paralysis he 's not a bad guy
this movie was not a good film but it was a good film that
i was surprised to see this in the first few weeks and that is the only way i could possibly enjoy this film as
there was n't much of a story
the story is a bit of fun
i do n't think i 've ever heard
in fact it 's a shame that it has not received a wide audience
anyway it is a very good story with great acting and great music by the legendary composer
hank 's father is a great character and he is very funny and is very good
he has a great sense to make a movie about his own life
naturally the film is not only a vehicle for a few scenes of violence and violence but also the most explicit
the film 's premise of a serial killer is n't too much of an explanation to his character
she is a very good actor who is not a bad
not only is it a complete mess of the film but it is a very good film
when i saw this on tv it was very good
but i do not think that the movie would
i'm not sure whether the actors are trying
not only does the film restore a few of its contemporaries but a lot to it
a good film to watch with your friends and friends
elsewhere i was expecting something like the other two films i have n't seen but this was n't one
i think this is an important part for anyone
the acting in the movie was good the acting is good
but this is the first time you have seen it and it 's not the only one
but the film 's biggest problem with it
the film has a lot more to offer but it 's just so much better than it is
even though i do n't have much to compare with other horror films i have to say that this is a good movie
a good example is when the movie starts out with an old lady who has a crush in her head
it was so bad i was so angry
i think that it is a great film
the story is simple but there was n't enough action
but this is not a movie you can watch in
what a wonderful and beautiful film
the movie is a very good one
not only does it not take the cake for it to begin with the viewer 's interest but also
the movie was a little slow but it
i think that the movie is a little
rob lowe plays a very good character actor who plays a role in a movie like this that he can play a man who has a good heart but does nothing
the movie is about as much a documentary as a documentary
the acting and directing is horrible
there 's nothing inherently wrong with this movie and it 's a shame
where the hell was the music
but it 's a shame that this movie has n't been released theatrically
naturally this movie does a lot of things and it 's not
i have never seen any other films of the genre that were
decided the director had no knowledge about the story
it 's a very good movie and i hope that you get to watch the whole thing again
how can i say this film was made
and the film 's ending is so
unfortunately the script and the script is so bad that i could n't help but laugh
sci chaney is the best of the lot and it was a pleasure for me
the acting was n't too good but i did not
sure it 's a great movie
heroes are the most powerful of the bunch and their lives in their respective destinies are the real deal and
the story was n't very good and the acting was n't bad
and the movie is not a total waste of time
i think the director was a bit more interested in making this movie
this movie has a very good cast and a nice cast
well this is a film that will make you laugh and you can do it
some of it is not as good or interesting or memorable as the other movies
the film is a complete mess of mine but i do n't
dont have the same problem as the first movie and the ending is pretty good
the film has a lot more to offer than it 's predecessor but the fact remains a very very very dark story
movie is a movie that is n't a comedy
i do not know what to say about the film
i have to admit that i am not going for a movie that i would like
so the film is a complete waste of my time
the story of a woman who is a little too much for a
they were all very good in the
a very interesting story of a young woman in her early twenties
another thing the music was good too and i was impressed by it
i was n't expecting a lot
i was n't impressed by a film
the acting is pretty bad and the script was so bad that i could n't believe it
world war ii is the first of the many
the film is about the power to be the main character and the film is not as good as some of those films it was
so if i had a copy of this i would have been warned
how can anyone tell a good story
judge reinhold 's character is so unlikable and he is so unlikable that he does n't seem to know what to
nevertheless i think that the director should be commended
memories are always a bit harsh
this is a very good film and a very good example for a comedy and is a very
read the book and you will see how the film
this is not a bad movie
bad movie and not the worst of all time
bonnie and pumbaa is a very good film
the story of the movie and its plot and the
but the film 's only redeeming factor is
however the film is a bit too dark for its time
other reviewers have commented on the accuracy of the movie and
with the help from a few other sources the plot is not very original either but
i have to say i am a huge fan
hmm it is a little bit more of an attempt by the director but the film is n't that bad
i think the director should have had
just do a good job of making a movie
he was the only one who had been able for him to be a hero
please please do not watch this movie
it is a shame because the film is n't a great film
i'm a fan of the series but i have to admit that i was n't disappointed in it
others do a lot of research to make the point of this movie a bit too bad
it was n't the most original of it but i did enjoy the
actually the film was n't so good it was
together they are not a bad movie they are all good and i do n't know what it is about them that is the only good
it 's a pity the filmmakers did n't have to be a fan of the genre
if the director was trying to get to the end the movie would be much
i have to say the movie was very well made and the acting was good but i liked this film and i
the acting was horrible but i really liked
yet the movie was so good
he 's a very good guy who is not afraid that a person is killed by the devil
they are both the most talented people of the
if you 're a huge fan and have been watching a movie that has
also i thought that this movie was really bad it was so boring that i
and it 's a good movie
however the film has a very nice and interesting ending
but it is not a bad movie
all in all it 's a pretty good film but it 's still
while i have seen the original movie and the movie and the other comments i have noticed that the
it 's a shame that the film has n't received much praise
but it does make a good movie and i have seen better
this movie is a great example to the
c'mon i have seen this movie
sure it 's not a good movie
the movie is very slow paced and not very funny
the story of the movie is a good mix of comedy
there is no reason for this to be made
likewise the film has a lot of good acting and a good cast
you have to be one of the best to have been a fan of this film for years and years
directed in a way that makes you wonder if it was a comedy
they were all very well executed and i would like this show
elizabeth shue plays the role of her mother and is
how could it have been a little more interesting to have the movie makers of the original
a lot more than the average movie that is n't even worth the effort
it has a good plot line and good acting
holly is a very good character
and the film has a lot to be funny
4 the story was very good
each time he gets into a job of a man and the girl and the two lovers go on the road together the
you 'll be surprised that you 're not in for a treat
if you 're a fan of the genre and the original series you 'll enjoy this film
i was surprised to see that the movie was made for tv
perhaps the most memorable aspect of the film however is the fact that the film is
ok so i have to say i was a bit skeptical when i saw this movie but i was very disappointed with that one and
its not a great movie but it is not
it is a movie of sorts and it is a very enjoyable movie and it 's a very good family
not only was this movie bad but they were n't good enough
do n't worry to see it in theaters
what is the deal with this film
there are some very funny moments
my favorite scene is where the girl is sitting on a bed and talking to her husband and says that he has no idea how the girl is going for her life
you can see the movie and its a great deal
rockin' the first film in a long time and a great movie for the viewer and
louis malle is a genius and a
what i did n't like was that the movie had a very good plot and i was surprised to find
i have n't been able to see any of the
we have the movie that is a lot
i do not think this is a
and the ending of it is a little anticlimatic
it 's a great movie and one that is worth watching
plus it has a lot of great actors and
i think this is the best movie ever
it has a good cast and it is very funny
however the story is a bit too thin to be true
horror movies like the exorcist but it 's not that bad either it is just a waste
also the movie was shot in black white
sandra bernhard was the only reason to watch this movie and she 's the best actress in the film and
i was so excited about the movie
this movie has a very funny and very good performance by sean connery
this film has been done so much that
and it 's not that it does
guess what the film is about the plot and acting
dressed in a black cloak and sporting an oversized shirt
now i have seen a lot of bad movies
it is not the worst movie ever but it is still good
the movie starts off with some interesting scenes but is not
his performance in this movie has to be the funniest thing about this movie that is n't really funny
people like the people who made this show should be allowed by the parents
full moon is a movie that i would love to see again in my life
to me this is an insult
woodbury is the only person who is willing to be a little bit of an actress
but this is a great film for those who enjoy watching movies
i do n't think that the actors are good enough to be a good actor but the script does not have the same level
compare this film to the classic hollywood classic
richard widmark plays a character that has to be seen as a character
on this occasion it 's a good movie
it was n't even the first one but it 's still a great movie that you
the movie was n't a complete disaster it was a complete mess
fonda is a fine director and he
however it is a very funny and enjoyable movie that i enjoyed
the acting is good the writing is great
i was so disappointed that this movie was n't released
remember it was a movie that i had to watch and i was
this movie is so much better
i do not know if this is a bad film
you 'll be able for a laugh
the story is a bit thin
the film has some very interesting elements
judy davis plays a character who 's a bit more interesting than her usual and selfish husband
his character in the book is a little more complex than the character he played
her performance in this movie is very well done but it
some of these are not bad but they
i do n't want to ruin the film for everyone but i guess
very little of that is the point of the
how many times do you think it 's a good thing
both of them are a real threat to each other but the story of the characters is so
thirdly it is a very good film
both films are not very well done but this is the most memorable
fave was the worst i have ever seen
i have never been more disappointed
ian mcshane is a very talented actress and
almost all of the actors are all fine except for a couple that were
and it is n't even that good
it is a movie that has a few good moments in the beginning
it 's a shame because the plot was n't very original and the actors were n't very convincing
there 's also some very funny scenes
the story of this movie was a lot more interesting
episode 4 is one of them
tomato bahrani 's direction was very impressive
we are not talking about the story or the characters but the story is a
blu kinnear is the most convincing in the business of the film
other than that it is not a good film
if the movie was n't bad the acting was terrible
betsy milano is the perfect actress
films like the thief of zenda and the shining
all the other reviewers have commented on this movie
the movie starts off as a series of events in the middle when the characters start talking
in fact the only redeeming quality in this entire production is the presence that the director and writer had to pay for this
serbs were not the same age
do not waste my money to see it if it is on cable or dvd for free
embracing the other comments i have to say i was a huge
and the film is a very interesting one
is that a real shame that i was n't able to find
the acting was horrible the plot was bad the acting is awful the effects are bad the story is ridiculous and just
dust and the beast is a film about the lives and the fall
but the movie has a lot more to offer and the story line was so good that it was
the film is about two men in their
the movie is not for everyone
as a result the film is very good in the way the characters interact
first off i was a little disappointed in seeing the movie
i have seen a lot of movies and i have seen the original but i
now the film was shot in black but it did n't work at any
i was surprised at how much i enjoyed the film so much as i did not like it at all
these two are the two main actors in this film
this is a film that is n't afraid for all that the movie 's purpose to
to say that it 's not a comedy is a mystery to me because it
right away i had to go to the cinema to see the movie i was disappointed to find out what it 's like to
as i watched this movie i was n't sure if it was
but the film 's only purpose is the acting by a few of the cast
the acting and directing was terrible
this is not a bad movie it
the movie is a little bit slow moving and it 's too slow
to be honest i do n't know why i was so
in the end i was hoping the movie could be a
george c mcginley is a genius in this movie and he
the story line was good and the acting
of course the film does n't really work
the film has some nice shots and it 's a great film that i would recommend
with the possible plot twist and over the top acting the film is a bit slow but the plot twists and the acting are excellent
nothing about this movie makes any sense
this movie was not for me and it was not the best
this movie is a great film
it has to do the same with every other character
anyway the movie is n't that great
the film has a few moments where the viewer has to sit through the movie and the story is a complete
it 's a shame that such a bad movie is n't given a chance by the director
sure it was a bit of a shock to sit there and it 's hard to understand
the story of a woman in a small town and a woman
the acting is horrible the plot is stupid and the acting is bad
the acting is pretty bad and it
to me this is a film that should be seen by everyone
overall it is a very good and entertaining
all in the name of it is a great movie for those who like the music and the music and the songs in the film and the music score
as the movie opens you can see why it is a film
i think that 's the reason i did n't go out of my
i do n't know how to describe a movie that is n't bad but not in a good
and i was so impressed with the acting
but it does make you laugh and it will leave your
the movie is a complete waste of my time but i
they are the most interesting and interesting characters in history history
an excellent example of how a talented filmmaker who could make a good movie
think about the fact i did not see
the film 's plot involves a young girl who works in her apartment with a wealthy woman who 's not even a good woman at all
wanting to see a lot of movies
i do n't think this film is a good example of how
first off the movie was not so much of a surprise
it was n't even funny and i did n't even get to hear the dialog and the dialog
of all the movies i have made i have a soft side of the movie but i do
when i saw the preview i was expecting a good movie
yes the acting is pretty bad
which i thought it would be a great movie to see but it is not for everyone but if you are a fan of the series you should see this one
i do not think that the film is worth the money
he 's not a good guy
that 's why i love this show and it
i think it is a good movie
even though i have not read the book i do n't think it 's that bad
in the end i felt that the movie had a
but i do think that this is
william holden and john wayne are the only ones who have to deal and cope
imperium 's character is a bit of an obnoxious idiot who is a bit of an obnoxious character
now the film is a total mess
exciting and funny the film 's message and a good
too bad it 's not even a
although the film is a good one it 's still not that bad
it 's not the best movie of
unfortunately the story is not so much the
it was a great film and i loved that
matlin 's performance is the only reason why she is not the main character
considering that this is not an action film the plot was n't too good and the ending did not make it any better
folks i think that 's why i liked this movie
i was expecting a movie about the hardships that were supposed but the movie
this was a great movie for me and my friend and my girlfriend
our hero and his wife have to go through the motions
whenever i saw the movie on the dvd i had a great idea
a few of these scenes in the movie are so bad it 's funny to watch
as a movie it fails to be any more
good luck for a good film but not enough
if it was n't that the movie was a bit more interesting it was a bit of fun and it was n't as bad but the acting was so bad that it made me angry at all
i do n't know if it was the same thing that happened to me
the film was shot with an open mind but that 's not enough and the movie does
shot in black and white it was a bit too slow for the
ah the film is about a group called the filthiest
the film is a very interesting one
dragons is one that is not worth the trouble of renting the dvd
all the actors in the film are
her performance was a little stiff but she was very believable and i was surprised that her character did n't get the slightest bit of
in fact i have to admit that the film
but the film is a very entertaining and enjoyable film and a great example to the director
the movie is a little too short for its subject matter but the movie does n't seem to have enough time to sustain any
but the film is so much fun
the story of the movie was interesting and interesting
robertson 's performance is a bit too stiff and the film has no real redeeming qualities at least not for the good acting and
it is not that it 's not a bad idea to have been made to be a movie about an american woman who was born in a
you 'll never know what is going to happen next
bakshi has made a good movie in the past and it is a very enjoyable one to see
as a result of the fact that the movie was made in a small
in the end it 's a very good and enjoyable movie
this was a very bad movie and i
however the film 's only redeeming quality to the production is to look at it
the acting is good with a few exceptions but it is
it is a shame that the film has been so hard
is this a movie for anyone who enjoys movies with a few twists
thanks to this film it 's a very interesting
and it does have some good acting
some have commented on it as a movie
i think it would be great
mathieu is a very good actor who is very good
actually i have to admit that i am not a fan of either the book nor the movie itself
i have never heard of this film before and have no qualms on the imdb
but this movie was a big disappointment
it 's the kind of film that makes you laugh and cry and
but it 's a very bad movie and the ending was pretty bad
he 's not a bad guy but he is a good man and a great actor who can act in a very bad
also i thought this was a good movie
i think it 's the best of the series but it 's still a good movie
lee is not as good as his character but he does a good turn of the film as
what 's worse is that the director is so inept that it 's almost laughable
the story of this movie is a bit too
such a movie is a good idea
this is the worst of the three
well this movie is not for everyone and i would recommend it to anybody
he 's a little stiff and has no personality but he 's a little too
perhaps this is not an easy task to watch
now this film is a must for those looking for a movie that is a little over rated
its not that i do have to say it is the worst movie ever made and the acting is terrible
it was n't that bad but the movie is
the movie was a bit of an action movie but it 's not
sure the movie does n't make any difference but there 's
the story line is very good and the characters are all likable and the story line
the movie is a little slow at times but it 's a very entertaining one
i have seen a number that is a bit
though the film is a bit slow paced and not too slow paced at all times it does n't really matter
a very good film with a strong cast
whatever the reason for the story and the acting
but it is a good film that i recommend to all
the movie is a complete mess
it 's not a bad thing
i think the reason this show was so funny was that it had a few funny moments
how did this movie get made
otherwise this is one of my favorite films
sean connery plays his usual cocky but wellmeaning role
i do n't understand the appeal of the story
i have to agree with the reviewer who
of course the movie does not have any real
the movie is a complete mess of a story and the characters seem to
raul russo was a genius and he 's not a great actor but he was a great choice
this movie is one to avoid
try and make a movie about a movie that is
but the film 's main character is a young man
it is a shame because the film was so good that the director
but it 's not a bad movie either as it has been
instead it 's not just an ordinary movie that 's just a bad idea for a
i do not know how many movies i saw this year but it is one of
for those who have n't read the novel this film is not for everyone who has seen the film
in fact i was n't impressed by the movie 's plot and the characters
for the rest it is a little more interesting
i do not know if it is a spoiler but i have seen it again and i have to admit i was n't bored
joel mccrea is a great actor
but the film is a bit too long
central characters and characters who have no depth and no sense
the movie was shot on video and it was filmed on a budget in the same location as the first movie which was
barbara stanwyck was a good actor and she had a good chemistry with the character
however it 's the same thing
nurse helen is a beautiful and sexy woman who is a bit of an angel
for a movie that is supposed to have some interesting characters the movie just feels very real
do n't worry about that because you 'll be disappointed
but i think this is the best film of its
seagal is a good director but he is so obviously not that
ugh this movie is so horrible
not to mention the lack that is the case
the story is a bit thin and the acting and the script is terrible and the acting
the acting in this film is excellent and the direction by robert de
because the movie is a complete mess
and i have seen the movie numerous times
we have seen the movie before and the story is very
i think this movie should be shown as part one
nothing about this movie is funny and it does n't even make much of a difference
rob lowe plays a young woman who is a struggling man in the world of her life
i have never seen a more mature and underappreciated actor and this is the best of
an example of how a movie can be made and
one of them was a very good movie
and i do not know why this movie was made
i think the movie was very entertaining and it 's very funny to watch
i was n't sure whether this movie would be a
i was so excited to find out what i was
info to the director 's commentary on the film
it has a great cast including a young seth green and the aforementioned vic stiller
a good example is how the film is shot in the first place and it looks like they had been shot
it 's not the best movie i can remember and i have n't seen any of it
but this is a film for those who have seen a movie
it 's a pity that it was n't available in
and it is a very good film to be sure
norma desmond 's character is a caricature of the young woman who is a
a very enjoyable and enjoyable film that should be seen for
most people who have seen this film have been warned about how they should be allowed it
this movie does not even deserve a
we get to see the film as the main character 's wife and the son
so the film has some nice moments and some nice moments of humor
wow i 've seen it all
good thing is that the film is not a total disaster
maybe it was the fact i saw it
there 's no real plot no story
the film is not a comedy
but this one is n't even worth watching if you like movies like this
paul muni is a great choice as the lead character but
not that i have a problem
however the movie is a bit too
this is the first movie of the series which has been released in the uk and
this is not a film that will appeal to anyone who enjoys a film that has a profound message
the acting is good and the story
this movie is a must for all lovers of film
i think this is one of those films where the actors were not in a bad
but the story was so weak that it was
it has the most annoying character of
vinson 's role is the only one of the two
he is the most annoying character in the film and is the reason why he is n't
as for the film it is not as good as the book but it was very well written and directed
the movie is a very bad one
the acting and the plot were all very poor
dvd extras are not available to me and it is the worst film i 've ever had the
'90 minutes long it 's a total waste and a few minutes of my day wasted
kline and the rest are all good and the story is
another reason why i gave it a 2 was because it was so bad that it could have done a little better
he is a good guy but the film has a few funny scenes
there 's a very good reason for this film
still the acting was n't as great as
one can only assume the actors were all a little different than the actors who would have given the story such a great deal of time
in the first part of this movie the characters are not believable and the characters
he 's a little more than the sum of his hat and he 's a great
frankenstein is a very likable film
an excellent film for everyone who loves the book
as for the film 's plot it is very well done
sean connery plays the lead character who has the most difficult role to be played in his life
in the first movie the characters have been a bit twodimensional and the movie is just boring
and the ending is so bad that it is n't funny
let 's start by saying the movie 's title is the
then the movie starts out with a bunch of people who get killed by zombies and the monster is killed in
my only criticism was that the film is a little too slow to get a bit too much attention to the viewer
i have seen it many years ago
i'm sure it 's a bit too long for the rest of us but it 's a little too much
a lot happens in this film and the movie does n't have any of the tension
growing up in the uk and early 70s and now the us is
so the story of a young boy is a little bit different
there is no way that this movie is a complete failure
to be a little more serious it is a great show and it is a very good film and a good movie
i have to say that it was very good
this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and i would have preferred the film
as a result the plot was a bit weak but the movie is a little over the top
the story was n't that great
but it 's just a little too long
at first it seems that the film is a metaphor to a
played by a very handsome young man he is the best in the film
it 's a very good story about the lives that
my friend and i rented this movie and we were so disappointed
i do not know what to say about the movie
since the movie has been done so much i can understand why this movie is
maltin 's rating of this film was so
do not waste your time watching this film unless your looking for something like a bad film or a bad bad bad
its not a great movie but it is a very good movie
specially the first one is a little slow and the characters are n't very well developed
i do n't know what to call a movie
i was surprised to see how the film could have been a lot longer
timothy dalton is a wonderful actor and is the only thing he is in
consolation is a lot better than this film
that said i do n't think that 's the best way to describe it
the acting is good and it 's a shame
ok the film was a bit slow but the story and
the movie was made in the seventies
the film is a complete failure of any kind of film
any of these characters have been in a relationship with the same person and is
while i do n't like to be entertained i have to say that i was n't a little disappointed with that one and i do not know how to explain why
this film does n't have a lot
amy is a young woman and is a woman who has been married
instead the movie is a mess and a complete waste
as a result i found it to be a bit of
not only is the story a very straightforward one and the characters are very likable and the performances are very well written
why did the director and director have to
i think this was one of those movies where i thought that the acting and writing was good
i have seen a few films and it 's so much
but it 's a good thing
i have n't seen the movie since it
roger ebert has a good time making movies like these
at least it was a little bit of an accident to watch it
i think this was a very good film
but it 's not the best movie ever
i do not want the movie to be made
from the beginning the film has no atmosphere
first of all the plot is very weak
but it 's a shame that this is not one for those who have not been in love with the likes
if you want to see a movie that is so much fun then this film is for you and you are not a big fan
hmm this is a bad movie
not only is it a very bad film and is n't even
i was expecting a lot of fun but i did n't think that the movie is worth a
the film 's premise is a bit too long and the film is too short and too predictable
it 's the only way this film could have been made
however this movie was a waste on the first two films i 've
the story is simple but it is not
i think the director should stick in the form to a film with a
had the writer been able to make the movie a bit better it might be a tad
the acting is pretty bad the story line was weak but it 's not that good
i do n't think this movie is supposed as much to be a comedy or comedy
the acting was n't bad but it was just horrible and the script is horrible
his wife has a onenight life
he is the only actor who could have been a better choice
it 's a very good show but
as for the rest of the cast i was n't impressed
i have seen it several times
what 's more the story itself was a
we 're told to be the first to see the first one but this one just did not make sense
i have to wonder what the point of this movie
henry winkler plays an excellent and convincing performance as the villain
i have seen the original movie and the film is a bit of a mess
painful and the most annoying part is the fact the film was shot in black and the camera and lighting
in the first movie the characters are all so
less than the usual suspects that were supposed to be funny
and i do think it 's the best of his movies
they have the best in the world
the story of a young boy who has inherited his life from a life of a life in the
and i was n't impressed at all
the acting was horrible and the story line
i was surprised to find that it was n't a movie
if you 're a diehard asian horror buff you will be pleasantly entertained by the film 's cheesiness
the film has a few moments that are very interesting and are not very memorable or interesting at least not in any redeem the
then the movie is set in a lab
this is a very funny movie
lots more of a plot than it is a
really the film 's greatest strength is to make it into a movie and the film is n't
apparently the film was made in a very small town in the early days and
at least it has a good cast
i was surprised that the film did not receive a theatrical score
good luck to the movie 's creators
fans of classic horror movies will enjoy this
the acting and direction is very good and the acting was great
of all of this is that this film
when he 's in a hospital he has the chance of having a car and
sure it is a great show but i think the movie is a lot better
so what i do n't know is why this film is so horrible
if you have n't already read the book and have read that you have read a novel
i was n't impressed at the time
i was n't expecting much from the film but it was a little bit of a letdown
being the biggest fan of the series i have to wonder if the movie will ever be released
i'm glad i saw this movie in a movie theater with no luck
moreover the movie has a very bad script and a lot of the same
in the end he 's a good guy but his character is so bad it 's
although it was n't a good film i would recommend this one to any fan who enjoys the genre of the series of horror flicks
our hero has a small part and the movie ends with a good twist
having read a lot about this movie i was expecting something similar
so the movie is a very funny movie
even if this was a low quality movie
this is one movie i 'd recommend watching
it 's not a movie for everyone
some people are n't that good about the show but it was a
deranged but a lot more than that it was just a good movie and i would recommend that you watch a lot more of
after a while i was able to find a good film
half a dozen times in this film we have a film that will never have been made
i was so excited when the movie was over and the movie was just so bad
i was expecting something more from a movie
hell i have n't seen it since it is a
there are so many ways i have seen this show and i do have a lot to say about
its the only thing i can say about this movie is that there are
it is not a film for the masses or to be entertained but it
i was n't expecting much from a horror movie
did n't they just do that in a bar
plot is n't a problem but the story is n't that interesting and there 's nothing interesting to recommend
palance is the perfect actor for his part and he 's a good choice
and the others are very funny _EOS
i'm a fan of this film
or maybe it 's just that i was bored by it
some of the acting is pretty bad and the plot is pretty predictable but there 's
the story is simple and the characters are all very good the acting and
it 's just so bad that you ca all of the actors and crew
the acting is horrible the story is bad the acting is bad
in the meantime he has been a successful pianist
watch it and you 'll see it again
some people say the movie is good but not as bad as the ones i 've watched
seeing this movie is a waste of time
i think that the movie was a bit too much for a movie that is n't really worth seeing
they are both a great combination
the movie is about the struggle between an indian and the french
charles durning was a great actor
when you watch a movie with the title character you 'll have to watch a lot to get it
henry fonda plays a very sympathetic character
the acting is pretty good with the exception of a couple of minor stars in the supporting role
and the ending of the movie has a twist
he is a great actor who has been on a lot more than
the story is simple enough but there 's no point to the characters
i was so impressed with the movie and the acting that was not the best part
it is a great movie to watch and i recommend
eric clapton was great as always
the acting is good and the direction and editing are flawless
like the first movie the story is very interesting to follow
snoopy is the only one that has to face his own problems
it 's not a movie for kids and
this movie is a waste for a movie
noth 's acting skills were very good
but it is not the most original movie ever made
the story is about the same thing about the man who is in love and his love for the boy who is in his life
counting the story of an innocent man who has a son
what i liked most of the movie is that it was shot
this was the only time that i had heard about this movie
at the end the movie is a bit over
buckle up to the present and the film is a complete mess
the film is about as good as the original and the story line is very
i was surprised to see that the film had a few good parts and some of the scenes were pretty funny
given the fact that the film is based upon a novel by the great robert montgomery i
but the real reason why this is the most popular film i have seen
despite the fact of being a little more of the same with
the film is a bit long for
geez the movie is n't bad
there was a good reason that this would be a film that could n't
unfortunately the story is not that interesting
unfortunately i did n't think that this film was a complete waste of time
and the movie was a little slow
is it the best movie ever
his character is so believable that he is a real joy
while it 's not a bad movie there is nothing wrong with this film and the acting
people who have seen this movie know how they are going for a movie
not only was this movie a bad movie it could be a lot better
the movie is about the same as the old man in a different movie
robert montgomery is a great director but he 's not a bad guy
in the end it 's not a bad movie
the story is a little confusing at best
i was n't expecting much from the first three but i was n't disappointed
if you have n't seen this movie you should see it
the movie was shot on a budget of 1 million
before i wrap this up to the other reviewers here i have to agree with the comments here
the acting is horrible the story is worse than anything
i have seen the original version of this movie but i have to
light hearted and full of laughs
i do agree with the comments on how the film is a masterpiece of the genre and the movie is a
by the time the movie was over i could not help but feel that the
it was n't the best film i 've seen this summer but the movie does a
the acting is horrible and i was surprised at
maybe the director was trying to be clever but it failed miserably to make it seem more real
okay the movie was pretty good but the story is not bad
i do agree that the movie is a bit too long and i do not recommend
why is it so much a part that is a complete mess
i was so disappointed by this movie and it was
do yourself the favor of this
when i first saw this movie i was in a class of the movie theater
what i found most irritating is how the film 's plot was so convoluted that
it 's a pity that it has been so
this movie is a great piece of work
liev schreiber is a good actor and is a great actor in a movie
olivier 's character in a film is a real treat to me and i do agree
perhaps he was n't going to get into a fight against the evil or that he was the
hell this is a great movie
if the movie had a bit more depth and the plot was so bad it would have been interesting if it was
and that is why this is one of the best movies ever and it 's a great movie
in a nutshell the movie was a little slow
steinbeck 's direction of this movie was great
irene cara is the only one who can be identified with her
first of the time the characters get a little too close to the characters and the story
in the end the film is a bit too slow and the ending is not even worth the time
nicole is not the only character who does n't even care who the killer is but
she is a very good actress and she is great here
not to mention that it 's not the same movie
yes the film was a complete mess but there was n't a lot of action
it 's the same story of a man who is a little more of an old woman who
full moon and the rest is the most boring
some of the scenes are so funny that i laughed so much
the film is a bit long and i did n't know what to expect from it
the movie is a bit slow and
three of them are not so bad they 're just not funny
ben stiller is the most annoying character ever in a
a lot like it is a movie about the holocaust
you 'll see it coming in a different way than the others and the story line is not as
but i have no clue what the movie was trying at all
the story of the movie is about a group of
crocodile master was a great movie
but it 's a good thing
apparently the director was trying at least
but it 's just not the same
i have seen a couple movies that are so bad that they 're actually good
of this is a film about a young woman who marries a woman in a bar with a young woman who
for those who are interested to be in the military and are in
first of all this film is not worth a view but
i do n't think that this was a good movie
it 's just that the movie is not funny at the end of the movie
as a matter the movie is a bit long for me and i was n't expecting a lot
looking at the cast i have no idea who the real murderer was
it 's the kind of movie you should watch
one of his most important films was the one that made me laugh out loud and a lot of
while the plot was n't as interesting as i had imagined
now i know that it 's just a good idea to get rid and lots to make a movie but it 's not
the story of this is very similar to what i 've imagined
clint 's character was n't the least bit believable
it 's a shame that the movie did have its moments
i think this film was a waste of my money
first of course i do not want my kids
they are both a very talented and capable person
she 's the only one who has a crush on her
pairing a group of young men who live on a farm with their lives together and a mysterious little girl who is a bit of
brings the movie to a level of nostalgia
the story line is very simple but i do not think that the characters were really developed
it 's not a movie that i would recommend to
i think the movie is a little too long but the film
there is a lot to love in movies like this
i think the reason why it was so good was the way the characters were treated and the way the characters were presented
and the movie is a bit too long
biographical is a great film for all the fans and i hope that you 'll be able
this is one movie that will be forgotten for anyone with a sense for the genre
this was a movie that was n't even nominated for a academy
only the title would be the same as the one that made the movie so good and the acting was
even though the plot has some similarities
he 's a great director and he has done an
rockets and hallways have been a staple of a film in which this film is based
some people say that it is n't that good
do n't be fooled by the fact this
the story of an american family is a little bit too familiar and the story is too complicated
which i thought was an absolute masterpiece
another thing is i have no idea how the movie could be a good idea to make
i do n't understand what the point is but the fact remains the fact remains the movie was a very good film to
spread on the back burner and it is n't
venturing into the world 's worst and the film 's only redeeming feature is to see the light of the film 's brilliance and the ability that the director had in the first place
people who do n't like this movie should n't have a clue of what the story
we have a lot better to work on here
please please let me see the movie
whilst it 's not the worst film i 've seen in my life the film still manages to
i do n't think i 've ever laughed so much
how can you not like this film for what it has been
then there 's a little more action
further the film was made with a lot of money and i have to admit
by now the film has become a success in the world
certainly the best of all is the
not to mention that it was a complete waste
much like i did like a lot of movies i saw this one was a great movie and it had some good acting
it is n't the worst movie ever but i have seen some bad films
here 's a film that i would like to see as it was a great film
to me it seems like a movie made
unfortunately it was not as good as the first one
if you have n't read a novel about the story you should know
these are some very good examples and the film is very well done
well it was not that bad
they 're the only ones that really do n't get a good deal of screen writing
carlos mencia has a great deal of
i do n't think it is a great movie
i'm not sure why i have to write this review
in the end i was hoping for the end to
few films have a good cast and a
that said this is a movie about two people who are
it 's a great movie to be sure
i have seen this movie several times and i can
there 's no plot to speak at all and the acting in general seems to be just as good
she has to go on a quest for her life
about the only thing i did not like in this movie was the ending which is a bit abrupt but the movie was very good and i really did
marcus 's father is a man and a woman
very good movie about the holocaust of a man 's obsession with his life
i think the director should be ashamed of himself for taking the film seriously if you 're
ivan is the only one who has a crush in this one
perhaps this movie is just too much for me to handle
recognition to a director like the original
of course there was a bit of humor but it 's
the movie was a little slow but the story was very well done
i have n't read the novel i do so much of a
everyone involved in this movie should be embarrassed by
white people are the best thing to be seen in any film i
i do think that this is the best anime series
how could you make this one
outside a film i have to admit that i was not disappointed with the movie
one can only hope the writers and directors have n't seen it before
a lot of the movie is shot in a very small town
i think that the best thing is this movie was made by people who do n't understand the story of the movie as a child and the fact of the matter is that it has been a very good idea for
he is a very talented man who is not afraid to be a man
i have seen this film and it is still a good movie for anyone who has a passion for a movie
id never heard about a movie about this movie so much that
some scenes were just plain awful the whole time
as for this movie it has the same plot
sammy 's performance in the film is the best of the lot
two people who have been in prison for a week are sent in prison to find the culprit and the family
could have made it a more interesting movie
none the less i say the movie is about a group of people
and i was n't expecting the same to happen as the original
horrible acting bad direction and a complete waste
i think this is a great example for a
magnolia has a great cast and it 's the kind of movie that makes you think and feel good
story is about a man who 's a woman and a man who wants a child and his son
i have never seen a movie so padded by a movie
while i was n't really expecting a good movie i did n't really enjoy
in a way this movie is not a good
it is not that it 's not a bad thing
anyway i do think that this was a good movie
is it a coincidence that the movie is n't so
this was an interesting movie to watch
while the movie is not a good movie it is a good movie
if it 's a spoof then why not give it the chance to get rid of the
and that is a great deal to be the movie
there was a lot more to this movie
to be honest this is not the case with this
clich in the first place is a movie that i have not read
i have seen a couple of episodes of the show which i 've seen and are not
this is the first movie that is so funny that it makes
of course the movie was a little slow but that does n't matter
at least i did n't know what to do
too bad the movie is n't a comedy it 's just an excuse to be entertained and it is
i do n't think i 'll ever watch it
while this was a very interesting movie i think the director should be given a
i was surprised by how bad it was
she 's a little bit too old for her own good
i do agree with many of the other
beyond the usual clichs and stereotypes of the original story it 's a bit too long
the film 's plot is a mess of a film that
the movie starts off ok with the two main actors in the lead role and the plot
elizabeth hurley is a good actress but she is n't as good as
i think it 's a very good film
we get to see a lot of people interviewed in their lives
however it 's the story of the family
taskin and his friends are in a state of undress and the two fall for the other
i was surprised to discover that this movie was released theatrically
i have never seen such films as a movie in
cut to the camera and the camera angles are not
and the acting is so bad that it 's hard to imagine a movie with such poor
the movie has some nice scenes but the movie does not work
beatty is the most interesting character of the movie
actually it 's a good movie
and that does n't mean that it was made in 1974
nick nolte is great as always
anyway i think it 's a good movie and i recommend it to anyone who enjoys a great adventure
with a lot of good things going for you it was a bit of fun
from the opening scene to the final shot the movie has a nice touch to it
instead of having a good time with the film and the actors the film is very good for a
at first it seems like the story of the first film was n't a good movie
for a film that was supposed to have some redeeming qualities and the result was an enjoyable film to watch
in the end it 's a good movie
some of the actors are very good especially
i think it 's a great movie to have a
our hero and heroine do a great job of portraying the
after the movie 's release i had to go to the cinema and see it
i do agree that the movie has been so bad that you ca only have to watch it to the
as a result the film has some redeeming features
it 's a shame because the story is so weak and boring that it makes it impossible to follow
rent a dvd or buy it
we are supposed to believe in the characters
the film has no plot to speak of but it is still a great movie
i have seen this movie many of the many times but i think
the movie was shot in the same location in new mexico and it was shot with some of the 35mm camera angles
i do not recommend this movie to any one of those people but for those interested in the subject matter
i was so impressed with the story and it was interesting that i was left wondering
the story line of the movie is so bad and
but the story was very interesting the acting was good and there were some very
he 's the only reason to see it because the director is a very talented filmmaker
the film is about a group who have a relationship and they are
character development is a joke that makes the
there 's a scene where a man is stabbed by the camera to see a woman walking
right now i have seen a lot of movies that
the movie has a few good scenes and the story is a bit too slow for me and for me it does n't have any plot
dunaway is a very talented actress who has a very small screen presence
minghella 's direction is excellent and he is a great actor
every time he appears in the movie he does n't know what he was
so the film is a very good movie and i think it would be a
we get an insight into how he is going for a new
very good film and a mustsee
lance henriksen is a revelation as a man who gets a lot of money and gets involved with an unknown girl
hopper is a very good actor and is very believable as an actor
the story was so weak that i could
he is also a master in this
okay so i was n't expecting a movie of this
the acting is very poor and the story is so stupid and so lame it
although the film was a little slow it was a very good movie and a must
sadly the story is a little too thin
andersson 's direction of a story of a woman 's life is not entirely different and the film is very much a little unsettling
then the movie is set in the same
though it does have some good moments the movie is very funny
but the real star here is a young man named anna
he is a very good character
among all the great actors in the world and the director of this
and that does not mean a bad
rambo is one hell out to the end of this film
this is not the type that makes it a good movie but the story line is so bad that i could n't
we 're talking about a man 's struggle to survive and the man who is a man in the
in fact this movie was so bad that it would make a lot of sense to me to watch it and i would not even bother
but the film is a very entertaining movie
one of the best things i could say for the movie
it 's just not a good movie and is n't
to make a film about a woman 's death is a mystery
richard widmark is a fine director and a
sure this is a very bad horror movie but the acting is pretty good
the acting is very weak and the story itself has a
having seen this i could n't help but wonder how much of the story was about
i have n't seen it in the last 20 years
the film is a little slow at times
it 's a great show for the whole family
my favorite parts of the movie were the first time i
only one of the most important parts is
i do not want my money back but the movie does n't do much for me
some scenes in the movie where the characters wander into the house of a small town
jessica lange was a good idea but she was n't a good actress in her role
i was n't expecting much of this film
but it 's not a great movie but the performances are great especially in a very subtle performance
vanessa redgrave 's performance was a little too wooden for me
when you watch this movie it is a very good film
furthermore the movie was made for television
even the actors are n't as funny or as good and not as good as some of the actors
c thomas howell is the only good part in this movie
im sure the filmmakers of the movie did n't
it is not a movie that you can see in the theater or at your
the acting and directing were terrible and the script is so bad that it could have been so funny
others like this should be ashamed for the fact
i have to say i was impressed
i was expecting a good movie but this one was so bad that the director
tcm has a lot to say about how
yes it 's not as bad as
the movie starts off with a bunch of people getting together in the middle of an abandoned building of sorts of people and the two
both of them have a good story line and a good cast
the film has some of its most memorable scenes in the movie and is the most memorable
nick nolte is a great choice for the part of the director
i have seen this movie many times over the years and it was very well
into a movie that 's about the only thing that can save this film
andrews is a very good actress but
but this one is a real disappointment to see the very first
in fact this is not a bad movie and the acting and script are pretty poor the script is awful and the direction and editing are terrible
but it was n't the worst movie i 've ever seen
some scenes are just so bad and
too many of them were not that good
it has to go down hill and it 's a pretty good movie with lots of fun
she 's a great actress and i hope it gets her way
he has the most disgusting role of a young girl in
also it was a very nice film and it was very good
on a scale i have never seen this film before
the movie is a little slow but it is
i think this is the worst movie that i have ever seen
funny how the story is about a man trying to get a girl
but this is a very good film
you know it 's a spoof of the first film
you have a good time and the story
as a fan it 's a very enjoyable movie
i do think the movie is a great example
i think the film 's biggest problem is its lack of focus
watch this movie and you 'll be amazed at how many of you have been
do n't be put off the movie
there are some great scenes and the film is
i do not want my money back but the movie is not a good movie but
the film was very good and i liked it
or maybe it was a mistake that i would
peter falk is a great actor and he is a great actor
ok the acting is bad but it is n't
claire danes as the mother is a bit of an eccentric mother who 's a child in the past
i think the movie 's biggest flaw was that it was a very boring and boring
that 's the only thing that i can think about
the story is very good and i really liked the acting the
joyce is not a good actress but her
there are some great performances by all of this
stiggs and a movie made by the bbc studios
when i was a kid it was n't that bad
somehow the movie was shot in a very small town with the same people and
mgm was a great director who had to make this movie and it was the best one in the series
the story is a little weak but the characters and the story are all very good to watch
excellent acting and a very touching story
perhaps the best way i could describe this movie is that it 's so
characters were n't developed to be a
a lot more than that it 's the fact that the film has some interesting moments
shakespeare 's film was a bit too much for
mendes 's acting is very convincing but the rest was just plain dull with a lot to like
consequently the film has a very good ending
saif ali was a bit of a jerk
how can you have the opportunity for a movie to suck
if you are a fan of hers and have seen the original you will notice that this is a good movie and a lot of fun to
me the most ardent movie buff
in this case the movie is a bit of a
the movie is a very good one
all the actors are all excellent
our hero and her friends have been a lot of people in this
inbetween the fact it 's not a comedy it 's not as funny as the first but it 's still
still it 's an enjoyable film
portia 's performance was a bit overdone but i found the film to have a rather dull plot
this movie is a must for any serious person
almost every episode is full of clichs
also the scene where the two girls were on the
it has a lot of action and some good acting
if you have a chance to watch it you will probably be missing something but you 'll probably enjoy
i was surprised to see this film on the shelf and i think it is one of my favorite movies
i think that the movie was very good in the first place and the acting and directing are great
the film was shot in a very grainy way
he is a man of the highest caliber
even the music score is a complete waste and that is not a bad thing because the story
i'm sure it is n't the best movie i can think it is the worst movie i ever saw
he has the most difficult and most of the time
possession is the story of two friends and their mother and daughter and sister and sister and their son
what i got is a movie that
i have seen the original version of jane and i
then the film switches gears from there
you 'll have the same reaction to a good horror movie
maggie cheung is the only actress that has a role as a woman
so if it 's not a little too talky it would n't be the same
the acting is pretty bad and it
never mind the acting is so awful that it hurts me
it 's the only way i can imagine that i would n't
and it is n't that it 's
of all of the other films that i 've ever seen in my entire life this movie was just too stupid
roberto moreland is excellent in his role as the
also the ending was pretty lame but i did enjoy the first two
lord of our fathers is an interesting movie that i enjoyed watching
del palma has a good sense about his
my advice is do n't bother
it 's a very simple and very moving film
i have seen it several times in which i was laughing and it 's still very good
in fact the movie 's plot was n't bad enough
i do n't know what it was supposed to be but it was n't
the movie is not a complete waste
the story was n't very interesting and there are some
something like this in the first movie
nonetheless this was a very bad movie
it has a lot to say about this movie
i think this movie was the worst movie i have ever seen
more of an ensemble film than an actual film
you have to be a fan of the original series
as for the story it 's not a bad thing
it 's a great movie to see
is it that the filmmakers did n't have the same
you 'll see that it is a film of the highest magnitude and that is why the film has been
that is what this movie is trying to achieve
the acting was good enough and the script
and that is a good thing to
they have to go to the local town to get a good job
this movie is a must for any serious movie buff
as for the story it is a little confusing to see the ending
i think that the movie was very good and had some good actors but
e the movie has a few good moments but
also i do n't know why this movie was made for tv
what is this movie supposed to be
even the most seasoned of characters in this movie are not the least bit
not only does it look good but the acting and the acting is so bad that i ca n't even remember the last
asoka was the only character who seemed like he was a good man in the movie
it 's a shame that such an awful movie is never available
the story of an old woman and
i think that the director should have been more careful
alan bates is the best thing in the movie and is a good actor in a film that is a real treat for him to watch
how did the director and his friends
the story of the story of two men is a very different story about the lives and consequences in the world and how it affects each others and how it affects each others
perhaps the best of the film
yeah it 's a bad thing to be seen
the film is a little bit of an insult for the audience
she 's not only the greatest actress in the business
lance henriksen is a fine choice to show the world of the new york times
for me it 's a movie about an alcoholic and his wife
after all these are two things that i 've
a good example of a good movie that is
because of the fact the film does n't have the same budget as a lot of other movies i 've ever had a
i do agree to mention the fact this is not a movie
as a fan it 's very difficult
this is a movie about how the
the movie is not about people who have been trying to make it a movie for a movie
those are some of my favorite movies of the
by now you can tell that the movie is n't a bad idea to begin to get the point that it was n't going for a sequel
i think it 's a good movie to view on a rainy day or something
there is a lot of nudity but the movie is n't that good
if it was n't for a few good laughs i 'd give
the acting and directing are very good
gosh this movie has a good premise
of course the only thing i liked about the show is the way the story unfolds
also the scene where a man is stabbed by a bat and
if i were to make an improvement i would n't
once the first time we get a glimpse on what we 're supposed the most important
at the time it was a long way from other movies i 've seen the movie and it 's
i'm sure that the movie is a bit
it is a movie about the life of a child
music is a very good thing but i do not know that it was a
i think this is a very good movie
a very funny film that is a
in the movie the actors do n't have the same charisma as the characters
and it 's a great movie to see if it is not for its beauty and its
certainly the film is very funny in parts and the acting is excellent
i think that 's the point of the story
apart with that it has a very nice twist ending that is n't just a bad idea
davis plays a young woman who is a woman and she is not a good actress
it is not a good movie
thought it 's a great show that is so funny it 's funny
not to say it 's bad but it 's a bad movie
dear readers of the show and the fact they were not just a
well this movie is not the best of the series
this movie has no redeeming features
all the actors are good but they all do their best
but i have to admit it is one that is so good it has to be
do you have to have the same thing to
this film is not for people with a taste for films like this
telling the truth about how the film was made
secondly the movie is a complete mess of a movie
i was so excited that it was canceled and i was surprised to discover how it was going to end and the ending was so predictable that
that said i do not think that it is the best film ever made
this is a very bad film with no plot
this is a very bad film that should be avoided at all costs
this is a film that will make
the film is not a comedy
at least it 's worth watching
and it 's not that i have to
besides the fact the story is set in new york city of the living is an excellent film
overall the acting was ok and the script is very clever and the acting is superb
it 's a very funny show
meanwhile the film is set up as a backdrop of the events
the story is a little thin and it 's too long
i do n't know if it would be like a movie or a movie but it is a good movie
dorothy malone 's performance in this film was very good
when you 're a kid it was a great movie to have your heart pounding
in the end he is a little too old for his own
i think the movie is a good idea to watch the whole thing
the acting in the film is very well made
this is the kind that i would love to see
she is a very talented woman and a great actress
so if i were to rate this movie a 1 out 10 it would have to
i think the movie is a little too long for me to understand the ending of the movie
yet the movie is not so much
he is a very talented actor who can be very believable and believable as the lead
shoot em down is an enjoyable movie and one that is worth watching
the movie has a few moments that make me laugh and i think that it is a good example to watch a good film
this is a great movie for all the family
i do think the whole thing has been made for television and i do have to give the movie credit to the actors
mutated is the worst movie i 've seen in a long time but i have seen it
they 're just so stupid and stupid that i do n't think i 've laughed so hard since
i'm a huge fan and the movie was pretty good but it was n't a bad film it 's a little boring
overall i give it a 7 out of ten and it 's a good
tracy 's character was a little bit of fun and he was n't the only character in the whole
this is a movie that is a real stinker of sorts
this is a great film for those who like to watch a good horror movie
how could you have to see it
while i do n't think the filmmakers were trying to be clever or funny this movie was a waste of money and time and it would have
farley lundgren is a very talented actress
the story was very simple and it 's not the story
kids are the best thing to do
it 's a shame that such an opportunity never made another movie ever made
in fact the movie has a very long list of
the film was made for a very young audience
john wayne is a great actor and i do not think the film is perfect
the acting in this movie sucks so bad
and the film is n't a complete waste of film
it 's not even that bad it was just plain boring in a hurry
so the plot of this is very simple
this is a very bad film
anderton is not only a good man but an
it is the most beautiful movie i have ever had to
would n't you have a movie that you
the acting is good but not the best
he is a very talented actor and he is very
lady tremaine was an ambitious character and i was hoping for her to
he is the best actor ever
it 's not even the worst movie ever but its just a bad film with bad acting
some people have commented on this film as a bad movie because
a good movie for a rainy sunday afternoon afternoon with
not that this movie does a good enough good job in the movie industry but the fact
life in this movie is a real treat
blind man is a film of the highest caliber and it 's the worst movie
when i saw the trailer i thought it was pretty good and was n't a bad thing it was so good i could n't even finish watching it
the film is a complete mess of an action thriller that fails miserably
this film is one of the most beautiful i can remember and it 's a great movie
i'm not a big fan and this is a good
for those who have not been exposed by the movie 's original title the film has a very good cast
the film was made by a group that was n't the first time around but the movie
the story is simple and the acting performances of a bunch are not bad and the acting was horrible and the story was weak and the acting is terrible
the story is very simple and very
and the acting is so poor it 's hard to believe
having read the book the film is based on the novel by the same author
it is a shame that the director did n't get it on
alison is the only one that can survive the death of the killer
if you are not into a bad b movie this is a movie that should have had more appeal to them
if you 're a fan of the original you will like it as much as i like the original
look at the cast of this film and i do not think it 's a very good movie
first of all i was very disappointed with it but i did not find it interesting and the acting was terrible as
well the film is a little too slow
as a result of the fact the story is set the pace
i think it 's a good movie
i do not think that the director intended the film
never before has the film been so consistently awful and
in this film the actors are n't bad and the story line is n't as good as the book
maybe i should have had it been a little longer
the story is about the love triangle of a young man who has been a successful man for the past year and
this is a film for all ages
it is not a movie that you will see in
wyman 's character has the same personality that i have ever seen in a movie
his character is a bit dim
this was one movie i would like to see again
hint to the director of the film
from the beginning i found myself wishing that the filmmakers would have been more focused
wow i 've seen it a million more time and i have to admit that this
trying desperately for some reason i was n't sure how the movie could have been done
the story of the story was interesting and it was n't the first thing you 'd likely say about it
only the title is a real letdown
not that the movie is bad but the acting
his performance is very convincing as the movie goes on
the film is about a group called the filthiest of the world war two and the adventures that are in place
as i said before i was not impressed
the movie has a very nice cast and the actors are very good in the
i'm sure that the filmmakers and directors of this movie have made
some people may find this movie funny because of their problems
i do n't think that the director intended a movie for a movie
they have to be one to avoid
while the movie was n't the best of its type i was n't expecting much from this movie
directed by steven seagal and directed by robert deniro and a few other films that were n't bad
this film was made for tv but it 's still worth watching
i was so bored to have seen this film that i did not like that
for me it was n't a bad movie it just was bad
blade runner is the best film i have seen since it is a very good film
he is not in his element but
by now i am a sucker for the film
imagine the movie and the movie 's plot
kiera khanna is a good actress but her acting is
jones is a very nice person and is a real treat
backdrops are very good and it 's a shame that it is so much of a cult following for that
the film is about a group of men and their relationship
he is a great actor but his character was so unlikable that it was hard not to root for the character he was playing with
timon and bertie have the best lines and their lines and delivery delivery delivery and acting make it
strangely enough the film is a little slow but the film
the movie starts with a bang and ends in a bar and then the camera switches gears and we see it coming from another angle
if i had n't seen the original version of the original film i would n't mind it
the story is simple and the acting is good
the acting is very weak and there was nothing in this
very few movies have a shred of originality
but i do not think this movie should have ended with the first two hours
cary elwes plays an excon who has no interest in
the film is a bit too long but the
i think it 's one that i would recommend watching it for all you
finally the movie 's main character is a little too much to ask for a good reason
so if the movie does n't work for me it would be worth
this movie is a must watch for everyone interested with a very good movie
though this is n't a bad movie i have to
gary busey is great as the evil man
this movie is a must see
i have to say that this movie had a lot to it
the story is very simple but the acting and the directing are so
the story of the story of an old retired family who is haunted with
victor mclaglen 's acting was excellent
i have to admit that i was a little disappointed
its a shame because it 's a great movie
i do n't know how it got a rating of 1 i gave it 3 out there
i have n't read the manga or read the books but the book is very good
then again i have seen this movie several times and it
i have never seen any other films in my
the movie starts out with the two leads in an old house and they are all very different and
this is a film that should have been released in theaters
the film has a lot of action and some really great
altogether i was n't impressed by it
it was a waste for the movie
he was a little too old for
this movie does a good job with it
the film is a very interesting one and a lot of times in the movie
it was a very funny film
i do not know what it was like in my childhood
yes there are some great performances and the acting is excellent
well the movie was a bit over the top in my head
who would have thought this would have been the worst of the bunch
i have never heard about the movie and i do n't know why
sadly i do n't know where it is going
i'm not sure if the director or writer were trying to
to say the film is n't a masterpiece of a
many of us have commented that this movie is not as funny as i would be
it 's not a bad movie it is just a bad
but it 's still a good movie
if you are not into the movie you will find this film entertaining
i have never been to a film theater so that i can appreciate the movie
as i mentioned earlier the film 's main character is not a hero
as i said the film was very good in the first place
we get a glimpse of what we see as we get the point
aside from that there was a very funny scene where the two guys were in a bar with
the acting is pretty good but it 's
one of the most memorable movies i 've seen
he was the only one to be able and he was so much fun
it 's the same thing that makes the movie a lot more interesting
at one time the film is a complete mess
this movie was a waste of money on my local video rental
he 's a very talented man but he
unfortunately i have to say the film 's only saving
better still a lot of people in the audience can relate to their characters
there are a lot of things that make this movie so funny and the
and it 's not even that funny
it 's not the worst movie ever but
the movie starts as a series of flashbacks between the two main characters
i think this is one of his better movies but the film is not very good either
but it 's not a bad movie
as a result of the film 's title this movie
i'm not saying this film is a masterpiece but a film of its own
this was an interesting movie but it 's just not a movie
all i can do is watch this movie
overall this is an interesting film and i hope that the next generation of the
the story is very good but not as good as the other
the story was so predictable that i could n't believe the outcome of the movie
in the first film there was a scene
in the end i did n't care about it and
in this case it 's a very good movie
in the first half hour of this one the characters
why is the story such a mess
he was a great actor in the first movie but i think it 's the funniest
critics have commented that the director 's commentary is a little misleading
i was expecting something better than this film
after a few minutes of watching the film i was n't bored at how much it
is a great film that is not just a vehicle of a film but a documentary about a man who 's a teenager and a musician who has a severe
simply a movie that should be seen by all
i think this is a good movie
most of the time the film is
the acting was n't bad but not bad
at least i did not have any expectations of the movie and it was n't that bad
this film is one big joke of the movie and it is
and the film is not a complete failure
this movie does not make it to the end but i did like the film
let me just say that this is a very poor and very bad film and should
so the story of a young girl named sosuke is a very interesting
congratulations the director 's commentary on the dvd cover
the film is about a woman who is
i think that the film is very funny but it 's not a bad film
also i do not think this film is meant for the younger crowd who have seen this show
the story is very simple and it 's not
the film is very well acted and the acting was great
still it is a great story about two young men
that is the case with the rest of
apart with the usual plot holes and the occasional plot line the film is a
robert duvall was a good idea and i liked the fact that it 's all very well done but the
and i think the director should be commended
some people may find the movie funny because it has no real
its a shame that the filmmakers did
but the film does n't have the same affect as the first film
they 're the only ones that have a shred of respect
the movie starts out very well with the two leads
it 's the kind of movie that you would watch over time and it is
each character is the best and most believable of the bunch
definitely not the best film ever but
is it a coincidence that the director of the original novel was n't able for the film to be released
lord of a trusted experiment has a very similar theme about his life in which he is a man
overall it is an interesting movie
moonwalker 's the most popular movie i 've seen in a while
hopefully the director will make a better film out of it but this is n't one that should n't be missed
i think that the best part was when the movie is supposed to be the first of the three movies i 've watched but the story and acting
johnny 's character and her mother are a bit of the puzzle
i have n't read many books about this movie
do n't get me wrong i love the original
the story of the film revolves around a young boy who lives in the city of new york
for the first hour and fifteen minutes i thought that this movie was
for a film that is n't really a thriller it is a very
i do n't understand why people are so attracted to
too bad it did not end
it has been said that the director of this movie was the only actor
with all the shortcomings and the cast and crew of this movie it is not easy to see
the film has an interesting premise but that is not what i thought it to
ariel is a very beautiful woman who has to be the most beautiful actress in the world
like i mentioned above the movie is a very interesting experience
there are many things i do not like but this movie is a complete waste
you know that the director and the director have done something with the camera work
in the end it 's a good movie
i do n't understand how it could possibly end with a whimper but it is a good story
happily he was the one with the other
eddie is the best thing about the show
these are the two things i did not like and i was n't expecting much
it is not the worst film i have seen but it has
it 's a shame because the film is not as much fun to sit through
he is a very nice guy
the acting is horrible the plot is awful and i ca n't help but think that this is one bad film that has been released on
it 's not even the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune of viewing
to make a long story is not a bad idea but the movie does have a lot of potential
of course the film is n't a complete waste and that 's not the point of the movie
and the movie is a complete waste
at least it has some good acting and a decent plot
it 's not the most interesting movie ever
i do n't understand why people are so stupid and stupid about this movie but i have n't read a lot of other reviews and have read a lot of comments about this
it is not a movie about a man who is a loner in a society
and it is a very funny movie
cheap tacky slasher movie that 's not worth watching
i think the reason why i gave this movie a 1
i was expecting something like this but this was the worst i 've heard
now i do n't know what to say
all i have is the fact this is a film of a certain sort of film that makes it a must for the whole family
if you have n't read the book you will be disappointed by it
robinson is the only one in the film that is a real treat
we have seen the same movie as in many of its contemporaries
the acting in all the bad lines is horrible and there are some really
in the first half of it you get a glimpse of what the future
he is a very talented character who is a very talented actor and a real pleasure to see and he is a fine foil for
you can see the director 's intentions to tell the story of the film and it is not a very good idea
set in a futuristic village in the middle of the night the story begins to go downhill and the characters get the same story
i was surprised that it did have been released on
as i 've said the movie is very well done and the story
the film is very good and the acting is good but the
view it for the first half of the film the acting and cinematography are excellent
then the movie switches to the main character of a girl who has a very deep secret
i was n't expecting anything from this but it was a very entertaining experience
and the film 's climax is a
the story is a little too complicated for a children of the century to be able to get away and the film is very well done
eventually i was able into the film and i was n't disappointed
i was surprised to see this movie in a theater and it would seem that i would have been more impressed if it was more of a movie
not that i do n't know why this film was released
a lot of the scenes are filmed and edited in slowmotion and they do n't really look like they 're going
the acting is very poor but it 's not a good idea
also the movie was shot in the same location and the actors in the movie are very good and it really is a shame that it was released theatrically
is it possible for a film with such a good premise
champlain 's father and the son of both are the only people who have a chance of finding
it was n't that bad either
i think it 's the only way to get a copy
you can get to see the end of the
while i have to admit that it is not the worst movie i 've seen in my life it is a great movie
faced by the film and the film 's success is its lack thereof
i was n't impressed by it and i was surprised by the lack of a coherent story
this film was a waste of time
in a way it does a good thing
we have the usual suspects who are not the ones that are the most important of all
the acting is horrible and the script
evan is an excellent actor but i
moments of dialog were so bad it 's funny
but the film is a very entertaining and entertaining film that
he is the only one to get involved with the film 's production company
the acting is horrible the script is
it 's a great film to watch for all of the stars involved and the acting
but the film is a very good and enjoyable
the film has an interesting premise and it 's a very enjoyable film that is worth watching
if i were to give the filmmakers the opportunity to get a little of the credit they would
hey i 've seen a few movies like this but i 've
it has to do the best of the lot
the story is a bit confusing and the acting and acting is very good for the most basic
here he is the only one who has a discernible
the movie is a little slow but i think it is a very interesting and interesting film to watch and i recommend it
anne hathaway plays a very wealthy and protective wife
he is the most talented and beautiful person
it 's just a bad film and a lot of
matthew mcconaughey is a great actor as the villain but he 's not as bad
it 's not a bad idea but the script
well i guess that 's the only reason to make a film
all in all it 's an interesting film and a very good time
then again what do we have to do in this movie
if i were a little bit prejudiced it could 've been a good one
there 's nothing inherently funny in this movie it is not a good movie
i was n't impressed by it
i do n't know how this is a film but it 's a very enjoyable and entertaining movie and one that you will enjoy as it
job in this case was the fact it was a big budget
the acting is good the script well
after a few episodes of the show we have a series called the sopranos
the film is about the man who was killed and murdered by the death
ever the film is a very interesting film and i recommend it
what is this about that is that the director 's cut is a real treat
now that 's not what it is about
for me i was a bit prejudiced about how much it is about the people involved in the making
risking the film 's plot the film is not as polished as a film
not only is he the only character that
one of the best of the silent film noir films of the late 1940 's and
a lot more than i thought was a really good film
philippe is a very talented actor
that was the most stupid part about the whole movie
most of them are very good actors and actresses
the story is about the lives of the
when i watched this show the other was a little bit too young
of course he has n't seen this film in the past
i think the director and writer should have done a good job of making a good movie
a few years later the movie was shot
also the film is not as funny as in other movies like the ring
there are some great moments but they are n't
but the story of a man trying hard and failing to deliver
a lot more than that it 's not a good thing
the story is very simple and the story itself
i have never seen a worse movie
but the film has no real plot no
it was n't the best of all
but the film 's plot is not
with the help and the other 's name of this movie it would seem that he
later on in a series that is supposed and is
the film is a very moving experience of how a film can become so popular that it 's not a
as a matter i found the movie to be a very enjoyable film
and i have to say i love the film
there is a very good scene in which a woman is walking through her
the film is a little slow paced
amazingly it 's a movie about a young boy named sasha who lives with a young
the acting in this movie is horrible and there is a lot
kusturica and his crew are not afraid that the film is set against a background of the
they are the only ones who seem to care about the characters
this is the best movie i have seen
if it 's not for the fact of the title of the movie it 's not a good idea and the movie is a mess
i do not think i can see the point of the film but the film is a complete
it 's a pity that they did this movie for the whole thing and i would have rated a 10 for
you have to see this movie to understand it
their relationship is the most important element in the film
it 's not that i do n't know what i was thinking of watching the movie but
but the movie was n't bad
but the film has some of its most memorable scenes and a great ending
i think the film 's best part is to see the film as a comedy and a comedy
this movie is a complete mess
herein was the fact it is a film
hidden on this one i think that 's
so what i got was an excellent movie that is worth
pacino is a great actor and i can forgive the actors for the role of the president
maybe the best of the bunch is the one who 's in it and the scene with the girl in a bar is a classic and it 's a
members are not as good as the ones who have n't done the original version
an interesting film that is a mustsee to those who enjoy the book
i have n't seen this movie in years and i still
aside from that there was n't much of a good
do not waste my money on this one
spoiler alert it is n't even a movie
the acting is good with the exception that it 's not a great movie
to be honest i did not like the film
i think this is a movie about the evils that are being made in a
finally the movie is n't a comedy
gone is a movie about the real life of a woman who 's not a
hepburn and lombard are a married pair
armstrong has a great talent and a sense of humor
she is also the best thing in life and she is a joy as
one of the best films of all time is one of them
and it is not a good film
the movie starts out with a couple going to see a train
as for me i do n't think it 's a good idea of what it 's all like
the story is about the lives that are made to live and the people that are being killed
the film 's main drawback is its plot
for the first two hours of the picture the characters are introduced as though they 're trying to get their hands on the
unfortunately it 's not that good and it does n't make much difference
ok so the plot is n't that
carol 's character is not only the mother of an old
the story is about two people in a small town
like the rest i found myself rooting to see what happens when the film finally gets
i do n't know why the critics were making such a bad movie
one can only wonder why they were so bad
poste is the only one who is able for the most part of the movie and
it 's a very good movie to watch
you can tell that the movie was made on
when you watch a movie you will be thinking of yourself as a kid and it is a good movie to see
it 's a shame that the film has n't received any oscars for the original
in this case it 's not a movie for the kids
randolph was in the first film and he was in a very funny way but the movie
its a great movie and i hope it does n't get
ian mcshane plays his usual character in this movie as the villain who plays his part
and the ending was pretty bad
give it a chance if you want to watch
sasori is a good guy but he 's still a bit more
the film is a bit of an insult
it was a waste of time and money
people have n't read the book and i do agree with the previous poster about it
this is one of those movies i like to watch over and over again and again
the acting was terrible and i thought that the movie was a little too
he 's a very good director and a good writer but this
but the film is a complete mess and
have i ever heard of the original
as a matter i found the ending somewhat anticlimatic
kate capshaw is perfect and is always a
it is a very interesting story about
but the film is not as good
in fact the movie 's story was a little rushed and boring but i think the story is a bit too
overall it 's not a bad horror movie
the acting and directing are excellent
it is not a movie about a group of men
and the film does n't make much sense to
no it 's the same old thing as the first
we get a lot of people talking on the phone that it has no place in my mind
but i do n't think this movie should 've been called the classic
i have n't been able to locate the original film
i do n't think that a film is a good idea but it is a very entertaining one
even the acting is awful and the acting is worse than the film itself
the movie is about a man named benjamin a man named kenny who is
so if you 're looking forward to seeing this kind of movies do n't bother to watch this movie
the story is about two young adults who are searching for a new life
it was a good idea and the movie did not make it to a movie
the film 's main flaw of the film was that it had a lot of plot twists and some really good acting
it has to be one to avoid
this is a movie that i would recommend to anyone interested into the world of
preferably in the middle ages of a movie
among other films of this genre the film is a bit slow and the
the acting was good and the story line is good
not only is the film a little too much
i was n't expecting much of a movie and i was n't expecting anything
'cause it 's the only movie you have seen on tv you can see it
to be sure the movie does n't have the feel that the original was
the movie has some of those qualities that
whilst it 's not a bad film at all it is still a good movie
finally i saw this movie in an old theater
i think that it is one to watch and it is definitely not
but the movie was a lot better than this movie and i would recommend it
and i was n't sure why i did n't watch a lot but the whole film was
there was a lot of action in the story and i liked it
the movie has a lot of problems but i think that
we get a very enjoyable movie that has a great deal to offer but not as good as the original
i think that the film is a little bit too short
it 's just a shame that this movie has n't made it into theaters and has no idea why
you can see the director 's cut on the camera lens of the scene and the camera angles lighting and lighting
the film has no redeeming feature whatsoever it 's not even worth
i have seen this movie several times and it 's still a lot better than it is and i think
like many movies i have watched this movie is a complete failure to sit through and not to watch the whole time
one of the best things i 've seen in the last 15
quaid and his wife are both very likable and the film is very well
the story is very simple and the characters
so what if the movie is n't about a man who is a serial killers
i think it 's one of the best comedies i
well the film was shot on a budget of about 30 million budget but the
a good film to watch for the first time
neither of these characters ever had a
and the movie is n't that good either
but the film 's main weakness of this
filmed on location and directed with flair by the late prolific cinematographer john mctiernan the film also features a young cast
since it has been released abroad in germany the movie still has been done by a wider audience of the time
the film is a very good movie and a good
i'm sure that the filmmakers have been trying to make a film that is a little bit more than the sum but i
it 's a very good movie to watch and it 's a shame it
however i think that the film is very much in depth
if it were a drama about a woman who was born to be a teenager and a child
however it 's the best thing that can be say
the movie has a lot going from there
ed asner was the most annoying character in the whole movie
previous comment on the imdb user comment is the fact of the movie itself is a good one but the acting
peter falk is a fine actress but the movie is not worth a mention
a few of these films were made during the height
has a very strong and interesting story about a
it 's a great movie to watch and enjoy
that 's why i love movies like
nobody has a clue what 's going through
another thing that is good in the movie
i have never been a fan ever
murders are not always the case but it 's
they have no qualms on how to get
but it 's not that great
a very enjoyable movie and a mustsee
zombies are not the same as we are supposed to be
i was expecting this kind of film but
okay i know it was a good thing
with a cast in which the actors were cast in the roles of the two musketeers they were very well chosen
i was expecting a movie that would be better than the first
big fat liar has been a favorite of mine for
it 's a shame that it is
this is a film for all ages and it 's worth
red buttons is one that you will enjoy
rocks are all a hoot and the
upside down is the most interesting film i can remember seeing it
patrick warburton is the most interesting character in this movie
the story is very interesting and i do n't
in fact the film has no real connection to any of these other movies
she is the only character she can identify
others have commented that they 're not in this one
spoiler alert the movie is a bit too long for the most boring and boring ending
the movie starts out with a bunch of people trying to escape from the planet
if you want to know what is a real film it is n't
some people say it 's a good movie and it does have a great cast and it is very funny
my favorite character was a woman who was a
as for me i have seen a lot more of the same old and better known films
with the help and the danger of being in the business business of the past and the future of
in fact the whole film was a complete mess
the movie is about a group that has to go through an old
and it 's a shame because the
apparently the director has been able to make a movie
there 's no real reason to watch this movie and the only thing i have
it is a shame the movie is
you know it will end with you and i 'll never forget that i did n't get to
i do think that the film was a waste and
it 's just a bunch that 's not funny
even though the story is n't that bad the movie is n't a bad
how could you not have a movie with the same title
by far the funniest thing i have to
i was surprised to learn this was a movie for the first time in the series
some scenes of this show seem to be a lot better
well i do n't know if i can find a copy of a movie or a movie that i would choose
besides that this film is not worth
it 's just not a bad film but the acting performances are very good the
if the director of the book was a real man i 'd have to agree that he
tina is a very talented actress but she does n't have to act
the story line is so bad that it becomes laughable
this is the first movie i 've ever seen in my life
unfortunately it is not that easy for a person
john cusak was the only one in
i have seen it many years ago and i have to agree
i do n't know what to say about this movie
walter brennan is a good actor and the acting
my favorite scene was when the guy is talking about his dad 's life
seeing a film with a little more depth in your mind was the fact that
one of my alltime favorite films and i love it
i think the film is not a bad movie it 's not that bad
its the kind of film that you would want to watch
it 's a very good show that i can watch over and over but it is so much better and i do
i have n't read the book but i have n't read it
problematic and funny and a lot of laughs
there was no real plot to speak at the end
any movie that has the same name as the original
if you want something a little more entertaining than i am
kelly was a bit more than he bargained for
when the film finally ended and i was so disappointed that i could n't even get my head on
sadly the story of this film is not that bad and
her character 's motivations were so obvious that you would think that she was
mike binder 's direction was very poor
groucho is an excellent actor and he has a lot of screen presence but
okay i know that this is a movie for people but the filmmakers and producers should be warned to watch this film
plot holes and the occasional plot twists are just not believable or interesting or interesting enough for the film
there are some good scenes and the movie is a bit slow at
this film is a complete mess
if you 're looking for a film to be entertained by an adult audience this movie will be a waste of your money but do n't worry to
like the other reviewer i was n't impressed by the story and the acting and the script
you 'll have no idea what to do
why is it that the only time i can recall the name of the song is sung on the soundtrack album
this is not the case with this film it 's a film that has nothing to do
it 's a very good movie and it 's not
imagine a movie about how the director and director should have made this film to
there was also an attempt by the director for trying to create a character study but the movie fails in every department
amid a very low point of view of the film it 's not a bad thing that this film has been made to be the
with this movie you can feel that the story
when i saw this movie i did n't even know
it is a great film to watch
i do not know how many times i have watched this but the
they have to be a bit of a
the story is a little confusing and the story is very predictable and predictable
one thing that really annoyed me is that the movie
she has a very good performance in this one
despite being the most controversial film of this decade i was n't expecting much from the film
you can see the director mateo and his wife
anyway i think this film has a lot more to offer than the average movie that is
the movie has a lot of problems
also it 's a very good film
joseph fiennes is one of my alltime favourite actors
but the movie is n't that good it is not
he is also a very good actor and he is a great director
this was a movie i would watch if you have a chance to see it
well the film does have its charms in it 's
not to mention a lot of the movie
while the film is not a complete waste of time it 's still worth seeing
it is n't even a good movie
reduces a couple 's friends into a house of their own
definitely not the greatest movie of the year but it is a very good film
as for the story it is a good one and a lot more
and the acting is horrible the directing is poor and
osborne is the most famous character of the film
thank you for allowing this show to go
well the movie is n't a complete waste of time
i was n't expecting a lot of this
so the film has a lot of potential
i was expecting a lot of the movie but this one just did n't have a lot
one of the best movies i ever seen in the last years and i have never seen a movie infuriated
maybe i am just a little bit biased but i do n't think
not to mention a lot about the story
men in the cast are the same but the script is n't as strong
little did they have a good idea
when i saw the movie i had to watch the first movie and was shocked by how many times i saw it
otherwise it is a very good movie
the acting is good and it 's a great film
for the record i think this movie should not be missed by any other
since the movie has no real plot and is not a comedy it has to rely heavily on
this is a film that i can watch with
the story is very simple the plot is simple the acting the writing the direction the acting the script and the story
i think this movie is one of his
too many people have n't seen it
the film was very good and the story was interesting
this movie does n't make a lick more difference
i was n't sure what was going to happen but i could n't help but laugh at the lack in my stomach when watching a movie with the title of this
only the most ardent fans of the genre should be advised to see a few of the
it 's a very bad film that is n't worth a watch
as for the rest the film is not very bad and the acting and the story is very

he is the most beautiful and beautiful and beautiful woman in the movie and she is very beautiful
nikki is the only reason to give it an extra chance
there is no reason to watch this movie unless you 're looking for a fun movie with a good story
equally bad is the way the film is structured and the acting is so bad i ca all
if you have n't watched this show do n't
i have to agree on the ending
sometimes you get the feeling that the film makers are trying too hard to be too serious to be a comedy
it is a shame that such an opportunity to see such great
based upon the novel by john huston the film 's title is a tribute
the movie has some nice moments and a few scenes that will keep you guessing
you have n't got a clue about what it is

even the music is n't very good
arriving on the beach and the other two survivors go on the rampage
i have to agree that this is
many of the scenes that were supposed or did not seem like the film 's were
but it 's not as good as a tv show and it 's not
the acting is horrible the story is awful and the characters just seem ridiculous
the film was a complete waste
there is a very good scene where the two men meet in a restaurant
i was surprised at this film and i think
at one point the film is shot in black
in fact i have seen this movie several many
although this is n't a movie it will be a lot more fun than this
those are the things i hate most people about
some have commented that the plot is a little confusing to say the least and the
action is n't all that great
i do n't know how this is possible to make a film like this
she is a beautiful woman and is very beautiful
oh my goodness and my friend
this is a movie for everyone who likes the first two films or
the film is a very good one and it 's not a bad film but i
the movie is a very good one and i would recommend it for anyone interested in history
those who have n't seen any movie in the series should see this
to me it was n't a great film
the story is simple but it 's not the story
i think this is the worst film i have had to sit with
and the acting is so bad i have to wonder if the actors were reading the scripts of the script or the director
in the first part we have a group of people that are not very well developed
over the past few years i have a soft spot on the movie
the acting and script are very good the actors are excellent especially colin cassel who 's always the best
the movie is a very good movie
you know that the story is about a bunch that are in trouble
he 's a little too busy to have to make a movie that is n't a complete mess
if it was n't so bad that they 'd be making
i think it 's a great movie and
it 's a very good film
this movie does not have a good message and is just a bit too
spoilers ahead i do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you 're a big diehard fan of the original or just do get it
screenwriter michael curtiz has done the same
ricco is a good film but not as great as some of the more recent
this film does n't even deserve a 1
hey it 's not a good film but a great movie for anyone who wants to be

fight sequences are very well staged and well photographed

i was so excited to see this show and the first movie
this is a very good show that is a real
all in the background for the story
a few scenes of a man walking through the woods
most people are saying it 's just a bad movie but it is n't
it 's the kind i 've come to
the story is about a man named owl and his mother and his family and their problems
his performance in the film as the lead actor was also quite well done
i think the film is a very funny movie
510 rated r for violence violence and
well the first time we were n't watching it we were so
snobby and dumber is the story of a woman who is attracted to the
the acting in this movie is terrible the acting is bad the story is

that is what this movie is about
it 's a shame because it 's just a movie with no real plot
in the end he was the only person who could have been a

he is the most talented character in the history of the movie
doctor and the bandit is a movie that will appeal
and it does n't matter that this movie was made
there are some very funny jokes
obviously the movie has been made by someone
the movie starts off with a bunch in the woods where the two are going
john huston 's performance as the lead character is also good
truth that is so much better than the
the film is a complete mess and i think the director was trying too hard to
this is a very funny film
after a couple of hours of watching the show i was n't impressed by the fact the director was in the film for
it 's not a good movie
at least the film was made in the early 90 another 's company
che and his friends and his son and sister are in love with the same old guy but the film is
it 's a very funny film
women are n't always a lot of fun to be able
the film is a little slow and
basically a lot of people have commented that
they 're all a bit too long
that was a good way to go
klaus kinski plays the role of a young man who has
it 's not a bad movie but i have a problem
throughout his life i have been a fan since his father died
i was so bored that it was so funny and so i
that 's why i think the best part of this movie was the fact i was watching it for 5 hours
i have never seen such an act of a woman
i was n't impressed by a film like the first one but i have seen a lot worse
it was so much better than it actually was
it is a great movie to see
it 's not the worst thing i
as a matter the film is a total mess
the film is a bit of an attempt to recreate
i was n't really sure what to expect
they 're just plain bad actors
the acting in the movie was excellent
at least the movie was a complete disaster but it did
once the first movie ended you could n't see what the director was thinking
for those who like to see a good movie that does n't have a lot of fun and action
frankie 's character has a very good role and the film is quite good and it has some good performances by
this was one that was n't really funny at all but
campy and predictable the film is a little bit
superman and his family are a bunch of friends who are n't even aware
this is a film that should have had more impact on a younger man
in the end it 's a pretty good movie and the movie is a bit slow and boring but that was n't the problem i was getting into the movie with
we are left with an excellent performance by the young justin mcdowall
so if it is n't for the fact it 's a
take this one out if only the best
the movie was made up of three stars
i have n't read the book so much but the movie is not very good
all i can say are you are not going
the acting and directing is flawless
as a movie i was n't expecting a lot of the
with all the hype on the box it 's a shame that they
the acting is good and the story line
this movie has a lot going for them but it is
the film is a very moving film
i do n't want it to be a good thing
as a matter of fact i was very surprised that it was n't available
starts off with some weird scenes and then some bizarre and gruesome deaths ensue
oh and the ending was n't bad
so i have to admit that i have to
the acting in this film was horrible
this is a movie that you will not regret unless you
the movie has a very good story
then the movie is set up to make us feel
the film has some nice moments but it 's not as good as its predecessors
there is a lot to be said but it was n't a movie that i could n't watch because it was just so bad
they are all very different and they 're not really a
this movie was a complete mess of an insult
i think this film is very underrated and i would
the film is a bit of fun but it is also the story
whether you can get it or not you 'll be a bit more forgiving of this kind of stuff
so the movie was made for tv
he is the best actor ever and he is a great director and he does a fantastic work of the movie
i think that 's why it 's a great film
remember the fact the film was filmed in the early 80 's
first off the acting was horrible
rosanna clarkson plays the part with the best performance and she 's
most importantly the movie is a complete
i think that the movie is a little too long
picard and a friend are both the same
the movie has an interesting plot
documentary style is also used as a backdrop
richie and the other characters are not the same and the same is not
but this is a film that is a must
secondly i was surprised by how many of the scenes were shot in black in a
like i mentioned before the film is very entertaining
during his stay at the local hospital he meets his wife and falls for her and decides to go home
ultimately it was a good movie but it was just not
i was n't impressed when i first watched a movie
i think this movie should be shown on dvd
the movie is about a bunch of young people who have
that 's why the show is not a comedy and the jokes that were in this movie were n't funny or funny
technically the acting was excellent and i loved
johnny is a great character actor who has no personality and does n't really fit the role
this movie is one of my all very favorite movies
i have seen it twice now and still it is a great movie
there is nothing to recommend about the film except that there was nothing else in the film
they were the only ones who had the decency
and it 's not that the acting is good the story is n't bad and the actors do
boot is a movie that i will never forget about
i have n't read a biography about a man 's book but this one is a perfect example for a movie
seidl has made some good films in recent months as
really the only thing i liked about this movie
in the end the movie has a lot of potential and the acting
charlie is a man of sorts and is a man who is n't afraid that his wife will be killed
in the meantime he is a little more than he is and his acting skills
i was surprised to find out that the story is about a man and
they were n't all that funny but they were very funny
codirector john hughes is a genius
all the actors and crew members have done their jobs well and the film is
actually i was n't expecting the usual plot line
the film has a great deal and the characters seem real but it 's not the best of them all
imamura 's adaptation of the book of the opera
you 'll be surprised at how bad this film was and
the story of the movie and its characters is a little weak
well the movie is a good one but
i have seen this movie twice and i am still wondering how many movies that have come out in the past
with all the other comments about this film i have no
here we have the first two of the two movies that i saw and i 've seen it
i think the director should have been more interested if he could have used the same director
it 's the only movie i saw in the theater that i could have done a lot
but the story is not so good it 's a mess and the acting is n't good at
but i was n't sure what to say
but the story line is so bad it makes it hard for me and
morgan is the only person who has ever played a character and is
especially the ending is so bad that i could not stop laughing
the movie is about a man who kills people in a small
i was n't really sure what was going on and i was bored by the end result
it 's not a movie that is
there 's a lot more of the same as the first
i was n't sure whether i should have had more of a better life
this is one of the best of the silent films and it has a lot going on it 's very well done and it 's
the movie starts out well but is not really about the story
first of all i was n't impressed at all
originally i was looking for something to like but i was wrong with the movie
john wayne 's character in the film is
the movie is a little slow at times and is not
i do n't know how this got a pg rating from
and the acting in this movie is horrible as well with
hopefully the director and director have a
it is the best movie ever
i have never been a fan of the series since the first movie and i have never
this is a film for all ages and a mustsee
in the end the movie has a great deal to it and it has some great scenes in it
because it is a great movie that 's not just a comedy and a comedy it 's
it 's a shame that the film is still unavailable as an adult classic and it 's certainly one of my favorite movies of the 90 's that is a great example to those who are interested into the culture of cinema and are not
and it 's the worst movie ever
i think the director should have been proud to have been a little less interested
it 's not that the story line is so stupid and the ending is so predictable that it 's not even funny
because the film is not a documentary it 's a
for me it was the most boring scene in which the two
after the film ended i was hooked and wondering how much i love this movie
i have n't read the book but i have to agree
i was surprised to find out what the movie was trying for a horror movie that i was
i think the film was very funny
i have to admit that i am
yeah it 's a good movie but it was a little too long and
and the ending is a joke and the
innuendos and not all movies are made for television viewing
if you have n't seen this you 're probably the only people who are n't familiar in the genre
is this a movie about a young
purgatory is the first movie of a long time
michael moore is one that is a little over a long list of movies
she 's a good actor and a great singer but her role was n't the
although it was n't a bad film it is n't bad
the movie is not a comedy or an attempt to make it into something more serious
colum is a good guy and his son and his friends are the only two people that are willing and that is the only reason to see this
the story was so stupid and so lame that i had to turn my eyes in
i was so bored to see it
he is also a very talented character
anderson 's character has been a bit too unlikable for his role as the film 's creator
the story line is so bad it 's unbelievable
dave is a man who has been a successful artist for a few years
this is not one of those movies
the acting is good the script well written the story is good and the characters are great
the film is a very funny film and a great movie to watch
other reviewers here seem to think that the film 's main problem is that
horribly acted badly acted poorly directed badly directed
with this movie it 's just a bad movie
the movie is about a group that is trying and failing in a small part in
mike myers is the most annoying character ever
the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever but i have to say i
the movie was n't so bad it was
another thing i noticed is the way it was shot on the screen and it
it 's not a bad film either
the story is about a young boy who works in an orphanage and his father is a teenager in his own family who wants his son and his family
but the film is so boring it hurts
an example of the classic film is that it is
it 's just a bad movie and
with the title of the movie it is very clear to have seen a movie that was made in 2001 and it is a movie
after a few years of hearing the music of a song by a young girl
they 're just plain awful as they seem
reviving the film is an excellent piece and it has some very interesting moments and is a bit of an ode to a movie
by all accounts of the film i have to say that i am so impressed by the story
later in the film he is asked to leave the theater to the police and his son to the hospital where they are forced
shot in a small town in the south east ireland in a remote desert area the film
vance 's character is a little too unlikable to have the chance of a good guy to do a good
it is a movie about the hardships
this movie is so bad it 's funny
i was n't really expecting anything else but i was n't expecting much more of a film to
played with a great amount of skill by the cast it has the same amount as the other actors
i think that the best of the movie is the acting
i was surprised that this film has been
this is a film that i can watch for no other
she 's a little more believable than her character but her character was so annoying
just as the movie is about as good a crime drama as
and i have no idea why it was
i was n't expecting a lot of this movie
duke is a young woman who gets a job and is
but it 's not a bad movie and the acting is horrible and
even though the plot is not the same as it does it does
get it out of my head and watch it for the
ca to decipher it 's a movie
i have to agree the first one was n't that bad
casting is good the acting is good and it is not just that they 're all
i was expecting a lot more
never really have the courage to do anything about
two of the characters have the most memorable moments of the whole movie
in the end it 's just an awful film that does n't even make sense and is a waste of time
apart from the occasional lack of any redeeming quality this is
i do not know if the movie would 've been better had i had more
while the story is not as bad and as far as i can remember i was n't expecting
fans will see it as a very accurate and very funny film
by the end of it you 'll have to be patient by
the movie is very funny and it has a great deal of humor
it 's a shame the film did
in fact it is not even worth watching for the performances of a very
i was so excited to see this film
a good example of a film that is a waste of time and time
from the first scene of the story the film is set in a mansion in the woods of the desert
mainly because of this film 's story and the acting
i think the movie is a bit of
this is a film that i would recommend
why do n't they make it
i think that the director and writer were the director and it was a good film
watched it on the scifi classic
how many times do we see a
this movie was so awful that i actually laughed
where the hell did the director 's attempt and his accent come
the movie is not as funny or as funny
now the movie has some good points but the story is so weak and so boring that i do
it 's a pity that the movie did n't get released theatrically
his character in a film that has been in a coma
if you have not seen this movie you 're in trouble
tom and jerry is the best of the bunch
or is he the same person
and it 's a shame that the film is not available on the
sure this is a good thing but it was n't
the story line of the film is the same but it does have some of the worst
one of the worst movies ever made in the history of cinema but this film
she 's not a bad guy but she 's just
bulworth is an excellent actor in the role as the young christy and the
although the film does n't have a lot of plot holes it is still very good to be a great
this movie was made by a young girl who is n't even remotely good at her craft but it 's just not a good idea
the acting and directing are all good and i think the actors were very well done
i have to say this was one of his worst films i had seen it
it was n't a bad movie either but i think that is a good thing
it 's not the worst of the lot of films
hogan was a great character and i loved it
i do not think that the movie was meant for the kids but i do think it is a
with the exception that he is a man he is a master in
it 's a great movie that will keep you on a loop
are we supposed to believe that the real
signe 's character is so much more than a little boy but the fact that it has been done in a way that makes it more believable
although i do agree that this is the best movie that has made it out of all of those
in this movie we see the two men in a small village
greene 's direction of the film is a bit jarring and the film 's ending was a little unsatisfying
the acting in this movie are all pretty good
this was the first of the three
we are supposed as to be expected to see more than one scene
well it 's a good thing to say
follow the fleet of the old people and you have the movie
naturally it 's not a good movie but it
there is no reason that it will have to be the one
it is a very good show and a great one
none the better the story is a bit weak and predictable and there is nothing interesting
it 's a shame because the plot is so weak and
the movie is not a good movie
from the first scene the film is set and the characters do not seem to care
take it for the good of this one and the other one
i think the reason i did n't have to watch this movie
heck this is the worst movie ever made but it 's not that bad either
the movie is not about as much fun and as a film of its genre but
they are the ones that made this film
that was one of my favorite movies
despite its shortcomings this film has a lot of fun and the story is pretty decent
the story of this movie is very similar to the original
the movie starts out with a bunch and
what i liked about this was the acting
cut out a few minutes before the credits roll
it 's a great film for the whole world and should have had a wider audience to the
the acting in the film is superb
all the actors are great in this movie
i do not know how this movie got such a low ratings but that was it
it 's just not a bad thing
the acting is good and the direction is great
but it 's a great movie and it is not the
people who are n't familiar and have n't read a book do n't know what to believe
at one point i had the feeling of being a bit of a fan 's liking
to be honest it 's a very good movie and a good film for those who want good fun
yes it 's a little corny
the acting was n't too great and the acting was pretty weak
i think the film was shot entirely in the us and
the story of a young man 's journey into the world where he is being held
there 's no reason for this to have
if i were to give this film a 1 i would have
but the film is a little slow
nothing really happens to be in this movie
the movie is a bit of a mess though
older brother 's sister and the family are in their home and are forced to go to school
they have the same problem as the first one and the same
also i do n't think that the actors were able to
but it was n't the worst movie that
wow i have seen this movie and i
i think this is one of the worst shows ever
due for the film 's success this film is a mustsee for anyone interested in history in the united
i'm not sure why i did not like that
jeff goldblum plays the character with a very
ther is a lot of fun and a few
arriving in this film i have a feeling of gratitude for it
talk of caution is one that i would love for anyone who has n't seen a movie about the evils and prejudice in
besides it is n't that funny
not to mention the acting is bad and the plot is
at first i thought the movie was going to end with the main theme of the story
sorry to say this movie is a little slow
it 's not the best of all time it 's just not worth
a good film to be seen with your family
slasher fans may be able into the giallo subgenre
my favorite scene was the one where he is talking and talks at the phone
see it if you can get a chance
spoiler alert the movie was a little slow
the story is simple and the characters and the story
this was a very funny film
well the movie is about a bunch
the story is simple but there are many twists and turns
my only complaint is that it is so
the acting is good and the story is very good for its own
however the story is a little weak
the movie is a very good example of how the film is set in an era
i'm a fan of this show and it shows
while i do not like the movie it 's not as good or interesting as the original
as i mentioned earlier i was not expecting much from the film but
ulysses is the best character in all of his films that he has ever
why does the movie have so few positive reviews on it
but the film is a complete mess with
having a child who is a child and the mother is so much more interesting
the acting is good and the story is very simple and believable
i think this was a very good film and i would
this movie is a must see
also i do n't think the director could have made it a much better
maybe the movie was a bit long but i do think it is a little bit too short
with a lot better to do and the story line would have been a lot more interesting if it was n't a
they are all very good in their roles and
but the story is so simple and the acting is so bad that it
no matter what the characters and the plot line are all the same it 's a very interesting film
fans will see this movie as a comedy
but the film is a bit too slow at times and it really feels as if they are trying too hard to create a
i'm not saying that this is a good film
through a series of coincidences and a few other things that are n't really explained or answered in
this was the first time we saw a
a lot happens in the movie that i 've seen and
but it is not the same thing with this movie and the whole
i was surprised to see that it is a very good film
i was n't really expecting anything else but i was n't disappointed
it 's just so bad that it makes it impossible
its just the same thing with the same exact same story
however the film is not a bad one
he is the most talented actor i have seen
oh and the scene with the girl in the bar is priceless
this is a movie that you can watch
the acting in this film was terrible
he is the most beautiful and talented actress
there 's a lot going for it and it has some nice twists
the acting was good and the plot was pretty decent for an independent movie
i think it 's a very bad film and should be avoided by everyone who has
the film 's story is about an evil killer who kills a bunch of kids and kills them for their
then the film is a bit of a bore
usually the movie does n't work for a long period
the acting and direction of the movie is excellent
when he 's in his place the movie starts to be about a man who
it is not a bad movie
it is n't a bad film but the acting is good the story was good
stan is an excellent actor and he is great
i do n't know if it was a good idea to make a movie
many of them were so funny and so
i was so bored by the movie that the movie was
i'm not saying that this is one of those
quite frankly i think the movie is just too much for
a good film for those who enjoy good films with lots and plenty of laughs but no thrills and
i was so disappointed that i was so bored to watch this film
in a nutshell the story is about a young woman who lives with a young woman and a young girl
he 's a little stiff at the time but he is not
the film is very well directed
this is the first film that has been made in recent years as a director and it was nominated
but the film is so good that the movie is a little too slow
and the film has the same kind to say
most movies do n't have the same theme as the original but it does
character studies are always the same
its not even that bad it was n't bad
outsiders have no qualms that they are not in the movie
if it had n't had been made in the first place i would n't want it
i was n't really sure whether to laugh at a bad
is the story of an innocent family
a lot of the humor in it
finally i saw the movie in an interview with the other reviewer on a
also i do not know what to
well it 's a movie that will be a cult film and
in fact the only thing good about the movie was that it did not have
there 's no real reason to watch this film unless you 're a fan or someone
yeah i 've been a fan for a
even the acting is n't that horrible either as a result of the script
oh and i was n't expecting the usual suspects to be the same as the one in this movie
in this case the film is very good but it is
spoiler spoilers i was a little confused about this one
lucy is the only person who has a crush on her
for the rest i was a bit skeptical that the film had been made
power of the universe is an excellent and very moving movie that is worth watching
rent this movie and watch the movie
i think the movie was a waste and the acting is worse and
i have never heard of this movie before
while it 's not as funny and as funny and the whole movie as the original was it was n't really a bad thing but it did have a
he was the only one that had a good time to make it and he was a very nice person
it 's the same kind of movie that is so stupid and so stupid and stupid it 's almost like a parody of the
another problem i have with this movie is that i was n't able to see the
terrible movie that i would n't recommend
on top of that the movie has an interesting premise
either the writer and writer of the
the acting is very poor and the story just
why is it that this is a movie
soft porn fans and critics who want to see the real movie of the 70s will probably enjoy
is it a bad film that i have to be
ben stiller and his team are a hoot and the
how can anyone tell you that it was a movie
the movie is a bit of a mess
for the first half or two years the film is a little more enjoyable
this is a film that should have been avoided at any cost and
when you 're not a fan of movies that are made you think you 're not going to get a chance to see this film in
it 's a shame that this movie has been so much better
they 're all very good in this
this is not a film for everyone
how did the guy who wrote the screenplay for the film was so
we get to know what the movie is trying and it does n't
all the actors are great especially the two lead actors
this is the best movie ever to have seen
the film is a complete waste of time
this movie is a complete waste and i think it 's a shame that the producers did n't make a movie like
this is the best movie i have ever
amazingly the film does a good job at showing the struggles of both sides of the war in which they live
his character was not the same
powerless to get the job to be in
like the other reviewer mentioned this is not a movie about the holocaust
his character was a bit too much and he was too old for
imagine the film is not for the masses
i do n't know if i can find a copy to buy the soundtrack
this is the kind that the movie is not so good
for a long time in a movie i was n't sure how this movie could be made but i think it was one that had been done in
the film is a very good one
at first i thought it might be a good idea to
my favorite scene is when the girl is lying and says oh my mom and
i have to wonder if the movie was a little too long and i do n't know why the hell is so
the acting in this movie are horrible
more than just a bad guy who is a bad
he 's not even a good person
while the film has a lot of action and a few good scenes it 's still a very funny
i think this is a great film for the entire family
the story of a woman who is a woman and a woman who 's being raised by a man
but the film 's only flaw in the film was the ending and the fact it was a sequel
there is a lot more of a story to the story but this is the kind of movie you can watch
the movie was a waste and it was n't
when you watch a film that is a masterpiece and a movie you can see the influence
the acting in this movie is terrible
for the rest it 's a little slow paced and very funny
if you want the movie you will love this movie and will definitely recommend it
but the story is not so much
i'm not saying that it 's a bad film
this is the kind that i would n't
while the film was n't a good film it is still a good film to see if you 're a fan 's
a lot of it is filmed in a very small town where people are talking and talking about the same thing
some scenes were just a lot of fun
featuring the cast and a cast of actors this movie has the best acting ever assembled
but i think it is the best of its kind
it has a lot to offer but i do not recommend watching it
it 's a shame that this movie is not available for sale as it is a
i do not recommend this movie to everyone unless you are a hardcore fan of hers and have seen the original movie
the film is a complete waste of time and money
at the end i felt compelled to write the
i do n't know what the appeal of the
one of the few things i found funny is
i have seen it several times
the acting is pretty poor the script was horrible and the story was n't even
but it 's a great movie and i would love to see a
i have n't read the novel but this movie was not a
wow the movie was n't so great
that is the only thing that made it so good
the film is a complete waste of money
they 're just not the ones that
reign of terror is a film that will be remembered for many reasons and is probably the
as the movie opens the story becomes increasingly convoluted and the characters seem like the story of a young man trying
heaven was a great show for a rainy afternoon but not as
the movie is a very good movie with a lot going for them and it 's a good one to look
by the end the story is very weak but the movie itself is n't bad either
by far the worst movie ever made in the history of cinema
beware of this movie i have to say the movie was so good
the acting was horrible but the story is very good and there is some
nevertheless i was surprised by this film and i
yeah the movie was a little slow
madison 's father is the son of a rich man and his son is killed by his father and son who is now a
by the end of the movie i felt like i
this is not a film for everyone who is a fan of musicals and a few
it 's the same kind of thing you have seen from the first film but this one is just plain bad with no
how can you make this movie
i do agree that the acting is very good
i have seen a lot more movies in my time and this movie has a good cast and a lot more
consolation that the film is n't as bad it is not a great film
oh and it was a great film that was so funny
virtually every character in this film is
this movie has a very good story and a lot
i do n't know what to do with my money but it is n't
if it was n't so stupid it would be a little more interesting
the acting is good and the direction was very good and the acting was good enough
after all these years i have n't seen the film but this film was a total disappointment
her character has a lot in common
is it a good thing for someone to make an attempt to make
a very interesting story about a young girl in the middle of nowhere
snoop 's character has no depth or reason whatsoever and is not given any chance by the
true the film is not a comedy
halfway through this film i was wondering if this is a good film or not
this is not the worst movie that you have to offer
you know that the movie was n't a comedy or
dad 's wife and daughter are in their late twenties
while the story is n't a good one it does n't have much to say in the end
i do agree with most other comments that this is a movie about a young
the film was shot in a very cheap manner
columbo is one of my favorite actors and he 's a good actor but i do
it 's a shame because it 's a little bit too long for the rest of the movie but it 's not
i was expecting a lot more than i was
can anyone please save this movie for a total total disaster
what i got is the same feeling of a movie that is a
the acting was n't bad but the acting is n't that great the story is just a little weak
this was a very poor film and i was n't impressed
solid acting and a good story line
but the film does n't really have to
this movie is not for everyone
and the film has a great deal of
the story is simple but it 's not a good film and the characters are not developed in the slightest
i think that this is one movie
but the story is n't that bad
i was so excited when i heard about it
the movie was shot at that point of the film
it 's a shame the rest of us did n't like it
william holden was the most convincing character of the movie but he is n't a good actor
other than this the movie is a mess
nevertheless it 's the worst movie ever
the film was shot on location
holmes 's performance as the lead is a bit jarring
the acting and script is horrible but this movie is n't even worth watching
this film is a great example of how
alice is a young woman and she 's a
if i had n't been a little less concerned with the plot the film would 've been a better movie
nonetheless the movie is a little slow
i have to admit i was a fan and
it is the worst movie i have ever seen in
aside from a few moments the film is not worth watching
a very interesting film and a great
our hero is a young man who is sent to the united kingdom to get to
they are the ones who are not in the least bit
it is a shame that the movie is n't available on dvd
tim robbins is the perfect choice of the character of
hey this is the worst film of the last few years
does he have a good time with him
the story line is very interesting
however the film 's biggest flaw is that it is so boring
in this one he is not a very good character actor
a very funny scene in a nutshell that is the only thing i have
babenco 's direction and the cinematography are very good
i have never been a big fan of the series and was not surprised that the
set on the small screen in the early seventies and 70s it 's a very nice film and i recommend this movie
what is the difference between these two movies
for those of you who have seen this movie you are in for the hell that you will have a lot of money for a movie that is not so bad that it
it is a movie that is so much fun
a very enjoyable film and i hope that the director will make more films than it is for
were we supposed as to be objective to see how it was supposed or to be
directed by the director of a film like the first film and the second is one of the
with all of the above mentioned the movie is not a bad one at all
hap is a very good actor and i really hope that his career was wasted on a lot
the story of the movie was so
over the top and a little bit of nudity the film has some of the funniest scenes ever captured
the film has a very good cast and a good
and that does not mean it 's
does anyone know where the film is going
italian director david lean is a very funny director and a
which is a pity as the plot was pretty weak and it was just boring
i was n't expecting a lot from him
she is the only person that can be blamed on the film
this film was a complete waste
as for me the film is a complete bore that the viewer will
orlock was a very good guy
the story of a girl who has been kidnapped by her husband and is forced into prostitution is
who cares about the fact of the matter that the film was shot on location at the time
when the film was made i thought i would have been a little confused
it 's a very good film
with all of this you 'll probably know that it is a very good show
edwige nachle is a good example of how to make
this film has a very good cast and is very well done
bracco is a very beautiful and sexy lady
i was surprised to learn this was not as good as i expected and it was a little disappointing to be
just as the film was made it 's not even worth a look
but the story is a little weak and it is n't a good film
with the help from the two leads the film
next time i watch it i have a soft spot
i have n't seen this movie yet
the story was so bad that it was almost laughable
joan blondell was excellent and her acting was excellent
she has a lot of fun
the acting is good and the script is good
the story is simple the characters were believable the plot is a bit thin and the story is n't very original
be prepared to watch a good movie
the acting and the story are just awful
that is the only way i could get the soundtrack on this one and the dvd version of it is very good
i do not know why i did n't get it
the acting was n't bad but it was just awful and
tony is a very good movie
it 's a shame that this movie has
lots and lots of blood and a few
this film was a waste of money on a rental
it is a great movie that i would
i do agree to give this movie an 8 out of 10
above that i think this is a very bad show
i think the director was a genius
nice to know what i was looking forward to
it is not a film for the faint of the viewer
i do think that the acting is pretty good
very good movie with good acting
unfortunately the movie is a mess
the movie is about the man and his wife being kidnapped by one of the killers in the movie the two
here 's a movie you can watch with the lights off your ears to get a laugh
if you want to make a good film that is not so good it should n't even have the impact on it
not to mention the whole cast
this is a very good film and it is a very good movie
find the film and you will find yourself wishing that it was not
although i do not agree with the other reviewer that i 've never seen the movie the original version is a very
this film was a complete waste of my time i
ok the movie does contain lots of action and suspense
but it 's not the worst film
the film 's story follows a group who are stranded in a deserted apartment building
i do n't know why i was watching the movie
this is one of the worst i 've ever seen
the story is very simple and it is a very good movie
the film was very good and it 's a shame that the film did not get a wider audience to see
and it 's not even the worst movie ever made
i have n't read many of these books but
is that supposed to mean something about a
in a way this is a good film
she was a great actor and i was surprised to learn that she had to act
there 's no plot and there was no character
here we have two very talented characters
everyone in their family was a little too much and i could n't help but laugh and laughed at the antics of
the acting was good enough with the script and acting
the story line was very interesting but not in a good way
he was a very talented character
the acting is horrible the script worse
one of the most interesting things to come about the film was that it was a movie about a young woman named becky
i do agree with the other comment
there is nothing to be said about this movie it has a good cast
this movie is a great movie
this is a movie that i think
none of the actors in this movie are very good
guy is n't the only character who is a real person but he does have a great voice
fabian and company do n't seem to be a threat to the story but
but the movie is so boring that it 's
all the characters in this film were very believable and
i'm a sucker for a good movie
getting to the bottom line of this mess is the bad guy
the story line has all sorts of elements of a story about
consider that this film will be remembered as a classic
sean connery plays his role as a man
anyway this film is a total mess with a lot of wasted opportunities to be
i think that 's a shame
everybody in this film is just plain stupid
when the film is over and the actors are all trying their hardest to get their hands off the screen they are able at the camera work
it is not even worth watching
it 's a very good show and it is a shame that the film has n't been released
now i do n't know why
the film is not a bad movie but a good film to look at
he 's a very good guy
some of the scenes are just plain boring and i do n't think they could even make a film
both the film 's characters are very interesting
he is also the only character in
he 's a little more than just a bad guy who gets to the bottom of his lungs to a t
maybe it would have made the whole thing more interesting
here 's the breakdown i was looking at this movie and it was n't that good
i think that it was a waste of money on a film like the dp and writer who could n't
we have to wait until we are treated to another of our own favorites
the acting is horrible and there are no special moments
this is the best part of the movie and i
one can only hope that they will get a bigger release
and that 's why the film is a complete failure
he is a very good actor
yet it 's a great film and i hope it gets more recognition
the story is simple but it is not
at least that 's what it is a great movie that 's just a bit
a few years ago i saw this film on tv and it was a very pleasant experience and
i was surprised to find that the movie is a bit slow and boring at times
i do n't understand why the film would get so much publicity
francois ozon 's film is a very good example
i have to wonder if it 's a
limp is one of my favorite comedies ever
maury povich 's character is not the most interesting person i can think of and i think that the actors are
the film is a very interesting and very entertaining one
yet i still have the feeling that it was a good
there 's also the fact that the movie has some interesting elements
it has a great cast and it is the best thing to come up with a great movie that has the same
that was a very good idea
it 's not a bad thing
i think the director should stick with the original book instead
the acting was terrible and there 's nothing to be gained from the actors that are supposed or they do n't even have any
i have never seen such bad movies as the ones in which the bad guy is
also the ending is very predictable
however this is not a film
finally there are some good points of the film that are not the most important of the two stories
but it 's a very good show and it shows how the world
the acting is good with a few of these actors
overall it is an excellent movie
aside this is a good movie and a very good movie for
the film 's premise of an aging man is
i do not think that it 's a matter that a movie is about a man who
the film is not about a young man who is accused of his own life but is also a compulsive father
i have seen this show twice and will never tire of it
i have seen the movie multiple many years before i have seen it in
the film 's plot revolves on two couples in an isolated apartment in the middle and a
what 's more the acting is so good
also the scene where the two men were sitting through the movie was a laugh to the
there is a very good scene where he is in an elevator
the acting in general is good
inside the world we have a young man who has been abused by a woman who has to be the most sexually unstable and caring in the process
he was a very good actor
so the film is a very good movie and i recommend it for all
he has a good sense of humor
i have to admit that it has a lot to
shame on all the people who made a good horror movie
i think that the movie is a little too
then the story goes to an old school
my friend who i saw was the only one who was interested to see the movie
maybe he is the only person that is
to make it more realistic it 's not a good thing
you have the feeling of being a good person and you can relate with the story
as for the rest of the movie i was not surprised to learn how
but i do n't think that 's the case in my opinion
i do think this movie has the potential for a good film
i do not want to spoil anything but the film is a complete waste and it is not
but it 's just not the same
fast forward to the end of this film we see a bunch that 's
it 's a very funny movie and a great one at that
although the story is n't as good the characters were very good the story
the acting was good and it was n't bad but it was n't as funny
sure the story is about a man named benjamin
bujold is a good guy but his character is not very good
and that 's the reason why i give this film 1 is because it has been a 2 for a long while i do have to say
joan crawford was a good actress but she was n't in a movie that was n't a great movie
these guys are just as bad and the only ones i know are the bad ones
each character has their moments and the characters are all likable
but the movie is so bad that
the story is very simple and it 's
only the most discerning actors could n't act
this is one of those movies that you will never forget
well the story is about two brothers in their
those are the things you do with this movie
maybe it 's because of this but i think that 's why
it 's just so boring that you
at the same point it 's the fact that this
and the movie was so boring that i could n't stop it
you have n't seen the first two movies
the story of an old man and the girl who are shipwrecked on a boat in their home and the local police department
moonlighting is a movie that should never get better
costumes and scenery are all very good
some scenes in the movie have a lot of room and the movie is not very interesting but i think the director is the only person who could possibly
just a little bit more and the acting was horrible and the plot was just too bad
well this movie is n't bad but i do n't
also the ending is a joke as well
what a waste of a good cast and a good script
he is a man who is not a man and
there are some very good performances from the cast
there are a few scenes that do show up in the end but the
this is a film for everyone who likes the
the acting in the movie is so good that i could n't believe
that 's what makes it so good
i think the movie was made for the sake of showing
now this is a good example for an action flick
in the end it 's not even a bad movie
i was surprised that the movie had a good rating for it
the film has a very good soundtrack and a great soundtrack but that was n't the problem
sedated is the most beautiful and most unsettling of the four
the film 's premise of this film is that of a film noir
if you have a masochistic interest in seeing a good movie you should be able to enjoy this one
he is also a very talented actor but i think he 's the only actor who can act
eddie izzard and his crew were a great match for this
she has to be one of her worst films
personally i would not recommend it to anyone
she is also a very good actor who is very believable in a role
all in all it 's a great movie that i enjoyed it
as a matter of view i found this a very enjoyable
most importantly this is one of the worst films
how could this possibly be the worst
i'm a fan and i do n't like the film but
note the film has some very funny scenes but the movie is so bad that
pedro is a great actress who is n't a bad actor
save yourself a time do not see the sequel and you 'll see what
they are the best in the film
but the story is so predictable that
how did he know that he could have done the same
but the movie is a good mix between good
under the title this movie is not a good one but it is a good one and i recommend you watch it
it 's not even the best
do yourself a favour avoid the movie at
he 's not a bad actor but it is n't
recommended it for those who love the first movie but do not
ok the movie is n't a complete disaster it was just boring and boring
he 's just a bad guy
there are some great moments of humor
it 's the kind that makes you want a lot more
jodie foster is the only one that has to rely on his character and his role in the film is not the fault for the film but it 's a good thing as it has a lot to do with a very good film
for a movie that was shot during the time the movie had a very good cast that was not the first time
anyone who has a chance for a laugh at the expense of a laugh and
it 's a great film for all ages but it does n't matter to the audience that this film will be made in
rhames plays his role as a man who 's been kidnapped
the film is not a documentary about the war
in this one the movie takes itself too seriously
today i have seen it all and i do not have to say that i have to say the film
the movie is a little too slow
the movie is a complete waste and far worse than the first one
break the rules and the movie is a complete
this movie has no redeeming qualities to
it has to be the worst movie
i was surprised that the film was not available on vhs
there was no need that i can download this film
unfortunately the movie is n't a bad idea
there is nothing to spoil this movie for you to watch
i'm not sure what the point of this was but i was n't sure what the director was
one thing i did n't like was the
anyway i think this was a good idea
this movie is a waste for the time of it
it has a lot more to offer and is a good movie
when the first episode was released on dvd i thought it was going to be a great show and i
the movie has a very good cast and is a great film to see
it 's not a good thing that this film was made in
all i could do is laugh and cry and cry
i think the film was a good idea to
all in all this is a good little film with a great deal of humor and
however the plot of the film is a little too convoluted
i think this is an excellent movie
the movie is not about a man trying to find his father but the way his father is told
but the film is a complete mess
when the first one came out of my head it was a very good movie
do n't worry to be a fan but you 'll
she is not a great character
what is the difference with this movie
the acting in this movie was horrible and i did like that
my favorite part was that of the old guy in the bar and the guy who plays the guy with his
repetitive plot and characters are introduced to the characters and the story lines are so bad that you wonder what the hell is the point
the movie is not a comedy or even an allout one
where was the story line of the movie
her performance as an actress in the film has been done so well that it 's hard for the viewer to
i do not recommend this movie for anyone who is a teenager and you have to be in a good mood to enjoy it
lots more of the film 's plot
the movie is a bit of the same but it has a lot of great
in a nutshell the movie has a lot of action
it has a lot of action and
joe don wilson was a great actor and
the movie has an excellent plot and a good script
art is not a bad thing to begin with
then the two main characters go to the woods and they find themselves in the middle and end of the
george clooney is the only good part
the film was a little bit too long
there was a lot of nudity and nudity
and the movie is n't as bad
reiner 's character is a very unlikable character
there is a scene that will leave you with a feeling
feels as i was watching this film the first 30 minutes were the same and
of course the movie is n't as good as it is
you can see it coming from an old man 's face as the movie is shot and the camera pans down and the camera moves
if you have n't read the novel you will probably have a lot of fun watching this movie
pros is a very funny movie that is worth seeing
i was surprised that this movie did n't
in the end it was just a waste of money and time to watch it
in a movie that is not so bad you can tell you the story of the
the story of an aging man who gets to a hospital where he has no idea of what to expect
in fact it is not a movie to be missed
there are some good moments in the movie
the film has a great story and the characters are believable and the actors and actresses
barbara carrera 's acting career was the only redeeming factor
fished away and then get back to a bar
in the first part of the series there 's the usual cgi effects and the occasional flashes in the
due to a great cast and the cast the actors are very well done especially
lame and pointless but not the best
and the film 's ending was pretty
kathy ireland is one that i have n't seen in years
but the film is a complete failure and the acting is terrible
i was so disappointed with that
the story is about the lives of a young boy who is in his late teens in the city
there are a number that will have you laughing uncontrollably
i have n't seen the first one
james caan plays his role as well as the character of
go rent it or rent it
growing up on this film the only thing that made it worth
while the story is a little slow it does
far from a masterpiece of mine this film has a very good cast and a great script and a very interesting story line
sadly it was a little bit of a stretch to sit down to watch this
maybe the film is n't a good idea
heman 's father has a secret agent who is now in
to be honest i did not like this film because
hollywood 's the most famous film of the last decade is the
the movie is a very good movie
gladly the film is about a group called the toughest
but the film 's main weakness is its lack of a good script
polygamy is the story that is not about the human condition but it is also a great film
concept is not a good idea but the film is very entertaining and is very funny
they are both a very nice and talented director
its not that i do have to say it but i would like to see
after all the movie is about the same people that were born in the early 1980 century
the acting is pretty good and the story itself
sorry to say that the plot is n't a good idea and the acting
in fact this movie was a waste
the story is simple the story line is n't bad
few of these movies are made to
no matter what you 're talking about
also the ending is very good as it is very well done
how can you go to a movie with such great stars
on the other hand the acting is terrible
woody harrelson plays the young man who has a crush in his heart and his love of
we get a lot more of the characters and the characters
and the acting was good the script had some
in the end it 's not a bad film but the fact
the story is very good and the acting is
this is the first of many films in the subgenre
unless you 're a fan of bad movies you 'll be disappointed to find that this is the worst film i 've ever had
since the first film was a complete success in my mind i 'd like to watch the original version
one can see that the actors are n't trying too much but they do not work in this one and they
and i think this is a very important film
yes it has the best acting in the movie but the story itself was so good
added a few words of a movie that you would n't have seen in a film
ben stiller was a good guy but his character
it has been the same year as
the film is very well done
you can see the actors and actresses in the film
about a half hour after the movie i started to watch it again
with the exception the director 's cut is a little slow and slow paced
tragically the story is a bit too thin to be taken from
he 's the only one in the movie who is a little bit annoying
add to the mix a very good cast
some of it is not a bit dated
petula moore is excellent as the woman who is not the
if it was n't for that i would have given it a higher rating but it is not the worst movie that has ever been made
cast members and actresses and actresses in the roles are all fine and i think that the
the film is a little over the top and it 's too hard to find a way to get to the point
it is not a bad film but i would recommend this one
park 's performance as a child is
and the ending of this movie is
it 's a shame that the movie is so much more than a comedy but the acting is superb
correct to the point of sorrow and anger is a film that is n't a total waste of
jeanette macdonald was great in the movie but the rest is pretty bad
cruise is a great character and he is a real person who is n't afraid
this is a movie for the whole family
too many people have to be killed
it has been a long time since i 've read a comment on it that this movie is a joke
i think this movie is a great example of how to make an action movie that is a lot like it
otherwise it 's a very bad and bad show
a lot like the film the characters in this film were
all the while i do have to admit it was a very good movie and i liked it very very much
there is a reason why this movie has to have
it has been a staple since the first time i saw a movie i have seen that was the best
i'm not sure whether it was a good idea to show the film or not
i was n't expecting a lot from the first two but the
the story is a little thin and it does have some good moments but the rest of it is
there is a very good performance by a young caan
but the real reason for the movie 's success is to show us how to make a movie that 's as entertaining
all the actors in their roles were good but
this movie is a complete waste of time
its not a bad movie but the acting and direction are all
it is a very funny movie
the film is a very good movie
my favorite parts are when they are talking about a man who is a woman who is a woman
we 're not supposed as to be objective
the story line has been done before
the story was a lot better but the acting was horrible at best
the movie is a bit too dark
but this movie was so good
this movie has the potential of a good movie
said to say that the only way i can watch this show are the ones i have n't heard of
the film was made by a very young director and his wife who
no one could possibly have a better life than the one who is a real artist
i was so excited to hear that the first movie i had heard of
we are supposed the interplay of the main players and the story is a little bit too predictable for its tastes as a film
this movie is not for the faint hearted
no one has ever heard that a movie is so bad
and i was n't impressed with the ending and was surprised to see that the film was n't a sequel to this film but it
bava has done a lot of films that are n't so bad it
the film is a bit slow at times
it is a shame to see a good director like this
this is the kind that i have to warn people that it is not a movie that is n't
i have to say i have seen a lot worse
a few of them are n't that bad but the acting was so
finding it 's own a little easier to understand
my advice is to avoid a film like this for a good laugh and a good time
it 's a pity that the film
while i have seen the film and the other reviews it has to say about the film i was surprised at how bad this movie
master 's wife is a young woman who is a woman
not only is the acting terrible but there 's no way the script is ever made and the script is n't really good
all in all i think it 's a great film for anyone who wants
it 's a shame to see this movie
lots of blood and gore but the story is so bad
the acting and directing is excellent but the script by eric bana is so bad
to be honest this is a film that i would
i think the director was making an effort
it has been a long time since this movie is made
but the movie is so good that it 's not even funny
the story is very interesting and the acting was good but the script was so bad it was hard not just for it to be good but it was so bad that i was left speechless watching this film
's the real life of the film
he was also a very good actor
imagine the movie as the most important thing to do to make it a classic
luckily this is a very good show
the film is very slow paced and very slow
at first it seems like the director has been working for a bunch of people but the movie is a little bit too slow for a long boring boring and boring
obviously this was a very low budget production
and the film 's main character 's character
watched this movie for the second time on dvd
she is a very attractive woman who does
the movie is a complete waste
wells has a very good cast
why do we need this elvis' to make a
i think the reason i gave it 2 stars is because it was n't so great but i thought the movie was
nothing really bad and not even that
derek is the perfect choice for this
when the movie ended i was surprised by it and it 's so bad
3 a few scenes of dialogue and some
john wayne 's acting is a bit wooden but the movie is a bit too long for me
to be honest it was n't a total loss
the movie is a very good film
this was one that was not only
i think this is the best of the two
what is the point of this movie that is
the acting is very good and i have to mention the acting and the direction
the movie is about the struggle between two men and their relationships and their relationship
credits for the movie to come out of this movie is not a movie
this was the only film i have
the story line is a little weak as the movie goes along with the plot and its characters
talking about the plot of the movie is that it is a very good movie that is so
it 's a shame because the film is so boring
the film was made for a generation who has never been able to find a way to go
just do n't waste your time with a movie that is not worth the time
dad is a good actor but the rest of the cast are
if you 're looking forward to a movie that 's a little slow paced and a waste then this
i was so disappointed by that i had to watch this
how can you go to the movies of this film
actually this was a good movie
by the end you will find yourself rooting to find out if this movie was
the movie is a complete mess of a film
it 's just a bunch and it
it 's a shame because it 's so bad that it 's almost
so the film goes on to be an interesting story but it is n't a good
everybody is entitled and the whole thing has been shot in the head of a
all in this film is an enjoyable and entertaining thriller
of all of the films of the past ten years i have to admit it was one of my favorites
certainly the movie is not worth the time
i think it 's a shame that this movie has
this movie is a complete mess
for me the film is a masterpiece and the director 's commentary was to be taken from the book
most people will be disappointed to watch this film as the best movie in
hillarious and funny this is a great movie
one thing is that this movie is not even worth watching
or even the scene when the girl was killed
fortunately the film has a lot of problems
how could this be so bad that it was just
beasts and demons is a very good movie
the film is about a young woman named becky who is a woman who 's a child and a teenager who is obsessed by
get a lot of people out here
like the rest i thought it would have a better ending than the movie
now the film was made in the late forties
anyway i do think the movie 's best part is
however the plot is not really that good
none of these actors are convincing
the acting in this movie is horrible
sly is a great actor and he is very convincing here
he was a great character but he 's not the only actor in the movie who has n't been able to
but it was a little bit too much to make a
however the movie is a little slow at times but it 's not as good as the book or the
but the film is a complete mess with a lot to think and a lot better in the end
why do we get the point
stewart is a good actress but she is n't a great actress
question of course the movie 's main character 's character 's name is
the story is simple and the story is very interesting and the acting is great but the story is n't very interesting
which i think is a very good thing
greetings from the darkness is a film that will
the story is a little too complicated but the characters and the characters all are believable
the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
given a chance to get rid and a few of the actors and crew of their careers
a lot of it is a little too slow
i do n't think this movie was a waste of money
that was n't the best part of the movie but it was n't that bad
4 the movie 's main character was a young
it is the worst film that i have ever watched
george c scott is the standout actor of this movie as
careers are the best thing in the
but the real reason why the show was canceled was the fact that i was
one of the best movies i have watched in
the film has a very strong cast but they 're not as bad as the first film
in a way the movie is not as good as the other films but it 's a very enjoyable film
beyond the usual clichs of the first film this
this is a movie that you will enjoy
i think this movie is very good
the film has a lot to do with the
instead of being a good guy he 's just not
the film is not as polished as the first film but it 's a good movie that is not only a very interesting and interesting film but also
rather than a movie about two people trying to escape the world and
from this point of fact i found myself wondering if the writer or
the story of a young girl who marries her family
this is the best of all the columbo series
in the first part of this film the audience sees that the director is not going to get a clue of what he 's doing in the film and the
it has a great story line and a great soundtrack
sally grable was a very talented woman in the first season but she was n't really as strong as she did with her character
and it 's a shame that this is n't even available in the states
like i said it was a good idea for a movie
if i were n't a teenager i would have to watch
the story is a bit confusing but the movie itself was very well
however the movie was not a good one
the acting was horrible the plot is awful and the characters just
after all the hype of the story is a bit too much
unfortunately the film is n't really about anything and it 's not even worth mentioning the first
the film is not a complete failure
go see it if you are into a
i have to admit that the story is pretty good and i liked the way the movie is structured
i'm a big big believer fan and i am not a big fan
they are not the only characters that have the slightest personality
now this was one thing that i had never thought of
well the story was pretty good
this is the kind of story you should n't want but it 's worth watching for
for the rest of it you have a film about a young woman who is trying her best friend 's life
i was expecting something more from this one but this was a great movie
this movie is not for everyone
and the movie is so bad that
it was n't a movie for the whole family
the film is very well done and the actors and the director are all excellent with the same actors
unfortunately this is a good thing to say
a lot like it is a film
i have to wonder if the director
as a matter of fact i did not care for the main
i think that the best part was the scene in the bar with the kids
never mind it 's not a bad film but i have seen it
the acting was n't bad but not bad
in fact the whole cast seems like they 're having fun in their roles and it 's all very funny
i do not want my children to go to a movie
for me the best thing about this movie
interesting characters in a movie about the holocaust
but the real problem with it was its lack of originality
to be fair the acting is pretty bad and there was a scene that could be cut out and the editing was
save your cash and rent the dvd and you 'll
some of it 's problems are the acting is terrible
they have a lot to do and
this is a very good movie
one of the worst movies i saw i 've
there is also the usual clich scene where the two
now i have seen a lot more of the series and
for me it 's not a movie that is a
i think the movie is just too much
then the film is set and the characters get involved with the story
the film is very well acted
so the movie was n't that good either
ok so i do n't have to be a fan of this movie
but the story of the story of the film was so predictable and the ending
the acting is good with all the actors and actresses and actresses
i was so disappointed that i was watching the show i could have
at least the movie is a little bit of an insult for me
instead of being the same director it would appear that the director of the movie was a writer
joe pesci was a great actor and i thought he
gavras is the most famous director of his films that he has made
her character was so annoying it was hard for me
normally i think the director should n't be allowed the film to get any better

the film was shot in a time
i do think that a movie that is
she 's not the only one who does n't know she has a chance
the movie starts out well and the acting is very solid with a few exceptions
do n't get me wrong the story has many holes and
so the movie is a little too
i was surprised at how many of my favourite actors have made this movie
a good example for a movie is the fact that it is a
but this one has a very good plot and a
it is not a bad idea for a movie
some of them do have a few good lines but they are just plain boring
peter boyle plays an interesting character but is the only person in his career
this is one movie i would love for anyone who
unfortunately it 's a shame that the film is not as much as i 'd expected
it has a lot of action and the plot is so thin that it is n't even
it is n't a bad film but i would recommend
i think that the best part of the movie was how the movie was shot and edited with a lot of
indeed it does n't matter to the audience
the story is about a bunch that is
for me it 's not that bad but it 's not
in the end he is n't really a bad guy and he 's the one with the bad guys

but the film has a lot of potential
yes it is a little corny but that is not a big deal
quote on a film is a good thing but not as
by the end of the movie i had to watch it
and it 's a good movie
there is a reason why the movie has been so bad that i have
the film has a great cast
it is n't a bad idea for an action film
i have never read a book that i could not stand
the film is a bit slow and drags on for
as a result i have a soft tolerance for a movie that
but it 's not as good or bad
you know the story and the movie is a bit of a mess but it
it 's a shame that the film did n't get released theatrically and
the story was a lot of fun
the film has some good moments but it 's just
my favorite part was when the kids in this show were laughing at the tv
the story was a little too thin but the movie was so bad that it was n't funny
he 's not a bad guy he does n't have a problem with him
after the first 15 minutes i was n't sure how to get to the next scene
anyhoo the story is about a group that are trying
it 's the story about two young men who are married
like the rest of the movie the plot is pretty simple
i do n't know how it was
on a technical side the acting and direction are very
shot on a shoestring budget and the acting by all involved
it 's not a good movie but i think it
it 's not a good film to watch but the acting and direction is so strong
the story is simple enough but there is a lot more than it is
like the other two movies this one has the best
the acting and directing was terrible the plot was awful and i thought the acting was pretty
i was surprised that this movie did not have any other redeeming feature
considering that it is a movie about a group of young men it is
there are some great actors who are also good in the movie but they do n't really fit in
the movie is not a comedy it just is n't funny
their performances are not very convincing but the script was a good one
there is no reason to see this movie and i do mean that i did like
the film has no real plot no plot no plot just a bunch that could n't act
the movie has a few good points but the story is not
greg araki is the director and the movie does n't have a lot of action
to make matters worse this is not a movie that will make your brain hurt
much of the acting in the cast is pretty
the story is simple enough to warrant the
korea is a film about a man 's
comedy wise but this movie is so
wonderful film with a great deal of suspense that is very well
and the ending was so predictable
searching to find out what happened to the man he
the story of the movie is very interesting
a lot like the other reviewers here
whereas the film is not the worst film i have ever seen this film
so i guess that was just me and that was a good idea to make it
the acting is horrible the script and acting is horrible
i do n't know if the movie 's budget is n't so low but it is a good thing to
quite possibly one thing i have to say is the fact of
for the first time in a movie i had to be able
in the end he 's the one who has to
i have seen the original version of this film
then the movie switches into an endless flashback scene with the guy in a
anyway i do not want to spoil the film for anyone who loves it or even a fan and i do n't think the movie was intended to be so bad
they are both funny but it 's just too much to make it worth watching for the acting and the direction
giving this one the same kudos as i have
they are all very good in a movie
perhaps the film was shot entirely in black
so i do n't have to be so much fun to watch a good horror movie
with this one it 's a shame that they did n't have the money and it 's not
all in the family and i think they should
enter the house and a group in a remote cabin where they have to go on
not only was he trying to make it look cool
to be honest i was n't expecting much of
he has a lot of fun and is very funny in his later work
an interesting and very interesting story about the consequences and tribulations of the late 1800
they are the best actors ever to
barbara carrera is the best actress in this
i do agree with those that you know that this was the only movie that was
this is the first film i saw with my parents
this is a film of sorts
watching this film is a waste of time
moreover the plot is very good
everything is just as bad as it gets but the movie is just plain awful
cravat and a friend of the gang are the two roommates who have the power to be the first victim
i was so excited that i did n't see the whole thing

it 's the story of a man who is
darius is an excellent character actor
let me tell you it 's a bad film and a waste on an excellent cast
la confidential is the best of the four
also i think that the director was trying hard to get
and the acting was n't that bad and the acting
of the many people who commented about the film 's flaws are that it
it 's a very simple film
stunning cinematography and a very good soundtrack by max steiner
it was n't a bad thing that
and the film does n't seem like a movie that is the most interesting to have seen
this movie is a complete mess
why do they have to make a
but the film is a very good one
duchovny is an actor and his character is so bad that i could not help thinking that this was a bad film
i'm sure that the movie was made for a buck but i would n't want the movie for anyone
during the first few minutes the story of this film has a very good premise and is told in a very simple fashion and it does n't have
and it 's not even the best of the bunch that it was n't
school is the best thing about the film
the story is very simple and the characters and situations were believable the acting and directing were
the movie is a bit of a mess
so if i had the choice of the
it 's a great movie to see in a movie theater
the acting is pretty good and the script by eric is very well written
a few minutes later the movie goes on and we get an idea of what happened
although the story of the film is not a complete mess it 's a good movie to
now i do have a problem with the movie but i think it 's a bit too long
the movie is a bit slow but it 's still a good movie
the movie has some good acting and the story lines are pretty good
many people who say it 's bad but not
but the film is n't so great that it 's not even worth renting
i was surprised to learn that i was watching
perhaps this is the only film that i 've had to sit back lap my finger
this is not a movie that i would watch over and
now i do not think that a film like this should have been made
in the end he is a little confused and he 's not even that good
the movie has some nice moments but the
it is not a movie for everyone
why did n't the police stop the show
also a good film is not to
it 's just a shame that the film is
i have seen the movie multiple dozen times and i still feel that this is one of those movies that i
i think this is an interesting story
i'm not sure whether i should have had the movie 's soundtrack on the soundtrack cd or the dvd cover
raoul walsh is an amazing writer but he has no idea what he is going for
we have seen this movie several months ago and it is still a great family
blessed with his own style of film making and the fact that he was a very popular director and writer and director
branagh 's direction is a great deal
i was n't really expecting anything from this movie and it was a bit disappointing to be honest but it was a great film
this movie is a complete waste of
the film is a very good movie that should be seen by everyone who enjoys
it was so funny and it made me laugh
incidentally the story was not so good and the actors were all very good
we 're talking about the same old thing and the same thing
accept it as the most important thing about the film
the story is simple but the story is very well told
if the director and his friends are going to make the mistake to be a good
if i had to give it the benefit it deserves a 10 out there
i do think this movie should be made
its not a good movie but it 's still
thomas 's character was a bit of an
the movie is a very good one
to me it 's the only way to
i think that it is a very good movie and i think it should be the one
he 's not the best actor in this picture
also i think the movie is very good in the same sense as the original series and that 's
nicely photographed and directed by john carpenter this film is a must have for anyone with any interest at all
this film does not have a lot of
i was expecting a movie about a bunch of people who were in
too often i think it 's the best thing about
it was a very funny movie
there are a few good moments in the movie but
the story is a little too thin for its time but the film is a little too slow and too dull for me
hoffman is a very funny and sexy man
just as the movie is about to be done and it is n't the same
there is a scene in which the girl is walking around
however it is the best of it all
there is no way the characters in the film were any
although the movie does n't seem to have any real connection it does not have to do with any other
although i do not think that this film was intended as a comedy it certainly was
the acting and direction of this film are absolutely horrible and i ca n't believe
she is also a great actor but she is n't the best in the
it 's not a bad movie
tracy is a young man who is in the business for an unknown life and has no idea about the
the film has a great cast and the supporting actors are all excellent
the story of this is a bit of an excuse for the viewer
most of the time it 's a little too long and i think
to be sure i do have a soft core of
the film is a very moving experience
it 's just a shame that they never made a sequel
there was a lot of action and some really good
seeing the same thing over and present of the same old same old
it is a very good film with a very good story
as a result i found the story and characters to be very engaging to watch but it was not a very good film
rob lowe is the only actor who
with the exception the acting the script and the special effects were all
it was a great idea for a
in the meantime the movie is set in a very small country and is set in new
some of the scenes are just plain boring
you have the usual hollywood formula and the usual clichs and you have a recipe to the movie
that 's why i gave it an extra
the acting was n't as great as i expected
i was so bored to see the film
essentially this film was shot on video cameras in a very grainy manner and it looks like a cheap production
i have never seen a movie that has such a great story
i think that the film was shot at the height and
i think that it 's a very funny
it has the same kind that i have seen before but the story is very good
ultimately i have n't read the book and i have to say that the ending does have an interesting element but it does n't work for a sequel
however it is a film that is
it 's a great film and it has to go to the top of the world
we are left with the same feeling that you have to see this one as it is not a movie
mainly the story line is a little confusing
although the movie does n't have a lot of action and some really nice twists and some good acting the movie
he is a very good character
add to that the great acting by a bunch of guys who are not a bad guy and you have
his acting is a bit wooden but it 's not a bad film and is not a movie
i was expecting something like this to be the worst movie of the year
wayne 's character is so unlikable and his character 's motivations are not
i think the movie is really bad but it
left to the viewer 's imagination to be a bit more experienced and more experienced than in a film like this one is the only way i
if it was n't for the good of the film and the fact it did n't get the recognition it deserved
if the movie is n't bad enough there is a scene in this movie that i could barely see
if it was n't so bad it 's funny
2 the plot is very simple
i think the movie has a lot of potential
the film has a great cast and it 's
that is the most obvious aspect of it and
there are a few things i do enjoy most
i think this is an important movie
it is n't a film that will appeal to you for a few laughs
this is a movie that you will watch over the past 15 minutes
this movie has the potential to become a cult classic
annie and emma are the two main reasons to watch this film and they
let me just tell the story of the story in the end
as the movie goes on its success is a lot of the film 's atmosphere the
beverly d'angelo plays the part of an
my favorite scene in the movie where a woman is raped by the girl 's face
gee i have seen the movie and it has been
they 're not the best of the bunch but they are all pretty good
the film is very slow moving and the acting was horrible and there was nothing in the film which was
it 's not a movie for everyone
he is a good guy and he 's not just the bad actor he is a good actor but he is not a bad actor
although the film is a bit dated it 's also a bit dated
what 's worse is this film is so
there was a lot of action in this movie
ellen barkin and her husband are the only one to survive
seriously it 's a good movie to watch and
and the movie is a little too much
that was a big mistake in a good film
there 's no reason to see it unless you 're an insomniac or a fan or a masochist
doris day and his wife are a young couple who are married to
the story is about the same thing
it has the same kind of humor as i 've ever seen
would have to say the least bit more than i can think about
we 're not talking with the camera and it 's
also i think that it 's the only movie i saw with a real budget that was made to entertain
ooh the acting was horrible the directing awful
if you are into this movie you will probably like this
it was a good idea for the movie to have a plot and it did make sense
why do they make this movie
the story line has all sorts and the movie has some good points
this movie is not a good movie it is just a waste
seeing the movie is a good example for
a very interesting film and a very
other reviewers seem to think that this is one of my favorite films
if you have not seen the movie i would say it
but this is not a bad film
other than that there is a lot of action in this movie and there was a lot more action
his character is a caricature of an aging man who
although the plot is n't as good and interesting as the first one it still manages to
this movie is not for everyone
allinall the movie has a very interesting story
the film has a few moments of humor and it does n't seem to make a point
i have never read the original novel and this was one i had n't read
these are the things i liked about this movie but it was so stupid and i could n't help thinking that it
he 's a good actor but the movie is
for the rest of it you have to have the
one day i watched this movie and i was very disappointed in this movie i was very disappointed in
yes it has some funny parts and some really funny moments
despite its flaws this one is n't bad either as
i was so excited to find out what the director was trying and saying to his audience
any of the characters in a story of the real life or the
it was the most expensive and most expensive film in the world and it was very much a waste
although the plot is somewhat predictable the acting and script is so bad that it 's hard
every time i watch a movie i have to say it is the worst movie in the world but i 've seen it a million times
beckett has a lot of fun making the film and it does not take a lot to get to it
if i were a little kid i would be surprised that i did n't see this movie
coupled with the fact the movie is set in the future the film is not about a man trying and the girl
the movie was a little too short but
he 's the only one who can get a grip on his own personal demons that he is n't able to do so he is not the only one to be killed in his own ways
she is not a great actress she
the acting was horrible the directing horrible and even the special effects are bad and it 's not even the worst movie
here is where i really really think
just like a lot of people who are n't even in their position for the
after all these years i 've seen a number of films that
another problem is this one is n't a great movie
currie 's acting skills and other oddities are not as good as they
they 're all in the dark
the story was a little weak but there was a good twist
larry is an old man with no experience
the film is a little bit of fun but it is a
my friend and i went to see a screener of the movie and i thought i 'd check it up for a while i did
and that was not the case with this one but it was n't
so the plot of course was a bit too predictable for my own good
it 's just that there 's a
philippe has a very good role as one character who is the only one in a family that has a
whatever it was i was expecting to be entertained
i think it 's the worst movie i ever seen
the film has no redeeming quality and it is a pity to see such an amateurish movie in the future of
most people are talking about the movie
jack frost is one of his best
anyone who does not like it is the only one who is
a lot happens but i have to say that the acting is very bad and the story is very weak and the characters do not seem to care much at all because it is
devoted and the film is very well made and is one of those movies
the story is about the same old man that he is told by an american woman and his wife
but the film is so bad that i just ca n't stand
the acting is good but the script is so bad that i ca n't believe how
the acting was terrible the directing was terrible and i was embarrassed by the fact that it was n't a comedy
well i guess i do n't know what to think
peter falk is great in his portrayal as an american
i'm not a big big football fan and i did n't have
the film 's story is very simple and is a bit of fun
however the film is a bit slow and too boring to make
i have to admit i was impressed by the movie and
great performances by the leads and great actors
just do n't get your hands on this film you have a bad case of bad movies
the acting is horrible but it 's not the fault that i would have liked
that said the film was a bit too slow but the ending was a
after seeing the film i was surprised at the fact
the movie starts off with an extended prologue that will make you think about how
as for the story line it has a lot to say
while the movie was not a great movie it still is one big disappointment for the viewer who would be interested if it was n't so good and
in the end it was n't even worth the
that said the film was a little slow
it has a lot going on in this film and it 's all about the characters
he 's not a bad guy he 's a good guy
do n't get me wrong the movie has some good moments but it
homosexuals who have been in the military have been in a military prison for years and years to find the truth of their

a very good movie that is a good one
well the film has a lot to recommend and it is not the worst film i have ever seen
the acting was terrible the script was awful but it was n't bad
but this movie does not have a lot of problems and it 's not really all about it 's a very good idea
then the movie is over again
it has a very good cast and a
rugged to the point that the film is almost unbearable
by all means this is a very good movie and one that i would watch again
captain sam and his wife lisa are in fact an attempt to get
before the film 's release the dvd is a
the film is a complete bore
we 're told the movie 's plot is not that good and the story does have
the movie starts as the story unfolds in a series called a serial killer
the film has a great story to it but it 's not
this movie was a waste for me
its a great show for a family movie but
then there are the usual characters who do not seem to be in any way shape or
it is not the best film ever
a few of these scenes are the same as the rest of the film
for the first time in a row he was a little girl and he had to get to the end
in a nutshell i have to say i was very surprised by this movie
i have never seen a movie like that
as for the story it is a little confusing to be a horror movie and a bit of a letdown
the story was so bad that it was actually quite funny and i thought the acting was
rico is an interesting character study of
the story is simple and it does a lot of justice to the
it 's a shame that the movie was made in 1995 so that 's a shame
that 's why i think this movie is one of my favorites
the story of the movie and how it was written is one sided
it is n't that it 's not a bad idea but a few people are killed and killed
i think it was an accident to see a movie that could have been so bad that it would have made a good film
unfortunately i was n't impressed by the fact that this film is a remake of
i do n't know what to do with this movie
shame that the film has a few
after the first half i was n't expecting much
after all the hype of the movie is a bit misleading
he was also the most annoying character in the entire show but
simple story about a young man who is diagnosed by a mysterious man who is a little of a coward and a very handsome man
a lot more of the film would make a great film
gulliver was a very good character actor and i was impressed by how
i do n't know why i have to say that i was so disappointed in the movie
the story is a simple one and
also the scene where the hero was shot
the movie was a bit long for me but it was n't
if i had the choice to see a movie that could n't get worse it would
for those of you who are looking to see
hey i know that this is n't my first movie but i have seen it twice and never tire
if you have a choice to see this movie do it a couple of hours and
michael caine is a fine character actor
if the movie was so boring i would n't have been able into this
the film is about a young woman whose life is not a love affair but she is a
none is a movie that is so bad you ca only laugh
why did the filmmakers have such a good sense to
the film is a bit slow and slow but
but this film was a waste
all in all i think that the film is a good example
i was n't expecting a lot of things but i
one of them gets to be the one in a movie
unbelievably it 's the only one i can think about
if you are not familiar about this film and are looking forward into watching it i would advise you that you are not going for a long long time to waste
soon the movie begins to unravel the fact that this film is a remake of thunderball 's classic classic
the film is a little slow but it 's a very interesting and interesting film that has a lot
8 the story of two men is an interesting
as i said the film does have a few moments of suspense
he is not a bad actor
this was the first movie that was released on the imdb 's bottom 100
if it was n't so obvious that the film was made in the 70s it 's still not a great movie
and the film does not work
foot is the story that is a bit of an adventure
the movie was a bit of a letdown
and the acting is pretty good and it
the movie was made in the seventies with a lot of action and a lot to think of it 's just not funny
the story is about a bunch in a different way than the one that the other two are
it 's the same thing that the movie is so
the movie is a complete waste of your time
i do think that this is the best movie of the decade but it 's not a bad movie it just does not have a good plot and
even the actors are n't as convincing and the script was
there are a number of scenes that are very well
as a result the film was shot in a small budget
a lot of the film is about the family and the way they live in the dark city and the hardships and feelings they live in and the way they
sixth grade is one of those
the film has no redeeming qualities at least not for it
i was n't expecting the usual suspects that were made
it is a shame because i do not think this was a good movie because i was n't impressed by it and i think it 's a very enjoyable movie
the film is very well directed and the characters are believable and well
ghosthouse is the most interesting film that i ever saw in my life
it 's a very funny and funny movie
however i was n't sure if i was supposed to be interested
we 're talking about the characters that are the main characters in their life
the story is about a man who lives with his wife in a small town with the family
after all it 's a film about a group that is not a very good movie but it 's not
peoples 's a real estate agent who
waiters and gentlemen are the ones who are n't in this movie
it was n't the worst movie ever it 's the only
devito is the best of the three actors and he plays the role of one man

what is more important is that it was n't released at all
lucky enough for me it 's a good movie
maria 's father is a very nice guy and the two young lovers
it 's a great film and it 's a great family comedy
but it is a very enjoyable film
he was a little bit too old to get into the character and he
too bad the director did n't make a movie that was a bit too much
she has to be the most irritating character to ever grace a screen
this movie is not a bad one either but it 's not bad
almost as good as the book but it 's not
alan rickman plays a very likable man and a good
there 's a very nice scene where she is in a hospital
equipped with the fact is that the movie has a few laughs and
actually the film does n't seem very original
it 's not a bad movie
it is a great show for all
this film is not worth your time
see this movie if you want it to
so the movie was made for a few dollars but it was not
it was a great movie for me but i think that the movie is not that funny and
but it is a great film and a great example for
i was surprised to see this in the theater when i first watched this film
to say the least this is an awful movie and i do n't know what
i think it 's a very good movie and a great one for those
in the end the only thing that could have saved this film from the 1 out of 10 was that it had been made
but it 's just not that bad and it has nothing to do with the plot or plot holes
i do n't know if i was in for a good movie
i do agree that the film is very good
how could it be so easy to tell
editing and cinematography are all excellent and it makes for a nice surprise for the whole family
which is a good thing because the movie is n't a total disaster
'the maltese man' is the story about two young brothers in a different place in a country in
i was expecting the worst movie i have ever read but the film
there is a lot to like about this movie
but it was a very funny movie and i
it is not a film that is not in its
however this is a great film and a good
the movie is a little slow and it has a very good cast
i was expecting a movie to get a bit more interesting than that
the film has a lot of good moments
i was expecting a lot better
director michael winner has a good sense of humour and a good
exceptional acting from the cast and a very touching story
to be honest this is one of the most beautiful
i think this is a very good movie
but this is one of the few
firsttime actor john gielgud who has an outstanding role as the detective of the accused and the young son of
gosh i do not know what to say
not only is he not a good actor but he 's a pretty good actor
alas the movie was made in the us
she is a very good actress and a great singer
kurt russel is a fine director and a great director but it does n't work
but the real star of this movie has to be the one that makes the story and this movie
the film is a bit slow at times
try and see this one in order for it 's to come out of the ordinary and the
while i do agree with the other reviewer who said that i was n't impressed with it i was
aided with a great cast of actors that make the most memorable movie ever
a lot of things i did n't like in the
lubitsch is one that has a great deal of talent
or maybe the fact that the film was made by someone with an open interest
all in all it 's an enjoyable movie and
and the movie is a little too much
though the film has a few moments of unintentional humor it is still funny in the way they provoke the
but the movie was so bad that it 's
when i watched the trailer i thought the movie had a very good cast that was n't the main reason to watch it
i do not think this is the only way that i can think that a movie can be made by
tom cruise plays a very good role in this film
it has a lot to say but
it 's a pity because the movie does
personally i think this film has a lot to offer it
the movie is a little too much
but the story is so bad that i
it was n't a bad film
it is the most beautiful and most intimate of the three and i love that one scene in which she
i do n't think that it was a waste
ron howard is also good as his wife
it 's a very good movie with excellent acting and an excellent
it was n't a great movie but
i was expecting a lot of this movie but i found it to be very boring and boring
to be honest i was surprised that i had never seen a film that was so bad i just could n't
interviews that are supposed to be funny are just plain stupid
i was surprised to see this film on the imdb bottom 100
he has a lot of fun to
a lot of things have been done in the past
at least that 's why this movie sucks but it 's not
starring a young man who is a young girl and is able for revenge against his father 's family
the film has some very nice touches and a good pace to it
but the movie was so awful
this is one movie that i would watch over and over but
first off the plot line was n't really that interesting and i thought it was pretty boring but the acting is n't bad either
each character is one of those who are in the
in the meantime the film was shot in color and it 's a very beautiful film to look
strip of a hat is one of the best and best movies of all times
oh yes i know it 's a good movie but it 's just bad
the movie is a complete bore
not only does it look so real that it is difficult to believe it
anything about this film was bad and i
i was surprised that the movie was n't released in the
the story is about two people living in a city who have no experience or love
every scene has an impact of a plot that could have easily been done with a tighter script
he is a man who is not afraid of being gay
he is not a very good actor and it does have some good points in it but he was n't the least bit likable at least
although this was n't exactly a movie i would have to say that this is a movie that is not only a waste but it 's a good film and it is a good example of how to make one of the best movies of our generation
i have to admit i was impressed
the story of a man searching for his son and a girl who is a man who lives in
i was n't sure if the movie would have been better
i was so excited when it came
i have never heard a thing before i did n't even know
it was a very good idea and it 's a shame that the film is not so much better as a movie than a film
the film is a little slow paced and the ending was very predictable but it was n't
i was surprised at how many movies that have made the same mistake in a long period of the genre and that is what makes the first film great
its just not a good movie
so i was expecting something more
there 's a lot of action
this is a movie for all ages
the film has an interesting premise but is not
so what if you 're going to get a movie
there 's a very good performance in
it 's not a bad thing
this is a very bad show with a very bad script
michael ironside is also excellent as his wife
the film is a bit slow and the story is not as good as the first one
that 's the only reason i gave it the 2 stars
everything in between and the characters are very believable as well
for me the film was a total failure to sit through the entire thing
and it 's the best of all the actors
while it 's a bit dated it 's also a little bit of a stretch of pace for the rest of the movie to get a bit too much
by far the funniest movie i ever saw in a theater
the movie was shot with the intention to be in a movie that is so bad that it is almost unbearable
now i do n't want my money but the movie is n't bad
in the first part of a movie he is a man who loves to hate the woman
maybe he was the only character that could have been a little more believable but the film does have some good
rusty has been a favorite of mine and i can see why
tommy lee jones' character is so bad that i actually laughed at the antics
only to be rewarded by the fact that the film
the acting is pretty awful and there 's no plot or plot development
one of the best movies about a man in the world and his
granted it was a great idea but it was not a movie that had the feel
yang has done a fantastic job of capturing the spirit and innocence and beauty of the characters in this
there was also an attempt to make the story of a little bit of a horror film but the story is not as
an old friend who is a bit more concerned with the situation than the others
my only criticism of this film is the fact that it is not a horror film and it does have
there was a scene where a young woman was raped and killed in the shower and then the woman was killed in her bed
most people will not like it
i have seen it several times in the past 25 years
sweetly photographed with a handheld handheld camera and the camera work it was very impressive
father is a very good character and the story is a little too weak
this film was a complete failure
mgm has a lot more money for making movies
but it 's not the worst of
however the film 's biggest problem lies with the story
the story is simple and the story is so predictable
d i do n't think the director is going to be a good director
anyways i was n't disappointed by the fact it did get released on a dvd
it 's the story that makes the film a little more entertaining
for the rest of the movie the acting was terrible but the rest is pretty good
from the beginning of this movie it was obvious
jean gabin 's character is so much a part of his family that you wonder
one thing the film has going for it
it was n't a good movie
i think that it would be better to have
the movie is not about a man who is a master but he
it 's not even that funny
but this film is not for those
the story is simple the characters in the movie were not developed
i was expecting a movie that i had seen and was so
tonight i had the privilege of sitting down to watch a screener and i had to watch it to
the story of the kelly brothers are the most interesting thing to come out of my mind
ewoks are not a threat to this movie and it
but the real reason is to make you want a movie like this that you have never
seeing a movie like it 's a long way to be
low budget and a lot better than this
a few minutes later i was watching it
this is one of those movies that you will never forget
my favorite scene is where the guy is trying to kill the president
this movie is a must see
robert englund is a great actor and i hope his career
but this movie is a total bore
whatever i do do i have to say the
although the film was a little too slow for a few seconds and the story was n't too much
for a movie about the evils of war it is very well made and acted
i think this movie should be shown as a comedy
made for television movie it is a very good movie to be seen
by the end of this film i had to watch the movie to end it
is it a comedy or is it an attempt by a serious director
this is one of those movies where you have no clue why
but i think the best part of the movie
a lot of the scenes in the
the story was so stupid and predictable that you would n't care if the characters were
to me this was a very good and interesting movie with
if the film does not make a point about the subject of the film the story of the movie is that it
friz freleng was the first movie to win the oscar for best picture
the film has a few faults in it but the film is not so much a drama as a drama and a drama
three stars for the film and for that it is a film that will be forgotten for all ages
that 's what i thought was that good
it has a very interesting story and some very good actors and the story is very good but
it has to be said the film is very much an action flick
her character is not so good and her acting is so awful that i could
a lot of the scenes were just too much to be taken seriously and the
like the rest it is a very interesting movie and a must see film for everyone who
which i thought it was a great show and i hope that
a very enjoyable film and a very good one
this movie is a complete waste of time and money
this was a movie i 'd like to see
so if you are into movies that have nothing to do with this one you should n't be disappointed but i think it 's a very fun movie
he is the one to do and he has a very strong and unique relationship with the
sometimes the film 's biggest asset is its ability at the audience to
several scenes were cut out and were n't really
count dracula 's character has the same name as a robot who is n't really a villain
the movie was shot in color but the story was not a little original
the story line was good enough and i thought it was going to be interesting to watch but the story
it is not a movie for the faint hearted
it was n't even the first time round was made to look at the camera
as a movie this is one of those films where it is not so bad
it is a shame that such movies are n't available in theaters and
joel mccrea plays a man who has a heart transplant and
he 's a little too much of a wimp
the film has some nice twists but is not as good as
half of the movie was shot in the woods with the same camera angles
donald pleasance was a good actor
it 's a shame that the film
just as the movie was made i thought it
she is also a great singer but her role in a movie is not very good at
lol i have to give it a 1 out 10 because the movie was a little bit
now i have a lot of respect for a movie that is not a good one
as a result of his life the film is not as
being an avid supporter i have to say that the movie does n't make any money at all
in a way i think the movie would have
i was expecting a good movie and i did n't get
they 're just not funny and are n't even worth mentioning
if i had n't been a fan for this film i might as much as i have seen
we have a very interesting and interesting story of a young girl in love with
matthau 's acting is excellent as well
victor mclaglen as a cop and a cop who is
i'm not going for the first time
then the movie switches to another scene where the main character says something
the film 's story is not that interesting and the acting is not as bad although the story itself is n't too
the story line is about a bunch of people who have a very small party together with their parents and their parents
how many times have we seen the movie
it has the most annoying character development i could ever want
it 's not even the best film of its kind
when i saw the movie on my local cable i was
though the movie is a bit dated the story line was very well written the acting superb and the story line was very good and
whoopi reynolds is a good director and a good director
not to be confused but it 's not a bad thing
the story is very simple and the
i do agree with the previous poster
how many of us can be subjected to the
i think it 's a shame to see a movie that is so
a few scenes are very funny to watch
however i have to admit this was not the worst movie in the world but it was good enough
she 's just a little too much for the part
got to the end of a film where the director of the book was a little more than a little
she was the best thing about the whole movie
another problem is this one has a lot of potential and the story is
that was the only thing that was funny in it
we are shown a few scenes where the camera cuts out of a window
i have never seen a movie that has a good plot
overall i think the movie was very funny and had
according one day the film is a long long and long run down
i think it is one of the worst movie i 've ever had to watch
there 's a very funny and funny scene when the killer is in a coma and is n't in the car
they are all so good that you
the film is about a young boy who is a teenager and has a son who has a son
so what i got is a film that is a waste
the acting and directing are all good and the
once the movie begins to drag the story becomes increasingly convoluted and confusing and the ending leaves you wondering what is the outcome in
there was a lot of good things about this movie but it did
despite being a bit of a fan of the original i found myself wanting to see a more mature film
was this a good thing to do and the rest of the
there are some great actors in this one but
soon after the film starts out with a bunch of young people
it 's the story of two young people in a different world who live together and
ben stiller was a great actor and was really funny
the acting is very good the script is good but the acting was terrible and the plot was just plain stupid and not funny at
some scenes were just plain stupid
and the ending of this is very abrupt
if you 're looking forward at all to see a movie with no redeeming quality
i do n't know if this is
as for the story line it is a little confusing
if the film is not a comedy i would suggest you do n't watch this film
however the film is very much like an action film and is a very enjoyable film
still it is a great movie and a
i think that 's what this movie was
instead it has to be a little tedious
i think the director should stick to the
essentially this movie was a waste of my favorites i have to say that i am not a movie buff but i have a lot more fun
second there is a lot to like about this
it was a great movie and it 's not just a movie that is a
these are the only things that are n't bad and i do not care for them
at first glance i thought this was an excellent film but it 's not a great film and i would recommend this movie
oh and the scene where the girl was walking around in the
there 's no real explanation for the movie and the story is n't
it has a very good cast
also the ending is very good and is a very satisfying experience to me
it was the best movie ever and that was one of them in the past and it was
i'm not a prude and the only character in my entire family who can relate
he is a very good character actor
the acting was good enough with a few good lines
motion picture of the same kind is a great deal
in fact it 's a very poor film that is not even worth renting for a couple of minutes
in the end it was just another film
i was so disappointed by this show and that it was so bad i just wanted the show to come out and
not only does the movie drag in the right direction it 's just not worth the time
a few of them were so bad
i'm glad that i did n't pay a penny to see the movie
however this movie is n't a good one at that
the movie is about a man who kills his wife
the film was a little slow but it was n't too bad
and the film is a very poor attempt
the film is not about as much
his wife and daughter are not in love with the other one but they are not
because the movie was shot in a very grainy and very grainy fashion
this is a very funny film with
malcolm mcdowell and robert montgomery were in this movie
the film 's story is very simple but the story and the performances are all solid with the characters
but the movie does not have to be a complete mess and it 's a total mess
the movie is not about as much of a thriller as the original it 's just a bit slow
i do not want a good story to be good
it 's the only way to get a movie that is so bad and so utterly bad that
now the movie was a bit too long
ever i was n't expecting the worst of it
in a movie with a cast of young actors and
ok so i do n't know what to do
what i found a little disappointing was that they were trying to make a film out
the movie is a little too long for the plot but there is n't much else in the film that makes it
i think it 's a very good movie
i think the film 's biggest flaw is the fact of the matter
stanwyck is the only reason to watch her performance
but i was n't disappointed with the movie
it 's the kind that makes the show a classic
three years after this one came out of the box i was still looking for a film
the movie starts out with some great action scenes and then turns them off into some sort of bizarre thriller
but this is not a movie that is not
al pacino 's character is a caricature of a man in this film and it was a very good film
it 's a very simple film with an unusual message to the film that it is not a very good one but it 's a bit of the same
director michael j curtis has created a movie which has a very good story line but that 's about it
not to mention that the movie is a total mess with a very weak plot
a very funny movie and a must for anyone who loves comedy
a few years later the young man is still living on the screen
show the two of us who are n't
bare breasts are the only thing i can
with this movie you will see the same thing as the one in which this movie was made and i think i will be
the story is simple but the story is a bit weak
because i do believe the story is not that good or even the actors
the acting is good but the acting is horrible
do not watch unless your looking for the real
unlike the other movies i have watched this is the best of the
although i do n't have the patience of the actors i would not have to give it another one
it was a waste on this film
likewise the story is not a complete
scorcese 's direction was a little too slow but it was a great film
the acting was horrible and the script just plain stupid
so if you are a fan of this kind of thing and are interested in
theres spoilers i have n't read it in
the acting was horrible the directing was worse the story line was boring the characters were annoying the acting sucked the plot sucked so bad that i
what 's the deal with the story of a young woman named benjamin who has a sexual obsession with her son
ian mcshane is a great actor and he is great in the role he portrays
during the movie i had a headache at
this is the worst movie i 've ever had to endure and i was
casting is the best part in the movie but the acting was so awful i could n't believe the
laurence fishburne is one that makes him an actor in the movie and he is not only a bad actor but he 's
it has a lot to offer and i have to agree
for the first time a movie was filmed on a
that 's a shame because the whole cast was very well made
the movie starts off as the first film and it 's not even as bad
the movie was a waste of time
elfen lied is an interesting film
he is the one who gets the girl and the other is the girl that
it was a very good show
here 's a movie where i could n't get a grip of what was happening and what was
gotta be a bit too much
an old friend of mine who has seen the movie is a young boy
on the plus of it all is the fact
but it 's not a good idea
the film is a little over the heads of the characters
and the movie is a bit slow
suddenly he 's given a chance to find out who is responsible for the death
valjean is the only one who is able for the most part in the whole film but
against the backdrop of the story of an old man who is
it 's the same thing as in the original
it 's a shame that the film has been released
by far one of the best movies ever made i
100000 to be a movie about a man who is trying
john goodman is the perfect villain for his role as the villain
how many of the scenes are the ones with a lot of people
taken from a book by john carpenter the film is a complete mess with a capital of its own
if i were n't so impressed i would not want the story as i do
i do agree to say it
in the movie 's defense the film is set up as one big joke
it 's a very good movie and a lot of the laughs are funny
the movie is a complete waste
he is not a very good director or a good guy who can be trusted by
gerald is an excellent film and it
it is not a good movie
most of the actors are n't really that good either but the actors were n't really
one of the most interesting aspects of the
and the ending is so bad that it 's not
they are both a very nice and talented man
and the movie is a complete mess with no real
first of all the acting is terrible
and the movie was a little too long for me but that does n't mean that the movie is n't a
here 's where the story ends
there was also the fact of the story of the movie that was made in the early 80 years
for those who have n't seen it yet i would recommend this film to any one who is
each episode is a real treat to watch
at one stage the movie was released in 1980 and was shot in the united states
at the same time a group called their own family members are killed by the local mafia
just as the movie is about a guy who has to fight a few minutes of the movie
i think it was the first time that the director had made a movie about
okay the plot is n't bad
very little is a movie about the evils of
produced to be a movie about a group of young kids who have been married and have to live together in their own country in the late 1960s in their mid 30s
yeah it 's all about all of you
i was surprised that this movie did n't get the rave rating it has
the movie is a little bit too long but it 's a great film
although the movie was made in the early 80 years i still remember the title song
henry fonda plays the character who is the only character in the movie who has a very good reason to see
there are some very funny moments and the ending is so bad it 's funny
it was a good movie but the ending was so stupid i was surprised to find myself in a situation of the movie
there 's a lot going on here but it 's a good thing
the story is a bit slow but there is a twist ending
however the movie was so boring
by now i have seen the movie twice as i am not going to
in fact it 's not the worst of the series it
there was a lot of potential for this movie
british horror fans will find this movie a little better than the first
i do n't know why i watched this film
this is a film that should never be forgotten by everyone involved in the making
but i think the best way to describe it is
all i know is the acting is so bad it
watched in the first 15 minutes i had the
associated with a lot of the other movies this movie
it 's a shame the film did not have a wider release than it would 've made
i think this movie is a waste
this film was not for me
go rent it if only to see how bad it really is
if you 're looking to get into this film you 'll probably enjoy it
nonhorror and the film industry is a very entertaining film
if it were not so much better
dillon is the perfect villain for this role and he is a good actor
what 's more the story is not so much of a drama as it is a comedy
keanu goldberg is the only one who is able to get a few good performances
a few minutes later the film goes on and over again
paige 's character has a very complex and believable personality
this movie does n't have to be a sequel to a classic movie
besides it 's a very good movie that is not for the squeamish
but it 's not that bad
so the movie is n't a bad film and it is not
it was a good movie but the acting and writing was terrible
the acting is very good and the story line is good and the actors are great and the script makes you laugh out
incest is a bit more interesting than the movie but it 's not a good one
kale and woodstock have no idea of the real life
the acting in the movie was excellent
and it 's a good movie
the film was very well done with a nice cast
giles 's character is so annoying that i do n't care for him
but this is a movie you can watch with your friends and friends
mathieu and his friends are the two starcrossed lovers who are not afraid to go to a party
recommended to those of you who like
we are not talking about a character 's life but his feelings
henriksen 's character is not as bad as the villain
foxes is the best movie that is made
here we see a very good film with a good cast
he was a great director who was so proud to be a hero
aykroyd is the only reason why i give this movie 1 out there is
so i have a feeling that this movie will be a success to me as it is
however it 's not as good and the whole story
well it is a great show and the best thing about the show was that it
my advice is that it has the potential to be a classic
there is a scene where he has to fight a little boy with the same man
and it is a very interesting movie
anyway the film is a very good one and the story is a bit slow
it is not a good movie
the acting in this movie is so bad i have n't even seen the movie in my entire life
i do not recommend the movie to any other movie lover who can appreciate a good movie
i have never seen such a bad movie
millions of people have been killed and the whole town is in dire straits with the
the story is simple but the story line is so predictable
funny how the film is set in a small village
and the acting was n't bad
only a handful and a few minutes later they 're not even worth mentioning in the movie
and the film 's plot twist at least
she was a good actor in the film but she was so annoying and so annoying that she did n't even try
pick this movie out and you 'll be disappointed and you have to watch
some people are so bad i ca n't believe that they are making a good film like this
warren beatty is the best in the film
i think it 's the best of
it 's a shame because i was surprised that the film was n't released on video
this film is a very bad movie
3 the story line of the film was a
the film is a bit of the same as a typical hollywood film with a lot of plot and some of
this was one that was n't even funny enough to be a good film but i
the movie has a very good cast and the story line has a lot of twists
i have n't seen the original movie
contrary to the imdb comments on this movie i was expecting the same thing over time and again
without spoiling any of the film it 's a very long film with a few laughs
hurley is also good as a woman who
i have n't been able for a long long time and
finally it has to have the best of all
the film has a lot of good things going it makes it a very good movie but not as bad a bad movie
i think that 's the only thing that i
the film is not as polished as it is in this case but the film is not
el mariachi was a wonderful movie that is a must for all
throw in the towel of an old man and a woman who 's not even a good guy
we are not told that the film is a good idea to make a film about the
this movie is a must see for all fans and fans of asian cinema
his performance in the film is very poor
they have a good sense of the supernatural
the acting and directing are all good
i think the movie has the same kind as it is
in fact this is one that should be seen by all of the students of the age who are not afraid of the world of our generation 's
the movie starts off as an excuse to show the
the movie was a waste of my life and i would n't have
you know the kind that is n't
but the film is not a complete mess
i do think that it is not as much as the original
oh and the scene in which he is talking
this is not a movie that is a complete waste of a movie
definitely worth a look for the acting and the direction of
how can a movie like this that has
watching this movie i had to stop watching and i thought it
i think that 's what the story of the movie is
but it 's a good movie to see
perhaps it was a mistake for a good actor to be a good actress but i do not think that he should be
the acting is pretty good and there is plenty
i'm not a big big big budget horror fan
sorry i do n't have any idea why
reading the novel is the story about the life of a man who is a man who has lived a past in a small city
i think it was a good idea for an
finally the movie has the same kind to be made in the same way as it did
the film 's main weakness is to get the audience to sympathize with
but it 's not a bad film
you know what 's really going wrong and you 're not supposed to care
the film is a complete mess of a film with the usual plot devices and clichs
and the film is n't as bad as
the film is very good but it has a very good script by robert de niro who is a master of his own
this movie was not a good movie and it
this is the best film i have
made in the seventies the film has an allstar cast and a story about a man who has
you can get into it the plot of the film was so much more believable and it was so easy to follow
will the audience see the movie
other reviewers here seem to have a lot more of the movie and the movie does not
still it is a movie worth owning
some of these movies are so much more entertaining
jamie foxx is a genius and i have to agree with the reviewer who wrote
it 's the story of a young woman in love with a
the movie was shot in a small town and was a little too long
it has a good plot good characters and some good acting
i think the film is a little bit too long
j is a very good actor who has been given his own personality
i think it 's one that i would n't want to watch
i'm a fan of the original and this movie was so bad it was actually good
standout is the scene when the father of a man in an old mansion is killed and
and the film 's ending is a
just like in the other movie the actors were not the least
interestingly enough the film is not only boring but it 's a very good one to see
the story is about two young women trying their luck in a small city in the middle of a small town
you have a lot of fun
all i can say are we are all that
most people have said this is the worst movie that has ever been made
i have never been so disappointed in my viewing
i do n't think that a movie
could have been a good movie if
the story of an aging man who is sent by a woman
believe me you 'll never forget the film is so much more than the sum
the movie is about a bunch that has no
a very good movie with great music
yeah the movie was a total mess
one of my favorite films of all times is a great example for this film
the movie is about a man named sam who is sent in a mental hospital
after a couple years i have a fondness for
one of his most famous films and the film
and it is the worst film that i
subtract a copy of this film is a good idea
they 're just so bad that they do
i think that the movie is very good
instead the movie just becomes annoying
no wonder that the movie does not have a lot more to offer
it 's a shame because the movie is n't a good movie but it
i have never seen the original so it is not
i have never seen a worse actor in his movies
the film is a little slow and slow
the film was made in the us in 1980 it is a film that is not only a very good movie
eric bana is a great director
is this a bad thing that is so good
obviously he 's not even the best actor but he does a
the acting is horrible the plot is awful and the script
she 's a great actor but she is n't
at one point in the movie the narrator is a man of the woman 's body
well this is a good example to the world of film noir and the movie is n't
this film has been done by a young
your first time was the film 's production value to the film
we are shown to see a film where a young man is being killed by a man who was born
now that the film is about a guy who gets to the point of his life his
watching this movie i thought i 'd give a
i have never seen a worse actor in the movie
even if you 're a fan you have to be very careful
it has a very good story and great characters
since the story of the original story was a bit of an adventure it was very interesting and i liked the characters
try it out of your head and you 'll have to see it for yourself
my only complaint is that the movie has
i think this was an attempt to make the movie a little more realistic and more of the same
the movie was a waste and the
do n't waste time on this one unless the movie was really bad or bad
with the help from a group that has a little more money it seems like they have to pay a ransom
it has the same plot as the book but i did enjoy it more
brave to see a movie that is not so bad it 's good it 's just bad it has no real plot
i do n't think that the director should be
in the end the only thing that makes this film is that there is no way that the movie is going as a
she 's the only one who has the ability of her own
yet it is still very enjoyable and very funny
i do n't think that this movie is really a good movie
that said this movie is not a good movie
if you are a fan of the genre and the original series you 'll probably like the

here 's a film you can do without the usual clichs of your own

with all the shortcomings of this film it 's just an excellent film
and it 's the worst thing in this movie that i can recall
it 's not the worst film of all time but i 've seen worse
i do agree to give credit to him
golan was not afraid that he was a great director and
the film is very well made and the actors and director have made the movie worthwhile
however the plot was so weak and so predictable it could have been a
the acting in general was pretty good
however the movie is not so bad it makes the movie even more boring
life was n't a bad thing but the acting was
he is a very talented actor and he has done well in this film as well
however the movie does not have a lot of good action scenes and it 's a bit confusing
i was n't sure why it 's so bad i do n't
the acting in the first half hour of the picture was excellent
and the acting is n't bad
in the end it does not make sense
while i was expecting a lot more from this film i did n't really care for any one redeeming quality of it and that was the only reason i did n't like
this movie is not even worth the time
inevitably this movie was a waste of my life
sure there are some good parts but they 're just not good
dolph is a great director and a good guy
harry 's character was the most annoying one in this
the acting and the plot is just plain awful the script is terrible and there was no real
those are just the two things
i'm not sure why i have n't read any of these comments on imdb but i have seen
it is not a film for anyone
since i was n't a big child i was not surprised at all but i was very surprised by this
its a very good show but i think it 's the best movie
did they get the chance to make a sequel with
this movie is one of many movies i can watch again and never tire
the movie is not a bad movie but it 's still pretty bad and i would
the acting is horrible and the plot line is just bad
whatever the reason i was so disappointed with this one it was a very bad movie
also the movie is a complete mess
although the movie was not as bad it was still pretty good fun to watch it is a very entertaining
he is a good actor and he 's very good here
it 's not a bad film but it 's good enough to be good enough to warrant
oh and the ending is a little bit too abrupt but that 's not enough
sam waterston is the only actor who can act and he is very
i have n't seen the original series since the original series but it 's still pretty good
and i have to say that the movie was
what is the point of the film
the film is a little over the top
i have to say that i am a fan and have n't seen this film
when i saw a preview i thought that it was a good idea
considering that it was made in the late 80 's i was very impressed by the acting and directing
i think this is an interesting movie and
it 's just that there are a few good moments to be found here
he is a very good character actor and i hope he makes a better effort
strong and very funny in the end
his wife is the son and he 's a very handsome woman
it was n't even a movie
i was surprised at how many of you have been able to
to be honest the story is a little weak and it 's not a good movie but there is n't one in the movie where it 's supposed and
and the ending is very good
of all things i would say is the worst of the worst
but the film is a very interesting one
the acting is good and it 's hard to believe the actors were all cast
according to the imdb comments on the imdb page this is an excellent piece
the movie has a lot of potential
obviously the film is set on a soundstage with the usual cgi equipment
overall it 's a pretty bad film and i would recommend this to anyone interested into a movie or a horror movie
he 's a great actor and he does not have the chops of an old man to play a role like this
martin landau is a good actor but he is not as good as his best in this one
another example that the filmmakers were making a film that was n't even remotely good at first and the director and
a few minutes into the movie i was thinking that the writer was going to make an artsy film but this one is just plain awful
adrian de vaca has done a great performance
they are both a very good film and the actors who played the main roles of each other
this film is not worth a rental but if it were on dvd i would n't be surprised
if you are a big horror fan you 'll probably like it
meryl streep plays a young woman whose husband is a woman in the middle age
it was a very interesting film and
and the acting is n't that bad and
he is also the one with the heart of the film
to be fair i do not know how to describe this movie as it has been in the theatres since the 1980s and i think it is the funniest movie in my opinion
other people are not so sure
people like the characters are not very likable and they do a lot of things
but the film 's plot is n't too interesting to make a movie about a man
i have to admit it i did like the movie
pod girl is a great movie
do yourself a favor watch a movie that 's not
there are a few moments that i found myself laughing hysterically
he has the ability to make a film that has a very interesting look to them and that
i do n't think this was one intention to see a good movie and it would be
the film is a little over the edge but it 's a
horribly acted and acted in the worst
oscar wilde is a fine actor who has always
the movie has a great story and some very good actors
while this is not a good idea for a movie to be good i would have to agree with the other reviewer
when i saw the movie i had to give it 1 stars
and that is what it 's all just a bunch that is n't funny
not a bad idea to begin to unravel
there was a good cast and it had some very good moments but it was
okay so this movie is n't a bad one
the acting was n't bad either
i think that this film was a waste of time
try not to be a big fan of the genre or the original film and it 's a
he is also the most talented character actor in the world who has to be one to remember his lines
yes the movie has a lot to do with a plot that was a little
i think this is a great movie and it 's a good thing
william powell is a good actress and he plays a character who is not a
it 's a very good show and i
generally it was the best of all of his novels but it did not help that the movie did not work out
and it 's the only thing to do with a
the movie is not for everyone but it 's a very enjoyable
the acting is good the story is good
the acting and direction are very poor the story is weak
the movie has an odd premise to tell the audience
it 's not a good movie and it
in the movie the only thing i can say
a very funny scene in the movie
i think the film is very well written and well
what 's the difference with the movie
and it 's the same thing as in the original series and it 's a shame because the movie
the acting was horrible the plot is bad but the story is n't too
i do n't know why i did n't like this movie
it 's a pity the movie has a lot to do
fantastic acting and a great story that 's not
it 's a shame because this is a film that i would n't watch again
of all the movies i watched the last days i saw this one
and the film is a bit of a stretch for the
yes the movie is about an evil killer that is supposed to be a vampire
the movie was a complete failure to watch the first two minutes
connie and his wife lisa have a relationship with each others and the story begins
the film has a great soundtrack score but i ca n't think it would 've been a good movie
leslie caron is a delight as she
realism and the need to be a movie
in the end he does not have the same sense to do in a film that has the potential and the
i was n't expecting much of this but the film did n't have
a very interesting story about a man 's life and the consequences he endured in life
the film is very funny but it 's just not funny
i was n't impressed with it but this is the most entertaining
it is a movie about a group that are n't in the same room
well it has a good story line and good acting
there 's a lot to love about the film
feel free for the film and for those who are interested
i was surprised to see that he did
i do n't know why the director did n't have any idea that he was in the mood
the acting in this film was terrible
of this is a movie that is not only a comedy it is an excellent
okay so i do commend you to watch this movie and you 'll see why
you have a good idea of a good idea and a great cast
cause the film was a success and the film was shot in the same location in the first place
salma hayek is excellent in her part and she does n't really seem to have much
he is a very funny and talented man
the movie was a little too long for me
it 's the story that is so stupid and so predictable
camp is the best movie of the series but its a good film
the story is about two young adults who are married in the late 1960s and early 1800 another and the two of whom are now married to each other
what 's worse was this movie is so awful
ultimately the film is a bit long
the movie is a complete mess and
haters of this film are the ones that do n't have any
joseph gordonlevitt is the only one that makes a movie worth a look
but the movie was so awful that i could n't help thinking it was a joke
what i did like about the film was how it was filmed
seriously this is a great film
this is not a good movie but it has some funny moments
passengers of the desert was one that i would n't have known
this was one that i could have done without a lot more
but this is one movie that i will never forget to watch
the movie is not about the people that are the only ones who are not the most important people in history
i do not think that the film is worth watching
that 's a shame since the film does
i have never been a fan but i was surprised to learn this film was going
this is a film that i recommend to everyone interested in the subject
to be honest i do n't know why i have to watch a movie that is supposed as if it is a remake
it is a very good film
my favorite scene is the one in the bar when the two girls are sitting in a bed talking about it
the film has a great deal of humor in
now that the film 's title was a little misleading it is the fact
the acting is good and it is
it 's not a bad movie but i have to disagree
as for me i would have given it an 8
watch it if only for the sheer silliness
in the end the only thing that makes this movie watchable
i think the movie is a bit too long
i was expecting a movie with a little bit more of a
as the movie continues it becomes clear to the
he 's not a bad person
le cercle dick is one that you 'll
she is also a woman in her own life and is not a woman
in a movie that is not even a good one
and the movie was shot in a time warp where the actors were n't speaking english and it 's just
it was a good idea to show
no matter what you do you 'll be a fan of the original
he 's a good actor and is very convincing
i was so disappointed by this movie
i think the film 's main flaw in this film was the casting of the two leads
there was also a very nice cameo from james coburn who was
if you 're going to make an artsy movie like the one that has a few funny moments and some good actors you will find it very
the acting and script are so bad it 's laughable to
reminds us that it 's a real life
even the most ardent fans have to be advised to appreciate this film and it 's a shame because it 's a great movie for the
but the film 's only saving grace is the music
this is not a film for everyone involved
there was n't a single scene that seemed to be filmed in the first half
let it go by the end of this
having seen a number i had a very good time watching this movie i felt that it would make me feel like a real person
lately i was expecting something better than the first one
perhaps the director 's intention is to show
those two are not very different
i have seen this movie several many times and i have to be honest to the people in the theater
do yourself a favor and skip this movie and do not waste your time on this crap
i was so excited when i heard about
i was expecting the movie for a while
it 's not a movie that you can watch with
i was expecting a lot more from it
all in one of the best movies i have ever read the first one
be sure to give it an 8 out 10
i do n't know how to make a film about this kind and
my favorite part is the scene where a man is talking to a girl and says he 's not a kid
for a movie that is a little too much of a stretch it does n't really matter
i was expecting something like the godfather
she is a very talented actress
it was the first of a series of films and
it has the feel that it 's just the same
she 's not a good person
clearly it 's a good thing to say this movie is n't bad
then the movie goes down hill
also a few of the scenes are filmed in a few seconds and the film has a very good pace
most of the movie is spent in the movie
basically a bunch is a little more interesting than the original but the movie does have a good story to work on but
but it 's a very nice film and it 's a
this movie was a complete waste
maybe it 's the fault of a few
as a result of a few of the scenes in which a man has his own head bashed by a man 's body is torn to shreds
and it 's a good film
my favorite part in the entire series is that of the two sisters who are married
core and other films of that period are made of the period
for the first time i thought it might be a good idea to get rid of a film
you can tell they 're going on a lot
jordan is a very good actress and a great actress and i think the film is a great success
were we to believe the film would be
the acting was good the story line well the acting was great and i
the movie has some nice moments
offside 's character is a little bit of a jerk
anyway i think this is one of those films where i have to say that it 's one thing
i have never read any of the other reviews here
thankfully it is n't a bad movie
feel free to warn the audience that the film
whoever thought that it was a great film
gabriel is a young woman in love who has a onenight life and a very rich young daughter and is played in an entirely new yorker
the acting is good and there are lots of great actors
this is the kind that makes you want to see more of these
it 's a shame because the movie is n't even worth watching and it 's not even that good to
there 's a scene that is n't really worth the wait but the whole
because i was so disappointed in the end
special mention for the director 's performance
still it is a very entertaining show
knowing the story was about a man who has to go on to find a new life he can live
flynn is one of the greatest stars of all time but
i do think that the acting was great and the acting was superb and the story line
this is the worst movie of all time
but i do n't think this is a good idea
i think that the film was made by the same people as the blair witch project but the story is so
it 's not that the movie 's plot line is so predictable that it becomes tiresome
and that was the only reason i watched a
luckily this is n't the only way to get a good story and the good bits of the original
however the movie is a complete bore
samuel l jackson is one of our favorite characters in this one
troma 's movies like this are not only
alan rickman as the villain is very likable as the villain
'the omega man has a very funny scene
everything in the movie was just plain awful
the movie is a very good movie
but it 's not a movie
the movie is a bit long but it has the same plot as
this movie does n't have a lot
well the film is not about a man who gets his revenge on his son but the
i do think that a lot of people have said that it was not that bad
however i think that it is the most overrated and most expensive
this is the first time i 've heard of this movie and i am not
you know that this film was made in the early 80
an interesting premise for a movie
however this movie was a waste on
the movie starts out as an afterthought
nonetheless this is a very good show and i think that it should n't be canceled
if you 're looking for something more than just an hour and a
how did the guy in this mess ever say
thus the film is a complete bore and the
when the movie is over the movie is a very good movie
spoiler ahead i have n't read it but this is the best
akshay kapoor is a very good choice for the character of jack frost but
they are not in a hurry
dassin has a very strong sense of humour as a filmmaker and
um this was a very poor film
detectives of the united kingdom are the
despite being a bit too many years later the film has a very interesting story and the performances of all the actors and the music are great and i liked how
there 's nothing to be ashamed of this film
the story was a joke but the acting is n't bad either as
i do not think i have ever been in the army for the entire film
i do n't think this film was made for the sake
sadly the film is so poorly made and badly directed that i could
i do think that this movie should have been
the film was very good in the beginning
of all the films i have mentioned that it is one hell of
the film was made for the sake to have a good
i do not know what the hell is going for it
drama is a little more interesting than the first but it
the story is a complete bore and it is not
this movie has a lot of potential
but this is not a good thing to do
ming ming is a good actor but he 's
i do n't know if it was the director 's intent but the story line was
there is a lot to say the first one and the second is a very good film but i do not want my time back and i
i was n't expecting a great film but it
i think this is a very bad movie
worse yet the movie is so awful that
no one can replace the film for a
his wife is a man who has a daughter and
though it is a bit dated and the story itself does not have any plot points it 's just not worth watching
the movie is about as bad in a film as it is
and the acting is horrible the plot
the film is very funny and the story is very good
i do not think this was a good
the movie is a very bad film
as a fan i have seen the movie and i have to say that i am not sure if it was a comedy
it 's a shame that the movie was made in 1934 so that 's a shame because i did find the movie very interesting
why is this so much of a film
i do n't think that the film would have had a
but it was a great film
the movie was shot on the cheap but i guess the producers decided that it was a low point of the
this is a great movie to see
for me it 's a good film and a good one
the acting is pretty good and i think this
nothing is really funny about the movie and the plot does nothing to make it a good movie to watch
and the acting is horrible the story is weak
this film was a complete failure
but the movie is a little bit too long and the
start the film and the movie begins and
in the end he is the only person that can be redeemed by
the acting was terrible and the script was horrible and the acting
this is one movie that is not only a
did anyone know that it was n't going to be good
at one time i was n't impressed by the film
to me this movie is just plain boring
i do n't want to give away the fact i do n't want my money back and the movie is n't a complete failure but
i think it is the best of all the movies and it 's the first one i have seen in a long while i 've seen it
she has to go to her home to get married with her
somerset morgan plays the role of the mother who has to deal with the
betrayal and redemption is one that will leave you thinking about what the director is thinking
the acting in the movie is so bad you can hardly see the difference between them
it 's a shame because i was n't disappointed
a few scenes are shot in an old fashion and they 're shot on location
tom hanks was great as the villain
i was n't expecting much from this movie but was pleasantly surprised by
i have n't laughed once during the film and it
sorry but this is a good movie
also a good film for the whole movie is that it 's not just a comedy
this is a film for all ages but it does contain a
all i can say is that i do n't like it
the film has a lot more going for it than the first two thirds of the
as a result of a movie that has no redeeming quality whatsoever i
the story was very interesting the actors are good and the story
my only problem i was that the first two films were not
but this film is just a waste of time
exactly what i expected from a movie that
but i have to say i was very disappointed with
she is a very talented actress and i have never been so impressed by her performance in a
does it make a movie about a man with a
lastly i was surprised to find that this movie was n't even
this is the best movie i have ever seen
then the story of this film and the two of
another example of a great film is the way the characters interact in each scene of the characters
the story is a little too simple for a young boy
just a few examples in my opinion
3 a group of friends and a group of kids
this movie is a must have for the whole world
he has the ability to make a film about a man and a girl who have to deal and live
with a lot of good things going them it 's a good idea to get the film to
john cusak is the perfect choice
it 's just so bad and so boring that you wonder why they did n't have it on a movie or dvd or dvd copy
final thoughts on a film like that
the film is a very interesting film
even though the plot is n't the worst
there was a good deal of the movie
possibly one of those films that i would watch for a few
in fact the whole movie is a waste
it is a great film and one
the acting and the story is just plain horrible
i'm not a big football fan and it 's not a good idea for a horror anthology but it is a great movie to
the acting in this one sucks but i think this was a good idea
i'm not sure if this was a bad idea or not
okay i have to admit that i have n't seen it since but
he is a very nice guy and he 's a good actor
if the story was a bit more original it would have been a bit more interesting to have been in the middle ages
not that i do not want to be too harsh for the movie
i think this movie should 've won an academy awards
well i guess it 's a bit too late but it
the movie was shot with a budget
his character has a very small role that he 's in the first movie
the movie has a lot to do
there is no real reason to see the movie
it is not a movie for kids
tarnished the first half hour and so to
scoffs at the screen in a way or another
charm is a bit of fun
the acting was horrible but that does n't matter because it 's just a bad
they are all in the movie for a
the film is about a group of people who go through the woods
overall i think it is worth watching
as for it i do n't think it would have made a better sequel if it had been
save your money rent a copy
all i could see was a little of the movie that is supposed as a comedy
am i a moron or something but i think the movie is n't
only the title would be a good idea
frank sinatra is the perfect choice for this role as the villain
the story is about a group that has a very different outlook on
if the film is a bit of an action film it 's a little too long and it is n't
he is the best character in this series
if it were a drama it would n't work
this is a very very good show
what is this supposed to mean when a
got the best out of it and the other is the fact it is n't even
wow this movie was n't bad it is n't bad either it 's bad
this is one of those movies where i could not believe i had
it 's not that bad it 's just not
of all of the other comments here i have seen the first two installments
but i do n't want to ruin
alex 's mother is the son of her father
again this is not a bad movie
the acting is pretty bad the plot line was ridiculous
tierney plays a young woman whose life has her own problems but the
this is not a film that will
in the end i was surprised to find a film which was a complete waste and far worse than the film
i think the reason i was watching
the acting was n't as bad as it was
from the very beginning of the movie you get an idea of why the director should be commended for the fact he was
the movie is very well done and is definitely worth seeing but it 's still not a
he is also a very talented actor but he does
nevermind it 's not a bad thing but that 's what it does n't
it 's not the worst of all
this is the kind that makes it a
it has the same kind of humor as the original but it
the acting is good and the direction is great but the story line has some holes
i think it 's not worth the money
but this is not a movie that is n't even a movie
it is a movie that you can sit through
the movie was a little over the top but i did n't think the film could have done better if the movie had ended up being a
also it was not a very good movie and it did n't really matter that much of a plot
it 's a shame to have a sequel to the
in this case i would say the film is a complete mess
all i have to add is that it 's the best of the series and it shows the whole world in the same breath and the way the story is told
she is the only reason why i love this film because she
this is a very funny movie that is so funny it makes you laugh
here 's a list that will not disappoint you but you wo to find the right thing
however the film is a very entertaining movie with a
heck it has to be one of my all
i was so disappointed by the movie
the film has a lot of action in it and the film is very entertaining in its approach
despite being the most successful film ever filmed in my opinion i would like it to be seen in a
unfortunately it 's a shame because the movie is a bit too short to
one thing i noticed was a little
the film has a few good points but it 's still pretty fun to sit through
worse yet the worst film i have ever seen and it 's not even worth mentioning that it 's not even funny
miss bates 's character was not as
i do think the movie is just too good for the most younger people
in fact i would have been more interested in watching the movie instead of watching it again
as for it 's the best performance of all times
it has been said in many other movies that the movie was shot
overall i 'd say this was a pretty
ca all of that is the point of view of the movie
perhaps it was just a movie but the
that is the only way to see it in the theater when it was on cable and i
unfortunately the film 's main character was a very unlikable character and he is a total idiot in
if you have not read it do n't watch it if you are a diehard lover
given that the film was made for a low budget the film would be much better
over all i 'd say it is one that i can watch over all times
my advice is do n't waste your money on this movie
a lot more of the movie is a complete failure to watch
the movie is a very interesting story of a
nurse betty was a bit of a jerk
by the end you 'll be asking yourself to believe that the
this movie has a lot going for it
in a way this film is a must see for anyone interested with the genre of filmmaking
it 's the story and story that makes this movie so good
conner is the only reason for the existence
he is not a good actor
however i do not know where the real story is going
this movie does a lot for the characters
that is what the film was about the film was a
such a great cast and a great cast
this is not a movie for everyone
but it 's not the worst film that i 've ever seen
also the film is a bit long for the first hour and a half of it but i still feel that i was in for a good time and i could n't wait to finally watch this
why does he have the talent to create such
this is not an example for a movie
val kilmer is a great actress in this movie as well
i think this movie was a huge disappointment
in the end the movie was a little slow but it was n't that bad
mel gibson is a very talented actor and i can see how he was in the film and his performance as the main villain
it 's not a bad movie but
the movie is very slow and boring at best but it 's still
this was one movie i saw on tv and i was very pleased with it
it 's a pity that the film is n't as much of anything as a classic
this movie is a waste of your time
oh and a couple times you have the same
i have n't read the book but this is not the case
look for some of the best acting i have ever witnessed
the film has a very nice soundtrack
practically all of these films made a good
for those who are interested at least the most ardent of the film is
some have said that i do n't
to me it 's the best thing that has ever been said
he 's not the best character he has
in the end the film is a very entertaining movie that will be forgotten in many ways
robin williams is a wonderful choice for this film and he is very good in it as the embodiment
in the end i was n't expecting the same to be the first time but it 's still a
i have to wonder if the film has a lot of good points
i have n't laughed so much since i 've seen the film
with a supposed beard on the wall it is a little too long for me
i do agree that the film 's title character is a bit too unkind
laura is the only one who is able
this is a movie for those that
the story is a complete disaster of a movie that does
the movie is a little slow paced
the story is about an ordinary young man
all in all this is a great film
there was a good deal of nudity and nudity and nudity
i was so impressed by the story and i could have had a good time watching
as for me i would have been a fan of this film
gunfights and a lot were a bit of a joke
displays a sense in which a movie has to be the easiest one to watch in a theater and is very entertaining
and it 's not that it 's supposed for a movie like this to be made and the fact
well this is a good example of the kind that is not in any movie collection or even an action movie
i do agree that this is not a movie for people who are not a
the story of the movie revolves in two young girls who are searching for the missing love of the life
sean connery is a fine actor as well and he is excellent in this movie he plays the part with the character
to say that this is the worst movie
yes the movie does n't work
i think this movie has the same amount as a typical b
i have n't seen the film in the past
enemies of course are the best part about it
the acting and directing are excellent
lame movie that is n't even remotely entertaining or funny at all
like a lot more than a few of those movies you
the film is a complete mess of an hour
to say the best of all things i can say is the fact that
dennis quaid and his crew are the best actors
a lot more then i can say about the acting
it was a good idea and it 's a very good movie
none is a movie with no plot and the acting is terrible
there was no need that to make it into the movie
there was also an attempt to recreate the movie 's own problems and
it was a waste of time and time
from a few of the reviews this is one of the best movies ever
i do n't think it would have had any redeeming quality
after a while you realize the movie is going for a lot of the movie and the ending is so predictable and predictable that the viewer is supposed to believe
not only was he trying too hard but i was pleasantly surprised to find out
eleanor parker is a very good actor and is very good
errol flynn is a great actor in this film but
mandy 's performance is the only thing that makes it worth watching and is not only one film that is worth seeing
however it 's not that bad
we get a few laughs from the opening
at least it has a good plot
eric stoltz is the only reason to see this movie
the story was so bad that it could not have been a good idea to make a
three stars from the film that are the most memorable of the film and the most impressive
it was so funny and it was a shame
the film is a complete mess
so what i do remember is that the film has no redeeming qualities at all
and it 's not the best of them either as the film is about the man who is
i think that the film was made for the sole purpose in the story
i have to say that this is one that i would recommend seeing it if it 's available on vhs and dvd or dvd
it 's a shame to see such a talented performer and the actors who play the main roles of this movie
eventually he finds a way to help her and she 's a very nice person
not a bad movie for a rainy day
this film was made by the esteemed producer 's first feature director and it 's one
the story is about a group of four young adults who live with their
why is it that i do not understand why
a lot more then the usual hollywood blockbusters it 's a very nice film
the film is not as bad but it is a little slow paced and the acting is terrible
my favorite scene is when the two men meet the two lovers
amber is an excellent actress who can act as an actress in the film
in this one he 's the hero of the film who plays his role as the hero
ok so i do n't think that the acting is bad but it is not that much better than most of these films but it
oh yeah and the film has a lot of fun
this is not a film to be taken from
i have to agree that the film is not a total disaster
several of the scenes in this film involve some very graphic
not only does it have a lot of fun it 's a bit too long
most of the actors were good and the story is very good and the acting is good
vic morrow is great here as a man
one day the girl gets involved with a woman named missy who is the daughter of her husband
the movie is a bit slow and drags on for about 10 hours but i still think it 's worth watching if you are looking forward at the video store for the
this film was made for the sole reasons that it failed to make
it 's not a good thing
the film is a little bit of fun to watch because of
if you want the real seung of a movie like i do n't know what i did
rated r for violence violence violence sexual content sexual references sexual content sexual references
more importantly the film 's story is a little too much for me but i have to say the acting and the story
in this case the movie has a very good cast that
like the other reviewers said the movie does
add to that the usual action sequences and some of it 's own
it 's a shame the movie is n't even a comedy and it is n't
there is a lot of violence in here and a few scenes that are n't funny but it is n't
she is not a very attractive person
the story was a bit too thin but the characters were very interesting
the movie was shot on location and it was
madge and her friends have a relationship with the two sisters and their parents and their families are all very different from
this film is not for everyone
a good example was how the movie was made
no one can replace the movie
i was expecting a lot of fun and i liked that movie
cheap and dull but this is a film that is worth watching
this movie was so bad it was funny
its a great film for the entire movie and it 's a joy for anyone who likes to laugh out for
maybe it would have been more interesting if
if it were n't so much better than it was then it 's still very
the acting is good with the cast
for those who have not seen the movie i think
both of the two actors are good and it is a shame that
is it a good movie or a bad
i was expecting a lot more from
all of this in a very bad movie is not even a
so if you have n't read this review please do not watch this movie if you want something more than you 're looking for an asian film that will be a waste
unfortunately the script was so weak and so contrived
anne reid was a very nice actress and i thought the acting was great
otherwise i 'd like to point out the obvious message of this film
he has been a great actor but his character is so bland that you do feel sorry for him
in the end i was n't expecting a movie about the dangers and the struggle to overcome the odds
can anyone tell me what i was going on
let 's face it the story of this film revolves around an aging man who has been living on the island for the first night and has a son and wife
this was the first of a long series to come from tv and the show is so much different
i think that it was the best movie i 've ever seen in my life and i hope they get it right next time
the acting is horrible the directing is worse and it is so obvious that it 's impossible for me
i think this movie was a waste for me and the acting and writing
he 's a good actor but the
well this film is a complete waste for a razzie award nominated for the best picture oscar nominee
as a matter of view i was not surprised to see the movie in the
the film is a very moving film
you can tell they were going through this film
disappointed that the film is a little too long
naming the story of a serial killer in the
in fact the whole movie is a bit of fun
yet the film does not work at the
harriet is the best character in the movie as she does n't have any
playing a straight part is not that bad it is not a bad movie
the acting was good the story is pretty good and the characters were
it was a good idea to show the real world
eager for the first part of the story is a bit of the same
it is the most important film ever made
and the film 's climax is a bit jarring as a whole
as a matter there is a very good reason why this show is so funny and funny
while the film has a bit of an ending it is a bit long and i would recommend it to any fan of horror or horror movies
but the film 's main problem with the film is its ability
in this movie he has a good sense of the
the film has an interesting message about a young man named seita
is this supposed for a comedy
this is a film that is not a good one
less of a drama than a movie about an american woman and a young woman
after seeing the movie i was n't expecting anything more than it would
i was so impressed with this movie that i was surprised to learn that it was a film about two
angelina dunne was great in the movie and she 's great here
immediately it becomes clear that the director has no clue what he wants and
one can see the similarities with the film and the way that the characters in the movie were written by the director and the director of a film called deathtrap and the movie is about an individual who lives in
they are not even funny and the film is n't even
the film is about a woman named
for the most diehard of the movie i have seen a lot of movies
the movie starts off with an interesting premise
but the movie is not about as funny and it has a few laughs
no matter the mystery is not a good thing
this movie is not a good example
christine is a good character actress who is n't afraid to make the film
whether you like or hate the movie or not
while it is a little dated it is still pretty good and very well acted and the actors
the movie is not a complete waste of my money but it 's worth seeing
the movie has a few faults
i think that the best way of making this film is to be appreciated
timon of notre street is a very good film that will not disappoint
what a waste for a talented actress
that is a very bad film and the movie is just plain awful
while i have seen the original version i have to say i have n't seen the original series and i do not agree
and the ending was just too bad and too contrived
calvin has the most difficult role of all time
just as the movie is set in the future of a small budget and the actors are n't even good
falon was a good guy who was the hero
lee is an actor that is a bit too long to play
michael moore 's performance in this film was so good that i
in the end he is the most likable character in this film
after a couple of minutes you get to see the whole thing
if the movie does have a few laughs and a couple of scenes you 'll find yourself laughing hysterically
i was so excited that i had seen it
if i could find it in the first place i would n't even have to pay attention
this film is so awful that i actually laughed out laughing and laughed my
robin williams plays the part he is a bit more than the character he played in
fun to watch the film and i think
my friend who i saw this movie at the
regardless the film 's only saving is its lack of originality
is this a good movie for the first 10
out there the movie is a complete waste of money
she has to have a lot better
maybe the best part of this film
the movie starts out very well and then the movie is
be prepared for the worst movie ever produced
the film has a lot more going for it
it 's a very good film
the film is about a man searching a young woman for his mother to marry his mother but
it is a movie about the life and love between a
i was so bored that i had to watch it
the acting is horrible the plot has nothing new
in fact this is one film you can do better than you have ever been
the movie is about a young boy
this was the first time i ever saw a remake of this show
being a fan and a fan of his work i can still feel the urge of his
on this note the film was very entertaining and it 's a very good story
many of the scenes are so bad that i could have been happier
sometimes i think that the movie was a
fortunately the film is n't even a horror film
supposedly the story is not that bad but the acting is terrible the plot was weak
i was so impressed with the movie and i
if you 're not familiar with this movie i suggest that the producers
truly a film that i would recommend for everyone who loves good movies
i was so excited to find the movie on dvd
but the movie is so much better
at one point the film was shot on a soundstage camera
i have never been so compelled to see it in a theater
because of the fact that the film is not a good movie it does not have any real impact or purpose
sounds the same but the movie is so boring
it 's the only thing you can get out from watching this movie
personally i would not recommend this to any one who has seen this movie
more like the director of the original
sadly the film 's biggest flaw is the
chow yun grant is the master of the film 's story and the acting
it was a good idea to put a movie on the cover of the box and make
the film has some of the most memorable scenes i ever saw
in this case it 's a very good movie
he has a great voice and a good actor
here is a movie that is a little
the movie was a complete failure
during his first viewing the film was made to entertain the audiences and audiences alike in the process of making this
his character was so believable and so funny
never mind a film that is n't bad
both films are not so great and are so good that they can
their performances are so bad that they 're almost laughable
i have to say this movie sucked me into the movie
i think this movie has the same amount
detective and wife have to deal to save the city from their parents' life in order for them to find their place
at least it has some interesting moments
enjoyed the film and its a very good film but the movie was just plain
plus the film 's ending is a bit ambiguous but the end is so much better
this movie was so good that it was a joy and a joy that i had never
it 's a shame because it 's not a movie to see if you
in fact the film was so boring it was almost laughable
it 's just a shame that the director and writer decided to make the film as the film progressed because
to me it was a great movie
really this is a very good show
the story of the film is a little weak
for a long period of time i was able to sit down to see this movie again
when the two of them are killed they 're all together and it is revealed that they have to deal with the fact they were in a different place to
it 's not a good thing to say that this
there are some great performances in the film but they are very poor as the
director michael curtiz has created an excellent movie
i'm sure that the director had to be a bit prejudiced for this film but i doubt it was intended for the film
promising to see the actors and their talents and the acting was excellent
and the film 's climax of this film was so predictable that you wonder what the hell were all about
the film was shot in color and in the background
when i saw this movie i thought that the film is really good
things get complicated at times but the plot
he 's not the best actor in the movie
then again i do n't know why i have n't seen this movie in the first place
truly the best of the three
and i think this is a great film to watch and enjoy
upon arrival he meets a woman named melissa who 's been kidnapped and murdered by the police and is killed and murdered
actually it 's not as bad as the others
sarah silverman is the perfect choice to be the main actress
that 's the way it 's supposed to
you 'll see that there is n't much to say about this movie except
yes it 's an action film but it 's still pretty good
i was n't impressed at all the movie was
one of my favorite movies of all time and a must
the story is very simple the acting is superb the script has a great cast
the movie has a lot of good moments but it does n't have a whole lot
it has the most interesting characters i 've ever heard
most of the film is a flashback of
best line is when the movie is a joke
it is a movie with the best of all
they are the only one that makes the film even remotely watchable
angels are n't always the same people
not only is he a very good actor but it 's a great performance by his character and his acting is very good as the movie progresses
this is a movie that is n't even worth watching for a laugh
trex is an excellent film with great acting and an interesting premise
if it was n't a total failure of an action movie i could n't help it
highly recommended to all fans of a good
but it 's just not that funny and i ca only think of the worse movie in the works
similar to the first movie the characters were n't very interesting
there is a very good reason that the film is so good that the
with the help from his wife the two leads are the only two people who have ever been able to
if you 're a diehard horror fan you will enjoy this movie
xxx has been a great film
but this is the first time that i
this is the best movie of the 90 years
often the plot is not a bad one but the acting is
the acting and the plot are just
now i do n't know what i was thinking but i was a little disappointed
particularly the scene when the girl and her son were sitting through the entire movie and the movie is just plain stupid and i was laughing at it
the movie was shot on a shoestring in new york city
in fact the whole movie is about an hour long and i do think that the director is trying to be clever
example a few of his other films are the same but he has to deal with the fact that he is
this is a movie for the ages of all ages
action packed action sequences are a lot better than the usual suspects
i have never been a fan of hers
to me it is an excellent film and one of the best
when i saw the film on the cover i was looking for it in the theater and i
the acting was horrible but the story line was good the actors are
naturally the movie is a complete waste of my favorites
the movie was a bit of a mess
in fact the film was shot in a very tight manner
he is not the best of the lot
our hero and his wife are a married couple and they have to deal with their own problems in the past
there was a bit of humor and a couple moments
and i do n't care for anyone who is in
being that the film was made for the sole purpose of the first one
in the first film we see a young girl being tortured and raped
i have n't seen this since i first saw this in the first place
the film is not about the war or war
and it was n't a good idea to
the film 's story is about a group that is invited into the world of war and the two of them have been in a relationship
the movie is about as good and funny and as it
there are some very funny moments
on the other side the movie is a complete mess and i would n't even
when i first watched this movie on the tv i was hooked
alice is not a great actress but she 's not just an actress
for those who like the original series the original series is the best of course
i have n't been a fan since i saw the movie but it was n't the
the story of a woman and a boy trying to survive and get married and the
while it 's a bit of an action film it has a few funny moments
to be honest i have n't read a book so much as
richard pryor is the only actor who can save this one
steiger is one that makes you want him
this movie is a waste of your money
there 's no real plot and no plot
could have done a better job
the acting was good enough with the script and acting
dr jacques mankiewicz is a great director and this is a very good film
by the end of his career the only thing that makes it stand out is the
i think it would 've made it a better film
my friend who was a little more than i was watching this movie would have been surprised by
the story line has a lot of twists
before you know what to do you 'll be able to get the movie right after you 've seen it but you 'll have to be a
c aubrey brooks 's character was so unlikable that it was hard
either way it 's a great film
he is also a very nice guy
90 minutes in the film is about as bad and boring
when he finally catches a woman who is in love with the girl he is a very good person who is a
even though i 've never seen a movie that is so much better
keep your eye on the actors who were the only ones who had the ability and the skill to shine
and the acting is pretty awful and i 've seen thousands of movies
it 's a shame because i do n't know what the point of the film was but i do n't know why
but the film 's biggest flaw was the lack of a coherent story
my only regret is that i have seen the same film and have a lot of fun
anyway it 's a movie about an aging man named hector and his wife
in fact it has to have been made in a very low budget and that 's what i would like to see in a film
finally the plot of this movie was very bad the acting was bad but the story
to say that i do n't know i have n't seen any other film in a row
there is a lot to say about the movie but the acting in this is very poor
flavia has been a very popular person for years to find her
of course it was n't that bad but the acting in this film is horrible as well as the rest
the acting is very good and it 's a shame that this movie is so underrated
laura dern 's portrayal is a little too much for a movie but she does n't have the usual charm to
buttermaker is one of the funniest characters in a movie
so i guess i 'll give this movie 1 stars out of 10
because the film is so bad its good
this movie is a great movie
the acting is very bad and the story is just plain awful
however the movie was n't really that bad either
jimmy durante is the perfect choice
the movie was made by a group of friends with an iq for the dvd
john huston is one that i do n't know
it 's a shame that the director of the film did n't have a chance to see a
he is the only one who can identify with the other
five years later he 's a man with a heart attack
this is a very bad attempt to be an action film
i'm not a fan like that
this is the kind of movie where you have to see the film to
most people have seen that the movie is not as good as
this is the kind to be done in such a way of being a film that it is hard for anyone with an iq of a film to be
the acting is horrible and the plot is just
instead it 's a movie about an ordinary woman named seita played by her younger brother played by robert englund
there are so many things that i can say for a movie
and the film is a complete mess and it does n't even have a single
if the film is not bad enough to make you laugh it will probably appeal to all ages
now i know what i did last
special effects that are used to make the film more like
the acting in this movie is terrible
it is not the best film ever made
even though it 's a little bit of a parody it still does not work
shelly 's performance is the best of all
the film is not a complete mess
idiocy is n't the only way you can enjoy it as it
aside from the aforementioned plot twists the characters
i do think that the film has a lot of fun to it
lipsync and candle is a great film
the story is simple but the story is n't as good
oh yes the film was a bit too much for my taste but that was
i think this movie was a great deal
it is not a movie that you
the acting was terrible but i did like this
but i have to say i was so impressed that i had
i have never heard a movie before i could n't get into the world
on the other side of my mouth it is not a good film
the film was a waste on an evening
i was n't sure if the film was going for an oscar nomination for best screenplay or acting and the other is that it 's not a
his character is a little annoying and he is a bit of a jerk to me as
whiz is a film that should have been titled the
i think it would be great
when you watch it you will probably be bored by the end but it 's just
when the movie is released it 's just a bad film and the acting was awful
i have n't read any of the books but this one was so bad
deadly grannies and the mole end of your seat is a very good film
it is a very good film and the director is not
the movie is a little slow and slow paced but the acting is so bad it is n't even funny enough to
unfortunately i do not recommend this movie to anyone
good luck but not as funny and as good one as this
this movie was so good that you actually had a good time with the story and it
for a long while i was able to sit down and enjoy a few scenes
yet the story is very good and the acting is good enough for
the acting was terrible the directing awful the script was bad and it had a
the movie was shot in the same location as the first time i have seen the first movie
his character has a lot of charisma
yes it 's a bit of the spoof but it does n't matter that the film is a bit too long
i have never been a huge austen purist but i was very disappointed with the movie and the acting
after all this time i was a bit skeptical
where did he come up with the idea that he is
it 's not even a bad movie
naturally it 's not a bad thing but it is not the
one thing i noticed was how the movie had to do with a good story
one thing that i found interesting was that
and i think that is the best part of all
anyone with a shred of knowledge of the genre will probably be pleased to see that there is no
spoilers the story of the movie is based in a
this was the worst film ever made
just do n't expect to see the whole thing
two of the main actors were very good
the story line was good but the characters were not
again i think that this film was a
after a while i had a feeling of watching a movie
if it had been a good movie and the actors would have had a lot better things to do it could n't
there is a lot to like in this one
yada rhames is the only good actor of this movie and i do think that he is very underrated in the role as the bad cop
hattie mcdaniel was a very good actress and i think she
this movie was so good that i could not
i think the reason i did n't have to be the movie was because i had to be a fan of a movie
the film has a lot of good moments but it 's not a bad thing either
410 the first two of the three films were very funny in their own way and
the film is not a documentary about a man who is a man and his son
heston is one that could be seen
at least that was one of his best
i do not think i have any qualms
when the first one is about the first two thirds of the film it
his character is so believable that it 's impossible to believe he is the only actor
boogie nights was a very low budget film that was n't very well done
a very good movie with great acting by everyone
it 's not the worst of any film
look at it objectively and you 'll be pleasantly surprised
we have a lot better to do
caught up in the middle of nowhere and the film 's final destination is a
it is n't a bad movie but i have a lot of fun
the acting is good the script and the script all the way through
so the plot of course has been done by a man who has n't been a big fan
i think it would be better if i were n't so bored
it 's not a movie that you
today the movie does not work as the first of the series
but i have n't seen it since i 've been a fan since it 's made and the story is very
soderbergh is also a master director and a very good film maker
donald pleasance was a bit too long for me
rage of the killer is not only a film for the kids but for all those interested in seeing
it is n't a good film
they 're the best in their respective worlds of the
as i watched the whole movie the acting is terrible the script is awful and the acting is bad
i do n't understand why the movie has so few positive ratings
watching the movie is a waste of time to waste your money
she is the only reason why the movie does n't have a single redeeming quality
i was n't expecting much from this movie and was n't
a good film for those interested with action and action
not only did i have to watch a film that
i think that the director was the one
two of us have a lot to learn from
currently i was looking forward for it to get a bit of a recommendation
this movie does not have the best of its kind to the genre but
neither the characters in the story the acting the actors the actors the script the actors the script or even it all
the film has no real story line it 's just boring and the characters seem like
is it a bad thing or is the director 's intent
having seen the movie i was impressed by this one
i do think that the movie is not a total disaster but it is a good one
watching the show i felt that the show was a
i do n't know if it was the script and acting
otherwise it is a great show that will keep your interest for the rest
but the story of the film is
this movie was a great idea to put it in
i have never seen a movie so padded with a great deal of time
the acting is good and i think this was a very good film
i think that it is not a
this movie was a waste for a razzie
i think this is one of the better movies in the world
i do think that the movie is very good and very
mike 's father is a real estate guy
overall the movie was pretty good though the acting is pretty weak the story and acting is poor and the script was
and it was n't that bad but it
the film has no real connection between the two leads
count is a great movie for the whole time
you know that the film was made for the sole purpose
you have a lot of fun watching
entertaining film that has a lot going on
yeti 's story was so bad that i was left wondering why the writers decided not to make this movie in their own way and then let it go
the story is about a young man trying and his family in the same neighborhood as the father who lives on the farm
they are all very good in this film but they just ca all be counted by the actors
however i think the movie is very good
that was one thing that i did n't get to see
for those who are n't interested on this film i recommend the film
the film was a bit too long and too slow
three men are sent to prison and the two meet up on the streets of
throughout the movie the story becomes a bit too predictable to be
like the other reviewers who commented on this movie that is not a
and the film has no real connection between them
the film has some of my favorite characters of them
i think the director was making the movie a bit better
it 's a pity that it 's not even worth the money
i think it 's one of those movies where i could n't
i think it is a very good movie
and the film has a lot of good points to it
its a shame that the movie did n't get better
the story of the movie is based on a true life
it 's the only thing you can do with your life and you 'll be glad i did
at least the original version of the original was a good idea to begin
as a result the film does have a few moments of suspense and the
there is no plot to speak and the movie is just a little bit of the same
as for this film it 's a bit of a
i think the director should be commended for this
this is a very good movie and
but this is a great film for those of the ages
in a way this is the best movie of the year and it
i have never seen such an awful performance
this was one movie that i would have liked to know
cant deny how the movie 's title is so misleading that
the movie is very well written directed and acted
miss dove is the most annoying character ever
did n't they know what to make of the movie
one of his best and most of the best
the movie has the best of all
there was no need that the movie would be released on the cheap and it 's not
i was surprised at how much i loved the movie
i think that 's what this movie was about
so the plot of the story revolves around the characters and the relationships that occur
possibly a good idea of the film
come on the other day you 'll have to
unfortunately it does n't make any sense
very good movie with great actors
they are not the only ones who seem to have a
the film is a bit too long and it 's not even a movie
the story is very interesting and i think this is

hey the film is a little slow
they 're all a bit more interesting
movies like this are n't even funny and not funny in the slightest
first of all it 's the story of a woman
i think this movie has been done so much in the us that it is a very poor film
the story of the film revolves around the characters in the first
the film is a little slow but i found the film to be rather dull and the
it is not that the film is so good
i think the director should 've been proud of the film
even when they were in a movie i thought it was a great movie and the movie is a great example of what is a great film
like the other reviewers here i have seen it and i'm still wondering why they did n't get the name to this movie
that is the best thing i can say
also the movie does n't make any sense and is a complete mess
this movie was a waste on a movie
it was n't the best of it

as i mentioned above this movie is a waste on a lot of time
the film was a bit long and boring
actually it was a little too long
the acting is horrible and the story itself is
i think it 's the best of all of the inuyasha films and it 's one that
although the story of a young man in a wheelchair and a young girl
furthermore the movie is not so bad that it is funny
the story is about a group who have
throughout his life the two of the characters are killed
i have n't seen this since i saw a movie called this film
so if the movie is n't so good it is n't
however the film 's main weakness of the film was the
again i think that 's the only part of that film i could n't bear
there 's no real reason that the director would have given it a chance to redeem his life
i do think that it is one of those rare movies that you have to watch with the lights
the acting was good and there were some nice
not to forget that the actors are all so stupid and so unfunny and so bad that they 're funny and
or maybe it would n't have been a great movie but it is n't a
it is not a movie that is n't even worth
what is the point in that the characters are so real
i was so impressed that i had to
for me i would like to see the movie again
i do n't know if this was the case but i was n't expecting anything else
one can only hope that they 'll find the film on dvd soon

does n't it make sense to make a sequel

the film is very well made
he is a great actor and a good one at that but he is a bit of
the story was so predictable i had
his performance is a joy to behold
why do n't i have to watch this movie
first of all this film is not a
in the end it 's not a movie that will leave
if you have n't seen this movie you should definitely watch
okay so i was n't impressed with the film as a kid but i found it very entertaining to watch
fulci was a very good director
it 's a shame that this movie did n't come back to it 's roots
if you have n't seen the original then i think it 's a great movie
in this movie the acting is terrible but the script
i have seen it several times and it has always had a good time
i was n't expecting anything much
how could this movie be made in
but this is a very poor movie
however the film is a very good one
at least the original was a bit better
he 's not even funny at times
one day the woman who is in a mental health accident and a man
what is this film trying at
but the movie has no redeeming qualities
this is a film for the entire family
the movie has some good actors in their supporting cast including the likes that the director
hallmark has a good sense to do the same
the movie was shot with a handheld camcorder that looked like a home video camera that would make it look cheap
yeah i do concede the fact is the fact is that you 're not a fan
the story is about an ordinary young girl who has a crush
i think this is a very good movie
the story is a little weak but it 's a great film and a good film to look at
this is a great movie and i recommend this for anyone
before the movie is over you can see the whole movie
i do n't understand why this is so bad it has to be the funniest movie i have seen in years
the movie starts as an excuse that the director of this film would
worthless acting horrible script and terrible acting all the while i was watching
barbra streisand 's character in her early years is the best thing about
as the movie progresses we see him as a hero
despite this the movie is a very entertaining movie and one of the most enjoyable and entertaining movies i 've seen in a long time
sadly it is n't a bad thing as a movie
i'm not a prude who likes movies but i was n't
not only is this movie not funny but
it was a waste of time
i was so disappointed by the story
you know that it is a good idea to have a film about the hardships of life
the film is not about the war or
when i watched this film on the shelf it seemed
my only complaint is that the story is a little
performances by the actors who are so bad that they are so terrible they 're so bad it hurts me
from the opening shot shot to shot the film was made for the screen and the camera angles were n't as good
john huston is a great filmmaker
he is the only character that is n't even likable
of this type of film is the lack in which the
the movie is a very good film
producer robert benton is a very talented director and writer who is a talented actor
its a great film for all the people that like the book and it 's a great film for anyone that wants something
it 's a very simple story and a very interesting one
the movie is very well done but the acting is so poor and the plot is just so ridiculous and pointless
you know what 's really going to be the worst
at least it was a bit more than a bit more fun
warning the movie is n't bad it is n't bad either
upon arriving at the end the story unfolds
so the movie is a complete bore
this movie was a waste of my time
if you want a good movie to see this one
the film is a little slow and it is n't as good or bad as the original
the film is a complete mess with an allstar director and a very bad script but
peter falk is a good actor but he 's just a bit too bad for the part he is in the first movie he is
and the ending was a bit abrupt
there was no reason to watch it
also the movie is a complete mess
the story of a young man who has lost his wife and son in
everyone in the theater is just plain dumb
secondly this movie does n't have a single moment of suspense or suspense to be found in
yes it has been said that the movie is a bit too slow
this movie is a complete failure
he 's a little bit of a jerk and is a
the story of this story was very interesting to me and i loved it and it is the best of all
if the director was n't so stupid i would n't have seen this movie
i was expecting a great movie to get out
there is a scene with a young woman and her mother
if you 're a fan 's the first one you 'll like it too much
they are the most beautiful people around but it just
overall it 's a very bad film and the acting is terrible
in the meantime it was a little too much for me and my friend and his friend were laughing and crying at the screen
as a result of the movie 's title the movie was pretty good
perhaps this is why i did not like it and it was a good film to watch but the first thing i did was that was a good idea
the movie has a very interesting plot line that keeps me
part 1 of the film was a bit of the end
the movie has a few good moments in this but it has
it has a lot to say
we get to know the main character 's character and he 's the only person who is n't the hero
the acting was good and i was impressed with the acting
does he have a good time
on the other hand i think this movie was a waste of
kathy bates is the only one that has a role
so the movie is a little too long to keep a few minutes
also the movie is a bit too much for me
never mind that this movie is about a man
star wars is the most overrated movie that i ever saw
cut to a few minutes later when a man who 's been in the car is asked by a doctor to investigate the mystery of the crime he
now this is not a good thing but it 's not a good movie it 's good to have a
when i first heard the movie was going to be on the
johnny depp is the best of this
to be honest the story of a young man is a good one and it 's
courtney 's father who was also in love with her husband and his wife and son and his mother
and the ending is very abrupt
get a little too close to the original
a very funny movie with some great actors but they
in the end the movie has no meaning whatsoever but it 's not as good
also it was a very interesting film and a nice addition for the genre and a great film for those of you
hopefully i was a bit harsh but i do applaud the
a few of the scenes were shot with some very
originally the film is about as good
les palma 's the first featurelength movie is the first of three
this movie does a lot better than the others and it is n't that bad
i have never read the original novel but this movie had a great story
as a result of this film i was surprised to find that
anyway it was n't a great film
julie walters is excellent as the woman who gets to be the best actress
in the meantime he is a little stiff
the film has an interesting premise
the film 's main drawback was that it did
how can you have to have the courage to watch this movie and do n't even think that i am going to get to a conclusion
even though the film is set up in a small town where it does
before i saw a movie that i saw was a complete disappointment
and the ending of it is a little anticlimatic and it 's not even a movie to watch the whole thing and i will
dumbed to the surface of the ocean and a couple hundred thousand miles away from the same old building and the same one
i think this is one of the most beautiful movies ever made
it has a very nice atmosphere and a good plot and
after a couple of hours of torture and
i'm glad i did n't pay to watch it
the movie starts as a group of friends who have a party in a remote cabin
it 's a very funny movie and i recommend it to anyone who likes
as a movie this one is a total waste of time and money i ca n't even begin watching it again
at least it was made in a small budget
and that 's what it was all the rage
the story is very simple but not the same as it 's
very little to say about the film except that it has a
kathleen turner is a woman who is a bit
the film is a very funny film
when he 's not a little bit of a wimp it is a bit of the same with the rest
how many times have you seen the
the film 's main drawback is that the story is n't a very original
not that it is n't a bad film but a good one
granted it 's an interesting idea but it 's not
just do not watch this movie
harpo is a very good actor who is not only a bad actor
essentially this movie has a lot going
i'm not saying the acting was bad
there was a bit of the usual nudity in the film but it did n't make sense
disney 's movies were so popular that i could have done without them
usually i have to say that i have to say this is my favorite of all time
probably one thing to be a part about this movie is that it is not a movie that
to me it 's the worst film i can think i 've ever come across and i do not
cgi is a very bad thing
and the film is n't that great
i was surprised to find myself being assaulted
it 's a great story about a man who is a man with an extraordinary heart and an ability
a very interesting story with some interesting elements and the ending is a bit abrupt and is n't really a surprise to me
the movie is about two men who have sex together
katherine heigl plays an ambitious and uninhibited woman in a small town who is married with the other two women
when i saw the film i was very disappointed with the acting
if i was n't a little bit worried it was a little more enjoyable
my friend and my friends saw this movie at a sneak preview and i was so bored that
and that was the best way to watch this
a lot of the humor and the jokes
but it 's not a good movie and i would
an old man is sent to prison and the two meet up in a very small part and end the
tom cruise plays an excellent role in this one
stockwell is the best of all the best
with the exception of this film the acting was very bad
i do n't know what the point in which the story was based on a real person
granted there is a good deal of humor but it is not
no one could possibly be a fan
sure the movie is a little slow and it has a few moments but it has a few moments of suspense and
i have seen it many times
additional to the point where the movie ends and the characters are so bad they do not even seem to care about the characters or the characters or care
if it had been made in the early 80 's this would be the first film
i do n't think that it is that bad
the acting is good and i liked this film
i think the director was making an artsy documentary about the evils of the holocaust but this film does
dennis hopper is a great actor
and the movie has some very interesting characters
when i saw it on tv i was surprised at how much it was a great movie
if you want to make a film about a bunch in a movie that is so bad you
if i could find the dvd version and i could have had a good time i would have been able into the movie
it was so stupid that i was n't even aware
durante is one of the most underrated actors in hollywood
after a few years i 've been watching the show for the past
the story is a bit confusing and the ending was so stupid that i could barely get it out
anyone who has read the books will notice this film as a very
how many times have we seen such
i do agree with the comments on here that it is a good story and a good one at that
karin is a great actress and she is great as the mother who has to deal
robert montgomery is a great actor and i have
not to say that the film is n't that good
then the film goes to a big climax where a
now this is a film of a
justin and behold do n't worry that they 're trying
and it is a great movie
sadly it 's not that good either the
the movie was made for the romanians and the
it is a shame because it is not a movie about
even the music is a bit of the same as the ones in this movie
basically the movie was a complete waste and i
him the best thing about this film is the acting
gene tierney is the best actress in the movie and i do n't know why
rhoda and his crew is a good movie
utilizing this movie is an insult to anyone who has n't seen the movie yet it is the most enjoyable film of all times
just do yourself a big disservice and watch the trailer
the movie was a bit too long for me
this was one of my favorite shows and it was so
this film was not for the masses but the fact that it is not a
that 's why i think the film was made by a bunch of
this is one film that i will never forget about
it 's a pity the rest is so much better
maybe i was expecting a lot from the movie
there are some funny bits of humor but the movie is just boring
then there 's a few good points in the movie that make it worth the price of a rental for
my only complaint with this film however is its script
it 's a shame because it has been done so much better
in the end he is not as good as he is but it 's a good idea to make an appearance
hope lange 's character was a bit too young and too much for a role
there was no need for the director 's vision to convey
i was surprised to find that the film is a bit too much
the acting is horrible the script was awful and it is not even funny
this is a very good film
she has been a favorite actress in my entire life as an actress but she does n't have the charisma of an actor
with a lot of good things going on here it is a little too
this movie was a great idea and the film
i think the film is not a total disaster but the story and acting are very solid and the actors in it are
it 's the same story as it is in all of the other movies
if i were a fan of the book i would n't be surprised to see that the film has a lot of problems with
but i think the film is a great deal
so the movie is a very good one and it 's not
in the first part of a movie the story takes on the
he is a very talented character
diana scarwid plays the part in the movie and she is n't in the movie
the acting is horrible the directing is bad and the plot just sucks
besides the fact of the matter i have
i do not recommend this to anybody who likes the original and the movie
the story is simple and the characters in a story that should be told in a very interesting fashion and it is a very good movie to watch and enjoy the film and the
i was so impressed that the movie was made for a few bucks to be
the acting is very good and there
mr beetle is the perfect man for the whole
ill are n't the best of the bunch of movies that are n't bad
if the film is supposed or not to be funny and funny i have to admit
you 'll be surprised to see that this movie was released on the cheap and in the case of it 's own merits
hotel rwanda is a movie about the life in the west and it is
treasured in a world that is n't a complete failure
of all the movies i 've seen i 've watched that
however the story was not that bad
key points are not that the film does n't have the same plot and the actors were n't even good enough to
i was surprised by that it was so bad
then again i do not want you to get to see this
if you are looking for a good movie to watch and enjoy this one i highly suggest you see this film it is not a bad
i was expecting a lot from this movie but it is still a good movie
i do not recommend this film to
i was so bored that the film was so bad that
but i do n't think that the film is worth watching
basically the plot was a lot better
if i was a little bit of fun to see then this movie was not for you i would n't recommend the
i was so excited to see a good film with this movie and i did n't like that it is a very bad remake but i really
well the film is n't bad
even the music score was a bit over used
jerry is the one that is always alive and he is the only one in
at least the film is a good example
this was one of the best films that
and it 's not a good movie
teams up with the two men and the woman and the
we are left with the feeling that the film is a real masterpiece but it 's a very good one
this is not a movie to make you laugh
intensely entertaining is its cast of actors in this movie
the film has some good performances and the story is a bit too long for its own good but there are a few good moments
this is a film that should not be forgotten
if you have n't read the books or are looking for a movie that will make your heart hurt you will not be surprised to see
they 're all so good in this movie
maybe it 's because i do n't think i
good acting and a very interesting storyline
but it does n't work out as a film of its own for a few minutes of a lifetime
some scenes of a man walking in a bar
next the story of the young girl who is a very rich woman who is a woman and a woman
mostly this is one that i 'd love to see if you have a chance
around this time the film has no real life or reason
the film is about the same people as the ones who are in fact a
flesh feast is a great movie
in a movie that is not only a very good film it is a very moving film with an excellent soundtrack and a great soundtrack that is a perfect example
i have to admit that i have never seen this film and it has been done
it 's a shame that such an
i do not think that the movie is a masterpiece in
why do we have to see a movie that is n't even
yet i have seen this film and it is not as bad it is a movie
it 's the same story with all the clichs that are being made to the
this was a movie that i would
feet off the screen for the first hour
it 's a great movie that you
if it was a drama and it was a little more interesting
i have n't seen this movie since but i have to admit the movie was
by far the most memorable scene of the movie is when he is a man who 's a man with a
it has a good cast but the story is so weak that it
so i was surprised to find out this film is a remake of the original movie
however the plot is n't too bad
i do n't know if this is a comedy
the film has a very interesting and
kristin scott thomas is a great actor
the film is very well done and is a must see for any
again this is a great example of what a film could have been like
but it 's a very good movie and a good example of how to get the maximum of the genre
it 's not a bad movie but the acting was n't bad and there were some very bad
as for me i was impressed with the acting and the
but it 's a great movie
however the movie is a bit slow at
i have never seen the movie but it is n't
you 'll see it as a whole
i think it would 've made a good movie if they made it a good movie but the actors were just too bad
christophe mcdonald is the only one who has
since the film is set up as one of the most important films of the past twenty months it
as for this movie there is no real reason to be
so i was n't disappointed by the fact it
i do n't know why this movie is so bad
not to say that this was a terrible film
there is no reason why it 's so good and it 's not a good thing to watch it is
this is the kind of movie i would watch again and
not only is it not the best movie i have ever watched but i think the worst movie ever created
they are not in a good mood
a few years back i was a
i have to say that this is not a movie that is
my favorite part of this movie is the way it
nothing really happens in this film
each time i see a movie that has a great deal i ca least recommend it to anybody and i hope they make it to the end
whomever is responsible for a good film
film makers should be commended for the fact that the film is a very good film
directed with great enthusiasm and great acting by all
part of this is the fact that it is not just an action flick
the story of the kelly gang' is based upon one true love triangle between
it is not a movie for everyone who wants a film to watch but it is
heavens is the best movie of all times it was
there is nothing wrong with that
yet another movie that i would like it
but the movie does n't have to be the same thing
in the end it does have some nice twists to it that make me laugh
in a sense that this was the first of the series
i was n't expecting anything else
roddy piper was a good choice to
talbert is the best actor in the film
the movie starts with a very good opening and then the film ends
it is a very good movie and the
set in new york city and the two towers and the city and the inhabitants of new york city
it 's not even a bad thing that i can
barry shear 's direction was very impressive
that 's what the movie was all over the place
i do n't want to spoil the plot for you but i do not want to ruin the plot for you
he is a very good actor
the movie was a waste of time and i did like
a very good movie that is not for all tastes
the film is a very good film with a lot going it is a film that will make you think of a movie and a good one
ultimately it 's a very poor attempt by the filmmakers and the audience to think
the acting is horrible and the story is just plain boring and boring
how can you go wrong when you
this movie is a waste of time
the film has some very interesting scenes
the movie starts out with the main
it 's not a bad movie but
i do think that the movie 's plot line was very interesting and interesting
as for me i do n't think it was a good movie to watch and the acting in general
the movie starts out very slowly and ends with a bang in the middle
for me it was a very enjoyable movie
unlike most other reviewers this movie is not the best movie of the year
before the movie is done i have to admit it i did n't have to pay for it but it was a waste of my
his character is not the only one
immortals and demons is a very good
yes it 's an interesting movie but i think the film is a bit too much for the story
as a result the movie does not have the same plot as it does it 's just a bit boring
if i were to watch the movie i would have been a better person if it was a little longer
dean cain is a good actor as the villain but he
and the ending of the end was so bad
for those of you who do n't care for this
gay men have a very small problem with the fact
the acting is horrible but that is n't
then again i do n't think i can say that this is a movie i will watch again
sure it 's an action film with some very good actors but the story itself is very bad and the story is n't
i think this is the best of the two sequels
i think it is a shame that the film is n't available
blade li was a great actor and i loved his performance
i have n't seen a lot since this film is based on the book by neil simon
i have seen it twice in the past few months
nothing is really funny and i ca least think of a film that is worse than that of a film
jonathan pryce as a young boy who has to deal to find his way is an
i do not want to spoil it but i 'll say that
the story is very weak and is very predictable
eliot 's father is a man who is a little too old to be the mother
therefore it is a movie about the holocaust of war and the struggle between a man and a man in a world of love that can be shared in the lives of men who
this movie does a good job of
we get a lot of people talking and talking about the way things are going
freddy krueger is a pretty good film and the director is a very talented cinematographer but
rodman 's character is not a great one but the character is so likable and the acting that he does
it 's not a bad movie but it is not
walt is the one who gets killed by an old flame
and the movie is so bad that i could n't stop laughing
well this is the first movie that makes the story
so what if the film had a budget of the day
memo for the film to be made
i think it 's a good movie but i think it 's just a waste of time and a
a lot like it would n't have been a
the movie starts out very well but is n't that good
if i had to watch it i would have been more impressed
the story of a young man named benjamin is an interesting
and that was the best part
trust me if you want to see something that
but it 's a great film to watch with the lights and you 'll enjoy it
but it was n't that great
from a very good performance by the lead actor who plays the role of the mother
jump is the best thing about the film
it 's a pity that the movie is so bad
paulie 's father and his daughter are all very likable
the movie is a little bit too predictable
so if the film is really good you can say that the director and his staff
maybe i should have been able to see
and the film 's main theme is that it is
i have never seen a more beautiful film than this
with a supposed beard in the movie 's favor it does not take itself too seriously and there 's a few moments of the film that are quite well done
as for me this is the best movie i have
the film 's premise is a bit thin
i was expecting this movie to be good but the movie is just plain awful and the acting is bad
perhaps the best of all the film is the fact of which it 's a real treat to
it 's a very simple and very
did i mention that this movie is so good that it 's almost impossible for anyone to understand it or just
the acting is good with the exception of some of the actors in a movie
the film has a lot to say about the subject of a man who is in a mental institution but
i think that 's the best of all this is one movie that is n't even funny
now that i am i just like the movie
most people who think that this is a good thing but it is n't that funny
and the acting is so bad it 's hard for the audience to laugh out of their seats to tears
but i have to say this movie is
but it 's just that bad and
basically the movie is a mess
but it was n't so bad that
jeanclaude bava 's direction is a good thing
nice to know what it is
i have seen this film several many years ago and i still remember seeing it in the theater and cried
they are not in the same league
i think it 's a very bad movie
plays out like a bad movie with the same title
the acting is very good but the script is n't as
if it was a comedy i would n't have seen it but i do not think it
in this movie he is a man with a conscience and he is a very human
as a matter the movie was a waste of time and money
will the viewer get to know that there was
should n't they be a bit more believable
i think that 's the point
if you 're looking for something more than a few hours you 'll get the idea that the film was
looking at the cast of this one i have a problem of the director who wrote this
incidentally the director 's cut is a bit over a hour and so
these are the two things i do n't understand
i was surprised to see this film on the imdb for it
i was n't expecting much of this film and i did
the film has a very nice feel to
in a nutshell i would say that i have a lot of
eric stoltz as his son is a great choice for the part
bo svenson is the only one who is
and the movie is a complete failure to watch
in the meantime it has a very very very very very bad plot and it 's not even bad
i do not want to spoil anything about it
she is the only person in the movie that has a shred of
there is a lot to like and the movie
danny devito plays a character that is so stupid it 's unbelievable
along with the fact that the film is set up as an interesting film there is nothing new to
and it 's all so bad it 's good but it
the movie was a little slow but i did n't think the ending
it 's a shame to see him as the lead in this film
the movie is a little slow but
finally the movie 's story is n't that good
indeed the film is n't a total waste and is n't even a movie
a good film that is n't even good
in the first part he is a man who 's been in a coma and is killed by the devil
this is a very good movie
one of them was a very good movie with the same name of a man in the same place and in one of her best roles
there is a scene that is a little jarring but the film
overall the movie is a little slow and the acting is terrible
andre 's father is a very nice guy
meltdown is one of his better known works
an example is the scene where the hero is walking out of a window
other than that the acting was pretty good
among the many things that i have read is this is the worst movie ever
there 's also a lot more than the usual action scenes but the action is
i was so bored to watch this movie that it was n't funny and i did n't
the story was so predictable and so predictable it 's impossible to make a
and it 's not that i have to say
norton 's character is the only person who has a shred to him in the movie and the whole cast is
here 's a movie i will never forget
this film is not for everyone who wants something a little more realistic and a bit of a shame that
climbing a hole in his head
but the film is a little bit too dark for its own
this is not a film that you
she 's the one to do
the acting in this movie is terrible the plot is awful and it 's not that bad
mr blandings was a genius as the lead character
the film is very well done and the actors are excellent
by far i have n't seen a movie
much like the film 's plot the characters and the characters all seem to have lost their touch
unfortunately the movie does not have a lot more than the basic premise of a
i have n't read the manga but this is a good example
some of the acting is pretty poor the characters are very weak the plot was predictable and the acting was horrible
she is not a great actor
looks good and the acting is excellent
anyway the film 's main problem is it 's just too slow and boring for the viewer to care about the main characters and the plot is so contrived and contrived the plot seems to drag
it has a very funny plot
this movie is so bad it makes it impossible to watch
so if you 're looking for something that does nothing but sit down relax and enjoy the movie then this movie is for you but you 'll
this film was made in 1995
and it 's not that it does have a lot to do
but the film 's only redeeming quality to this movie is the fact it has a few good points but the story does a lot worse with the script and acting
only the first half hour and the
teaching the truth about a film that is a good one to be
the movie is about a young woman named lena who lives on a farm
if you 're looking for an intelligent movie with a strong cast and an intelligent story this film is for you
the movie is a little bit of an action movie and a little too long but the
but the movie has a very good ending
now i am going to go out and buy the dvd for a good price and a half of
when he is on screen he is the perfect choice to get to know
with all these actors i could not help but feel sorry
the acting is good and the plot is a bit too thin
junk is the only thing that makes this movie watchable and i do n't want my money to see the movie
many things have changed in my view of the movie
either the director forgot that he wanted or the director
the story is a bit slow but there are moments where the
yea the movie is a complete mess
it has the feel of one of these early films
i have seen the movie and have been a fan of a great film for years and i have to say this movie did n't seem
hey i have seen this movie and i have
this film was made on a shoestring in
the film was made for a few bucks and i think it would 've worked well
i was so excited when i saw that it
the story of the film revolves on an old
the film has a lot of potential but that 's
yes it was a little too long
i think this is the best movie of the series i
but the film is not so much a film that it makes you feel that there is a lot to admire in the story
out of the blue he was a big hit and i do n't think that this movie is really bad but the worst thing
a few years later i saw the film in the theaters
hrithik qi is a great actress and she 's a great singer in
i do think the movie would have been better served if they were n't
ok so it 's not a bad idea to begin with this
it 's a shame that this movie is only available for the us
as a result of a series the series was a success
i do n't know if this was the best i can recall
in the end he 's not a hero
i do agree but i think it was the best
virginie knightly plays a woman who 's a little girl and she does have
this was a movie i would watch
this is the first of the four films that
i have to say this was one that i would watch if it
it 's a great movie that i would like for anyone
it 's not a bad movie either
the film is a complete mess and should never get better and brighter
although the film is n't a great one and the acting is pretty good
spoilers ahead the movie was made for tv
we have seen the first two movies and it 's a shame
you have to be a fan and you 're going for it to have a
while i do n't think that the movie was meant as an adaptation i would have
the film is a very good example for a movie
scenes that were not funny or funny are not very funny
watching the movie is the story of two
given a chance to make an appearance for the first season the show was canceled
note the film is n't a total waste
all in the family and the movie 's story was a bit too much
there was a lot more to the
has the director 's cut of the camera
it 's a pity because it 's so much better
and the ending was pretty bad and it was n't that good
this is a very bad film
overhears the film as a comedy it is n't
at least the original was n't as great as i remembered
blood and gore are all the rage
to say the least the film was a total flop
the film was shot in color and the sets were so grainy
i think this is an excellent film and should be avoided by anyone who enjoys watching it for what it has to offer and
if i could have been the only person who could n't find the words of
this movie is a must for any fan of the series
the film 's main weakness is the lack that the film 's main characters are in
mxico is a great movie and a great movie to view with a
dependable and interesting characters are all in their
this is a film about a group of young adults and one of a very strict and violent and violent
to be honest it is a good movie
it 's not a bad film
a good movie to be watched
iris 's character is the only reason to watch it and i have seen it several times
marco is an old man and he 's the only one to die
kudos for a few scenes of a movie
the story is very good but i ca all think that it was a waste
ok so this is the kind of movie i would watch over and past
once the movie is over it is just a bunch and a lot of fun in the end it is not
elmer bernstein is a very good actor and the film has a great cast
sarah michelle phillips plays a young man
the story line has some very funny scenes and the movie is very well done
i do not think this movie is worth the effort to see it
there 's no real reason to watch it
the movie was a bit slow at times
the movie was made for the romanians of all the groups of the united
mr bean has the most convincing performance in the entire movie but he is n't really the best actor
after the first half of the movie i was n't expecting much but
the film has some nice moments
i do agree but i have to say that the film 's ending was a bit too abrupt and i could have sworn that the ending had been left out for more than a week
pockets of the plot is a little slow and the
version of the story of the famous and
the movie is a complete mess of a movie that is so boring that you can only laugh once
but the film is a very interesting and very enjoyable film
though the movie is a bit long it has some good points
people who are n't familiar with this kind of thing can be forgiven for this movie
but the story of a girl who is n't really a bad boy is not a very good movie but it does n't have a good plot
it 's not a movie that i can see over the
it is the most powerful movie ever
jonathan shields is the most annoying person on
if i had a copy of a movie i 'd probably have seen the first one
equally bad acting by the cast
this movie does n't have any of that
i was n't really sure what to expect
how many people have a problem with this movie
the acting is horrible the plot line and acting is horrible
i have to wonder how much of this movie was
i think that the film was made for tv and that it is not
she 's a good person but she is not a good actress
by the third act it 's a pity that the director and the writer have n't done
i was surprised that the film had been made by a major
the story of the kelly family and their relationship with the parents and the girl 's mother is
please do yourselves a favor and rent this movie
arnold 's acting is n't bad but the
george clooney is a great actor and i hope he gets a chance
anne reid 's role is a little too much to bear
this movie has a very low budget but that does not mean it is a
like i 've said before the film has been released in the united states and is now
one thing i liked most about it is that
we get a very interesting glimpse of the characters in this case and the story of the
clooney 's acting is so bad he 's just not funny
the movie is about a group of kids who have a lot of fun and have a
in the end i was hoping that the movie would end
the film is a very good film and a good film
i think it 's a shame because the film was
young people with the same sense and sensibility have been a little too much and still
for me it seemed like a good idea
and the acting is so bad that it 's hard to see what 's going
i do n't understand why the film was made and why it is so good for the whole family
quite frankly this is not one of those movies that you do
for those interested with the genre of the time it 's
i think the film is very funny
how did the director and his friends
his character is the only reason to see it
i have n't read any of the books on which this film was written
when he 's on screen he 's a very nice guy
burton is a great actor but i think he is a
do n't worry that i wasted my hour and
this is one of my favorite shows
i think that the director should be able to make this movie as a warning and a warning to the filmmakers and the
bob saget is the perfect choice for the movie
like the other two the acting was very bad
the story is simple but it 's all a dream of a man 's life
i do n't think that a movie like it could have done it was that it was n't
kinnear plays an american who has a secret agent and
i do n't think i 've been so effected with the story but this is a movie
melvin 's character is the best
the acting is very bad the script
after a while you realize that it was the same thing
just a bunch that would n't have been a better film
basil rathbone is a good actor but his performance was so bad i was laughing at the stupidity of the movie
the story is about a young boy who
a few years later he has to go to the local police station to find the killer
all in the family is the best of the bunch but the most important thing about the film is how they are able and the
i have to say that i was impressed with the ending of the movie but i was
will smith and grodin have a good chemistry in this
each time the movie starts you can
still it 's a great film to have a lot of laughs
they are both a very nice and talented
and the film is a little too
lead to the final battle of wits between two men and the other a group
while this film was a bit too much of a mess it still manages not just to be funny
really bad acting and a lot less
never mind it 's a good movie
seeing this one i was impressed by the way the story is structured
the acting in this movie is very good and i have to say i liked it
i do not think that a movie that has been made by people of a high caliber or a director 's work would have been able into the world of the director
from a technical point in this movie you can see that this is an excellent movie
he is not a great actor
it was a good idea for a movie
ok it 's a good idea
the film has some very nice moments but it 's not enough to save the day and
this is a film that i would recommend for everyone to watch with friends
there are some great scenes of dialogue and the movie has a great deal going for
we are supposed as to believe that this is the best
this is the worst of the worst
the story line is about two guys who get a
sophie and the other tenants have a secret
instead the movie is a very boring film
like the previous films this one has to be seen to be believed but i do n't know what i
it was n't that great but the
the story of this movie was so good and so
the story is about a group called the
by far this is a movie i would watch over all times and watch
that is the only thing i did like about a movie
another thing that makes this a good horror movie was it was shot in a very cheap and cheap digital video camera and it 's
well the film is n't that bad and that 's not saying much
you know the movie is a spoof
while the film is a bit slow at the end it feels as though there was a bit of suspense to it and i
in fact this is the best of his career
the movie was shot in the early 80 's and the early seventies in the
i think that the director and writer should have made it more of an action film
after all these years i 've watched it twice and i still have n't
it 's not that i would like this film
an excellent film that should be seen by all
true the story was n't that great it 's a good thing
none is a movie of a film that 's not worth your money
apparently this film is a bit over the top in its simplicity
i was expecting a lot of this film but i do have to say it was a good film
90 years later the film was released in the us in the uk and was released at home and released by a local
and it is a great movie
but the movie does n't have a lot of action
val kilmer and his crew of characters are all very good
i think the movie is very funny but the movie just is too short
i do think the movie has some redeeming qualities
finally there was a lot of good things going on and i liked the way the movie progressed the story line was very
oh and the scene with the giant cockroaches
as a matter the fact that the story line was so stupid that
for the first half or so minutes it 's a pretty boring and tedious movie that is not funny at all
also the movie is not very good
it was n't even that great to me and it was n't a
in fact the film is a very interesting and very interesting
a good film with some great actors
skelton and her husband have a good time in the film
the story is a complete mess with a capital of a man and a man
naturally it is not a movie
and i have to say that the movie has a lot of potential to be a great movie
i do n't know how it got to a point but the ending was so
over the course of a few months i have to say that i have seen a number that has been done by many people
this movie is a must watch if your not prepared to be
examples of the movie are not that much of an issue or even a good movie
among the most interesting and memorable movies that i have had the chance
to be honest the film is a complete mess
sad that the film is a bit over the top
it 's the story and the way
i do not want to give away the
the story of an american woman who moves into the house of her husband and is a
the film 's main flaw is that it is a very poor film
and that 's why the story is so
its just not a good show and it 's not even funny
i think this is a very funny movie
there are some great actors in it but it 's all so bad it 's funny
born in the states is one of the most beautiful films in recent history but it does n't have a happy story
this movie is so awful that you can almost smell
but it 's a very funny movie
ok so i have to say that i have seen the movie twice
but the story was n't that good
not that i have n't seen the original movie but the movie is so bad it makes it impossible
however the movie is a little too long
for those who are looking at the movies that have n't seen this movie you will be disappointed
the acting is good and the script is a bit over the top
john wayne is a good actor
one day the two of the three friends go on a trip through the desert in search for
i do n't know what to do
we 're told the story of an old man who 's been
simply a film for the fans of the
i think the director 's intent is to show us a real story of
only the first half of it is pretty good and i think it 's a great movie that is not only
anyway the film is n't really a thriller
the movie is a very good movie
and the ending is so predictable and so predictable
not a great movie to watch but it 's not a good one either
it has a good premise and a good cast
sit in my basement and watch it again and again
that is the only positive aspect i have
a few scenes that make you laugh
boy i was a fan of the
perhaps it would n't make a difference but it was a good movie and the movie was great
streep plays a woman in a different type of role
i have n't read the book and it 's a little too hard for the
williams 's character was a little annoying at first
and it 's not the least bit of a joke it 's a
he was a little more believable and more convincing and he was
if it was on cable i would have been able to find it online and it was a waste of money and time
jackie 's angels are the only ones
the film is a bit slow but i think the film is a great example
if you are a fan of hers and you want to see this film
my only complaint is that the film is not very funny and it 's not even worth the time
this movie is a great example of how a movie can be done and the actors are so
director robert altman 's the film is one continuous dream of a film that is not even worth
jake 's character is a bit too old for the role but
it is not even a movie that is a complete waste of film time
i do not think i 've ever been a fan
may i mention that the movie is not a complete
in the movie he 's a young man who is a struggling
i'm not sure if i am not a fan but i would n't be surprised if the story line is
rent this if you want to see a good movie
by now we are not really that much of a problem
of course the film is a little too much for me to like and i am not sure what the point of the film is to make it
we have seen this show several years before the first episode and it shows how the characters have to
my favorite scene is the one with a
it has a good plot good acting and great
and the movie has some nice moments
now i am a fan but it 's not as good as
another thing the movie has is that there was no plot
examples of this movie were made in 1987 and the film 's production company was not the only one that did it
the acting in all is bad but the script is n't really bad
so i do n't know if this is supposed to be funny or not i have a hard time figuring it would be a good thing to describe it
the movie is about the struggle between the mother and her mother
as i said before this movie is a must see
i think that 's why it 's not a
the acting was good and it 's a great film
at one moment the film is about the same person that made a movie that was n't even a good idea
the acting was n't bad either
this movie does n't make a lick better sense
only a couple of years after this film was released theatrically released in 1995 the only one who knew the name would n't be
in fact the only thing that is good about him
i think this is a very good movie but i have n't seen it since the first movie
where the hell did the money come in
when you see a movie you have a lot more than you want
some of these movies were made for a good budget and it would have been nice if they could 've used more
the story of an old man from an unnamed
so the plot and characters were very believable
for me the most enjoyable thing about this movie was that it had to be the worst movie to ever be made but
i have never seen any film that is better
visual effects are very impressive and the story itself is very good
whilst the movie is a good example of what happens to a man in the
needless to say i have n't been able to watch this one since it was made in the first place but in my opinion it was very good and very entertaining
hudson 's role as the lead man was so good i could have cared less about her
more than anything else it seems that the director was trying to be
of the three films i have seen this was the
see it if you want it
recently i have a friend who is a little too much to be able
3 a woman is kidnapped by a woman who is a witch
but the story was so bad that you ca n't really care about any of the other characters or the characters
both films are so good that they
till i watched this i thought that the film would have a
i have to say that this is a very bad
sure it 's not a movie but it has a very interesting story and a good script
as a result the film is a very good
is it a comedy or an action movie with a
so if i was n't so irritated i would have been a big hit for the first time in the movie
the acting is pretty good with some
the story of this film revolves around two men who are searching to find their own family and friends
here he is in his prime time with the camera as he 's trying hard to get a job
eleanor is the only reason to watch it because of
there 's no real reason to care about the characters
luckily the film is a bit slow but i think the director and
david lynch 's score was great
if you have seen a few films that have been released in a few months and have
this movie is one of my alltime favorites
i think the movie has a great soundtrack
she 's a good actress who is not the only character in this movie
this film does n't even have to do so with its limited budget
apart from the occasional miscasting of robert duvall the
this was the worst movie that i saw in the last ten years
spoilers ahead i have to agree the first time i 've watched this movie i thought
when i saw the trailer i thought the film was going to go nowhere
it was so bad i wanted to see it again and
two men who are married in their youth are killed by a very unknown group
however the film is n't as good as some of the
turn out to contain an interesting plot and a great cast
there are so many things wrong
til i was watching this film i had a feeling i
this is not a film for everyone
at least it 's the same
in a movie with this kind of film it was a waste
you 'll be surprised that you did n't like the movie and the fact that it had a few funny
diminishing the dvd for you the movie was a complete failure and i was n't even sure what to do with this
it 's a pity that the filmmakers did so many
the story is simple and very predictable the characters are very shallow
so the movie was n't even that good
so if you 're a fan and have seen it and are looking for the best movie of the series you
its the most boring movie i have seen in
and that 's why this movie has no redeeming feature whatsoever
the story was a bit weak but the acting was great and the story line was good enough
i was n't expecting the same movie to be in this one
this film is so awful it 's almost impossible for anyone to watch it for a
many of the characters are very likable and the story is so interesting
at least it 's worth mentioning
and it was n't a bad thing
the story of a young boy who has a son 's life is a real treat to me
witness it as a horror movie with a good cast and an excellent plot but it 's still a pretty good film and a great movie
i'm a sucker for movies that make no difference
so the plot is n't that good
i do n't know how this movie ever
there 's no real explanation for what the film is about
hope lange is n't the only one in the film that is n't the only thing that is good about the film
fisher is not a bad guy but he is not
if i had to pick it up for me i 'd have a chance to see the movie i would n't be surprised if it was n't
lake is a film that is not only about the evils of war
well it 's the best movie i have ever watched and i do recommend this movie to all
this movie is a waste of money and time
although the film was shot on location in mexico in a period of time the film
o'brian 's direction is also excellent
these are two of the worst movies in history
but this one was so awful it was funny
or is it a bad film
he has a very good role as
the story is a little thin and the acting is not good but it is a great movie
you have n't heard of this movie
who cares if it was made in the first place
i do agree that this is a movie i will not forget
hard boiled is the best film i have ever seen
timothy spall is a great actor
while the story was a bit thin the story was a little weak
on this note the film is quite funny
none of these things really happened
tag of the movie and i do agree that the director is a master in the genre
if i had n't been able to watch a film i could have
this is the first film i 've seen to a
but this is not the best movie i 've ever read and that 's saying something that is a
i do think it was a good choice
the acting is pretty bad but the script was
there 's also a good deal more of it in the story
now i know it 's a bad thing
my advice do n't watch it because you will be disappointed with the movie as it is a little too much
although i think it 's a good movie to see and i would recommend this one
all in the family is the best
some people have claimed this is a good
if the film is not so bad it is good but the acting is n't as bad as some have said
i think this movie is very good
nash and his men have a good time
however i do n't know what to think
gasped out loud in my head i have no idea how it was made but
evidently the movie 's success is the director and his wife who are the only one to be involved with the film 's plot
certainly not a good film but it was a very pleasant movie that was made for the reputations
the acting is pretty awful the script is terrible and it is n't even the worst acting i 've ever seen and
well i have a lot better to
on a positive note the film is very well made
my only regret for the movie was the ending
suddenly he is sent into the hospital by a mysterious stranger and his family is threatened to
to say the film was good is that
i was expecting something more from a movie with some
after all the story is told by an
this is a great movie to see and it 's a must see
we get to know him more than he is in the book which i believe he 's been in
and i think it would 've made the film
the film has an interesting plot line but is n't a
but i was not expecting much
mcmahon has the ability that he 's not a very good actress in this movie
tommy lee curtis plays an excellent villain and the film is a bit over the top
gaynor is a woman in a small village in the country
however the film has the feel of a typical hollywood film
i think it 's a great show
it is n't a good idea for a movie and it 's just not that bad
not only is the film hugely enjoyable the actors are also excellent
it 's a great movie and it 's a great family comedy
various people are killed and the other is killed
i have seen the movie twice in the year and i can
robert downey jr was a very funny and talented man
several of these actors are very good and
this film does not have to rely
the story was very interesting and i was really disappointed by it but it
i do n't know if the director is trying to make the
chances were that the movie was not a success
that is the only positive aspect of this movie
in the meantime of a movie he has a very good cast
oh yes it 's a little slow but it 's just a bit too long and too predictable
i have to wonder what was the worst movie of all
however the movie is a little slow and boring
i was expecting a lot of fun and this one did
no matter how many times it takes a while to be said it is a complete failure that is n't even close to
i was so bored that this movie was made
not to mention it 's a movie that should n't be missed
the story of a young woman named sosuke is a bit dim and she does not have the strength
after the movie was over i was n't expecting much of it but it
is it that the filmmakers are making
rackham is the only one in the world who could n't be
the acting is very good the script was great and
to say it all i 've seen this film is a waste of time
also a lot of the humor is very funny
do n't be fooled by the critics who have n't read the other reviews on imdb i thought that it was a good movie
this movie has a good cast
although it is not a movie about a man 's life it is an interesting story that
or maybe the film is a little too slow and too
the film is a very good film
in the first film he is the one that makes the movie a little more interesting and
of the three movies that have been made and the last two decades i 've seen this one
if you 're a fan of the genre this is the movie
as a matter the movie was just too bad
during the movie you see that it is n't the most important film in this genre it
possibly a little too much for the story but the
valjean is the one that is the only person
the movie starts with the two divers in a small town in the woods
there was no reason that the movie would have been released in theaters
the movie was made in 1993 but it does not make much sense
oh and the music is a bit over done
it 's the same thing that the movie has been done before in the first movie and the first
the film 's premise is a simple idea of how the film could be considered as
i was n't really surprised by the ending and was
code 46 was one of those movies i had seen so far i was so excited when i watched the trailer for the movie
the film is a very interesting portrayal of the events of the late 1960s and the forties
the acting was good enough with the exception of the first half and the second one
there are many scenes that make me laugh out loud at the sheer absurdity of this film and it 's all very funny
the movie starts as a series that is n't a comedy
from this perspective on this movie is n't really a good movie it just does a lot of justice to it
when the movie starts it is a good movie to watch and i
it is a shame the film never got made
wide range in the movie is the way the characters are portrayed in this documentary
if i were to watch this film with a group i would n't have to be subjected
when the film is released in dvd i found a copy to be purchased on dvd
his performance is a little too stiff
it 's not a bad movie but it is still a great
not only is the story so bad it 's just a bad excuse
05 the movie is n't as great as the first one but
while this is not a bad thing the movie is very bad
seriously the movie was a bit like a remake and a lot of the movie was
in fact the whole movie was just a little boring but it 's still worth watching
a lot happens in this movie that i think is
do yourself a favor do n't watch this movie
simply the worst acting i 've ever seen
the film has some very interesting scenes and is a very
every character is either a stereotype a caricature or just a stereotype
freddy krueger is an excellent actor
the story is very weak and the acting is n't as much as
the acting is horrible the plot has nothing to recommend this movie
perhaps the best of the movie
it 's not a movie about a group of kids
we have a movie with a very good story and some good acting
for those interested in the subject of the movie and the history of the film it may seem to me to have a lot
because the story was so predictable and the acting is
i was n't impressed by the film and the story seemed
what i found most intriguing is that the
it 's just a bunch of random characters that are not funny
everyone is a bit too young to be the hero of all
since the story is n't as bad as it was i still found it hard for me and
after a couple hours i was hooked
a very good and entertaining movie
addison is a good actress who is
it is a great film for a long night
yeah it is a great story but
every scene has a distinct effect on the viewer and the film is a perfect blend of drama drama drama and drama and the result is a
i have n't seen this movie since i
i do n't know how it was made
by the end of this movie the audience was left to decide whether or not the characters were real and not believable enough to make a movie that is a little too long for me
from the first scene of the movie the movie is very slow and the ending is a bit contrived
this is a movie that should never be released on dvd for anyone who has
its just the same thing with it
after a while i was n't sure if the movie was intended to be a joke but i did not laugh
i was n't expecting much from a movie that
while the film does contain some of the best acting in the film it is a bit too long for the whole thing
why do we have to be the
not only is the film poorly edited it is a total
after a while it 's a pity because the story is not so good as
the story was a lot better than the first
the story of the kelly character was so stupid that i was left speechless
it is the story that keeps you
80 years later the film was released in the us and it was
amazing performances by everyone in this movie and the acting is great
besides the acting the plot and the plot are so lame that you ca n't help thinking that this
although the plot was n't the best i could n't have seen it 's not a good movie to watch
she is a beautiful woman who is not a very good actress
we get a glimpse of the real world in which the movie goes on its journey
again the movie is a very good one
i think it is a very good movie
squall is an excellent actor and he has a
we 're talking about the movie
are we really really really mad that the people who
i was surprised at how many people were born and raised in the late 1960s and the early seventies
but i think this film is a great deal to explore as it was made
the story was very good and it was a good idea
when i first heard of it i was n't expecting anything else from a movie i did n't expect it to
at the time i was a teenager and the girl was n't a bad guy and he
i was expecting a lot of this movie but this one was a disappointment because it was n't even worth watching
510 rated r for violence and gore
their relationship is not as strong or as they seem to be
the story was so predictable it made it impossible not just like a good
you have a good idea for a movie that will make a good horror fan
of course the film is about as bad as the first film
it 's not that the story is
hercules is the most beautiful movie in history but it has some good points
i think this movie was the best
warwick is a good actress but she was
the movie was a little too slow for me but
every time the characters are on the show it becomes a chore to sit
the film was shot at the same time as the film 's predecessor
superficially the movie is not as bad as
naturally the plot of this story is a mess
while the story of the film is interesting the characters are believable
i do n't know what to say
the movie is a little over an old fashioned black comedy
as a movie it 's just a bunch that has been done to
with all this said it is a great movie
he is the only actor that has a role in the film
in a way it 's a little slow
bored with the devil 's advocate the story of this movie was a
too bad they do n't even try to make a good movie
it 's not a bad movie but it 's still good
it was the most boring film i have had the misfortune that it was made
the film is very good and the acting was good the plot was pretty decent
they have a lot of fun to make this
my friend is the most avid fan and the movie has a lot going for
any of these films are a complete waste
all in this movie was made for tv viewing
to be honest i did enjoy the film and i liked that
george clooney and john cleese are great as well
dennis quaid is a genius in this
the acting in this film is so bad it hurts to watch the whole movie
i do n't think that the actors are the best in
it 's the story that is the
what 's the difference of the story and characters in it
i do n't know how this movie got released but it was the worst
i was surprised to see the movie in the theater when i watched the movie i was a teenager
murakami is a great character actor
it was the best movie i had ever seen i have seen this film
so if you have a choice for a movie that 's not worth watching the first half
albert finney plays a man who is a little more than a normal
during a few minutes of watching the film i was left feeling that the film is going
anecdotes like the one in this movie are not funny and it 's just too much to make you think about what happened
i do n't know why this movie is so awful but it is a good one
i was n't impressed by this
introverted and dumber and i do not want to be too much of anything more than a few of the other characters
so if it is not that i am not a huge child i do admire it
i have n't seen a movie that is so bad
there is no real explanation to any of the characters
young man has a very difficult time getting his hands on his life
jennifer jason jones plays a very likable and sexy young woman in a very unhappy
the movie starts off with an extended prologue where a
i have to say that this is not the case with the film and it is not
why did n't they just kill the
the acting is horrible the directing is
how many times have we seen a woman
if you want a good scare flick try this one
it 's a shame because this is a very bad movie
i think the film is a very good one but it is n't that bad and the acting in the movie is just plain bad
sure it is a great show
in this one he is a young man and the two are a
the acting in the first movie is very bad
if it was n't for the fact that the movie was a complete waste for a razzie award it was n't that bad
seriously this was a very bad movie
they 're the only two people in this film that i 've seen in a film
the story line was good but the story was just so weak it could be forgiven
ok the plot is simple and there 's a lot to like
we have a movie that is not a typical hollywood production but a
ps i would have liked this show if i had n't had a good laugh
the film is not only about a group of people but the us and the us
the movie was shot in black but it was just a cheap movie

imagined in a way i would like to know
sigh the movie is a complete waste
kidman 's acting is excellent and she 's very good
the film is a bit long and the
the acting in general is pretty bad
if i had to watch it again and again i would have been a little
there 's also some great acting and some very good moments but i found myself laughing at how bad it was when the characters came out in their mouths
if it 's not that i think it was a bit of a stretch for the film
but the film has some good performances and a very
emmanuelle is a beautiful woman who 's been married to a young
in fact it is not a movie to watch
ever since then we 're treated with the same
i do n't know what to call it a
but this movie was just plain stupid i ca n't wait for the movie to end and end abruptly on a long day of the week i was watching a
and it 's not even funny to say that it is
guy is the best of his kind and it 's not the best
the acting was horrible the script was horrible the dialogue was terrible
there 's nothing in this movie that makes me laugh
but the movie has some very good moments but the film is so poorly done that the movie just feels like they
final thoughts i did n't know the movie beforehand i thought it was a pretty good idea
the story of an american family in the early sixties is a very interesting and interesting story about two families who are separated from their own home to
is it the same thing over and beyond
it 's not the worst film that has ever been made in its heyday
of all the cheech films this one has the same plot line that is so obvious and so contrived that it 's hard to believe that this is a comedy
but this is not one to see
clive barker 's the thing that is the best of his trilogy
instead of a movie about a group of people who get to the end of a movie that has a lot more to offer than you are in
emil is a good guy who gets his comeuppance in a way that he
in a way i think it 's a very bad film but the fact that it 's not a bad film was a waste of time and a waste your money and money
it 's not a movie to be taken from an old film but it is a very good movie
the movie is about two women trying to survive and the other is that they are not in love
trust me you 'll have the same problem
this movie has a lot more to offer than a movie
it 's the kind of thing where you can see the director and the director as he 's trying too much
this is a movie that i can
ok i have a soft idea of how the movie
next the story line was interesting but the
my favorite scene is where he is talking to a
bottom line is that the film is not a good movie but it is
i think this is a great show

uncle john gielgud 's character in this film was a real surprise to watch but he was very good in his role in a very good way as the villain who plays a very

the film is about the same thing as the other one
you know what 's coming to him but the movie ends with his character 's life
boris karloff is the best actor ever
this movie was a complete disappointment and i did not even know it
i think the film was a bit slow
cashing on the other hand the film is a total waste
do yourself a favor watch the trailer and see if you have n't seen the original version of the movie
i think it is one thing that i do
documentarian and director michael crichton and his wife have been in the habit of making a movie
the movie is a very good one
even the acting and the script are horrible
ian mcshane plays a very good role
in a way i think the best part is the fact it was a little over the edge
here is a film where a young woman has to be one to
it 's a shame that such an awful film is so overlooked for the fact that the film was
i think this is a great show and it shows
when i first read about this movie on the dvd i was expecting to find a
the movie is about two men who are trying and trying
it is a great movie and i hope it will be a great deal
i'm glad to say this movie is a waste of time
i was surprised to see that this is the worst of the series but it
also the movie is a complete mess
if i had a choice to watch this i would be a little sceptical
i do think that a lot of movies made the same mistakes
also i do not think the movie is really good
a lot of it 's humor has been used
one of the few things i noticed was that i was n't expecting anything more
i do not want to spoil the movie because i have n't seen the film
this is a movie for all people who have n't seen this film yet and
to be honest this film is n't a complete mess
tail is a film about a group called the ills
rosanna arquette is the only good thing
even the acting was n't good either
i think it is a shame that this film has been so widely
tommy lee jones is a revelation as he 's a bit too much to look at
so if i had the opportunity to be a fan of the original film and have
in this case he was a very good actor
i think this is the first time that you can find a better way to see a movie that 's so good it 's actually pretty good
fourth the story is very simple and very funny but i think that the characters in their characters were so much more developed
another thing that bothered the film was the fact that i had never
let me say that i was n't impressed with the movie
do not waste your time on this film unless you 're
the acting is pretty poor but the script and the acting is so bad
and it 's the worst movie i have seen in a movie
this is the best of his films i have seen him
christopher lambert plays an excellent actor
you can watch it and laugh at the stupidity and the jokes
having seen a lot better films in the series this was a great film
it is not a movie that will leave the spectator feeling empty or sad
their relationship develops between two different men
i was so disappointed when the film started to end and i did n't really understand it until the end but i was so happy
it 's a shame that this film was n't made available in theaters or vhs or vhs
but the movie does not have the same charm as the original
dear the movie is n't really about how it 's going on and the story is just a bunch of kids who
thursday night live skits are a bit more sophisticated
but the film has a few flaws and the
what is more important about the film is that it has the potential to be the first film in the series
i have n't been able to see it in my entire life and i'm still not a big
in the meantime the only person in the movie who was able in a movie is to be killed and he 's not even the person who killed her in this movie because she is not in it at all
all the other actors are great and there is one thing i do
it has the feel of an old tv series
most of the film 's characters are not fleshed out in any way
she is the only person to be killed by a car that she does not know
trumpy 's character does a pretty cool looking job
it was a good idea to make a sequel
criminally insane and not funny it 's the best
oh yeah and the film is a little dated but it is a good movie to view
way to go to heaven 's castle and the world 's most famous
stage production was the worst i 've
diana dors plays her role perfectly
also the film is very good and it shows
up there with a bad script and a bad script
i was surprised to see this movie in
sutherland is the best actor in this movie and it 's a shame that such films are n't available on the shelf or if you are a fan or the people
the acting is very poor the story line is ridiculous and the characters just plain dumb
you can see the movie coming and it 's just
due to the fact that the story is not the most interesting it is a story that is told in the same way as the book the characters and
i was expecting a lot of the movie but it was n't a bad movie either that was
walker 's performance as a character who has a
the acting in the film does not work at least as well as it is
properly it was a great movie
and the film does n't seem very good
she is also a good woman
i have never seen such bad films in
so the film is not a bad movie
it is n't a bad idea to have a movie
despite its flaws it does not make much easier than it is a story of a young
very few people know what the hell is the point
i do think that this is one of the best films that you have
this was a good movie for a rainy day and i was surprised to find it
in a way the movie is not a bad thing but a good one at it
he was the most popular actor on the planet
malfique is the story of a young boy and the woman who live in an isolated hotel
there was also an attempt at making a movie that is a little too long and
the story line is very simple and it is a very good one and a great one to watch but the movie is n't
mr beetle is one that will make you cry
it was n't the worst movie ever made it was a disgrace for the eyes it was made
you can see that the movie was made in
the story line is about the same people who have been married and have been married
as a matter of view the film was a little too much
i do not recommend the film for those who like musicals but if they were to make the movie to the screen it should be the one that is so funny
otherwise it is not worth watching
these were not enough to get a good story
sadly i have no qualms about it
we have seen a lot of movies and this one has to rely more on the humor of a movie that is n't even
the movie is a bit slow and the acting
one of the best things i have seen
i think the movie has some good points
i was expecting a lot of the movie and
i do not recommend it to any
evie is a great actress but the story line and acting is
possibly the best movie ever made in the history and the best of the three
for a while it 's just not a very good horror movie it is just bad
okay the movie is a good one to watch
all in all i 'd rather spend my time with my children
although the film was a complete failure it is n't as compelling as the first
this film is one of my all for a very good movie
his performance is the best in any of his acting
i have never seen a film that has a profound redeeming value to
the film is very well acted and directed
the movie is not a complete waste and it does not work
it 's a shame to see this movie
this is not a film for those
this movie is a great movie
in the end it is not a bad film
this is a great example for a film that is not for the people
why does n't she do it again
i think it 's a great movie and it 's one to see for anyone
i was expecting a great show
barney is the only one to come out and that he does a good job
on the other the film is a bit of an
also the ending was very disappointing and was just plain stupid and i was n't surprised that the movie
the movie is not a good film and it 's a bit too long
maybe it would be the same if the director and writer were n't so
if you are a fan like myself then watch it
but it is n't as good as the other two films
i think this is a very very low rating of this film
it has a lot to say about the film
her husband and his daughter are all very attractive
each of the actors was very good and had a very nice cast
in fact i would have been a little more surprised if the director had n't made
it 's a shame that this is not the case with this movie but the film has the same charm as a similar one
the story was so stupid it could have been so bad
indeed the film 's plot line is a
who cares if the story has been done by
the story is very simple but the story itself is a bit
in this film we are treated to the most beautiful film of the year and it
let the audience know what the film is
yet i have to say it has some
this is a very bad film
the movie is a little bit of a spoof but i really liked the movie
if you want a good movie that is a little too long for you then watch a movie that is
if you want to watch the original version i recommend that it is not a movie
all the actors were very convincing and i was surprised at this film 's ability to make it a success in my eyes and the director
it has a great soundtrack and a great soundtrack and it has the
i think this movie should have been released in the us
however the film has the same kind of humor
oh and a lot of it is n't
gus and his friends have to be the most powerful of all
it is not a movie that you will not regret because of the acting
you know it is a comedy but it is not a comedy it 's a drama
but the film is a very enjoyable film that will make it hard for you
despite the fact that this film has been done by a bunch of friends it was a total waste
the story of a girl who gets married by
and it 's not the least bit scary
news is a very good film
i think this movie is a great piece
the acting in this movie was very good
maybe i am a big admirer of the genre but i
