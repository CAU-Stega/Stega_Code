still the movie was a waste of time
sadly this is a film for the fans of all those who have seen them and have not seen the film or read the book and do n't
the plot is n't really that interesting but there 's enough tension to keep you watching
sigh the movie is very funny
he had a great deal of humor to show
this show is the best show in the series
instead they get a few seconds of a story that could 've been better
i have never been so disgusted by it
he was a bit confused and he had his own agenda with his family
it was like they were in an episode of a series of episodes of the original episode and the show is
come out of nowhere the film is so bad that it actually makes the viewer feel uneasy
this film is a very good film with great performances by everyone who is a fan of the original movie
the film is a bit slow moving but that 's not the point
stimulated by the fact that the story is not based on the novel
sometimes it is the worst movie i 've seen but even worse i have the feeling it 's
city is a film that you can watch and enjoy
bad acting bad directing and a terrible
they have no qualms about the other
just when you look for it it is a very bad movie
one of the best things about this movie is how it could have been made with a bigger and bigger budget
the film is a very good film
he 's just a little too much to talk about
my wife and i watched this at the theater when it was first released
the acting was horrible all around
he has a great talent for acting
is it an unmitigated waste of time
i think the movie 's best part was when the director took her to a different direction for this kind of movie
the acting is horrible from start to finish
proving that there are some really good actors who have
you 'll never forget the film and the ending is the best
some of it was very bad and i did
but i have to disagree with the other comment that
worse than the worst movie ever made
kudos for this movie for its low budget
now it 's a good story for a good story but it never gets better than this
one of my favorite films i 've seen
the movie 's premise is very interesting
and that 's all there is
yes the movie is n't very good but it has some great performances and some good actors
and i 've seen some of the movies
this film is an insult to any movie maker in the world
she looks good but she does a better job of portraying her character and she 's too
instead of having sex in a bed the movie takes a turn for the worst in the past
many of the supporting actors are excellent in this film
it 's the same story with a couple of subplots
it does n't really matter but there are
interestingly enough i had seen it before and i would n't even bother to see this
he 's a very good actor but it 's so
this is a pretty bad movie
ultimately the script is pretty good
mark ruffalo is perfect for a role that is very touching in his role as the villain
the movie is a little boring and the actors are all pretty bland as well
casting was a bit stiff but the story is not too complicated
imagine this movie for yourself and i
and it 's the only thing you can see in movies and the ones in the first place
i was a little skeptical about how bad the story of a character being played
overall it 's an enjoyable little movie
dennis hopper is the star of the show
i do n't care what happens next
i would love to see this in the top 50 of all time list
overall the film works very well
i'm not a big fan of the genre but this movie does n't have that same appeal to it
he 's not just a normal man he 's still a good guy but
the story line is a little too convoluted but the script
this movie is just a bad movie
it has a good story line and some wonderful characters
most of these people have been so disgusted by it and i do not know how much they do n't have a good time making it
it 's a very nice movie
i 've heard that the movie is not going to be a success
cut off to a few seconds before the end of the
finally a man has a gun and he
mighty 'donnell was a great actor
normally i think they are a bit of a stretch for the eyes of this movie but it does n't
i would love to know more about the characters but if i have the option they are still trying to make the
when it came to the first one it was a good idea but that 's just a few of the reasons why
just because the film is a good movie
implausible to say the least the ending is predictable and the film
after the movie 's opening shot the film shifts gears into a series of events and a couple of
the story line is so bad that even a movie like that should have been
much of this is due to the lack of imagination
really the best of the movie however is that it was made in 1995
if you are a fan of the first movie you should check this one out because there are so many good movies out there
i saw the first episode on pbs and this movie was very funny
the acting was n't very bad
as for the movie i was very impressed by the
the only good thing about the film is the acting and
absolutely the best movie i have ever seen
but the movie is just a waste of money and money
great film with a great cast a solid performance by john cassavetes and
so the movie is about a family and their
all the actors in this movie were very good
it 's a shame that it was made in the first place
i do n't think the movie would have
i was expecting more than this
spoilers this is a great film with a few laughs and some funny
so what we have here is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen
this is one of the better films
i 've never read any of the reviews but i have no clue what
on the other hand it is not a very good film
i'm sorry if you do n't know how to get to the point of being a little bit of a letdown but i have to
i saw this movie at the sundance film festival
historically the movie is a bit of an insult to the intelligence of
overall it was a good movie that had it
like the first reviewer said that the movie is a great piece of work that 's the reason i give it a 2 out of 10
the acting is n't bad but the story was terrible and i could n't get the fact that this
spoiler the only reason i gave it a 1 was because it was a complete waste of time
so it goes to an old school and a
the story is about a group of men who decide to go to italy
you do n't have to go to this film to understand how it is going to be so boring
there 's no denying that this is not only a film that the director and cast should have had
i have a soft spot for this series of movies
it is a good example of the type of film i have ever seen and i
i have to say that i had to see this film
thanks to the great performance of the young woman the
that said the movie has a great deal of humor and a sense of mystery
in the end the movie is very well written and well acted
here the story unfolds and it does n't matter
in this episode the film becomes a little bit too
i saw it again recently and it never gets tired of a tv show or tv show
one of the funniest scenes ever
with a great deal of money and good actors and a few decent special effects i was expecting a good movie with great
panels and geeks and the people who are n't
samantha morton plays the young girl who is n't the same actress as the first time she plays
upon arrival he decides he has to leave a job in the city
on the contrary they are very entertaining and i thought that the acting was good
i was surprised when i saw a film of this calibre that had me laughing
a great movie for all ages
i do n't think i can even think of it again
i have to wonder why this film was such a flop
the movie was n't really a comedy and the plot was so stupid that
anyone who has seen this movie will probably agree that this movie is a waste of time
or the other way the movie is supposed to be
please note that the acting is bad
for the rest of us you 'll be bored to death and not just the one you get to like
it 's a very interesting film about a woman who is sent to prison to
while the movie has a few faults it is n't as funny as it sounds and is just a fun movie that is worth seeing
bizarre and sad to see him die at one point he
and the whole film is a total downer
a film about the power of forgiveness and the consequences of the human
the movie has a very strong plot and i do recommend it to those who love a good story
as the film goes on its entirety becomes tedious
the film is a very entertaining and exciting experience
the movie is a little long and is not worth seeing and i think the only reason why it is so awesome is the acting
on the surface the story of a boy who gets involved in a murder mystery involving an
all of the other members of the group who are n't the same are all over the place
in fact it was n't that good
also a good cast and a very good plot
then it 's revealed that he was not only a child of the murdered but the
let 's just say the ending was a bit abrupt but the
you can see this coming from a very very young director
he is a man who loves to love himself
however i do have a problem that i would have to disagree with this is a movie that
why is it the best movie ever made
routine is one of the best and most memorable scenes that i
as an example of why they would like to think that this was
yet the film is n't as funny as a few others and i think its the worst of it 's kind
sidekicks are the real people who have been the most important
i do n't know how to describe the film
boris karloff and his gang of friends are the ones who have n't
the acting was ok and there were some good performances in this movie and it was n't bad but that 's about it
that 's all i can say about this movie
i 've never had a movie about such a terrible and amateurish film as it was with the first
the only reason that i watched it was the score and i was so disappointed
i'm a teenager i love this movie because it
trying to convince her that she 's a bad boy who has n't been

that said if you 're a fan of the genre you 'll enjoy this film

anderson does not have any of the slightest charisma that would appear in the whole movie
technically the film does n't really have a

at first you 're wondering who the culprit is who is going to be the
this movie was a huge disappointment for me
ever since i saw it it was so bad i was n't convinced that i was ever watching a film
coleman 's character is so bad that it
we do n't know what it is and it is a
even if you 're not a fan of the genre or the series it is not
after the success of the first film i had the pleasure of watching
there 's an excellent line between the characters and the movie
it 's a very bad movie
the film is a little slow and not very interesting to follow
i'm not even going to give away the plot of this film as the
it 's a shame the actors are not given enough screen time and
well i have to say i am not a big fan of movies and
but the movie is a complete mess
it has the same plot and the
action and action scenes are the main reason why this film does n't work in any way
preminger 's film is not as good as a similar adaptation of the scarlet pimpernel but with a lot more depth in each character
being the first of the three to die i thought it was the worst movie i have ever seen
some of the scenes are just so boring that i could n't help but laugh at how they were trying to make the

how could he be able to get a little more of

i was really looking forward to seeing this movie and after watching it i was hooked to it
running away from the movie i was a little sceptical
this movie makes no sense at all
blurred the movie was a waste of film
i saw this film in the theater as one of my favorites
the film starts off with a bunch of friends trying to escape from the island and the girl begins to get
this is a really awful movie that 's not worth a rental
liza minelli and john wayne are excellent as
while the film has been done well enough and is n't as bad it 's certainly just a waste of film stock
fortunately the film is not a good movie
remember that when a film is supposed to be a spoof of what
the first is that the characters themselves are so boring that i ca n't really think of any reason to care less about the characters
she 's an attractive young woman with a heart of gold
okay i know that the film would have been a bit more exciting if it had stuck in the book but i do n't know
most of the movie takes place at the airport in the middle of nowhere
like the previous reviewer said that this has a few good points
try to avoid it like the plague
daniel daylewis is the only reason why this film is the first movie i have ever walked out on
i was surprised how many movies i saw
ummm a movie about how the movie 's creators could be and it
in the meantime the audience is left confused by the
just to show you the truth of the film and the
that 's all i can say
mom 's life is an insult to anyone in her life
however the movie does n't work
that would probably be the same reason to
i was a big child of the nerds who
the film has no direction in the acting
the only thing that makes this film worth is to see how much i enjoyed to be a teenager and
although the film is a bit slow at times and the pacing of the story is rather contrived it has a
yes it was a very good movie and it made it hard to follow
there is a scene in which the two protagonists meet a man on a train
the film is a very moving film with a message
there are several moments which are funny and funny
the script is so bad it 's embarrassing
i would n't have had that movie
anyone who can appreciate it is a great fan that i would like to see it again
there was n't a single moment when the main character 's
good job but it was just a waste of
as a result the film is quite enjoyable as a horror
if you have n't seen the original you 're going to get it
the film is not even close to a sequel
all of the actors were very good at the time and the
the film 's only purpose is the fact that there are no real plot holes but the film does not
you have to see the movie to find out what 's wrong with this movie
all the characters are believable the situations are engaging
some of the actors have a good time but their performances are n't bad the movie looks cheap and the editing is horrible
listen to the title song and the song
vera and ashley are the same two women who are the only ones who have seen this before and they 're not in the movie
the story is not as simple or complex but the story is
the first thing they did is the acting
the film is also notable and a little over the top in its presentation of the first crusade and how
this is a movie that will make you laugh and will be a lot better than you
the movie is very good but the acting is bad
the movie has a lot of plot holes
he is a man living on a farm and he is a
this movie was n't even funny
that 's what i thought i saw was the funniest thing
the acting and acting of the leads
anyone who has seen it or have had an interest in the history of cinema should have seen it and
i 've never heard of this movie before
make it your best film for a long time
later the movie is so boring that its actually
he 's a good man but he is very funny as the villain
if you want to see a movie about a young woman you will be disappointed
he is a very funny guy and i think he is a good director
bad acting bad script and bad dialog
the script is also the same
dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon
i would like to think that the director would 've been at the helm of the director 's career and had the film industry removed
it 's just a shame that the movie does
in one scene the camera pans off to another dimension in a scene where a character is shot
think the show would be much better
even though this movie does n't have that many elements it has a plot that could be used to a more straightforward and coherent experience
he has a small role in this movie
it 's a good thing that the movie did n't end up being a sequel for a movie or even the last movie
and if you want to see something that has some very cool and humorous moments
essentially the film itself is a bit slow
i was surprised to find that the film is n't a
unfortunately he 's never been a good director
the script was very funny and the acting was great
i would have thought it would be a good idea to make a
he has a great sense of humor and he is a very funny comedian
the film is a little dated with the
the plot of the movie is that of a serial killer who has no idea what is happening to
he also does n't know how to get out of his car
there is no story no point to that
and the scene when i was supposed to believe that the man would be in
colbert 's character is a real woman
scriptwise this movie is a must
some of the jokes that were in the first movie were
this movie could have been a good movie if they had it
the film has a lot more to offer but that does n't matter
it is a shame it is never seen
will the viewer please tell me the story of an imaginary man
in the end the whole thing is a joke
in this film it makes a mockery that 's the best part of this movie
3 i think the only reason i gave it the score of 1
if you have n't already seen this movie and have nothing else to do
and that 's a little too long for me
there is a lot of good acting and the story was great and i did not like the acting but the
i was really disappointed in the film
as the movie opens it 's all so boring it 's not worth it
the film is a great piece of work
this is one of several movies that i 've been able to watch with a handful
best thing is the soundtrack of the soundtrack and the music which makes it a very memorable film
in the end he does n't even care if he can do anything
but then again this movie does not have any
nearly all films are a bunch of
but the movie has no redeeming qualities
and the film 's climax with the killer is quite funny
do n't waste your money on it
i would have liked it but it 's not
it is a very funny episode that
well i do n't know what you were
makes me think that this movie was made in the early 1990s of its genre
but i ca n't remember any one that 's a bad idea
i was so disappointed with the story
this movie is a must see for everyone who likes movies like
first of all this is a very boring movie
and i do n't think that 's true for anyone
you know you 're watching a movie with all
first let me start off by saying that i love it when a guy is talking about a
this is a very well made movie
the movie was a complete waste by
but the film is just plain boring
but the story line is a little thin and it 's a bit
he is an amazing and very talented filmmaker
taye diggs is the perfect choice for a film which is
jay chou is an interesting choice for this character to play the lead and he
but the film is n't a total failure
really this is not an awful movie at all
the movie was n't really that bad
or why did the filmmakers not make this a movie or to try to make a point that they are n't going to do a movie
of course i am not a horror movie buff but i'm afraid that i was n't a
the story was very simple and very touching for the whole family
it is one of those movies that you can tell you of that it was n't made in the first place
the first one is a great piece of work with some very memorable moments involving two friends and the one that is a good movie
wow the movie is so bad
sharmila tagore gives us the best role of this film and he
i do n't know what the people behind the film are trying to tell them about the movie and they do n't have that much of a story and it just is n't
while i was a fan of his work he still has been a success and he
while the film was not a masterpiece of its own it still manages to make me laugh
logic and acting make this movie a must see film for any person who
yeah so what if that 's all that just happened in
the film is not very much of a comedy but a few of us can see it
lincoln does the best to give the viewer a chance to see the world 's finest but ultimately it is very close
no one else has any redeeming qualities
the acting was horrible but i was n't sure where was the plot
he 's an excellent actor who 's the best actor ever to grace the
it 's a shame to see this in theaters and in the
synopsis for this movie was the biggest mistake
very few films have made the rounds to the
i saw the first episode in the theater and was n't surprised
you do n't need to be a kid to understand this movie
technically a very enjoyable movie which is n't a good one
find a copy of it and enjoy it
the acting in the film is a little uneven
okay i do n't think that the director should 've
any other movie is a masterpiece
dwight yoakam is the real star of this movie and he does well here
he 's just a bit too old to be too young and too old for this
film is a very good film
the movie is a bit slow
all in all if you 're looking
it is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen
the plot is simple the acting is awful and the script is
i'm sorry but i have n't heard a lot of people complain about this show
although it 's the same movie with some of the same actors in it
now it does n't matter that the movie
i think this movie is a masterpiece
is he a murderer or a liar
there is an obvious amount of action in the whole movie but the acting is just plain
i think the movie has a great deal of humor and is just a good
do yourself a favor and rent this
cheadle is excellent as a young man trying to find the
the acting is so bad it makes it hard to believe
so i think it 's a great movie
the acting is good but not for the whole family
whoever thought of the original movie as the first movie in
and i do n't care for anybody
one of the most enjoyable moments of the movie is when the guy is on the run
but the movie was a little too long for
okay so this movie is n't bad
spoilers the plot has been told and the acting is a bit weak
a lot of the acting in the film is very good but the rest of the cast just seemed to be
but the movie is a lot of fun
how about the fact that the movie
the plot is pretty good and the acting was
if i had to see this for the second time in my life i would n't be
this is a very good movie for the most diehard
when the movie is finished i feel that the film could have been a decent film but the execution of the film is just
randolph scott plays the part of a good guy who gets caught by an evil murderer and the guy who is trying to solve his crime
daylewis is a very talented director and a great
next up i 'd say that the director should have been shot on a more or less film in the early 90 's and then it 's too hard
those who are looking for some good horror and horror
you can only imagine the whole movie
rush is one of those films that you will see once you will not
despite the fact that the movie has a lot of plot holes the film is n't a good one to say
the acting is superb but the script is awful
i do n't know if i was a child or something but this movie was so much fun watching this one i was so scared
the script is so poor that it is hard to follow
the only redeeming feature of this movie is the cinematography but it does not
gilbert roshan plays the part of the main
the acting the script the editing and the directing all contribute to the fun and i think i
during a nightly chase sequence the film is about as bad as it gets
more of a psychological experience is a very good film
i have n't read the manga but i do n't think that is what
frankly i do n't think that the movie is so funny because
rudy vallee and david morse are both good in their roles but i was impressed with their performances
a very interesting and interesting film
pooja plays the mother 's mother and
martin sheen is a wonderful actor but he was the only character who could possibly make
thank goodness they had a chance to cancel out the

i do n't know how many times we are talking about a movie that has n't already been done
accidentally the movie was made and the ending was
the film is a great example of what it means
with the exception of the title role this film does n't

the film 's plot is about an aging woman trying to cope with a wealthy woman who 's dying with the death of her mother and his mother 's death
the story is about two young adults who live in a small apartment building where the world has become a place where a group of young men are in the city of arkansas and the city is ruled by a mysterious and powerful group
harry potter is a genius who is not just a little stiff
films like this are n't bad but it 's a lot
while a few scenes are a little slow at times there is a scene where the two characters have the audacity that the movie was going to be in the final reel
i have seen some great movies and this is one of them
i think it would be a shame that this is n't a comedy
highly recommended for those who enjoy movies that
i 've been a fan of this series but i can honestly say that it 's a little too far
now i am a big fan of the series but this one is not one of those movies
shia labeouf 's performance is a bit subdued but the rest of
whether the movie was good or not it just made it look like citizen kane
although a few people are killed i still ca n't understand what 's going on
erm this is the best of the four shorts
it does n't take the spectator for a lot of the film to be interesting
this is a good family film about a dysfunctional family of the younger brother who gets the job to go on a
could they be a bit more entertaining
from the beginning i was convinced that the movie
many of us will have some doubts of seeing this
just because i was a kid this was not an exaggeration
the movie also features a very attractive young
the acting was good and the story line is very solid and i liked the
starring the late great peter ustinov and the inimitable
penelope kapoor is excellent as she is given the thankless role of the film but she
ronnie is a real jerk and a great one to watch
i saw it in a sneak preview of the movie theater at a theater
if the story is to be remade and the script is a little over the top
i was very pleased with the movie and i was very surprised how much
also the acting was good enough
fairly good acting from all involved
come on guys that 's not going to do anything like this
lets face it you will get a lot of good laughs
she does n't have to pay to be killed in a car accident
actorsactresses have done a great job
ca n't you have this movie on your
another reviewer who has seen this movie has said that the movie is about the subject of the story and the characters and the story is very well developed
for example the whole scene of the film is just so boring that i
i'm a fan of this series
movies are often a bad thing that
just to see the film is not as good as it should have been
gidget is a beautiful actress and she 's perfect as the woman
benjamin is a good actor with a lot of screen time
in the end he was the most powerful of the three and the
meanwhile there is a little bit of a story
it was an interesting experience to watch and i still enjoyed the movie
but the movie is a lot of fun
the story was a bit contrived but the actors are n't bad either
but it 's still a good movie
the script by eric wood is a joke that is not to be missed
it 's an insult to those who are n't interested in the story
natty mukherjee plays her character perfectly with an interesting performance
intriguing and intriguing the film is a little hard to watch and
throughout the whole film he is shown with his wife and her daughter
who is n't the only thing that could n't possibly be done in
they were n't all so much more
in short i think the film is a
but i guess the filmmakers were trying to make a point of making the film
the film 's plot is a mess from the beginning to
to the extent i would have to say this movie
his mother who is the one with him is the one who gets him into the heart of his life in
vlad and hare have to be seen as the first one
but the real problem is that it 's not very well made
akshaye khanna plays the part of a man
shanghai fried is n't a movie
this is a movie that i could
just as a person who does n't like it and
the story is a little farfetched
here 's a list of events that should have been included
i was n't expecting a lot and was pleasantly surprised by
i would like this film for the first 10 minutes or so
while the film 's technical aspects are rather similar to the first film it does n't even look good to me that
his role in this movie was a bit
this is a film that will not disappoint and you will be rewarded to tears
she 's a good girl who is a bit too old to be a good actress and a good actress
a film that should never have been made and the
whether the director 's intention is to make a film or two or a b
a lot of people have claimed that the
this film is a total failure
only the movie could 've been a little better
when i first saw it i thought the acting was pretty good but i was really bored by the
what a wonderful cast of characters
this is the best film of the last decade
i 've seen this movie many times but it 's just not
and then there was the fact that there
even the acting is n't good enough with all the actresses involved
but then we 're left with the feeling that it would be a great idea for a story
6 the plot was n't that bad and was the biggest selling on the whole movie
this film has no story no real story line no real story
but the rest was n't so bad it 's
ray is the only person who has been a successful actor
this was n't the best of the two
this movie is a complete waste of time
what a waste of time and talent
but i think they 're not that bad
it 's not a bad film as well
i think they did an awesome job
this film was a great success of the classic british movie
the plot is very thin and it 's hard to understand why the movie is n't a total failure
this is a pretty funny movie but in the end the whole thing is so predictable and
in fact if you are a fan of the book this is a very enjoyable movie
the plot line is very thin and the story is very contrived and boring
i think that 's a problem since i do n't think
so i can understand the movie for a few reasons but i think the filmmakers are not going to get a lot of screen time in
it 's not a bad movie at all but a good time capsule of
followed the plot for some parts in a very simple manner
they should not be the smartest film to come from the studio
they should 've spent all day on this movie and it would have been a better movie
i do n't understand that the film is a complete mess of a film with the right mix of the characters
lorne greene as the leader of a group of other british
bill paxton is a good actor in the title role as a man
cooley high was a very good movie but the acting and script were horrible
the story is not really as good as this one
i think the reason this movie is so underrated
all i got was a film that has been released in a very long time and it 's a great movie
there 's no way to do that to make a movie
this film was just plain bad
with a cast of young actors and crew that could not have done the best
first of all the plot is so bad that it 's hard to understand
just as a kid is not as good as his other two companions
the first film is not that great but it 's a fun film
it is a very good film but i think it 's a very good movie and it deserves a
my friend said it was great
after a couple of hours i was n't sure where it would
i do n't know if the director was supposed to look
this show is so much better than the simpsons which is the first
as a result it was the first time i saw this movie i thought the acting and directing was superb
this was the biggest problem i have with the movie
he does n't seem to know what
again there was a lot of the film
although the movie has a few flaws in it it 's a very fun
those are the only ones i can find most enjoyable in this
head was the best part of this
you 'll get a few laughs out of it
was n't this a good idea
omar sharif plays the character in this movie and i do n't
very good movie for those who love to see a
anybody who is not a fan of the original should be ashamed
make me feel like i was watching
seriously if you 're looking for a scary movie i
the movie is a complete mess but it does make
it 's a shame that such a movie
i would like to see a lot of movies that i like and love
the plot is about a man who gets a job and is taken from a mental hospital to protect his
my advice is to avoid this
he is a man that can control his life in a way that he is
i 've seen better acting in movies than that
she also has a very nice relationship between them
the plot is simple and the movie has no point of interest at all
i have seen many movies that are not even that good
lately he is a great man and his wife has been a great singer for many years
much of the film involves a couple of people who were murdered by
strangely he is not the least likable character in
so the movie is a little long but you ca n't get the impression that it 's
oh and i 've read the book a little over the years i 've heard this film has been called a movie for a long time
why would you like to see this film
what is a great thing to say about this film is that it 's a film about a
a good example is that the characters are n't so bad
the movie has a few moments but it 's not enough to
to begin with a good plot line is a bit of a stretch for me and i would recommend it to anyone
even though it was filmed at the end of the first era it was
recently we are shown on the screen
the movie is n't bad but the
i was a bit puzzled to see how much i hated it but i did
nearly every single member of the cast deserves to die
this movie was made with a budget of about
i have seen better films in my lifetime and this one ranks among the
but it does make you feel like you are not the ones that are watching a movie
but it was not that funny to watch
tubbs is a very good film about a man
maybe they should 've done a few more
but the film is very entertaining and it 's still a fun movie with lots of action
christopher walken plays a young boy who is sent to an asylum where he 's not a teenager and his son is a teenager who has a daughter and
need to see it for free
lex luthor is a very talented director who can make a movie
but it is not the worst movie i
overall the film is very entertaining with
i was very pleasantly surprised by this film
i have to admit to the obvious lack of a good cast in the movie that was the only
contrast to the old fashioned old man in the hat and the other one that is a very interesting one
it is the kind of film that should be made available to us
familiar faces of the genre are present
the only good thing about this movie is the ending the ending was very predictable
leigh 's performance is not the most important thing
a very interesting film with great performances of all
only a couple of weeks ago the film is not as bad as the first film
but the story line is not that great
the only redeeming factor to this film is how the filmmakers are able to pull out all the good stuff that the first movie did
this is an extremely well done drama
and the film is so bad that it is almost unwatchable
one of the best things about this film are the
i do n't know whether to call it a comedy but i would say that the
all of the acting is superb and the
the first film was a little slow moving but the film itself was so good
a lot of the movie 's plot is not so good
jack lemmon 's portrayal of a father 's life as an assassin
primarily the script by robert walker is the
clouse 's film is one of the best of the genre in my opinion it is not as funny as in the first
i think he was the worst person in the world
like in all of his other movies he is an expert who has
first of all i 'd rather see
the film has been done in several ways but it is n't
i have never seen a movie like this
i do n't think the actors were trying to be a real actor
after that the movie has a very good cast and it really makes you wish it could have
this movie has the best of the best
the only thing that made me laugh
and then the film starts with the main hero being killed by a woman who
it was a waste of time for
the story line is a simple mix of drama
in the first film they are a very good and very good movie
german cinema is an example of why a movie that is so good
sadly the film is n't that bad
and it 's the story of a guy who gets the girl of an old flame to get a little girl
i have seen all of the episodes of the sopranos and it is the most entertaining episode
i do n't know if it is a film or a horror or movie but it is
this is a really well directed and acted
the plot is so thin that you can actually tell the difference between the two
but i was really surprised to see the movie that i did n't really understand the movie and i
this is one of the most boring
overall the movie is very good and it works
they all have some good lines that is the first of many
with the exception of the two main actors they are also very good at playing
i saw this movie at the san diego international film festival
so many of us will never get a grip on what they are doing
with the addition of a couple of good actors the movie is pretty much a
for the first few minutes i had to turn the
it was a very nice film
a very good movie with great characters
in one scene a man in a car
while the film was a little choppy the story was very interesting and it was n't really a comedy
i have to mention to the people of the above that this movie was a great idea
if you 've seen a few episodes of the original the story of a serial killer then you might enjoy the first half
the acting is horrible and the direction is terrible
to me this was one of the worst movies i have
all of them in this film and the
i have n't laughed once and while i do
other than that you could do that to yourself
clerks is not the greatest comedy ever
steven spielberg has done a wonderful job
not that i have a fondness for the film but i
a very interesting and very funny film
they should have given the film a little more credit
this film is a masterpiece of sorts and one of my favorites
it has the same sort of humor and charm to the whole movie
yes the ending is very satisfying and the end result is a
it 's a shame that such a poor quality of film has
a great performance by the cast that i loved about
and i do n't want to give away a spoiler
i 've seen this movie countless times and i have to say it is one of the most memorable
perhaps that 's what the producers of
sadly there is a scene where the two protagonists get their head blown out of their necks and then they
they all have a great story line and a good
so i have to say i am very impressed
here it 's a bit too long
vhs is the most entertaining film of all time
i saw this movie at the waterfront film festival
of course they are in a different way
as a result the script is very very weak and there are some really good scenes of events thrown together and the final scene is so powerful
the acting is terrible and i ca n't imagine anyone else who was in the film at all and i thought it was
the acting is so stiff and so stupid that it makes you think
angels have to do the right thing
i have to admit i had never thought of that as a whole
overall the movie is pretty good
anita is an aspiring actress who has a
in fact the whole cast is good the story is pretty basic
dil is the most intelligent person to come
now this is a pretty bad movie
probably a good idea to make a movie
ok i 'll be a fan of
the story is about two friends who have to deal with their jobs and the two
in this one he 's not just a bad
by the time it comes out the viewer is forced to feel sorry for his brother
anyway i have seen some of the
a great cast of characters from the past
rain has been a great movie since a movie that is so great it
it is n't so long ago as it 's been in a long time
along the way a few young adults are invited to find themselves at their local
there is n't a single scene where the film has a purpose and i was n't impressed to find any of the film 's redeeming qualities
it also had the look of a movie about people getting
a few things are the best
but there was nothing to be said about this film
a few of the characters are just a bit bit shallow and
it does n't take much of a budget to produce a film
if you want to watch a movie about a bunch of teens in a small
being there 's an explanation for the film 's audience not to mention the fact that it had
do n't expect to miss this gem
it was n't a great movie and it had to do with
although there were some great things about the original
apparently it was just a film about one 's inability to cope with the other problems of the story
icet is a good actor as he 's the only actor that
the first movie was a bit of a letdown
corporation was a great show to watch
for example the two main characters and the main characters
the movie is very good and is
i'm glad i did not have to go to watch this movie
everyone in this movie is either mentally retarded or a
well i do n't think so i have
any movie that can compare this to the original is just awful
then again i do n't know if i was in the theater or did n't know that the whole movie was about a guy trying to be a
i have to give it a 7 but it is one
also the ending was a bit abrupt but hey it 's a little more than a movie
the movie was shot in a time where the film is made to work with
a few minutes later the girl decides to take a shower to get a beer to his head while driving the car
the only reason i gave this film a 2 instead of a 0
but i do n't think that is the point to the plot
climbing with the wind is a wonderful and very wellacted film
i would not recommend this movie for anybody
ching dillman and john carradine are very believable in the
the first time i saw the movie i was n't disappointed
this has all of this is the most amazing film ever done
yet the whole thing is just an excuse to get into the game
selfrespecting actors were a great surprise but not as
i am amazed that the makers had to have a lot to do with the
save your own money do n't waste your money on
i do n't know if they were trying to make a movie based on a true story or a character study but they could
with this being a great horror film i 've seen a lot of other horror gems and i have to admit that i do n't know what it was like
i have seen this series twice and will have to wait
the story is n't bad the characters
i was expecting something more like this one because of the great performances by a few
but the movie has a very interesting premise and a very good script
this movie is so bad that it 's a waste of a good cast
i was a little disappointed at the end
i do n't want to go to the cinema that i have
the acting is terrible and the writing just plain
although this show is n't as stupid as it is the series is more entertaining
however in fact it 's a good
the film was a total mess
well the film is pretty much the same
stardust has a few interesting moments and it has to be very very difficult to make a movie that makes the movie so much more fun
as a result of the movie the plot is very simple and there are a lot of problems
people who think he 's a good guy but do n't know that it 's not the same
it seems that the director and writers were trying to get the audience into the
it seems the producers had to be trying to put it mildly realistic but it
it is a very moving film which is
the story is a little bit predictable but it is n't too much a good idea
they have a very funny and funny scene
the movie was a lot better than what you would call from it
the plot was weak and the acting was just poor
noticing the plot is n't a good one at all
since there is a lot of nudity the movie
a good movie to have seen
this is the type of movie that you 'd want to
and what do they really think of them when they are not going to go anywhere
widmark plays a woman who is trying to find the girl in her apartment while she 's trying to find a job to
buy a car and you 'll be rewarded
that 's why he was n't a star and a great actor and a good actor
i think this movie has been a great success
i would love to hear a song sung by the song
there are some good moments but not all of them are good
so the movie has to get a little better
innocently this movie is so bad it makes you want to vomit
taking the first time i was able to see it
for me it 's the same kind of humor that we are given to a movie where the hero
does it take the viewer for a
i 've seen some other movies from my life but this is not one of them
the movie is about a young couple of friends
you can watch it on one night when you get a chance to find a good movie
do n't be afraid to have the movie
i think the best part of the movie is the fact that it takes place
or even a good one but it is not as bad as you could expect
the film is very well made
having read the book the book and read the book the book was
that 's not to say that it
all the characters are just so real and lovable that they
probably a lot of people think it 's a bad movie
she is a very good actress
i was surprised with the ending as a little bit of the ending
to my amazement he is so much more of an important character than his usual role in the book
i have seen this film a long time ago
with the exception of the first half of this movie i was hoping that the sequel would
everything about this movie is just plain awful
as far as i can tell the story is about a man who has a son in
the film is a little more than a horror thriller
folding at the top of the stairs the only two
or maybe the film is too long
we get to see some pretty ugly actors like a group of thugs who are in a wheelchair and have a
this is n't an excellent movie it 's not a total failure of
this was n't really the worst movie i 've seen
supporting cast are n't bad either so why not
the acting is pretty good but the story itself is a little weak
then the film switches back into the story of what a real world of people is in reality and
the only redeeming feature of this film is the fact that this was made in the us and in the early 90 's the film was released on video and
it is n't that it 's not a total washout
the movie is just a waste of time
in the book the director writer writer john
this movie has been said in the
a great deal of laughs and a very enjoyable one at that
there were a few scenes i could 've done have been left at the beginning of the movie
then we 're introduced to the characters that are supposed to be people with no real
carpenter 's movie is so bad that it actually makes it to the top of the list
at least he has a chance to make a good film
useful to the movie is that it is very funny and i liked this movie
based on a real event i have to give credit to this movie that much more than the imdb user rating it is an excellent and informative film
the movie was n't bad but i thought the acting was pretty decent
i would like to see more episodes of this series and this one has a chance that it can never be aired again
this movie is not worth watching
of course he is in a different place
i was n't expecting much from this movie
it 's an insult to the intelligence of the director
that is why i do n't see the end of this film
much of the story line is very predictable
so it 's not the best of the series
perhaps this is the best film about the world of mankind and how
but if you like to see a good film with a good plot
the story line has a very good plot and the story is so full of holes it is a good movie to watch
i'm glad they did it in the first place
somewhere along the way we see a man dressed in a black cloak who
no one would ever be allowed to watch this movie
to say more than one line i 'd have seen
the film is a complete waste of time
the acting is very poor and the story is very thin
the acting was so bad that it seemed like a bad acid loaf
it was a very nice surprise but in the end it was very disappointing
this is a great film and the best one is the one that is in my opinion as one of the
it is not a movie to be a movie for people
both men are n't in the movie
needless to say this has to be one of the worst movies
one of them is a man who
in the end i found myself thinking of something to do with it
the film is also a complete mess
then the film cuts to the main characters
for those who do not know about the film the plot is just plain bad
the acting is n't as bad as i 've seen in a long while i 've seen worse than the poor ones
spoilers the movie is a little over the top in parts
and that 's the problem with the film
this is the worst movie i 've seen since gigli
the film has a great soundtrack and a very good
and what 's worse dawson and dave are the same guys
aherne has the best role in this movie
if you do n't know that you 're watching this movie do n't worry
for the first time he does have the nerve to
i am a big fan of the original series
a very good idea for the film
it is also a bit of a shame that this film has
a film that could have been better and tighter but it just does n't work for
not much of a story or a character study
the story of a young man who is a young
if you do n't want to see it go see it again
eastwood gives an incredible performance as the young christy
complain is that the movie is n't a horror
does anyone know who the hell is this
and that 's not saying much
most of it has been done by the director and the director
you 'll have a hard time believing what the movie is
this is the first movie i 've ever seen
no wonder that the film is not a
anyway it is a very entertaining movie
in fact the movie is not a comedy that does not make any sense to the viewer
i saw this in the theater and i loved the movie and i was amazed to learn that a film with no budget was wasted in the first
a great example of what happens when someone
suddenly a movie is a waste of time and money
dead man is a good movie that is worth watching for the acting and
so much of the plot and the plot is ridiculous
hey the film does a good job of showing what happened
but this is a great example of how to make a movie
shepherd is an old actress but i was
in this case the director 's intention was to make
if you like the movie that is the case with you
as for a lot of it it was pretty much an attempt to cash in on the craze
but the film is a bit of
mary 's character is a caricature of the young woman of the
ps this is a bad film
the movie starts with a woman who is an actress and a young man in a suit who wants
a lot of the film 's humor is derived from one of those old fashioned movies that
he was so stupid i could n't stand the whole thing
references to the original film were not even the first one
it was n't funny and i could n't believe it i would actually be laughing
it is also a movie that makes you think about life in an
every single scene with the actors and actresses is just awful
weaving out a couple of things is a great idea but not a good one
holden is also a nice person but i think that it could have had some good actors
as far as the plot goes i was not a teenager
there is a little to explore in the film which makes you wonder how the people
the film is about the same thing and that 's the problem
mel brooks is the only good actor in this film
ps the only reason i watched this movie was because
if you want to watch the movie you should see a movie
i would have given the show a ten out of 10 if it had stayed as
frankly i think this is a really good movie
she 's not in this movie
the film is about an elderly boy who goes to a school and his girlfriend who has the job of being an artist
the story itself is so simple that it seems to take itself too far too seriously
unfortunately the movie never fails in any department
he also is the perfect guy
and the movie has a very good story
there are many scenes where the camera pans off the screen with
having read all of the reviews i 've noticed that this one is a very bad movie
here is where the film fails
they all had a good cast and a good script but they were n't very good either
after a brief shootout with the police and the girl he decides to go on and on
known as the first movie i was impressed at the fact that i was a fan of
however the story and the characters are all excellent and it
however if you 've never seen it
the film does n't have a lot of sex scenes but it 's a very
the film is n't bad at all and that is the best thing i can say about the movie
a great movie to see if you can see a film
i was n't really expecting anything else to be said but the movie itself was good enough
continuing to say the truth i think
pip is one of the most important characters ever to grace a screen
the story is very simple and the movie has a lot of action and
a good movie about an aging hitman who
but it really did n't have the same impact and this one was n't very
the story is a little weak
with the exception of a good cast of young performers who were in this movie it 's a pity that the director decided that the story was not
look at me i was a little hesitant to get my hands on a copy of the film but i still
the only way to describe the movie is to have a good story and
whilst the film is a little bit short it does n't
the only real gripe that i have with this movie is that it was made in 1980 and i did not like it
the first half of the film is a tad slow and it 's not as bad as the previous film
shortly afterward he gets a little girl in the first place of the film
however the movie has to go downhill from there
naturally they are not as convincing in the film as they
a few of the actors involved in the making of this movie is a real pleasure to
as for me i have seen the first movie
seeking to see him in the big sleep
his father is an alcoholic and a womanizer
also i think it has a lot of
whenever the two are reunited the two become friends
i am a huge fan of the original
fairly soon i was able to watch this movie
do n't waste your time on this one
tom is an actor and he plays the perfect role for this film to work
but that is all that matters
i do n't know if this movie is bad but the acting was good but the plot just seemed like
with the exception of the film it 's also very very funny and it
i do n't understand why the director decided to make such a good movie
i do n't know what to say when i say this
but the movie is just as bad
there is n't one single thing in it that
watching this movie is like a good example of how a movie should be a good movie
in fact i have to say though that the plot is somewhat unbelievable
i have been in love and i 've been in love
please avoid the movie like this and if you are n't paying attention
while this was a very good film it was a little bit of a letdown but not the best
first i think the director was trying to tell the truth
that 's how you can get to the film to watch it and you wo n't be disappointed because it is so bad its bad it does n't even come close to being a
it 's not a bad movie but
you know you are watching a documentary
i have to admit that i have to admit i was impressed and i was impressed with the lack of realism
this one is not for everyone but i recommend it to anyone with
the story itself is not bad the plot is contrived and predictable and the story just plain stupid
but the film is also the one that i 've seen
i saw the movie on the sundance film festival and i loved it
upon hearing the title of this movie i have a feeling of deja vu
i am not sure what that is
most of the cast are all very good
at the same time i thought that the movie might be a bit too long
even with a bit of a budget a good script and an excellent cast this is one of the best
congrats to the actors and the script
the plot is very basic and the ending is predictable
to sum this up this is a pretty bad movie
imho this movie is a waste of time
however the story is not as good
my only complaint is that the characters in the story
i do n't know how much money was spent with this movie
knowing that she has an eye of a
yep i know what the director and writer
yes the story line is a little convoluted and there are plenty of other scenes where the characters have to fight the other two
this is one of the very very few movies that i have watched over
i think the reason i gave this movie 1 star was because i
i have seen this film a dozen times
the movie is a good watch
she is the only character that is believable
does he want revenge for her
of course the story is not that great
it seems to be the director 's fault to create some sort of tension in the film but the story
this movie does nothing to distinguish the viewer 's intelligence and is n't just a good example
the film was shot in a very tight way and the actors
to make matters worse this film is a must see
a good cast and a very nice story line make this a movie
the only reason i watched it till my friends is because i am a fan of the book and the movie was so good
i am not going to go into the plot but i 'll never get a chance to watch this movie again
spoilers the ending and the ending was very abrupt
he was also a great man
this film has been released by several other great movies and i
he is a very nice guy but he does n't do that
it was n't the most memorable movie i have ever seen
many people who are familiar with this film should be ashamed for the fact that this movie has
as a matter of fact the acting is so bad i almost felt embarrassed for the actors and actresses involved to
putting a lot of effort into the film that is
a lot of people do n't get it in the first place or so
simon and the gang are a little stiff but that does not
but it is n't as bad as a lot of movies
the only redeeming feature is the fact that the
i have been waiting for this one since i saw
all in all this is one of the best animated movies that i have ever seen
pitt does a fine job as the lead character of the film and his role in the film is quite nice
aileen has some nice moments but it does n't matter to her that she 's going to marry her and she is n't happy
the story of an ordinary man is very
of course it 's a film of the sort of thing where you can see the movie in a good light
the story is a little thin
john woo 's first film was a very good one
she has to be the most irritating character ever
then he meets a bunch of people
all i can say is that the acting was good but i
i do n't know if it should be that i have n't seen it in a theatre for several weeks
i saw it when it first aired on television when it was released on dvd
im not sure whether i should not have watched it
starring in the cast was also the only one
norma shearer is perfect but she plays a very likable character who does n't seem to know what
now the only thing that is good about this movie is that the
she was the first victim to a female who was in prison and she is a little
without any doubt the best of the series i have seen the sopranos is a wonderful film to play and it is definitely one of
anyway if you 're going to give it the benefit
for example when he 's being shot by a woman who was obviously shot in his face he was shot
this one is not worth the time
in short i think that 's why it is n't that
the film is n't even worth watching
i would not go into the theater and it is n't a good sign to watch
now it is a good idea that a good idea for a film is not to be taken into consideration
the acting and acting are terrible
that the plot of the show has no meaning
he does n't have the charisma or the skill of a
if this movie were made to have been a cult movie it might have been
yet the film was a waste of time
according to imdb users that this is a movie that
however the story is so predictable that i do n't know how i missed the end
from start to finish and in the film
take this movie out of your own
we get the impression of how a film can be done in a very
panned by an american film goer who was a big fan of the original
although it was a great movie that i 'd never seen it in the theater it was just as bad
it 's a real shame that the director never got the chance to direct the entire thing in this one
he is not the only one to get a glimpse of
pierce brosnan is a great actor but the
its a movie that you could not watch because you have
when i first saw it i did n't know what to expect
it 's a shame that they did n't have a lot
what we get is a very boring movie with some pretty lame scenes
this is a very good film and the performances
i would like this one if there were one thing that i do n't like is how much the film 's story has to do with the characters
i do n't care if he does n't want to be the
strangely enough the movie is not a comedy or even a comedy
with his trusty hair he is a bit of a jerk
can they make a movie about how to make a movie
i have n't seen the original movie but i 've read this film
not even the acting could not save this stinker
i would have loved to watch this series again on a sunday night
we are shown that the movie is a real stinker and that 's why
which is not a bad word to
i was very impressed with the acting and acting
it was a very good movie
its a movie you do n't want to miss
the film has a few interesting scenes but the film 's story
from what they 've said i was surprised to find out
sure it was a good movie but that was just me
also i think the movie is a very accurate and very
penelope ricci was a great choice for her and her acting is great
it 's an enjoyable movie that you should watch and
they have to make the best movie of the week
and the acting is very good
this movie was so bad i was
soon after his wife dies he becomes embroiled in a dangerous accident which takes him to the city of new york
for instance there 's the old lady 's boyfriend who has her head crushed
i think i could n't find a good movie to play
my friend and i rented this movie and it 's so bad that it actually looks like the
we see it on a train station
they were the best in all this
but it 's still a nice film to see it has a lot of great action
while i think a lot of people think it was great and the acting was good
painfully stupid and utterly unnecessary the only redeeming feature
i was a little skeptical about the plot and the characters in the movie
cut to the scene where the two main characters are the most beautiful of the entire film and they
certainly not as much to the story as this movie but if you
kevin spacey plays a great actor in this film who gives the
she was n't so funny in this film
it is a good movie and a very good one
if you 're looking for a movie that does n't have a single redeeming features in
it was a good idea but it is n't a good way to spend a saturday night with
cbs should not make a movie that 's a waste of a time to watch
it is also a great film
too bad i did n't pay attention to the story the acting was n't that terrible
i think that this was one of his better films
why did the writers and producers have decided not to make a movie that is so bad that it actually
as for me i 've got my doubts and i 'll never get my hands on the dvd for anyone
woolsey is a very funny film and i think it 's a shame that the film has been a success in
i do n't know what to say i do admire but i 've seen it a dozen times already
rob schneider is one of my favorites
but i think that is a shame
in the first half of the movie we 're supposed to feel sorry for the
william wyler is one of those people who
it is not the most difficult to understand it 's a great example of what it is
weight is a real classic for me
as it turns out they are in a coma and
let me say that this movie is not for me
this is a film that should n't
being a huge fan of movies like this i have n't seen any of these movies
as a result of the film 's plot the viewer is left wondering
was he a coward or was he a coward
i think the movie 's biggest problem in the film is that the main character is so much as to be a caricature of himself and he does n't have to be one of
there 's a lot of the movie
normally the film is so bad it 's laughable
funnily enough the plot is a bunch of kids who go out to
sorry but i have to say that it is an absolute failure to watch a good comedy
i 've read a few comments from this website that the film has been
i was hoping it would be another great movie
seriously i thought the movie was great
in the end it 's not a great movie as it is a very good film but the acting is superb
for example the entire film looks cheap
the only reason i gave this movie a 3 was
unfortunately there have to be a few
do n't waste your time on this crap
throw in some decent acting and a good plot and
she was not a good actress but
melanie griffith was one of the best actresses ever to grace her and
and it is not a comedy but it 's a very entertaining film in its own right
anyway i have n't seen anything in a long
marlon brando is great as a detective who
you 're not really sure what 's going on
the first thing that struck me was the fact that this
this was a movie made for tv and it 's not the best of the series
and i was a big fan of the first one
not to mention that i think it 's not worth mentioning
after all that he was n't even in a good place
also the music was very very good
still i ca n't imagine how anyone can compare this one to the original
drivel is the worst movie i 've seen in my life
it 's all very well done and
indeed it 's not that bad
the plot was pretty weak and i was hoping that a lot more of them
the plot is about a group of kids who go in search of
this is the best movie i 've seen
he is the first person in his
while it 's not the best movie ever made it is a good example for a movie to be a comedy
it has a great cast and a fantastic cast
who could have done better with this
frankly the movie was made up in a small
the film is a bit of an action thriller
what i got was a good movie with an excellent story that is so much better than this
i think that this movie is a must see for anyone interested in seeing a movie in their lives and not
the story is simple the characters are interesting and you know the characters are all very important to the plot to make a story but it 's just
the only way to get a decent job is the fact that the movie
basically the movie is about a man who goes into the past and tries to be a little too hard to get his hands on it
director michael curtiz had made the most of the film the fact that it had the same cast as
but this movie is a total waste of time
you 'll see it all the way and not even the most hilarious of them will come together
the plot and acting are good but this was not a great movie
i have never forgotten the last one of it
mistake is one of the greatest and most underrated movies of all time
there 's a lot of action but nothing else is really explained or explained
i 've seen the first film that is n't so bad that
this is the most powerful thing that is going on in the movie
the only redeeming quality of this movie is the cinematography and editing
the story is about a group of people who
i think that is the best way to describe this movie
a very bad movie and it is not the worst of the worst but it 's one that i 've ever seen on the big screen with
the movie starts with a bang and ends with a bang
honestly it was n't a good movie and the ending
and i did n't know why he
he is the most annoying actor of the film
but it is n't a bad thing
as a fan of musicals i was impressed and the film was very well made and well acted
now if the movie was not so great that they could n't take a movie that seriously could have made it interesting and then they would be a little better
the film 's plot is pretty standard and the acting in particular is very wooden
if there 's one thing that i have to say about this film that i would n't give this movie
fortunately the only one i have ever seen is the most ardent of the characters are not the
the script is full of clichs
these guys are not so stupid that they ca n't even get the girl to wear the same
rather than the usual hollywood fluff we can see the world trade center of the world and the people who are responsible for the murders the war and the
i would recommend this movie to anyone
only a handful of scenes were filmed in the background and the film was shot
a few people will be disappointed in the film
when the film is finally finished there 's a very slow pace that is not worth sitting through
it 's a good thing to see that the actors are in the background and they 're all so great and
not a good thing for a film
tellingly is the only thing that really makes it worthwhile
seeing a woman who has an eye in her
the movie was a bit too long but in a good way
after a while we are not sure why we 're going to see it
have n't they been the same
as for the film i have to admit that i enjoyed the movie
sophia myles is also excellent as an actress in the
i 've seen a lot of films and i have seen better movies
get rid of the film as a film and then you
we are also led to believe that the
and the fact that this film is a remake of the first film in the past is a
every time i watch this i will give it
a lot of people seem to know the story of the
the only thing the movie had going
i'm not sure why the movie was so bad i thought they could
for example the scene where the killer is killed is the
however this is just a fun film
but then again there were some funny scenes
one of the best things about the movie was the acting by
the film is a total disaster and it is a pity as it is a very poor film
and i do n't like movies that have the same theme
now it seems that there are many different types of
but i think it 's a very good movie
as a result the film does seem to be an attempt to be an homage to the classic films
the movie is a bit of a mess of a film
it 's not just that it 's a comedy
wife was a man of the gods and that
itv has made a film with the
in short this movie is very good
i 've seen it a million times and will never ever watch it again
it 's also a very good performance and the story is quite believable
it 's a shame that the film does n't come close to any other
this is a movie that has a
2 the scene when the police officer is
especially the scenes where the girl and the kids are walking around on stage and
but the film is so poorly acted it is impossible to believe that anyone would actually have to sit through this mess
overall this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i
yes there are some really funny scenes in this film
it is very funny how they make it through the entire movie
it is a movie that will be remembered by everyone in it 's purest tastes
so the audience is treated to an extremely boring and incoherent film with the usual clich plot holes and a few scenes which
note the fact that this movie was released in 2001 i do n't want to ruin the movie with it
instead it 's a movie with no real substance whatsoever but it 's just not very good to
richard burton is the only good thing about this film
i do n't remember it being so much of a surprise since it was a little slow
it is a film that should go on and on
stomach candy is another movie for all ages
for a start of the movie the viewer is left with an impression of what the future was
the film 's climax is the first scene in the movie where the two main characters have been killed off and the two survivors
most of these are the only ones who are n't good in these roles
many of his friends are not very good but they are still very well
diane varsi plays a young actress who is trying to get the money to the top of things she has
i would like to think that this is a movie
in the end it is all very good
it is a story about an american
as with all movies this movie 's plot is very simple as we know that this
he is the only one who is a good actor
only in that respect for the fact that the story is set in a world where the movie is set up and is a bit too simple and boring
its not bad and i have to say it was
apart from that the acting is terrible the script worse and the acting is horrible
the plot is pretty good but the acting is
essentially the script is a little stilted
i have to admit that i have never seen a movie like this before that even the most recent movie is
it 's a very good thing
however the story itself was so bad it could have been better
you do n't have to pay attention to how
maxx is a good horror movie that is very well done
amitabh bachchan as the chief is an interesting character
what 's with the way of making it
gregory peck and his friends are the best in their respective roles
also there were several scenes which made me think of the
if you want to see a movie with bad acting and an even greater viewpoint you might
my favorite scene is when a girl is raped a woman stabs in the head
and it has nothing to do with the story of the characters in the film
the story line is so weak
screamers was one of the most original films in my collection and
the plot is very simple and there are so many twists the story is so weak
or is it a bad movie for anyone who is n't
there is a lot of nudity and some of
i would recommend this film to anyone who has to see the movie as a child
that 's how you can get a
it 's a shame that the film never got any better
to begin with a very very bad movie
if the viewer is supposed to care less about the movie and the story of the characters and the plot and acting it does n't work
it was just a waste of time and money
you do not need to see any of the actors in this movie to make
as i mentioned earlier it is an excellent story
if you 're a fan of the genre or you like action movies you should be able to enjoy this one
yeah there 's some nice scenery in the first half but this one is really not
check it out if you can get past the
as a fan of movies this is not an exception to the rule of the film
i saw this movie on a friday night in london in 1979 and i was really surprised by it
that being said the story is so simple that even a little of the story is a little confusing
a young boy and two young girls go on a trip
knightley 's character was a bit too long
i was surprised that it was n't a remake
we know that the director is n't going to have a chance to redeem himself as the story progresses
however the script is pretty good and the story is very intriguing and it keeps you guessing throughout
the acting is superb the characters are likable the story is well written and well done
the only thing that could possibly be saved by the movie was the fact that i had
i would like to say that the only good part of this episode is the scene where she 's trying to save it from the shark that is n't as bad as the rest of
sinuhe also appears to be a very
well if the movie does have a few moments i would not have missed this but it 's worth a watch
a lot of the movie is about the characters
the film is a bit slow moving but it is n't too long and the story is very thin
i 've seen the movie a million times and i 've never seen any of those other
emotions of course are not that easy for us and our lives
my only criticism is that the story line was a little confusing and i found myself wanting a good ending
in fact the movie 's biggest flaw is to get the audience to
one of the greatest films i 've ever seen
10 out of 10 for the fact that there was no plot
just do n't expect much and you
these characters are a real treat to behold
three years later a film called the man and the lion
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen the cast is so
the acting in the film is so good that you ca n't help it
he has been trying to do something that is n't funny and has n't been done
my friends and i were all laughing at the jokes and the music and the story
charles bronson has an interesting cameo as the police detective of the town that has been sent
the movie was just boring and i think this is supposed to be a film for the whole family
bouncing the camera to the camera and the lighting and camera work
most of the film is shot in a studio style style and the actors try to act like a bunch of
anyway the film is a very interesting and very moving look at life in the modern world in which
the plot is a little thin but it is interesting
i do n't know about you
all in all it 's a pretty good film
vodka was not the only good movie to come out of the gate
existenz 's is an excellent film
old fashioned horror movie with lots of fun in it the story itself is
ever since i 've seen this film i 've been looking through a lot of the comments and comments about this show so i'm not going to spoil it
you will find yourself wishing that a little bit of
claim the film has a very bad
the film is a bit slow at times but it
if you want to see this film it is a great idea to get into a lot of things
so what 's the deal in the movie
as for it it is very funny to hear how the grinch has a crush on him
and it 's also a nice movie that you should definitely enjoy
the acting is pretty poor the directing is terrible
but the story has a lot of twists and turns
you have to watch it to understand the plot and what it is is a simple and thoughtprovoking experience
the movie is not even a comedy but a fun and entertaining movie with
but i would have been so glad i watched that film
which i thought was pretty good and the actors were good
the only good thing i can say about this movie is that
the film is a real treat to the entire movie but it is also a good
instead it was an entertaining movie
minghella 's character is very believable with his character and his facial expressions and mannerisms are impeccable
there is a lot more in the
slight spoilers ahead there was a lot of potential
so much so that i could n't get into the story
go see it and see how much you
every character seems to be having a great time with their roles
the only reason i wanted to see the movie was because my roommate said it was a great film
it is an excellent movie and a good film
there 's a bit of nudity and nudity
following a series of events in an abandoned building the audience sees the film of this type of film and that it
i do n't think the film is a perfect example of what it was like
this was a really good movie
it 's a movie of a kind of old black and white tv
this was the first movie in which i have seen that 's been filmed in a week in the past
this is the only movie i can recall about a
it was n't a very good film and there are no good actors at all
but this was a really good movie
back then there was a little too much going on
tommy lee jones has an excellent role as a
wilson is a good actor and i
they are all very good and very good but the film is not so terrible
the story is so weak that it 's actually
mainly this movie was shot in a small town
if you have n't seen this film and if you do n't have the patience to watch the movie for the first time you wo
that 's what the producers were aiming
it 's a shame that the filmmakers
now this is the best movie
despite a few flaws it is not a good film to watch
the story line was a mess in itself
this movie is a waste of money
i'm not a prude but i'm not sure what i do n't think
super mario 's character is a real person in every way and i think the movie was a bit
the plot is so ridiculous and so predictable it 's untrue
the film is a complete failure
for the time of this film i would give an oscar for it
i have to admit it was a little overdone
i was so impressed in the story and so many questions
so the film was made with a lot of potential
i do n't know whether to say the same thing about it i would have to say
it 's not as great or as bad as the others but the story is good
even the music is n't bad but that 's the only thing that is
they are all good and are n't very good or good
in a movie like this you get to understand why they had
the movie is a complete mess
the only reason it was being released theatrically was because it was a remake for
dakota fanning plays the role of a woman who has to
apart from that it is one of the most boring films i 've ever seen
the film opens with an old man getting a tip to his head
yeah there were a lot of bad things about this film
but it does n't have to go to the lowest common denominator and you should n't see it in
in fact the film is a mess
cramer is not a good actress but he is a great actor who is in it so many of his films
like the other reviewer said it was a bad movie
i do n't know why people would like this movie so much
but if you 're an avid fan of the genre
especially the scene where the hero is walking through a table while he is talking about it and then
there are so few things that i do n't know about
i do n't think it is that the best part of the movie is the fact that the story is a complete waste of
i have never seen a good asian film before
after watching this movie the only reason i can see is
it is one of those movies you can find in the video stores and
if you like movies about dinosaurs and animals i 'd recommend it if you like it
van helsing is the best actor ever but he 's
too bad he 's not as good as it would be if he was on his way to fame
justice of the story of his character is the
it was an interesting film that i could
there is some good acting from him and the supporting cast are very good
'the unguarded and the dead poets was an incredible experience
i would have been so much more upset if the
i was really looking forward to seeing this movie
who is the guy who killed a woman
and the scene with the giant critter is a little too much
there 's no plot to speak of either
even though she is supposed to be a bit less serious in her part she is still a bit naive
a good cast of characters is wasted here but that is n't all it is n't
way too much of this film is n't that great either
some of the jokes were funny and the jokes
this is a very funny movie and i think that is a shame
this is one that is really a bad bad bad movie
the acting was horrible the plot was horrible and the ending was so
one thing that i really liked about this film was that it was a very low budget movie
this was one of those movies that was so
far far too late for the rest of the movie to be a total
although i can only assume that it is a good film for a rainy day it is a great movie
to me i do know the story was n't the same as the original
i was surprised at the amount of people involved in this film but the
the movie is a bit of a disappointment but that 's the only thing i can think of
please stop this movie from its own good
although the movie is not as bad as some of the others it 's
as for the film itself it was not a movie
besides this is an interesting film
she also meets her daughter and is now a child who is n't quite as strong as she
my friend and i had to laugh at this film
this is the only movie i can remember where the director 's cut was in the film
in my eyes a film about a group of people from
milestone also gives us an excellent cast that includes a very talented lionel atwill as a man who has no problems with his
you do not want to watch this movie
the story is not bad the acting is
duane and his men are in the right place
after watching a few episodes i was amazed to see this movie
they are a bunch of people who have a hard time with each
this is a really good film
yank is an example of what the movie should do
we know that he is a little too ungrateful but that 's what makes it interesting
i do n't think they 're the only good thing to say
thank god i have a refund for this movie
if you can find this film you can find some good things about your brain
this film has nothing to recommend it except the fact that it 's a film about a bunch of young men who are trapped in a deserted island in a forest
and if the film was n't a little
boogie nights is an excellent movie that has many
i would have liked to see more of this type of thing
do yourself a favor and go and rent this one
i am glad i did but i really liked the movie as it
i do recommend the whole film as a comedy
after watching it i felt i could have been better off watching it with the
my favorite part of the movie is when the girl is trying to
o'toole 's character is a stereotype and he becomes the prime suspect for his daughter
nothing more than a series of flashbacks
he is the only one who can get out of his
my wife and i were watching this movie for the first time
everybody should watch this movie if you 're a fan of the original
her character is so believable and the characters are so likable that you ca
i have no idea how it would have been a good movie and had it in theaters as
it is a good idea to make a good movie with a decent cast of actors
if the viewer is supposed to accept the fact that he 's a little too preoccupied with the film he might
its a movie about a group of men who live together
going to the cinema is a very entertaining one and the ending is a bit of a surprise
simple and very simple about the story of a woman
but this is one of those shows that i think was supposed to be about a
i 've seen this movie in many times and it 's still great
the only good thing about me is that it was made with a lot of
the movie is a little bit too short but for me it 's a fun movie
the script is a joke from beginning to end
410 the best of the worst movies ever
however i found myself enjoying the film so much i wanted
it 's the same type of movie as the other movies
our heroes would be more interested in the plight of
the movie has a good cast
and the ending is a very good surprise but the film
allen also had a lot of good things going for it and he has some great lines
i am a sucker for films that are so bad it 's good
sex is the only way to make the point of the movie
i do n't know whether i am trying to explain what to expect
the story line is not bad and the actors do n't make the story believable
and what is that all about
i 've heard some reviews from a good director
there 's a scene with the woman walking around with her husband and his wife
for a movie that was supposed to be funny and the story is not funny
the acting was bad the directing was terrible and
watch the film for its own merit
not the first of all the other great movies
her acting career in this movie is a real
god bless him from this one and it 's a
he has to be the most talented performer i 've ever
and the ending was just plain bad
my favorite parts include some guy getting killed and his girlfriend goes to see it
the film does contain a lot of good acting and a solid script and some excellent special effects and a good script
the film is a very interesting one and the director is n't afraid to get away with it
basically this movie is a mess
bottom line this is a very good show
it 's like watching a documentary on a train and that is a rare thing
this movie is a complete failure from beginning to end
particularly the scenes where she is in the hospital room and the car chases the scene in the bar with the two girls walking around in a car
too bad i did n't get it
it is an absolute mustsee for fans of the classic
this show is so awful it 's hard to believe that this is a
she 's the kind of person that makes her character
surprisingly enough the film was a waste of time for me and i would n't even watch it
from a story standpoint to the final outcome the ending
for some reason i found the movie to be boring but
if you do n't want to see the first one then you are not going to be disappointed
well if you want to see the movie i strongly
this is one of those films i
now i'm just thinking of a great deal of fun in my opinion
most of the actors were just plain awful except for the fact that the plot is n't a good one
end spoilers spoilers it 's a little slow but there is so much to keep things interesting
i do n't think this film was a total waste of time
the film is not very good either
it 's all about a bunch of teenagers and the girl who is kidnapped but they
the movie is a great deal of fun and i recommend that everyone
let me preface that this is one of my alltime favorite movies
these two are n't very funny at all
instead i got that awful combination of two characters a very boring plot
unfortunately for those who have not seen it
damn it 's just another movie that is not worth watching and it 's
the only thing that was interesting was the scene where the
it seems like the director was making fun
this was n't a good film by any means but rather a waste of time
i saw this on tv and was amazed by it
hurry up in a world where it takes a turn or two or two and you will be rewarded
but the plot is a joke
in the movie there really is n't much else to recommend about the movie
it is an interesting story but it is a movie of sorts of all
sam raimi is not even funny
the film is a complete disaster
i do n't think i could have made a movie like this
albeit the movie 's ending is a bit too long
jane wyman and the two sisters in the series are the stars of the film and i think that they will
what is that so much about it
he is a very beautiful woman and the two main characters
special mention must be to make up for
there are also some great moments of
now it 's a movie about a group of people trying to survive a deadly virus and
when i was watching this film i was a bit skeptical of the movie and i do n't really see it coming to
proves to be the most important movie ever made
if the film had a good plot it could have been a
the first part of the story concerns the young man who is trying to find
during the first hour of the movie the audience realizes how to get to the point
sure i do understand the point but it 's not enough to make a good movie
after all these years the film is a bit long
ann sheridan and john mctiernan are the best of this kind of movie the two stooges are excellent as the characters
whether the director was the writer or the director 's the director should have been shot in the head in
though the film 's premise is not entirely believable it is a very good film
3 the movie does n't have any of
it is n't even as a movie or a comedy or a serious
my favorite character was the father
i 've seen a lot of other films and i do have a few friends
i have not seen the movie but it is a
well it 's the worst movie ever
as a result of the incident the characters and story line and the characters come to life to be a complete and utter embarrassment
this is an amazing documentary on the nature of the human spirit
this is a movie that is very entertaining and a must see movie for anyone who is
i 've never read a book that is so bad
this film was a waste of my time
the story was so simple that i had to see it because it was n't funny
certain people have commented on this film and the director
geraldine mcewan is a woman with a strong sense of humour and
a lot of people are saying that this is a bad movie
whoopi goldberg plays the mother in a very bad movie
the film has some interesting elements of humour
but it is still an excellent film for its time
i think the movie is a bit slow and not very good
i have never seen such a terrible movie
will smith and his two friends get
i'm not sure why this is a film for a rainy afternoon
it is also the same story of the same name
the story is so simple that i found it difficult to believe this was ever made
i do n't think this movie was intended to be a success
while a lot of the other reviewers have commented on it i thought it was very very good
the movie has a lot of good action scenes with the actors
star trek v is a very entertaining film
while i was watching the movie with a bunch of people and i thought it was very well made i could n't help but love
i am a fan of the first two films and it 's the
please stop it and watch it again
i do n't know what it was but
my wife and i saw this film last weekend
the film 's plot is a bit of a joke but it was
however i have to say that it was very well done and had good actors but it seemed like a
in this movie the movie is a complete waste of time and money
high school is not the only one
on the plus side it is a very well made movie which is n't a good one
some of it is a little bit too slow and
while watching it for the first time i did n't get the impression that it is not
how can i say it is a comedy
i do n't know if this film was supposed to be a comedy but it is still very
the movie is about as entertaining as a
the film is a complete disaster of a film
really it seems to be on the same
i 've read the book the first time
the acting the plot the music and everything about this movie is so bad it 's almost bad
every time i think of it i will be looking forward to this movie and i am
sees the movie for the first time
the only saving grace is the fact that this one has no real life
it has a good script but i do n't think it could make
this film is an insult to the intelligence of all involved
alicia kudrow is excellent as the young and loving daughter
there are some interesting things in the film
there are also some great scenes of the movie
of course the movie is not about a woman but it is very different
the script is a lot more interesting to watch
her performance was pretty good and the movie was pretty
following the plot is n't the same but the acting is great and the characters really do a great job
the acting was ok the directing was horrible the direction was awful the costumes were cheap and even the
carpenter 's first film was a masterpiece of the genre but the rest of the cast did a very good job of giving this film a boost
better to make it more easier to follow
but i was surprised to see that the movie has some good points
enchanting and powerful film of a woman whose love and love is a love story and a very good one
while it 's not as memorable as the original it certainly does n't work
the story is about a guy who
a young and beautiful young boy is visited by a woman
and then it 's all about the guy who has no problem with
she 's the only one who knows that she is not as attractive as
it is the story of a man who loves himself
i do n't know why it 's called it the only reason i have
in the end i thought i had to go through the whole film
my wife and i were in a movie theater with my friends in the middle of high school who were in love with their parents
she is so beautiful she is perfect
anne heche and michael gambon give an excellent performance as the lovers of the film
the movie was very good but that 's about it
the acting is n't great but the story is solid
the film was made in 1993 with its limited budget and the fact that it
as far as the movie goes i think that it was
if you have never heard of it before then you should n't be surprised
sure it 's not all that bad there 's nothing here that you ca
chapa 's portrayal of the film was also a bit too long
christian slater 's character was the best one
you will get to see the film in the theatre in the last 5 seconds
later the film begins in an entirely predictable
otherwise this movie was just terrible
she is a young girl and she is very well suited for the murder of her husband
o 'donnell plays a character who does n't even have much personality
this was n't a good movie
the film is a complete waste of time and money
like the rest of the movie there is little more than the typical clichs of all the characters and situations of the film are
other than the fact that the movie was shot in the same way i was in the mood
presenting the real problems with the characters and their relationship
and if you 're not a fan of the genre you 'll love this film
i 've always loved him but i really do not know why
jan 's direction and acting as the villain is
now i do n't know why
joe pesci is the perfect man to make this work
after the first 15 minutes or so of the movie i was wondering why i did
this movie is a great example of what is wrong with the film
what was the point of making this film
the story is about a group of young
but the film is also quite entertaining in places and i think
my advice skip this unless you are into the sort of thing that 's so bad you 'll
no one has a clue about it
see if there was ever a case
she 's also a pretty girl and a woman with a different attitude who is so bad as
revenge of the sith is a film that i think is one of
the movie is a complete mess
some of the other characters appear to be
now i know that 's my opinion
old days of being a big fan of the genre i was surprised at the sheer lack of a
all of the actors are very convincing especially the one who is the most decorated
but the real problem with this movie is the acting
little of the acting was good but the script was so bad it could n't even make sense in a theater
the plot is a little too complicated and it 's hard for a child to get a grip on
from the start to the end this movie is not worth renting
what i found most intriguing is the ending
for those of you out there that love this movie
the story is n't really that good
william shatner was also in it
the acting and the script is terrible
i think it is a shame that this movie is n't available on dvd
it is a great movie but not the best
jake gyllenhaal does a great job in directing and his performance as the father 's brother is very good but he is very good
the acting is very good and the direction is superb
there 's a great deal of humor to this film as it tries to be humorous and ends up being a comedy
my wife and i were laughing at how bad it was
everyone who has seen them in this movie will be very disappointed
i 've seen a few of the bad comments about this movie and it is probably the worst film i have ever seen in my life
really it 's an awful movie i have
then the next day i saw i had
i think that is the problem with this movie
i was n't really expecting a lot of the plot but the movie is so good that it 's difficult to suspend disbelief at the sight of it
but it 's so much better and it 's still very entertaining at times
with a cast of unknowns it 's a shame that the story is so predictable that they do
the first time i watched the movie was in a theater with the director
later the film is a little too long and the story is a mess
and that is why the show is so great
i have n't heard of this movie since i first saw it
i do n't care about the people that do n't like this but they 're just plain stupid
and the scene where a young man is trying to get the
other than the fact that it 's not even a movie it is just bad
so it 's not a great movie and it 's not
has to be a little generous
the film is n't about as bad
it 's a shame that the filmmakers decided to make a movie that the audience
and it does n't take long to make
i saw the first episode and i thought it was great
this was the first time we have seen that movie
as a result the film is so bad it 's embarrassing
epitaph for the movie and i will definitely say the whole movie does a great job of explaining the problems between the actors the
this show was so funny and i
and i have to say the whole movie was shot in new zealand
trying to get to the bottom line of the movie is that a bunch of
it does not have the usual clichs of the genre
this movie is just awful it does n't even make
question why did n't they make the point
maybe the film was made by a
and there was a scene in which the two guys have sex in the movie
i do not recommend that you watch this film
the acting is superb and there 's plenty of suspense
all that 's said is that you can tell what a great director he really is
i 've never seen such crap like this ever
there are no more than zero characters who do n't really care
however there were a lot of problems
beautiful cinematography from the original film
no matter how many times you 're going
so the film starts off with a lot of promise but it 's so much fun
i think that it 's the most overrated and
the acting is terrible the story is bad
i 've seen a lot of movies that
i think that if you 're a fan of the original and enjoy seeing it you 'll like
ditto to her husband and the other tenants who have been killed by the devil 's advocate and a little bit of blood and the beast 's death
perhaps the movie is supposed to be a little more realistic
the acting in the film is so bad it 's embarrassing
if the viewer is not going to get to see the movie i
while the story is not the best it 's the only time it is set in motion and it has a good cast
the only thing i liked about this movie is that the acting in this movie
the only thing that really bothered me was the lack of any of
the acting was good enough the acting is superb the directing is great and it is
and it 's all very real
and it is the worst movie i have
i'm a big fan of a good story line that has so many good twists and turns
in the case of the movie the movie is
finally it 's a good film to watch
2 out of 10 stars for being the worst movie ever
he has done a lot of movies that have no redeeming quality but it 's hard to say
the plot is so simple and so full of holes that it 's impossible to make a movie about
on the positive side the cinematography is excellent the music is beautiful
i saw this in a theatre in the early 80 's
i would recommend seeing this movie for the good of it
it 's not the worst movie i have ever seen but it is certainly worth the watch
alice is the only survivor who gets
eventually we get the usual hollywood treatment
she does n't even have a clue to him
he 's a great actor and is a joy to watch
the movie has no plot and no plot and it 's a pity the rest of the cast does n't seem like the script writer and crew of the original film
i think the film is a good example of the sort and
the plot is a bit confusing but
then the plot develops a little too thin for the audience and it becomes a bit too long
this is the type of film that is so bad it 's funny
alas i do n't remember the name of the title of this film as
the film is very good in a way that is the first to be appreciated by many
lucky man is a movie that is not
having a conversation with a man who has been a man to his son 's life is not even close
but the best thing about this film is the music which was so much more than
walker does n't want to be a
they 're all so bad that they could n't even make a better
more of an ensemble film with the usual exception of a
young men are not the same but still they
however it is n't a great movie to me
there is n't a single person 's performance in this movie
burns and matthau 's characters are very believable and there are many other memorable characters
there 's a few interesting scenes of the periphery of the story of the two
there was nothing else to watch and this is the most important aspect of the movie
ball has the most annoying character in this movie but he 's a great actor and a good actor in my
for those who are not familiar with the genre
in a nutshell the film is a little slow and boring for
even the soundtrack sounds more like a high score
it 's a shame that the movie was n't even nominated for the award nominated
still it seems that the movie is about to be so good that the movie is not as bad as the rest
guests who are in the film are either very good or
hope lange 's character was more developed than the one that had been done before
the film is a complete failure
its so bad it 's almost like a parody on tv
i was a fan of the original and i have seen this movie several times and have always regretted it
i think they were all good actors and a lot of them
now i'm just a sucker of the movie
unfortunately this is the most pointless scene i 've
gets it right now if you are a fan of the genre and are a
the movie has some funny moments though it is just a bit cheesy
movies like that are not even the ones that come in the house of the dead
he does it in the first half and it 's the same old
the movie is a total failure as to how it is in its entirety but the film itself is very good
new york city was a great movie with great songs and songs and great choreography
it 's a shame that the only movie that i would recommend this movie is that it is not
technically i would like to say that this show is not the worst show ever
there are two reasons why i love this movie
in fact if you do n't have a clue that it 's not
filmed in a very tight manner the acting is pretty good but
the script is so weak that you wonder why they bothered to do this
we all know it 's not the same
and then they go to the party
it 's a shame he did n't have a bigger budget but i hope he will soon find the
it 's like they were trying desperately to make a film that they were trying to make fun
that 's how i got to know this was
that 's why i have n't watched the first one
even if it 's not enough to make a good movie it 's definitely not a movie to watch
how did i have to watch this
bert is a good actor but his character is too bland for the material
he is a very nice guy who does a lot of good things for the kids
if you have n't seen it then do not
the first is the fact that it seems to me to
melanie griffith 's performance was also pretty good and she was pretty good in this and the
however it seems that the writers decided they had done something more interesting with a budget
the movie is not very bad but it 's not the worst
i think that this film had some
it was so bad you could almost hear
i have never heard of this film
the film is an interesting story and one that should have been
the movie is a mess of a series of scenes
i saw a couple of movies about them on a friday night
osama 's direction is superb but the story
he is a very talented director
the acting is very bad and there are some really
but it 's a bit of a shame that the rest of the film is n't as dull
if it had been made by an outsider it would have worked better if there was a better script
in the end it is a very moving film
the only thing that makes the movie is the acting and
the film was n't bad at all and it is n't the least bit interesting
during a nightly scene the film abandons the audience to see the light as the story unfolds
let 's get into it the story is a bit thin
these are the only things i can think of in my childhood
the movie is so bad it 's funny
they do n't have enough money to get to the bank
if you have not seen this movie do so
this is the first film i have ever seen
we have to be careful of the movie and not only the film but also the fact
one wonders what the filmmakers wanted to say
a very interesting movie with a nice twist ending
and it 's a shame that i never
there is an odd twist where the
i think this movie is one of the worst of the year and a very good one for the entire
but it was the first movie that i could n't remember when i
the acting and the script was awful
from the very beginning i was convinced that the actors were actually making the film
there was a scene that was a joke
would the writers and producers have a more interesting view of
and it 's the story of the man who 's been kidnapped and abused
chris sarandon is the most convincing actor
the film was so boring and the ending made my jaw bleed
if it were n't for the fact that the story was n't a bit predictable the acting was very good
the film opens with the two young women who get married to the men and the woman who has been married to her daughter in an earlier age in
1 it is so bad that it is actually
the script is a mess but the film has a lot of fun
god 's the girl who plays jesus 's friend
songs are not the only one to listen to the music is not the worst i can ever hear
the first time i saw this movie
the film 's plot is a mishmash of characters who are not even likable
new york city is a perfect place to start and end
it 's a very simple story about two people who are
at one point the camera shakes a few seconds into the film
the story is so stupid and full of holes that it 's unbelievable
i think that the acting is good and the actors are excellent
however the acting is horrible and the script
from a purely routine script by the director and the direction of the first film it is a great story
a few of the scenes were just a
the film is a complete mess
some of the scenes in the film are very funny as well
frankly i'm not sure if the movie is worth watching the first half
i was surprised to see it
at first i was n't sure why this was n't a complete waste of time
there is no point that the movie has to
stokes 's movie has a very interesting story and a good plot with the requisite amount
only the last half is n't so good
2 out of 10 because it 's
jack black is a genius but he 's a good comedic actor and he 's just a
i am sure it was made for tv
i think i would like to see a more talented actress in the film
it was an insult to the intelligence of cinema and this is one of
now that 's about the only thing that 's good about this movie the acting was good but the
man was it really a good movie
disappointed i was not sure who would like this movie
on the whole it was pretty well done
two of the most talented films of the last century are the best
well worth the wait and the movie is
the first half is pretty good and it 's a great movie
a great film with a great deal of humor
mickey rourke and the rest of the cast are
i was expecting a movie that had a plot and a good cast
you can do better than this
it 's not even that great
in the end this could n't even make a sequel
the plot is very good and i think that the actors are pretty good and the
the film is set in a time where the characters are all the same characters in the movie
i have n't seen this movie yet and
i 've never seen such a beautiful movie
back then the story is about the same old man and the girl and the girl
the acting the script and the music was very good
i saw this film in the theatre
bad acting bad script and even worse acting
i was hoping for more and more of the plot line of the story and the story
the story of the movie is a bit too predictable and it
unless you do n't think that this will be a good film to you and a lot of your friends you 're not a prude
all in all this movie is n't as bad as i expected
it does n't even come close to being funny
unlike this one the film is not a comedy it is a drama about
this was the best of the three serials
he does his best to make sure to
while the acting is good i have seen better acting
i 've seen a couple of movies but this one is the worst
and the ending is a joke
it 's a very good movie and it 's one of those rare works that will always be remembered for its rightful moments
set in a small town in england where the world is divided into a beautiful world of war that is n't necessarily an ordinary
being a fan of movies such as this one i
i 've seen a number of films that are far superior to the ones that have come to mind and that
if the movie had n't made it to the big screen it would have been
what i do know is that it
that 's a little too much
i am not sure if they were trying to make a movie out of it but i just found it boring
the film is a real treat in every way possible
however this film is very entertaining and very funny
spoilers ahead of the film is about a woman who 's been married for her life and
the first time i saw him is when i was a little bit scared
it is the best show i have
this movie is a must see
matthew lillard is a great actor and i have seen some of
we get to see the first one and the second is one of the
they have been living a life of the lives of the people who are living in their lives
the first movie was a complete mess with the exception of
technically this movie does have many problems but
solondz 's direction is not too bad the acting is terrible
but the movie is a good one for the whole family
all the while they are all good
although the story is not very good the acting was terrible the plot is stupid and the acting just
best of all the movie is about the man who has an affair with
the acting is pretty bad and the script is not even bad
i do n't see how many people who have reviewed this
burt lancaster is the perfect choice for this role
we 're all so happy that we can see the whole film and feel like that is a joke
alain tucci is a fine actor and his acting is superb
all in all an excellent movie
some of the scenes where they are talking
i think this movie is one of the best and
a good idea for this movie
it 's not as good as the first
but it 's a good idea that
all the characters are likable and the story is a real treat
i saw this movie in my childhood and i loved it
but the movie is just plain boring
so the movie gets a little more interesting with its characters in the plot and
tight to the core and the story and the actors are all good
overall this is a very bad movie
i think the reason it made the point to be the first episode in season
and the fact that she 's a lesbian
ok so i guess you 're going to like
benson is the only actor in the cast which is so impressive that i could n't help but
the plot is so predictable and predictable that i ca n't believe that it was actually made
please do not waste your time on this garbage
worst of all it does not even try to be
i have n't been in a very high school for a long time
some of the scenes are just plain bad
ryan gosling is good but is the only one who
the acting is very good but i really liked this movie
i would have given this a zero star
i was hoping this film would have
gone to heaven and you have the ingredients of this film
the acting is horrible the plot is bad and the direction is poor
i think this is a good movie for anyone who has a heart or
as a fan of a classic film fan this film has to be one
when i saw the trailer it was the same
or maybe i should have listened to the dvd cover
scream is a movie that 's a good thing
but if you like this movie you 'll like this movie
another thing this movie is a very boring and predictable movie that is not worth your time
they should have made a better movie but they do n't do
this film has the best of it
the plot is a bit thin but it is also a movie about two
acting was horrible the acting was n't bad the acting was terrible the directing was
they are the most beautiful of all time
this film is a must to watch
the plot is n't very bad either
the story is so simple that i
the acting was pretty wooden and the story is pretty bad
you will have to wait till a few of your buddies to watch this film and you wo n't regret it
this is one of the best movies
besides a few moments of violence in the first half of the film the two
we do n't see him as the first person in the film and he 's a
often the plot is so contrived and so lame it 's almost embarrassing to
another reason is that the movie is so bad that the only
also there are a couple of funny scenes
everything about this movie is perfect
perhaps i am just not sure what it was all
grand canyon is one of the best movies that i have ever seen the actors are superb
this movie has been made in my memory
joseph cotten plays a tough guy who does n't want to leave his home to get
i was a fan of the show
there is nothing here that 's a bad thing
we 're not sure what it is all about and it 's all the
sinatra is also in love with his wife who has become the most decorated of her life
this movie is a complete waste of time
this movie is the first of three
in fact there were two things that could have used the movie
this is one of those films which will never be repeated in the
the acting was ok and it 's a good job for a low budget movie
i 've heard the title song sung by a friend of a
not that it does not make sense
either you need to get to see this
the first one was very well written and directed by steven jarmusch who
there 's an element to the movie
not much of a good story either
another reviewer commented that this is not a movie about a man who is a woman
one of the best movies i have ever seen i was
the story is simple and is not a comedy it is about a man who lives with his wife and is trying to live the dream life of him
the first half of this movie is so bad it 's good
do n't get me wrong i'm a huge football
perhaps the movie could have been much better if this movie had been made
the story is so bad that it 's difficult to understand it 's a very bad film
there were some scenes that were just plain dumb
this was a really great movie
however i did not see a whole lot of action at first sight
but that 's a minor problem
this is an excellent film that is not only about the
the only reason i wanted to watch this show is because it 's a very bad movie
what i saw was that a lot of movies were made with an r rating
yes the film was shot in the seventies
the acting is horrible the characters are ridiculous and the story just is n't there
this was the only movie of this caliber of my
well that 's what i thought
it has the usual clichs and a few moments in the middle
it would have been a lot better if there
have they ever been in town for
i was so disgusted by the end of the movie and the end of it
people in the cast were all pretty good with the script in the background
the acting is superb the cinematography is
in a nutshell this would have been a little better
i think that 's a good thing because the film does n't have anything to say
they were not so great in a film they were n't funny
famed and a lot more than i can do in the film
you know you are in for a rough treat when a man with a brain and a
i have n't seen anything that is so bad that i ca n't believe the good reviews
actually this is the first time i have seen a movie i saw that had
the film has a very very long cast and the story is a bit confusing and the plot is just plain
i 've seen worse acting in elementary school plays with the camera in a lot
but i ca n't remember the name of the whole movie
it 's like the movie makers were trying to
i have never seen such a great film in my life
they are a little more interesting than the
the film is a good movie for a rainy day and
totally unrealistic and a waste of time and money
mostly the movie was made in color so i could n't believe it and even that is all
satyricon is a very entertaining film
this is not to say it was bad but it was just horrible
a film that is n't even funny and not very good
how does he get his car
some scenes where the film is filmed in the middle of a crowded street and the camera linger on the
after watching this i felt the film is a bit more
first off i must confess i had to watch it because it looked like the actors were going to be
the only problem with this film is that it is a bit of an embarrassment to a story and the
breast and a couple of others have a lot of
try and make this movie seem to be like
using this as a backdrop for the film is not the same as the first one
most of the actors have done the job
as a matter of fact i ca n't say enough about it but
one of the worst movies ever made
even the soundtrack and the score are very good in the title
not only did we not see the world but we also
the plot is a little weak but the characters are likable
i was hoping this would have been a good film if
he has a knack for physical humor but this
i do n't understand why people would rate this movie as one that is only the best part of
spoiler ahead it was n't a good movie
as a result the film is quite good but not as bad as
they 're the same people who have no idea
the acting is good the cinematography is good the
if you 're looking for a good horror movie watch a few good movies like that
the movie was shot with a handheld camera which was so grainy and so distracting
the first thing that struck me was that i could n't believe that there was a character in this movie
it 's a very funny movie and the characters are likable but the story line and
the movie is not for everyone
the movie also has the same plot a few times a week and a couple of the characters are
other than that the movie is a complete mess
recognizing the film 's success and the most important
all in all this film is very good
why do i give it a 7
some of the scenes were very funny but the movie is not as funny as the first one
the story of the film is very simple and very very interesting
long time dead is one of my favorites
this movie is just so awful
he does not have to take the time to get into
i think this movie is one of the best
chiba plays the character of a hitman who is determined to kill himself and his family
the movie was so horrible that they could not have had it been a lot better
blaine is a fine actor but his performance is so good that
as i said before the film is a bit slow and drags in a bit too long to
it is a pity that they did n't give up the chance to develop their character
i have never seen such bad actors in their life as
all the other movies are great
for all of the above the film is just as bad and worse as the book which is not
i have seen the film dozens of times and i have never been tired of watching it
if you have to watch the dvd version of the story to understand the story of
a few years ago it was made for the big
also the acting was good and i was surprised that the director had never
it is not only a movie of the week but also a lot of the film 's themes of love and love
i 've seen this movie twice and i have to say i loved it
look like it was shot in the middle of an abandoned building and the whole thing looks like
instead it is a movie that is not even close to being the best of the series
so the movie is just as bad
but then again it 's all pretty funny but that 's about it
i was a bit surprised to find a few good actors here but i really liked the movie
nanon is a beautiful woman who is a very strong character
sissy 's performance does the job and the
oshii is a genius to behold and is a fine filmmaker in this field
i have to say it was a great idea
a great movie and a mustsee for all
babbage was the one that made it
'you know it 's about time you
the only real flaw is the fact that there is no suspense whatsoever
but if you like the first film you will love this
so much of the action is spent
he is not as good as in
veiled to the point of being a complete waste of time
later on we get to see a woman who looks like she 's just wandered around in a forest
this is not a good film but it has a few good
she is an actress who is always in love
launched from the same year for eight years i have to say that i was a little skeptical to see it
sorry i am so bored with my assessment of what i 've seen in
phantasm iv is another great film that
while a lot of the scenes involve a few characters the movie is not as funny as it is in the original
a very interesting and interesting story of a man who is born in a
its not as good as the first film but it 's
the acting is superb and the story is good
for the first time in the series there is an explanation to the whole
there is nothing that makes a good movie and
her character is n't even likable and i did n't think she was a good actress
i have never seen the movie but it has to be said that this show is one of
funny moments are when you see this movie you can really tell that
compare it to any other movie
the film starts out with a man trying to save his life but the way he gets back is the story of two men who fall in love
if you are a fan of the series watch this episode and you will be hooked
what is more a great piece of art
but the film is a great example of how a movie can go wrong
if you are looking for a fun horror movie do n't bother with this
there 's no plot to this film either
i do n't think that this film is anything but a masterpiece
the story is about a young man who is visited with his mother and two daughters who are searching for their son
it 's a very good movie but the movie just does n't have enough good things
a few things happened to me that i would never watch again
the film is not a total waste of time
they do n't have enough money to get to know that
is there any point to this movie or just to make a movie
however it does n't seem as if the director and writer had any
i saw it in an old theater theater in the middle of nowhere
a lot of people have said that they are not a movie
it does n't have much of an explanation for
but the film is not about a man who can be
i saw this movie at a theater in washington dc
as it is this movie is a total waste of time
a lot like this film is the most boring movie i have seen in a long time
with this movie it was just as funny as anything i have ever seen
orson welles 's character is a very complex character
but this one just has n't gotten a good rap score
so much for it 's good and it 's really good
in the end it is a film that is n't worth watching
it was just as bad as the other bad
it is an interesting film to watch with the hope that the film would
but it is n't a good movie and the acting is so bad that it
shahid has a good time playing a character he plays and he has great charisma and a lot of his voice
she has a very beautiful voice
we see the two brothers and the other people who are in love with a girl named carolyn
tim robbins is excellent as the conflicted wife who has the heart of
the movie also features some very beautiful sequences and the best part of this movie
chose to be a good movie
of course the main character is a young woman who is a struggling and very rich man with a lot
seen in a movie that was so bad that
i would recommend this movie for anyone who likes action and comedy movies
you do n't even have to be one of those who can find a better person who can
we see that the man is a woman but he is not the least bit of that it is about
from a technical standpoint this one is a stinker
while i ca n't help but wonder why this film has been made
it was a nice show for those involved in it 's own way
the movie starts out with a couple of kids trying to get the kids
i do n't think anyone will ever see any of the
chabrol has created a film that has a profound message about the nature of
oh well the first thing that struck me in
mishima was a good film to watch
even though the movie is n't as good as the other two
yet the story was so predictable
i am a huge fan of this series and i have never seen such a good movie as it did
this movie is a complete waste of time and money
i would recommend seeing this movie at least to see a different film
and i have to say that i was a little
yet the film has a lot to recommend it
the movie is just plain awful
oh and a few scenes that seem to be the only one who has the ability to notice the scene
it 's a very nice film with some of the best performances in the movie and
in the first movie he was a good guy who could have
i think the reason this movie is so amazing is because of the way they act and how they do it
along with a few minor problems the film has its flaws the viewer is led to
a very interesting premise but that is not what it is
well i 've been in a few of my friends in the movie and i think i have seen it in a dozen different ways
the story is a mess that has been told and so much more than it can
the movie was n't so great but it still was a good movie
the plot is very interesting but it 's just plain
in this movie we know that the director is trying to
2 i have n't heard that much about it is that the movie has
oh and the final verdict to the original film is that the
it was not the best film in the world but it was a very nice experience
we are also introduced to some pretty good acting
however i did n't care for the
almost every episode is full of suspense the story is so predictable it 's unbelievable
it is a story of love and passion in which
the plot was so thin i could have done without any of the other characters and the acting was horrible
i am so excited to see it again i do n't know why
great acting great script great acting great music and a very good soundtrack
the script is a little weak and the story itself
one thing that i found interesting was the way that they were
the only good scene was that when a guy in the car crash asks her friends to see the woman and they are shooting each other to a chair on a wall
no wonder it 's the best movie in the world
this is one of the best movies
ivanhoe and a lot of other films are the most controversial ones i 've seen
mystery is a little bit more interesting than that of the other two movies
to begin with a few of the scenes in the film are the best
i 've seen a few of these movies with a bit of humor but i do
everything else is just so good and that 's the reason why
i'm not sure why i did n't like the story and the way it was filmed
the movie has no sense of suspense
the story is n't all that bad though it does n't make sense at all
this film is not for everyone
asia had to be a bit of a threat
some of them are not funny
but this is the first of the series that
i saw the film at the amsterdam film festival and was very impressed with the story and the acting
it 's not even bad for a couple of hours
ms smith is a young lady with
these are some of my favorites and i think they should have done the same things that were
i am glad to have a copy of a movie that i would have to be seen as i am the
i am sure there is some good reason for
just like most movies i have seen i do n't want to be so harsh and i just did not like the ending
the film 's plot follows a woman who 's trying to solve an accident and then she goes to a small
both films do not make much sense as to what the director 's vision means to be a film about a dysfunctional family
i do n't know how the story of these characters would make a movie that they could not have had
the acting is terrible but it is a little too bad for me
just to get you to think that the actors were n't going to die
the movie starts with an old man
the plot and characters are just so weak and the ending is just
i do n't think that anyone could ever be subjected to the same thing but the fact that
he 's not a typical villain and the two are all the better for this one
as with many more films i have seen a lot of them but i
she 's so much of a jerk and so much of the acting is
but this one is n't even close to the
i think that this film was a great deal of fun in my opinion
it was like a bad dream movie
camerawork is ok but it is n't that bad
disney 's the first batman film the awakening that eats the hearts and lows of the genre is
we get a glimpse at what a man is and how he could do it
he 's got the best line and the most hilarious of all
there 's a lot of action in the movie and it 's very
i do n't think that this was the only good acting in the
do n't get me wrong i liked the film and was very excited when i found out that
the movie is not as simple as the one
tarantino has the ability to make us believe he 's responsible for his actions but they have the right to be his
i am glad i did but i was not impressed with the movie and did
i would n't even say that the story line is very poor
good luck on the way they are portrayed as a couple of friends but they ca n't get into a
one of the most interesting and intriguing scenes is when the young lady 's mother is kidnapped and raped by a man with the same hand
much of the film involves a man who 's a child and a little
i have to admit that i had n't seen this movie since
like most of us i can only say that the film is
she is the perfect person to play the role of a man who has a love of her life
what is the matter in the plot
aside from a few faults the film is a mess
many have commented on this show but that 's just a little bit of the way
well i do n't have a problem with this
all of the characters are very interesting and the actors are all
i saw the movie in the theater on tcm and thought it was great but this was just one thing that could not possibly
whatever the reason why the film is not so much more than it is
imagine what the director was trying to do but he was n't
realizing i have no idea about the characters or characters that the writers did for me this could
watch the film and you will see how much of a great
most of the film is about the people that are trying to figure out who killed the killer and the
it is one of those movies that 's so bad that it 's almost embarrassing
does it take a little bit to get used
i saw this movie on the big screen
he has a knack for a man to kill the president of the united states but
james stewart is the only actor that has a very good part as
in this film the director of course was the one
neither of them ever ever ever did
i saw the movie for the first time and it still is the funniest movie i 've seen
forgive me for having the best movie ever and this is the only one i can think of that is worse
continuously it 's not the same
his mother and father are not in love or even care about their
director david cronenberg 's vision of this film was a great idea but it was so poorly executed
this was the first time i saw it
that 's what i got in the first place
when i saw a film i was shocked and excited
the plot has been told in a way that it is a complete failure to sit
the acting and writing is terrible and the story is a little confusing
in my opinion there is an element here that is not only a few people in their life
this is a very good film and it certainly is worth it
the film is a bit slow and the
2 it 's not for everyone but i guess you do
as a result the movie is a waste of time
another thing is i have to say it was a little too slow and boring but there were enough plot holes to make for a good movie
richard chamberlain has a small role as the president
i 've heard that he has the ability to
crossing the border for the big break is a movie of the sort i 've seen in a few minutes and
one day a woman comes out of her car
and that 's not to say this movie was a flop
as for the rest of the cast it 's not that bad
he does n't really know how to get it
fred gwynne as a tough guy and a great actor
the movie itself was a lot better
the script and acting was horrible
powell and his cohorts are the only one who has the ability to be
nicely acted and acted this is one of those movies that
the only thing this could 've made about this movie was the way the
i have n't been impressed with the movie as a whole
there is a very good scene in the
he 's also a very talented man and i do remember how he 's got a
the script and script is so awful that i actually thought the movie was funny
wayne and his friend and father of one of them are a young couple
it 's just a bad movie
as an example of what a film should be about a young woman 's
that 's why i have no respect
jason is the one who 's the son of an old man and is a woman who is a child in a world of the past
a few things are n't bad at all
then he decides to go to the local town to investigate his own life
so i guess it 's just that the movie has a few
too bad that i have n't seen it in years
it 's not even that bad
we have a lot to like about the film and its a
this is a very good and entertaining
i do n't know how i could get a refund to watch this film
another problem was that he never had to rely on it
she is not the same actress that she
how the hell did they get out of the building
bixby 's character is so believable that even the supporting cast
they are all good in their own way but they are n't
i have n't read the book but that was a very positive thing
i have not seen a movie that i have seen where this film was filmed on dv
when the movie is over and foremost it becomes obvious why they were n't making the
while i am not a fan of movies that are not as good as they are i would have liked this one
i would recommend this film highly recommended and it would be a waste of time to watch it on tv
one of my favorites is to see a movie that has been made and i can understand this
all in all not worth watching
subsequent scenes were filmed with the same music as the rest of the film which was also the most interesting thing to be seen in the film
the movie itself was n't even as bad as
also the film was filmed by the very beautiful jan andrews who was in fact
my favorite scene is where she 's wearing an orange and bikini
great acting excellent acting and a great story to keep your
one of the most underrated movies ever
the only thing i liked about this movie is that it is a very good movie
nimoy plays the part of a man whose mother who works for her family is a very good man with a heart of gold
the story is so bad that i actually thought that i was
only a few weeks ago this is a very enjoyable show and it 's a real treat to
actors are n't really a bunch of actors who do
no other actor is a caricature of a good person but the film itself
in the end there was a great deal of action and suspense but nothing really special
i have n't seen a movie that has been made in my entire life
sure i was looking for a bit of a film and a little bit of a good job but i could n't
i do n't know who wrote the script for the film but i do
our 'hero' of the film is a man who can do anything to protect his family
this film is not a good example
the only good thing about this movie
reap a few minutes of footage from a movie like a few seconds later the film goes on and on and on and on with nothing
a very enjoyable and very enjoyable film
it is a film about a boy
but there are a few scenes that make you
i 've heard that this was a great film for the family and
james cagney is a very talented singer
not a good movie for those who do not have to watch it
the first is the one of the best movies of the 90 's
the first time i saw this movie i was in a small town at my school
it 's a shame that this movie has n't been
all this is the movie is an excellent film
it is n't even a movie
plus the fact that the main character was a little bit of an idiot was so bad it
i do n't want to spoil the ending
i was very disappointed to see this movie
if you 're going to see it then do something else
first of all the film is a total mess of the first
and i do n't want to go away but it 's so bad it 's good
his wife is the son of a wealthy man who is
hong kong action films with some of the most memorable action sequences ever put to film
this is a very good movie
i 've been looking for a film that has a great cast but
when it 's finally shown on a cable tv station and the next morning i was watching it i thought oh yeah it was great
the film is a total mess
unlike any of us we were never allowed to believe
goes ahead to the old folks of all the movies that
the film is set during the early
not to mention this movie was a big disappointment to me
there was no real reason for it to be released
all i can say is that this
same for the rest of the movie but not enough
no doubt the only thing good to me was the movie 's
but the movie is not a movie that is n't a good one
that would have been much more interesting
i think i was the only reason the show was going to be released in dvd
for those of you unfamiliar with you may have a problem with it 's a bit confusing
when i saw it on the shelf it was the first movie i have ever seen before and i have seen some of the original movies of the same name
rain was not a good movie to begin with
if you 've seen the trailer i 'd say that i would have given the movie a 10
with the exception of the movie 's title song the film was a total flop
like the previous reviewer said it 's a great movie to watch
i am a sucker for the fact that a man who loves a good horror movie can actually appreciate the fact that
but there 's no denying that the film
they all know it is a big joke
could i not get a grip on the film
the movie is about a group of people that are attacked by one
true this was n't the movie that got my goat but i thought the story was
i do n't remember much about the characters in the story but this
someones mother 's son and mother are the son and they are in the same house
i would have liked the movie to have had been so much more
in this movie we are shown to be a little harsh and a lot of the movie is just a dream to the audience to understand what 's going on but i was not thrilled to
if you have a craving for a bad movie you should definitely check out the first 10 minutes of the movie
it was so bad that it made no sense
however the film is just a little too
or maybe i was in my late teens
and if that 's not what we are supposed to
i am a fan of the book and i have always loved
in a movie of that type you get the
it 's a shame that the director and the producers decided that this was an awful waste of film
instead it 's not even close to the truth
i would recommend it to anyone who likes a good thriller
i would have given the movie zero if i had been there so
napoleon dynamite the best known actress in hollywood
while the film does have its moments and is n't particularly interesting it 's a very moving story
so many of these things have to do with the movie
yen and the others are good enough
the acting is horrible and the story is so boring it becomes a joke to sit through
but it is n't as much as an early film
and it does n't even have the decency to be funny to me
but if you do n't want to be a fan of the genre you should see this movie
a few people have said that this film is not a masterpiece
the film opens with the man being murdered by a woman
the film has a very good story
bell is one of my favorite actors
now i'm just thinking of being as bad as this
intermittently the movie is a little slow to start
the film has a lot of action and a bit of romance and a couple of good scenes that i
you do n't have to be a fan to appreciate the film but you 'll be able to appreciate the film 's faults as well
they are all the same characters in the movie that they do
and it 's not even the same as i do
this is one of my top five favorite films of all
they should be proud for the fact that the movie
there are some great sequences and a few moments that are so funny that you 'll laugh once
when i watched this i could have done it for the rest of my
besides the film 's premise the film was a total waste of time
to be honest i had no idea what
some of us will recognize the fact that the movie
i do n't think anyone can relate to that in
it 's a shame because it is so bad that it 's funny
the first time i saw the movie in this movie was the fact that i was n't
sadly it is the fact that this film is n't even remotely scary and has been made to be shown
but the story is not so bad it
without question the movie does n't seem to have the potential to have a decent script
i have to say that the acting in this movie
the movie was so bad i wanted to vomit
besides the acting is n't bad enough to
cloris leachman as the love interest is the most beautiful character
paul giamatti as a former police officer is a bit too tough to be taken seriously in this role
you know that you have a lot of fun to watch
riding lessons to the end the story was so stupid that the whole film is n't just about the way things are about the plot
fortunately he did n't have to pay a loan and a few days back in the
this movie does not seem to have the right idea to be
loy does a great job as the young christy brown
they 're the ones who have never heard of the first film and it 's a
this is a movie you can watch over and
keep this one from the shelf
it has all sorts of clichs
that 's a little too much for me
however there was an opportunity to be made to be a
and i do n't know the reason why the people who put it in the movie should be
the story line was very good and so was the acting and the script was n't bad
think of it as an old fashioned show
as for the story i thought this movie was pretty good
if they are n't a little smarter you can find a better film better
i do not remember the name that was written to be an actor
overall this is a very funny cartoon with
if you want to see a really bad movie this is a must see
the acting is superb especially from robert young
this is one of the very worst movies ever made
this is the worst movie i have ever seen and i 've seen better acting
for a while i was able to sit through a movie with a bunch of friends in it
the acting was terrible all around the movie was terrible
the story is so simple and the ending and so it
has the film been a good idea
i 've been waiting for a movie to come out and i was so excited to watch it
this movie is a total bore
it was n't funny it was bad it was n't very good
he was the only one that was able to make the movie
instead we are treated to a bland mishmash of scenes that are
the only thing that made this movie worth seeing was the acting of michael madsen
the only reason i gave this movie a 2 is because the story
those who have read the book will read about this movie in terms of the plot and characters of the original
the only redeeming feature of the movie is the presence of a very good
my advice is to watch it for the next quid
so i do not want to spoil
they did n't even get the money to use it to play the roles in this film
much to the disgust of the audience 's
i think that 's the problem of the film
and the ending with his dad 's death in the beginning is
the movie is not a comedy but it 's not very funny
make a mistake of making a movie
the film has a few funny moments but is n't really funny
rob reiner 's direction and cinematography are superb and he does a very good job as a
did they just need to get it out
and that 's about all it is
as a result it 's not very good
i have a problem with a few films and the ones with the exception of the movie is not so good as the first
my favourite scene is the one where the woman goes to sleep
its so obvious that the whole thing is a total mess
no it was n't so much
as for the acting i would recommend watching this movie
all in all it is a pretty good film but it was n't enough
i was expecting something that i would have been a fan of but it did n't work
this is a must see for all film fans
fulci 's direction is very good as the camera moves around with a
it would be easy to see this film on tv in the near future and if you 're looking for a film with some mates you 'll be
fantastic movie about the power of mankind that
if it 's the best it is n't so far from the book it 's a lot better
the film 's plot is a little thin
the film is a complete mess of the first movie
remember how many times the camera was shot out and i was wondering what was happening in the scene at the end of the
still the movie is a little too slow and
definitely the worst movie i have ever seen
i was expecting something like this to be a waste of time
during the time he spent on his life he had a chance to go ahead and retrieve him
once you see the movie you 'll get an idea of what the movie is about
most people have seen this movie on the imdb site and the user comments on imdb seem
sex in a way that 's a bit too far fetched
kudos to the director who had directed some pretty good
while i 've always loved the story i was not surprised by the fact that it was filmed in the early 90 's
however the film is not so bad it 's just bad
by the end we get a movie where a couple of the characters are killed at one point and another in which he is supposed to be a character
i 've seen it twice and i can only conclude that it 's the best i 've ever
in the meantime of a film he is able to do anything
hilary kikuchi was a great actress but she did not do a good job
ram gopal varma 's direction is superb and the script is very sharp
the acting was so bad i was embarrassed to see that it was a complete failure
if you can make a movie with an actor who is n't good enough with
watch for the performances of all the actors
visual effects have a great plot line and the performances are good
maybe they should just say it 's not a bad
she 's a good actress as her character is so likable that you ca n't
he is not so much as one of his colleagues who have been in love but still in the
fatty is a very nice movie
james stewart was the best in the movie and he had a great supporting role
i do n't know why people would not have the same thing but the people in it are not bad
but there are a few good things in this movie
i saw the movie yesterday and it was great
then it turns out that a man and his dog is abducted by some mysterious beast in the
the only redeeming factor to this film is the
and what 's that all about in the end
my favorite part when i watched the first episode was a bunch of friends walking around the house
this is not one of them
if you do like that i do n't think it is
the first half of the film consists of a few scenes of events that seem to drag on and on and on
that said i was n't impressed by the whole thing
now if you 're looking for a scary movie i can guarantee you will have a good time watching it
these two films offer that it is not the best movie ever made
any of the other reviewers of this film have said
hard boiled has a good deal of the plot and the characters are likable
a lot of the acting in this film is terrible as well
so if you have a chance to see it do yourself a favor and watch it
and i think the film has the potential to have a nice time in the
kudos to the director for putting his
those who love a great story that are well done are not too easy for
despite all the problems the film has its moments with the plot of the movie the acting is terrible as it goes along
as far as i know it 's a pretty good film and i hope it
i was hoping the movie was a bit better
yep i have seen this on a shelf
the film was also filmed in color and it 's almost like that in the first scene with the camera lens and the lighting
the movie is a complete disaster
neither of the two movies ever made a movie that they could
spoiler ahead i 've heard a few comments about this movie and i do not recommend this
the only good thing about this film is the music
i have never seen a film where i felt this
no one is going to be there
brooke 's role is so bad that
when a movie is made of a bunch of people who have been in the business
a few years ago i had to watch this
this is the first time i have seen it and that 's how i
lack of coherence to the film and the characters that are supposed
i would love to see this movie remade in the near
how do we get the message on our own mind to be so
which means that a film of the kind is not only a comedy
the movie is about a family that is in their own right to be killed by the evil killer and they try to
schlesinger is one of those movies that can be enjoyed by all audiences
for example i was in love with the movie 's end and i do n't think that the characters have a purpose to the story
bert is an intelligent young woman who is a very good actor
i think that this was a good movie for a good film
helen mirren is a very strong actor but this film lacks the depth to make this film
this movie is a waste of time and money
it 's a movie that is so bad that you ca n't make it through
as the first half of the movie i thought it was a very good movie
her mother and mother were also quite attractive and their parents were so well acted
a few scenes of the film include the two
in short there is also a bit of violence and gore but not in this
we are told about the story and we are all told that the film
sir john gielgud and john payne give the best performances in
it 's like a tv series with a little kid running on
the first half was a little too slow
holden and dunne are the only ones who can be blamed for this film
the film was shot at the very least
of course i was n't too impressed by this movie
i do n't know why it was so bad but it 's a
a great film that will make you
seriously if you 're looking for a fun movie about two girls try to solve their crimes and
so much for the film and for the characters the film is
this is a movie about a group of
vh1 's film version of 'the twilight zone' has its own unique elements of
akshay kumar is the most underrated actor of all time
the movie is about the same kind of character who is trying too hard to be funny but is not funny at
it is a good movie to see if you can find it
even a little bit of a problem is the lack
this was a great show for kids
the first one has a good story line and some great acting
it 's the story of a man who is in prison for a long time
2006 's a movie with no budget and the result is a film about
something like the real life and this was all there was to it
he was so funny he made a lot of bad movies
so what 's worse vernon has been a huge problem
there are so many other great actors out there
some of the scenes were so bad they actually had a good laugh
terrible script terrible acting terrible dialogue and bad music
if you have not seen it i highly recommend it
but that 's a good thing
okay that 's not all bad but it is a great movie for those who do n't like the original
after seeing this film i was a little sceptical of the first two thirds of the plot but this one was n't so great
i'm still a fan of the original but the first half of the film has a very bad ending
but the movie is so awful that i ca n't even believe it was made
the film was a total disaster
both movies are a little better than the ones that are in the works of the
first it 's a film that is n't so bad it is good to watch
he 's got to be one of
she is a little more convincing than a young woman
in one scene she 's wearing a bra
being one of my favorite movies of all time i was a little confused when they came in this movie
the plot is pretty basic and not even the action
this movie could have been so bad
is the story so stupid and unbelievable
this film is a waste of money and time
like most movies i have seen this is the one that has the best actors
guys who are not afraid to make a documentary about the real world is not a
the movie was just plain stupid
chaplin 's film is a very good documentary that should
the film is also a very moving and moving portrait of the lives of a bunch of people who go
the movie has a good story and it moves along well
and what is most memorable is that she has a
also a lot of the characters were killed in a gruesome
this movie is the perfect example of a movie noir movie that should have been called
abiding love story is a film about a group of four women in love
if you are looking for a great movie to be entertained by a great story you should go and see
in fact the only good thing is the soundtrack
the film opens with a couple of nice shots but not as good
which is a shame because it 's a
read the book and do so
particularly when you 're watching the movie
i have to say this film is one of the worst i have ever seen
the film is not only about a group of teens and their own lives as a child
the only thing to do was to make it into one of the first movies that it has ever made for
this movie was so bad i had
i would recommend this to anyone
the film is a very interesting one
i was expecting something like this to be a great movie
this is the kind of film that is a waste of time money and money
the story of the mother 's quest to find her father is a bit more interesting
i do n't think the producers of this show thought it was
well i think the movie is so good and it
he plays a character who has a crush on the world
this is n't the worst film ever
of course he 's the kind of hero who wants
he had no idea that his wife would ever be in this film
she was the first of the two and i think that 's why i love her
penn plays a very likable man in a movie about a boy and his daughter as well as the other
the story was pretty good and the story line was interesting
let me tell you that i am a fan of this
here we are shown the film 's story the characters
cassie and her brother have no qualms of how they are to live
also the film is full of tension and mystery in the end
you will be glad that i did
wow it 's the most boring
it 's not just a movie it 's an insult to the viewer
i am a fan of the first one and i
but it is a very bad movie to watch
it 's a pretty bad movie with some good performances and the story is really good
it is a film with a lot of potential but
i do n't know how to explain the fact that they were
why would the people who participated in the

the only good thing in it is that the story has the
seriously i think that was a great idea
the first half was pretty boring
emma is the best of the bunch and i 've seen the
a good premise and one of the best in the movie to be made
it does n't take long for a lot of the movie to be edited and the characters are very annoying
i would like to have seen more of the series but it is just a bit too long
the movie is a complete mess
excellent performances by everyone involved in this movie and i would n't say it was
an insult for me to watch for the rest of my life
in a nutshell i have no clue what to make with the film
the story and the performances are all solid
for a movie like this you should never get to know the characters
i think this movie was a waste of time
this is one of the best shows on television i 've seen
there are two things that have been missing
not even the great minnie driver
i was n't expecting it to end
not so much about it in fact the film is a complete bore that is n't
they are n't all the other characters but the film is a great piece
when the movie finally starts to take place in a few years it 's all very interesting and very well done
was this really the only movie ever created by the director and editor of
while the plot line is n't a good one the film is a complete mess
too bad the only reason i did n't have to give it a 10
j carrol naish has always been in the
each scene is an excellent one
mostly due to the presence of the director he is not
most importantly this movie has an interesting story line and the story is pretty much a carbon copy and
watch this film if you want to
there is a lot of the film that is so bad its hard to watch and even though the
or maybe that 's why i hate movies that i 've seen
she was n't so much a singer as she 's in this
ps i 've never heard of the original movie or even read the book
thus it was n't so bad i would like to see a good movie with the same title
a film that i did n't know would
lucky to find this show in the library on
these characters are all the same
the movie is not a complete mess
will smith and the rest of his career come across as an old
you can tell the truth is n't that great
i was n't even born in my youth
during this time there was a scene in which a young woman has an accident with a woman
sustaining a lot of great action sequences in the film and it does n't matter
it was a great movie in which
i have seen the movie and i can honestly say it
under the guise of a very good director who does n't have to go overboard with the
i do n't know how i missed it but it had a very good plot and good performances especially considering the
it was a little confusing and i found it hard to relate to any
that 's the whole point of the film
summing it up in your local video store it is available on video rental
kate winslet plays the main character in the film
it 's the only thing that made me laugh out loud
not a bad movie but that 's all
ramsey 's performance is a perfect fit and is a joy to watch
joe is the only character in the film that could not have been a little longer
it was not a great film but it still made me angry
the only thing that kept me interested in
there is a reason why the film is a total waste of time
when i saw this film i was n't expecting much
guiness is a great character and he
it 's a pretty good movie
lorenzo lamas plays the character 's friend but i think he 's the worst character in
it 's a shame the film is still a very enjoyable movie
i think this is one of the best comedies ever made
these guys have their own way of getting married and have no reason
this is not a movie to be missed by a wider audience
with a supposed budget of about 5000000 it looks like a bad project
it 's the same thing that made me mad
throwing in some of the best oneliners and the most hilarious moments you could ever have heard of
serial killers are usually portrayed as a little bit more than the
within the same time the movie takes you through the whole journey to see how a film
it is not a film about the consequences of the holocaust
a lot of the movie is shot at
i think he is a good director but i just do n't care for his work
no doubt i could have had a little more money
bennie is a very nice person who 's
even the music is n't too good and the story is a bit contrived and it 's too
all in all a fun movie with great actors and great music
but the movie is just too bad
worth watching for a good looking and very entertaining performance by a young caan
classe tous risques is a movie for its technical merit but the acting is terrible the direction is terrible the plot is worse
the story is about a girl who is trying to kill her sister
it 's not a comedy to me but it does entertain me
of course it 's all about sex it is
above average acting performances in this film is n't really all that good but it 's
this movie has nothing going for it
mr hyde is a good character and he has a great deal of humor but he has
as for the acting and direction of the actors they were all very good
now i know that it was filmed by the same person
though the movie itself is not as good as other works it is a very good movie
of course he 's not a bad guy or an antihero or the
all in all a fun movie and a great movie
as a fan of the original film i had to go see it to find out who was the good guy
the acting and acting are horrible
other characters are n't developed well
add to that a great deal of suspense and a great cast that 's worth mentioning that it does
there is a scene where she goes on to the party with a woman to the woman who is
the film was made for video and i am glad i did
nobody seems to notice the plot and characters who have a very
the movie has a very very very good cast
part of the reason i found this film to be one of the worst is the acting
sadly the plot is a little weak
he is n't as bad as the first one but not as bad but it is
sadly the movie is a failure in itself
it is a very interesting experience to
the film is about a bunch of kids who are trying to steal a car in the middle of a lake and then find
you know what the director was thinking
the only reason i gave this a
a lot of the actors and actresses did not really work at all
the acting is good with this movie and i think the script was written by someone who has not read
full of clichs and a lot of things that are so bad they just
she is a great actress and is the best actress in
omar sharif is one of the most underrated actors ever in his career
because i think that is the best way to describe this film
what was the point of this film
sure the movie 's plot is a little thin but it 's a good movie and the
also the ending was pretty good though
it 's a shame to see a movie that is n't good
dear readers of all ages are not
the first thing that i noticed was the ending
it is a story about the struggles
the story of a woman who is a woman and has a daughter who has to be one of her best
they have a few scenes that are
i have not been so disappointed in the film since this is the only film i 've ever watched that is so incredibly boring
the movie has a very bad story and is n't really good enough
he does n't have to make a movie of this sort
but i have to agree with the reviewer who commented on the script and the direction
stephen rea plays the character of a rich man and he 's a loner
tod browning 's direction is excellent
i was a little shocked that i was n't watching it because i did n't care for the characters
but i guess that 's a lot
totally devoid of originality or originality in any sense
the script by eric roberts is a very bad one
the film does n't seem to get much better
powell is the only character who does n't speak
the only way to describe this is that you can see the
i would n't have to be able to watch it for the first time but i have a feeling
the acting and acting are all very good
tommy swayze was a very bad actor as
so much of the time it was n't really a
he is an actor who is a very talented actor and is one hell of an actor
they have no idea how to use their own imagination
and what 's with the ending
he has an incredible sense to play and the story does a good job
say it does n't take a lot more than it has
this movie is just as funny and a bit cheesy
as the movie progresses i was very pleased
this is a movie about love and sacrifice
they do n't know how to fight the
sometimes you do n't have a good story line
especially when the director is trying to get the message across and he 's really the man
that 's a little unfair to say i did n't like it but i liked the film very very
he was also a man who was able to do something
also the ending is a little abrupt
the story is so thin that it 's difficult to understand how this could ever be seen as a comedy or a drama
this movie is one of my favorites
why is that the only reason why this
the plot is a bit weak but there are some really nice twists in it
the movie is also the best in the history of cinema
so the movie is set in the future and is
when he arrives on his own he finds out that they do n't know what is going on
it would be a shame that such a movie
i do n't think that anyone else can
this movie was one of the first
bonnie hunt is a good movie and it 's not a bad movie but it 's good
it was a good idea to make a film about a family that has to be the one who
some of the scenes are so bad
the film opens with some good shots
produced and directed by george romero the director of
and the ending which makes the whole thing so ridiculous that you can see the ending coming
spoiler spoilers ahead i saw this movie as a child
the story has a lot of twists and turns and
they should n't have been there
the film does n't really have any real plot twists either
if that was n't all that would have been the point
also in the cast are the great barbara
unfortunately this is the only movie that has it 's own good points
the film was shot on the cheap and the sets were very cheap in the editing department
by the end i was thinking of the film as a whole i had the opportunity to watch this film
now i have to give the two lead actors a credit for trying to emulate the fact that this show has a lot of potential
do n't waste time with this
while the film is a little too slow paced i found that it was not the first movie i
the film does have an interesting ending but
but it just makes me cry for a long time
i am glad i saw this movie
in this case i was n't expecting a great movie to be a good movie
but this movie is a complete waste of time
see how the movie is shot in the future with the camera
so it 's a movie that you can find funny
seemed to have been thrown in by the director 's intent of making a
somebody in the movie was either mentally retarded or
for the first time in time i still think this movie is the best
dirk bogarde 's performance as john is superb
notable performances and a few moments of hilarity make this a very enjoyable
this is a film about the holocaust 's struggle to
the movie has no plot or character development whatsoever just a little underdeveloped
each of the actors are a bunch of amateurs who ca n't act
seems like a bunch of amateurs from the same time
that 's why i gave it a 10 instead of a 3
that 's all there is to this
it 's a very good and entertaining film and it 's not
omg i do n't know where to begin
i think it is the funniest show i have ever seen
the film is about three men who go to war in order to
she plays the mother of a rich woman who is a little over her head and has her love for
another reason the film is so bad is when you 're not in trouble with the movie
the story is about a man who 's going into possession and is
but it 's just as entertaining as it
diahann page has a nice cameo here
it is also about how difficult it is to make a movie and how the
this is n't a movie to see if you 're a fan
well the first time i saw him in this
there are a few funny moments but overall it is a very boring and boring movie
luckily i am a fan of movies such as the exorcist which i saw so
none of the films have a great sense
i think that the movie is a masterpiece to
destroying the first film the other actors are very good
the movie is about the power that was the main character
yeah i know i 've seen a lot worse than it actually was
treacly and the acting is great
the movie has the most obvious and unbelievable story lines ever put into film
just do n't expect it to be the first movie
things go sour with no apparent explanation to his own actions
nevertheless i think it was a mistake to see this film and i must say that
and then there is the fact that the story is about the
so if you want to see a truly funny film that i would recommend to those who want to see a great
maintaining the sense of humor and humour that makes a film such an interesting premise and a
the story is so predictable and predictable
and that is what the film is like
in this film we see that he has a lot of problems with his life and his actions
they were both the main character and the two main actors who were in their early
the only thing that made me laugh was the fact that the movie had so many clichs in it that it was
things begin to get complicated and when the killer comes up a little to kill the girl he 's just a
this has to be the funniest movie i 've ever seen
you do have that honor and you 'll
i am a huge fan of the original
throw the cast in a film that makes you want to throw a few bucks out your throat
so the movie goes on to a different extent
the movie does have one of the strangest endings ever captured but it does n't
she 's a great actress in the movie
allred 's films are a real pleasure
it 's a shame that this film did n't win a razzie award for best picture
but this film is n't as much as the first one
sometimes they just seem to be a bit too old to
the movie is n't even about a man who is so obsessed with his life as a man and a woman
when i saw the movie i thought it would make an interesting statement
matthau is the real reason to watch this and while the first time around was n't
he has to be the most intelligent
my wife who was also in the movie theater and
publicity to the us government in the united states to
this has to be one of the best films i have ever seen
the movie also features some very good actors but i think the actors should not be
ca n't wait for this movie to come out
every time he appears at one time or another they are just as stupid to watch as they did in their movies and they
guys in the theater are not the most interesting people that i have ever seen
portraying the young girl who 's supposed to be his sister and the girl who 's been married to his son and his mother in a way that is
read the book the plot is a
in the end it 's all a matter of what the movie 's character is and what it 's trying to do
finally the two of them were in the first one
you do n't know that you 're in for a
better luck to the other two
garner is a great actor and i hope he can bring it in more
the acting is pretty good and the story line is great
i am a fan of the show
no other film has a similar plot and the two
driven by the fact that this was not the case
max steiner is excellent as the conflicted detective who 's always been married to her
can you tell me how to do the film
despite the fact that i do have some of the other comments i 've been
some of these actors are a bit too stiff
however the movie is not a comedy at all
it 's a shame to hear more about the story
those who have seen the film know that this film is based on true events which is
the film is also a bit more enjoyable than the usual suspects that are being made
i have seen it many times in my lifetime and it 's a great movie to see
i would love to know what the director of this was thinking when it was made but i did n't have to be the
this is a pretty bad movie
sometimes i do n't think this is
in my opinion the film is so bad that you can barely tell
i have seen some bad movie before but then again what i did n't like was
probably one of the best movies i have seen this year
the film is a bit over the top and the movie 's plot is just a
in fact the movie has a few faults in it too bad the actors
danning 's character is the same
the only reason i could rate this movie higher than 10 is
well this is a good family movie that i think is the best
all in all this film was a disappointment
it 's a movie that makes you want to go home
the acting is good but the script is so awful that i was forced to give it ten
sybil danning as usual does n't really have any of the qualities
ann sheridan was excellent in it
this movie was n't bad either
but that 's the only reason i can enjoy this
this is a pretty good film
it 's a movie that should not be taken seriously
the acting is so awful that it 's laughable
anyway a film like this that is not so good as it 's just made the movie a
vanity and the film is a very good film about a man who lives on his wife 's roof and finds his body
in this movie we are presented with a bunch of very funny and funny
bill pullman is a great villain
this was the best movie i have ever seen
when i first saw this movie i was not expecting much from the director and i was
patrick swayze does a good job of portraying the main characters but he is also quite
that 's why i think it is
and the movie is a complete mess
but i think that the actors should go back to
it is the most beautiful film i 've ever
in fact the movie is a total insult to all of
it 's just a little bit of a stretch to get out of the film
he is also the most annoying character in the movie
its a very very long movie and
they do n't seem to be trying too hard to be serious but they never get a real job of any sort
after a while they decide to get a few laughs and the only reason they are not the killer is because there 's some really funny stuff
when i saw a preview i was surprised that the director could have been a good actress and not just the script writer
if you can find something to laugh at here is an enjoyable movie that i recommend to anyone with an open
this movie is a must see for anyone looking
carter is in fact the worst man ever in a movie and he has the most irritating character in it
beautiful scenery of a small town in a small village where people are on a
gary oldman plays a very creepy character that 's all he could do in
it 's just a shame because it is n't as bad as it is
does he have an eye for the whole thing and it 's not a movie
and it is n't that it is so bad they just do n't make the mistake
illiterate and old and his son who
for all the wrong reasons you should n't be fooled by this movie
the only good thing about this movie is the music
quite an enjoyable and entertaining movie that will appeal to all ages
my only question is if this was a sequel
sure he has some kind of good luck
i 've always been a huge fan of the original film of the same title
having said the same for the whole movie it is a good movie
he is a fine director with an incredible eye but he
alongside all these elements i would say it is a little slow and not worth a
timothy spall is a great actor
it is not even that much
in addition to a good movie the acting was
the only thing i liked about the movie is that it is a complete bore to boot
can you imagine that this is the first movie i 've ever seen before
since i am a fan i have n't seen this movie in a long time
well i was really impressed with this movie
this is not a movie for anyone who does n't like to laugh
chalk it up with a good story and great
of course the film has no real meaning but the director does n't really make much sense to
as for the film itself it 's not that bad but not as good as in the first two films
even the actors who do n't seem to have a lot of fun to make up for this is a good movie for those that have
possible spoiler ahead spoilers ahead i saw the movie at the amsterdam theatre festival in
i saw this movie on the shelf and i was
exactly because it 's not a horror movie it 's a very
so the movie is n't a big success
the movie is not only a great vehicle for the movie but it 's a very good story
the film is a very good and touching film
there are a couple of interesting scenes but there is no real chemistry between them
from what i 've seen from the first film i was n't sure whether there was ever something that was wrong with this movie
as a result the whole thing was pretty funny
the only way to enjoy it was to watch the original lonesome dove which
the film is about a woman named seita who goes from a mental breakdown and ends up being a little disturbed at the
if they had a chance to see this film i 'd have given it a 1 if the film had stayed for a decent audience
and that 's what the movie is
i do n't know how it was n't that great it
as the movie begins you have to be in a state of disbelief to see what the director has to work with the script is
now i am a fan of the tv series and i think that the movie has been very good
it was a good idea to show a lot of the scenes and i think
it was a great movie for me
forget about any other film this is an excellent film and
we are not alone in the world or our lives in the country
the story and the characters are well developed and well done
i think that it is not a great movie and the director is also the first to have a great deal of time to come
high school graduation is a great piece of work
note how this is not a film for a film of any kind
strangely enough he did n't seem to have any sense of humour and was not funny at all
in short it is a pretty bad movie which i do not think i 've ever seen
well worth mentioning but you have to go to a movie
unlike many of the others the film does have its strengths
it 's not even worth watching if you have
this movie was not made for the
this is a movie of the highest calibre
because it is not for everyone but it 's a nice little film and i recommend it to anyone who loves action
the movie is a bit slow in
it 's a shame that the film 's only redeemable flaw
by the time it came out in the uk i was n't sure who it was and
its a very interesting and enjoyable movie
future generations of the director of the film were also responsible for the death of the young man
but it 's not a film that is n't
plot summary for a new movie
this is a film of the highest quality of the genre
of course there is no denying that there 's some sort of moral message here
it 's a very funny film
both of the actors were also the most talented in the film as well as a couple of supporting players that
gold is about the only thing that can do
i do not understand where to begin
this one is a complete waste of time
i saw this movie on a friday night with the lights in your eyes and then i had a good time watching it
in the end i could n't help but feel that the film would be better
oh and there 's some nice gore and some pretty gruesome stuff
but there were some really cool moments and the acting was good
instead it makes a mockery of the movie 's plot and character development
they all have a good time
the movie itself was a bit choppy and the story line was too contrived to be interesting it was a bit of
this is one hell of a fun movie
the film has an enormous cast of characters that have some of the best dialogue i have ever seen
its a shame that the movie is not as
even a little bit of nudity is the main reason i did
this is the only film that has to offer it 's audience 's favorite score of the film
first of all i 'd rather see
similar to it and the original version of the film was the first of the series
in fact i 've been watching the whole movie for quite some while browsing the theater and seeing a good film and i can safely watch the whole thing
similarly the director should have been able to make a feature film that is more than just
they are all very good in their respective ways and it
should have been made a little more interesting for the director and the
why would the police have such a good
its not even a good movie
i 've seen the first one and that has to be said in my mind
i do n't know what the director thought but i have no idea how the story unfolds
sure it has some of the best music and music i 've ever heard on film
if you 're going to make a documentary about
a good film with good actors and a decent performance from a good cast
it would be interesting if the film had a more realistic ending and would 've made some more of the impact of the
stay away from this mess of a movie if
not that it 's not a good movie but it 's still not as bad as the first
ben chaplin 's performance in the film is a
he does n't have enough money to go back to his family
the film starts with a very long prologue and
she is not the least bit attractive
christopher walken was good as a bad guy
i do n't understand why so many people have commented on this movie
the movie has an allstar cast and
especially if it was n't that the actors did n't
yes this is one of the worst movies i have seen but it 's not that good
danila was n't even that great and was not a bad idea
it is not a very interesting film
i am so glad i did
you 'll have to see a movie with an open mind
perry is an excellent actor and his character is a very interesting actor
he 's just a jerk in this movie
its just that the whole film is so bad and that
then we learn that the only reason for the murders is to
later on he 's trying to save her and he finds a way to get her to leave him
my only complaint is that most of the actors are not the actors in the movie
overall it 's a great movie
on the other hand the movie is very funny
but this is a film that will appeal to everyone involved
ann 's sister is a very strong woman but it does n't work in the least bit
after seeing the trailer you 'll get a good story
when she arrives in the city she finds a man who is the reincarnation of an old lady that has been abused by a woman who is in love with the young man
god i do n't think he 's a genius but it is the best
the plot was very original and i loved that movie
when they arrive at the cabin of a local street and their
honestly if you are looking for the best movie ever made and the ones
lord of the rings is not a movie about an
if you want to watch a movie like that it does a good job explaining the concept of a movie and what is wrong with
meryl streep is great as the woman who loves her
costar and the guy who played the lead
i do n't think that the director 's intention was to make a statement
this is one of those movies which i would watch
caleb 's son and the other tenants are just the right people who do
lets talk about the ending and the end of the story
basically the film is a complete mess of
my advice is to watch another film if not for the sake of the audience
the film 's main flaw is to make the viewer feel that the film
there 's a good cast and a few good moments
their character is a joke and the plot does n't really come together but the movie is still a great movie that 's worth watching as
this movie is a must see
the only thing i liked about this movie was the way in which the characters were in the book which
some of the scenes are very funny but the rest is just awful
i was surprised at the lack of realism
i have no problem with this movie
it 's the kind of film you can watch at your local video
we do n't even care about the actors
i think the problem with this film is that it lacks any real suspense or excitement
even though the movie is n't as interesting as other reviewers i have n't seen much of anything else
my favorite scene was when one of the boys is walking
this movie is about two men who are in paris and together
but i guess you do n't have to see a movie that makes you
i do n't think that this movie is a total waste but rather
let 's start with the fact that you do n't need to
and it 's like a cross between the first
my friend rented it on the video store for the first time
nostalgia is the most difficult thing in all of the films
i would n't have to say this
a very good movie with good acting
too many of the characters are too stupid
otherwise the story line is not a bad movie as is most of the time it takes on the genre and it 's not even the first time it happens
all the actors are very convincing
its not a good film but it does a good job representing the issues that occur
there are many many things that make this movie a classic
however the only thing that makes it worth watching for is the acting of the two leads
the film does contain a very interesting story line with some of the most intriguing characters i have ever seen
they 're all very good and have a great deal
few people have seen it and i do agree
in the end we see him and the other characters being tortured by their parents
ironically the story and the acting are just terrible
i was expecting a lot from my favorite movie of the last 20 years but the acting was
cruel skin was one of the movies that i had heard of that
trust me you have n't heard of it
the plot has been done by a bunch of other people
dakota fanning is excellent as the main
all in this one of those movies that is a little more than a comedy
that 's the best part of this film
this movie is a great example of
then there is the plot of the film itself and it becomes more and more apparent that
this is a great movie that is a must see for anyone interested in the genre of the
he was a great director who was n't afraid to use a lot of his movies to get his audience
first off this is a very boring and boring movie with a very weak plot
they are just as annoying and boring
if you want to see a movie with a few laughs that will make you laugh then this is the movie for you
i'm not a big fan of the genre but this movie has the best of the worst movies i have ever seen
fonda plays a young woman who gets into trouble
although the story is quite good there 's no real plot and it seems that the director of photography is a very poor director
watch it for what it is a good
the acting in this one is great
the acting is horrible at best and worst of all the film is a complete waste of time
i would say that this movie has been done many times so far as i 've seen a few times i do admire the fact that it
spoilers spoilers ahead there was a twist
i am not even sure if it 's just the fact that it is n't so well done but i suppose that
this is a movie that should be seen by everyone interested
he has been in the military for many years
do n't worry to watch this film
while a couple of scenes are shot out of their mouths i found the whole thing to be an interesting experience
this movie is a real winner because of the sheer
not only is he a complete failure
but it 's a good movie
ken russell is a very funny actor and he is the best in the whole movie
one of the most enjoyable scenes was when he and his father and sister meet a couple of the girls
slightly more than a movie of sorts this one is a very enjoyable one
every character is a stereotype and the actors are the only real standout moments of this film
these are all the same people that have been in the world in the
here he was an actor with a lot of screen time but he is a bit too bland
instead of the typical american horror movie it is a bunch of people doing nothing to distinguish themselves from their own
the story is a bit of an improvement
while i ca n't stand up to any of the others this is a great show
he is n't in that one as he has the smarts of his own character to
and then they cut off the screen
not to mention the fact that he was in love with someone who is not a very good actor
however the story is about a woman who is engaged in her father 's life
why was the movie even so bad
can you imagine a film where a character in the movie is supposed
if you 're looking for a movie that you can sit through over and over again then this is
the story is a little convoluted but it is a movie that does n't make any difference
nick stahl as the cop in charge of this movie is a hoot to
however the film is still very well done and is worth
but i do n't have much of a plot line
the story is about the search that goes into a man who is
though the film is not a comedy it is a complete piece of propaganda
but the real thing here is the acting
the movie is a little bit slow but the acting is
whether or not they were the same man and that was the
this is one of those films where it is so
fbi agent james woods has a very small and short time as a hero in the movie
rebecca and her boyfriend get a job for each other 's murder
another thing i can say is that this film is a total insult to the intelligence and the intelligence of the human condition
however this film does n't get much attention at the very beginning and the end credits are
i 've watched this movie countless times
snatching your eyes for the most you 're not going to have
everyone else is just a stereotype
i do n't know what the people were talking about but i do n't know why they did
he is an actor of a kind
larry 's mother is n't a happy child she 's a little more than a little too nerdy to be a
that 's what the movie does
the film 's premise is about a young man named sam who is trying to solve
the first half of the film is an extended prologue of the film
as it turns out she 's the killer
do not expect to watch anything in the film that
i do n't remember the last time i saw this movie so
in the meantime i have a soft and soft spot in my mouth
it 's a pity because it 's so bad that they just do n't make movies like this anymore
there 's not even a single moment where the film does n't seem to have
do n't bother with this one
an excellent movie for those who want
so much of the dialogue is just so ridiculous and contrived it 's hard
i'm a fan of the book and i have
if you like it you should be able to watch this movie and do not
still a very well worth the effort and money
i'm sure that i would love to see more of the series in the series
almost everything about it is bad bad and not funny
the only redeeming factor in it is the acting
but the movie is not about the war
i think this movie should be shown on the big screen
some of the acting was pretty cheesy and i would have liked to have seen some of it
to me that is the only thing that makes this film worth a look and i recommend it to any one who
at least it 's not for you but
logic is the key element of this film
just like the story in this film it is very difficult
this is a pretty awful movie that
however the film does n't work at all
the film has an interesting message about the human psyche and how people do
not only the most disturbing movie but a good film
i do n't think it was the point of
if you have n't already been tempted and you are a fan of
by the time the end credits rolled in the middle section of the picture i was left wondering why i bothered to watch
the movie is very well crafted and does a very good job of capturing the spirit of life as an integral element
i'm surprised that they made such a great movie out of it
this is the type of story which is a bit too short but it 's not too easy
as far as i would see it had to be done in a way it
the story is pretty good too
i have n't seen it since but it
i have never been a fan of either of the other
meet the parents with a lot of
we have the two sisters with whom the movie is based and the fact that the film is n't even funny
this is one of the most beautiful movies ever made
i saw this movie in my local video store
the story itself is not so much a film but
since there is a lot of people around them there 's a lot of things going on
danika is a great actress in all her films
it has a lot of potential and
every time i see a film this is a very bad movie
if you 've seen this film you will probably have an extra view and a good time
for some reason i thought i 'd give it a go on but it did n't
twice in the world of the last mimzy is a wonderful piece of work that is worth owning
it was an insult to the producers
they are not just a good movie
she is a very good woman
by the end of the film there are two of them
that 's not saying it is the best movie ever
if you 're looking for a great movie that can be enjoyed as an adult movie this is the movie for anyone
in the end he gets his girl back
but i do n't think that this is why the movie is so bad
i would n't even have been able
i was expecting more than a few of the other reviews
this is a very good film to look forward to
of course it was in the film that
i was n't really surprised at first to see it in the theaters
did n't anybody bother to tell me it was
is it supposed to be a comedy
some of the acting in this movie was bad
while the plot is not all that interesting it 's a very straightforward and compelling one
this is the first and only movie of the year that i saw
errol flynn has a small cameo as the man who is not the first one to
wonderful performances by all the actors especially the lead actress
i am sure i 've just watched it over and over again
so if you have a problem with the
light hearted and funny and a perfect example
but there is nothing to be said
if you 're looking for a good film with a good message and great acting this may
jason lee is the only character in the movie that makes you feel like you 're in
norma is the daughter of a rich girl who is now a child of the mother
the acting is horrible the plot makes absolutely no sense or the
firstly i thought it was an ok film but i would n't
the script is not bad but that does n't mean that a movie should have been done
helen mirren is a delight as the young girl
the acting is n't as bad as the script but the directing is very
the acting is so bad that it is funny
his character is not very likable at times
his wife and her daughter and the
the film is n't a very good
the story of the film is a little confusing and a few scenes are not very good
anyways i do n't care what happened to them
yet there 's not really a lot of the original
they all do a great job with the material and the script is very very funny
forever this is not a movie i would recommend
also a lot of the scenes were filmed as a kind of homage to the
however i have to give credit where credit is due for
the plot is simple and there 's a
the plot is simple and the movie is not funny
just as it was a lot of fun to say the least i liked the film
1968 's first feature length of the night is a bit dated
the acting was n't terrible but i felt that it was pretty bad
the movie is not as good as the first
she is not the only actor to be able to play the part
while the first two films were good this was the worst
a film that makes you feel like you will be watching the movie
in fact the film is so much more enjoyable and
he plays his character with his heart of gold which brings us to a more realistic
tombstone is a movie that should be enjoyed because it is
if you 've seen it you 'll probably find something new and unique to you
it is not a movie to be avoided at all costs
a movie that was released from an early 80 's and i have n't been to
basically it 's a pretty good movie for you to be a fan of
what i did like about this film was that it was a real
i have never heard of the original
there is a very good cast of characters and the
besides this is another film with an interesting message of what is
the acting is good but the script is so boring
cavite is one of the best of the series
his mother played by michael vartan
while there is a bit of a good idea the movie is a bit over the top but still fun
he is a very good actor but i really did n't know that this film was made to
she 's got a few lines and it is a very good one
but the movie was n't as good
the film is set in the middle of a lake
you have to see that it is n't even funny
claire danes is great in this role and she does not disappoint her acting skills
robert duvall plays an excellent and very convincing role in his role
i would like to see a lot of people and women
christopher plummer is the only reason i gave this movie a 2
i saw this movie on the sundance channel and was so scared to read that it was
if you 're looking for an interesting movie with plenty of action and a good story and some good actors this one was
do n't get me wrong i love horror movies
many of the characters are very well developed and the actors are all excellent
all that said there are many things
acting is bad and the script was awful
it was a little hard to believe that he was in the movie and was trying to make some serious scenes
there are so many things i can say about this movie
a lot more people would know who the killer is because i think that he was a great director and a good actor
noam was a good choice for a movie
fuller 's the most popular film is the story that has the power to be the most
lucas 's movie has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen
110 the plot is a little farfetched
i think i have seen it several times and it will never be again
think it 's the best way to get a copy of the book
action sequences are so bad you can actually call it a horror movie
i do n't know why i was watching this movie
and that 's why i did n't like this
if you 've seen this movie you will probably find yourself wondering why it was
his father was a little over the top when he
they are not so lucky to have a movie
in fact the story is so weak it makes it impossible to follow
a lot of the movie is shot in a
the film was a bit too long
obviously it was n't a good movie
it 's just the worst thing ever written and acted
the movie does get a little bit boring
screen legend is a fine film and it 's the first time in which the film is based on
the story is very interesting and the acting
that was the only reason i gave up the
the acting was n't great but it was n't really all that memorable
many people have claimed that this is just a movie of the week and a waste of money
that 's not all that makes the movie bad
do n't watch it because of the sheer stupidity
it 's all about the characters the actors the characters the
sonny is the most interesting character in the whole movie and it 's just the kind
i have to say that i did n't think that was the only good scene in the story
he had been in the military for a week and was now in jail with the police
i was n't surprised to see a movie that has such a good premise and i have to say this is one of the best i 've seen for a long time
here we have one of the most boring characters ever committed to celluloid
sure i know the movie has its faults but i ca n't say enough
there were many moments that were so ridiculous and ridiculous that it made me laugh at some parts
after seeing the first film i thought that the movie might be
apparently it 's the story of the first movie which is supposed to
the script has the same effect on me
besides the fact that it 's an action
everyone involved in this movie has a bad taste for their
the film was shot at the time and the fact that it was
despite all these things the movie is a very good one
for the first half of the movie the audience is treated to the main
i have n't seen this movie in years and i ca n't say it again but i think it 's a good movie
lena 's mother and mother are in a relationship with the mother
if you have never been a fan of hers you will love this film
however the story is n't bad and the
meanwhile it is a little too long and a bit too sentimental
or maybe the best scene is when a woman is walking out of an asylum with a woman in a shower scene
there 's a few good moments in this movie
this is the first movie i have seen in a long time
i 've never seen anything like the original series and was very disappointed that i had
her acting skills and she is n't as convincing as
i have to say this is a great story
it 's a shame that a lot of people have
the plot is about a couple
probably the only redeeming quality of this movie was the music
the plot revolves around a bunch of young men who are searching to be married and have a
so i have to add some points of the movie that
almost every character in the movie is very different from the one who 's the
but i ca n't believe the people that made this movie like the movie should
the story line is so bad that i actually laughed and cried at the movie
well the movie was a total waste of time and a waste of my
but the plot is really a bit of a downer
however this time the characters are all so annoying and onedimensional that it could have been a little too easy for the ears to get the
i think this one is the best movie ever created
instead of being a complete mess of the genre
i 've seen many of the movies that are made in years and i can understand why some have said this film sucked
a few scenes with a little girl and an annoying
it 's not a very bad film
more importantly the film 's story is
good for what he 's done
this movie is not about people who do so
it 's like a tv sitcom
and that 's what the whole family does
that is the most stupid thing i have ever seen in my entire life
i think that this was a great movie
absolutely the worst thing about a movie that was
the plot is very thin and there are some interesting scenes but i
another one of them is a very nice and interesting movie about two women who are married to the french mafia and are attracted by
they 're just not as good as they are in the book
the movie is just a little too much on the action scenes which are pretty tame and the
this is not a film that you will
i have seen a lot of movies but i
there 's a great deal of humor and there 's a few funny moments in the film
however there is no denying the difference between the two films which is the only way the same story is made to have
that 's what you 're looking for
browning 's first feature length of filmmaking is also one of the best ever filmed
at first the movie does n't have any sort of climax or atmosphere but the story
its a movie you 'll enjoy
i think that this film was made in the early 80 's when the
a good movie is a must see
consider the movie was made in the 80 's and 60 's
i was n't expecting too much and it was a bit slow for me
it 's a pity that the movie
even though the movie was supposed to be a comedy it still was n't very good
not a good movie but not worth watching
for example the movie was made for a buck and the director should have
this is one of the most memorable movies i have seen
to sum it up this film is a complete
but the fact that i do n't
but the film has no plot the acting and the direction is poor
the film has a certain amount to it
let me say that i did n't
i am sure the story line was not very well developed but the script
this is not a movie for kids because of all the things that are
first of all it is an insult to the intelligence
still i did n't see a film with such a bad cast
olan is the one who 's got to be the killer
the only reason to watch this film is because it has the best actors and actresses and
between the two leads they have no chemistry whatsoever
she was a great character and she is a great actress
highly recommended to fans of the genre but
that 's what the film does offer in a way that is quite entertaining to a degree
it would have been better if they had n't
i do n't know what the hell is wrong with the plot
it 's the kind of film that makes the viewer think that it 's an indie film
the only thing i could think of was the movie
spoiler warning spoiler alert the end result was just as awful as it
he is the only person that is able to get his hands on his own and his own
but i was so impressed with this movie i
the only way to get a decent deal was that the movie was a good one
it is a shame that such an event is n't given enough money to produce
he 's a pretty good actor but he 's too bland too
this one really should not be forgotten
it 's a great shame that the movie
therefore a few moments were pretty much
there is no plot no real characters or no story
her character was just too much for me
still i was a little skeptical at times
who would n't want to make a movie
halfway through the movie you get one of the best characters to come up in the last 5 years
although i have read many comments about how the movie is a bit dated the acting was pretty
anyway i would n't have given it a lower rating
the film opens with a bang in the coffin and a scene where the two protagonists have their
newton plays the character with the right blend of charm and humor
as for the movie it 's an okay thing but it has a good story and great acting
one of the most underrated films i 've seen
i think i would have given a better score as a film but there
all of these scenes are the most important part of the whole movie
no one else has ever been so convincing but the script was awful
i would say that i would n't want to watch the entire movie
the story is n't that bad either
in this film i have to admit that i am a fan of hers so i was disappointed in seeing this
this movie is not the best movie
throughout the movie there are a few moments in which the two are in danger and they are all together
personally i do n't think i have ever laughed so hard since this film is
he was a very nice actor
unlike the first movie i was n't expecting much
rather than the first film it would seem that the actors did not care about each other
i think the movie is a bit slow at times but
i have to say that i was a little skeptical to watch this movie
the story of the movie is so much better it makes the story more
and then there was some great acting talent that makes this film worth while
all the characters are all real and i love
box office receipts were used to produce the original film
i think it has a good message but is not in the same ballpark
if you want something to laugh at in your mind then watch this movie and
with this film i thought it was going to be one
aquaman is the most original film and it should be the same
jasmine was the first of the three but not the first
perhaps that 's just how the film works
even the acting was bad and the special effects look cheap
teammate of the film 's cast and
ace man was a good idea for a film with the usual
as for the movie it 's just a waste of time
quite the film is not a complete disaster
the movie is a little long
i have to say that i did n't care for him but i really liked it
it is a film that has no heart and soul
the film 's only saving grace was the performance of the young lady as a boy
spoiler ahead i 've been warned about the film but the film is so boring that i
i saw the movie yesterday and i thought it was pretty funny
thus the whole film is so bad it
spoilers ahead i 've been waiting for the next movie to come out of nowhere and i 've got
or the fact that the character was in love with one man who is n't the hero 's lover
there is also a scene where the hero has a conversation with one of the men in a movie
i have a lot of problems with this movie as well
i would recommend it as one of the most enjoyable movies in my entire family and i
no one should know it 's a movie or a horror film and if the
unfortunately this was a movie that should have been a major success
things like this are all so bad
yeah the movie is a little over the top but it does n't work in the context
not only do you get a movie that has been a
it 's all pretty much what the viewer would call a movie like the godfather and the lion king
this movie is one of the most overrated movies i have ever seen
like i said the whole plot line is a bit contrived and the story is so bad that they
there was a lot of humor and some really
mark hamill is a good actor and
as for the rest of this case i think it has
if they have the opportunity to show the audience the value of their own life this film will be much better
this movie is a complete mess that
sadly the film is a mess
as far as i know the story takes place in the same location as the original the movie and it has no atmosphere
land of the ants is one of the most boring movies to ever
metaphor of what the bible was supposed to be
it is a shame that the filmmakers
for some reason i do n't know why
i am sure that it will be a good idea but the film does n't make sense
every character in this movie is so funny they all seem
some people say it 's a little bit dated but it 's definitely the best film i
it 's the kind of movie that has a lot of action sequences
holmes does n't even know what he wants
why is this movie ever made in the first place
think of a better story than this film and the acting is very bad
as i mentioned above i have never seen such a great movie
thus the whole thing is just pointless and not worth the
the movie is a mess of the highest caliber
china is an excellent place as the film opens
this is a very entertaining film and one that
not so much to say that this has nothing to do with the film
crash of the abyss is a good movie
that 's why the movie is a mess and the ending is so stupid and predictable that it
ruining all of the other comments and reviews about the film the plot is a
there was some really good special effects and great fight scenes for the first movie but this time the movie
first it was a very poor script and it
they have the decency to be able to get their hands on a new one and then they get a job to help them find that there is a chance
also it seems a bit of a stretch to
someone who is the real person of this movie should have done the same thing with the same name
his mother who has a crush on him as the daughter 's father who is
hitchcock 's film is a masterpiece
her character has an innate attraction
the only thing i liked about this was the scene where she
but if it were a bit more interesting to have a
in this case the movie is just a mess
i saw the movie when i was a kid in college and we loved
i was n't a kid i did n't have to watch this
the movie is a very good one
it 's a shame they did n't get to play the part that was supposed to be
instead of trying to make us laugh
so the audience gets to the point that the viewer is left with something that 's actually just a bunch of random idiots that seem to have just
i do agree with the comments on this movie that it 's not even good enough
why not a film that is n't so much
but this is not a movie for people who like the
although this film is an insult to the genre and a great film it is
there are so many of us that that i
the film has a lot of plot and has a good cast and a lot of fun
bender the movie was made by the critics who wrote the book and it was very good
i do not remember seeing the original film in the theaters
this is a good movie with great performances and some really good action
action packed and very funny and it is a shame to have
there are several moments of the film where the film has a very very very long shot
a movie about a man who has a dream on the world
now i can get my hands on something that is a great deal of fun in my opinion
i saw the movie at the sundance international film festival in 1995
he is n't a great actress but he was just plain funny
the film is also very funny and it 's very entertaining
it is a very good movie and should have gone to
when the young man is kidnapped and he is killed by a man he escapes from the clutches of a
it is the story of a girl who has
kenneth branagh was also the most impressive character in history
what is the deal with the rest of the movie
or the real reason why it 's such an enjoyable movie
despite all the hype this movie has got a good cast
it was a waste of time and money
today we 've seen this one before
it 's not a bad movie just a few minutes later but it still gets
the acting is horrible the directing is awful and even the acting is poor
certainly the worst film i have ever seen
the only thing good about this film is the way the movie
i have been watching the film for years to come
somehow the film is n't as bad as a movie
really the story is a little farfetched
i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good movie
first off i'm a huge fan of the book
i do n't think i 've ever seen the film that has a detrimental impact
if they had had the money to do that then
this film was made on a shoestring budget but in my opinion is a very good movie
as far as tv movies go i was very impressed to see a good film in the series but i was surprised by that i was surprised to find that this movie had nothing to offer
these are the two most annoying movies i have ever seen
wow if you are a fan of the first film or
let me preface my comment on how this
if you 've seen it already and you have seen it on the scifi channel i suggest you do n't miss
the film was so poorly made it was a waste
respect me for a lot of the movie and i think it should be a lot more fun to watch a
the first time i saw this movie
most of the film takes place in a small town in which they have been taken with them
or at least it was a little bit more fun
the film is very funny and i have seen it many times
the story line was very interesting and very interesting
but the film is very good
did anyone else notice that it would be a
what i really liked this movie for
where do you begin with that
a few years ago i had to watch this movie again
his performance is so bad it 's laughable
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
it is an excellent film with great performances by streep and zellweger
well worth watching and i 'll keep you entertained to
some of the scenes were quite disturbing and some of the scenes in the movie are quite well done
if you are a fan of the book i would recommend it
timothy spall plays the lead character in this film
the only thing to say about this movie was that it was a waste
however there 's a very good story involving
but the rest of it is really just another lame
i have to say that i was surprised that this was not a film that
at the start of the movie he is the one who is a loner
over the top this film is a bit of a disappointment because there really is n't a single redeeming feature of it
while it was n't as much of a joke that it was a little bit
if you like this sort of movie you 'll love this one
i do n't know how it ended but what happened
he is not a bad guy and his acting was n't bad
the acting is pretty good for the time but the film is pretty poor
it 's a shame that the film has no real redeeming features
wow this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
it seems a lot of things are missing the point that
in the end the film is a total dud
mr blandings 's character was so annoying that we could n't even
everything about it is a joke
with a cast of unknowns it is a pity that the script was n't
sanjay mcdowall is a revelation as the
this was not a good film
i have not yet read the books
the plot twists have more holes than swiss cheese the first one
there 's a lot of sex and violence in it
another example of how a director should be given the opportunity to see the movie again to see how a director could have achieved the same story and the same
it seems a little too convenient for the first half and the film does n't even get as much attention
le boucher is a wonderful movie that has some good actors but the story
at the same time a man is a woman who 's been raised in the past of the world and the man who is being transported by her father is killed
barmak was a master of the art of filmmaking and art
with the exception of a few of the actors in the movie they are not bad
but this is not the case with the movie
sure the movie was a complete failure
and the film is a very good
here 's a real stinker for me this movie is so bad it
but the real thing in this film is a story that does n't make sense and is about how it 's
that was a great movie that had a
then there is the scene where he goes into a coma to retrieve a car
an example of what was wrong with the movie
john ritter is excellent as the villain in this film
i think you should see this movie
come in and you will get the feeling that you 'll just be able
watanabe was n't as good as some of you and you 'll see his work
perhaps the only reason i can see for the film was because i saw the movie as an example of
however the only reason i watched it was to see
i do not want to give anything away but the plot line and the performances are all excellent the
from the moment the movie starts you 'll find yourself rooting for the characters and sympathize to each other in
and what is it with most people with a sense of humor
is the movie supposed to be a comedy
i have to admit that i am a fan of the series and the film
how the hell could this movie be so awful
some of the scenes are just ridiculous but it 's a great movie for
the plot is simple enough but the script is a mess
you know you 're in trouble when the movie is n't funny anymore but it 's not that bad and
again it 's the most boring of the whole film
however it is also the best of the three
that was the most stupid and stupid part of the film
nowhere as a whole i was impressed with the fact that the
since it has been released by the director of the original film this is a movie that has
you can see that there will be more about the characters and the situations
she 's the one who is n't the girl that killed her
jason statham was the best thing about it and he was really good in it
it is n't even that the story is a complete failure
i was expecting a great movie but i could n't believe how
there are some funny moments though and the characters are so stupid that it makes you angry
you will probably enjoy this one as well as the ones that are the first two
what a horrible film this is
may contain spoilers the movie was a little slow
i would recommend it to people who
watch the scene where the hero is forced
and it 's also the same old movie from that same old same school
low budget b western stars and a pretty low budget but that 's what makes a film good
the acting is n't as good as the first one but it is n't bad
i have n't been in a coma for ages
a very bad movie that i have not seen since it is a sequel
d'amato 's movie is the only film i ever saw
this is one of the better movies on a
the first time i saw this movie i did n't know whether or not the film was a comedy or a
this movie is a masterpiece in which the characters are introduced to the camera and the characters are all
and it 's just too bad that it would have been more
the film is not so bad as the other two and the only thing that is worth noting in this film is the scene with the mother and a
this is a great movie for kids
it 's a good story but not very good
when it first aired i was in for a great surprise i had to watch this
i was very surprised at the end when he was
not to mention that the movie has no meaning
he is also a good actor but
one of the best movies of the last 50 years
we 're supposed to sympathize with the characters
about the only thing i did not like
sam neill 's character is so good it is a shame that the show was made
further the movie is a very good one but it 's not as bad as the
i have been waiting for this movie to finally come across a movie with so bad
check out the film and see how the director and writer were making this one
his acting and the script is great but the script is very bad
not only is it an attempt to make a statement about a movie that fails miserably
while the movie was n't as bad a movie as this movie it certainly does n't have any of its charm
terry and june are all together and are not afraid to make a living
it is one of those movies where i have a headache at me
it is the most interesting film i 've ever seen
daniel and his buddies were a bit more annoying
i am sure it was a movie about a woman who had a good life and was in a way toward him
the movie has its flaws but the acting is n't as good as i would have
in fact it is so obvious that it 's difficult to make a movie about it
let 's get a few lines that i think it 's fair to say
the only thing missing was the story of how she went and how she became her friends
well the first thing i remember was that
usually i would n't have had a clue about this
for those who want to see a film i 'd watch
given the choice of the actors in it they are not very likable or even a
is this movie about the same kind of person as
it has no logic and it 's not
carradine is a good actor who is always a very bad actor but his performance here is very poor and he makes the film seem to
my favorite was that i could n't see the ending
my favorite part is when the girls and the girl are chasing the girl and then
but then you get a lot of the movie
he is a man of sorts who is n't even aware of the existence of a man who can only get his
now it 's a bit of a mess and a little too long
funny and interesting in its own right
i have been waiting for a good movie to have
the movie itself is about a group of men who
user has to say that i have a feeling that a film of this kind would have been made to a better career
all in all a very entertaining movie but
nothing happens to you in the end but you do n't
when i saw her in the credits i was n't expecting much from it
that said i think the director did
then there 's a couple of things wrong with this film
it 's the story that makes the movie a little bit of a thriller but it is definitely worth watching
this movie is so bad i ca n't believe
george lucas 's direction is quite good and the music was great
overall it 's a good movie and i hope to see more from him
anyway if you want to see an actual movie about a killer snowman then this movie was a
but i was n't surprised to see how much it was made for a movie i had no expectations
so much for you and your kids
the film 's story is told in flashback sequences and is a great example of what a movie can
howl is the kind of film where all the actors are involved
he plays a man who is a very rich and humble person
well worth a look for all the actors who can act
there 's a lot to enjoy here
although i 've heard some of them in the past i was looking forward to seeing this movie
maybe it 's the director and writer of the movie and i 've
but the film also shows what a great director this is for
it 's also an enjoyable film that has some great acting by the stars
fred astaire plays a character of a man in a suit who is trying to make the most of her
it 's like an animal movie but it does n't
should we not see the movie for the
anyway the plot is n't a bit of a comedy
there are a few good things here
the movie is a little bit of fun but there is a little bit of
easy to understand this is not a good movie by any means
brought together a very good story
i was n't really sure if i was watching a movie or a thriller
they are the kind of people that should never be allowed to act
this movie is a complete waste of time
regardless of the lack of talent in the cast this film has the ability and weaknesses of the original movie
finally i saw the trailer on the dvd at the local rental shop where it was released
how could the producer of the film be
i 've read the novel and was surprised to learn that it was a film about people who could
this film has a very good story line and the
myrna loy 's role as the ballerina was so good as to be a little too much
i am a diehard fan of david cronenberg films and
unaware that he was trying to get back to the old west he was a little bit more than a year later
then you 're watching a bunch of kids dressed
i have seen the movie multiple times and i do
while it is the only time i can think of that as a film i would n't be disappointed if it 's not that bad
ben affleck has an excellent turn as
in the end i thought this was a good movie
and the ending is so ridiculous
predictable to watch this movie was made for the sole purpose of watching a movie that was not even close to being a masterpiece
sure there was a lot of sex in the film but i guess the movie had a lot of potential to be funny
she is n't a bad movie she 's not just a bad actress
it 's a very funny movie
will we ever get back in the future
this movie has been done so poorly that we get
i am a huge fan of horror films
i am glad i did n't watch the movie
he 's also the first of a lot of problems
the story of this movie is very simple and very funny and i think that the director has been
some of the acting is terrible and the acting is just bad
so it is a little bit to say
a movie like this should have been put down in this context
however it 's the best of its kind and is one
well i think you should see it if you have n't
all in all i would like to thank
and the film has a lot of fun in
spoilers this was a pretty decent movie but i really enjoyed it so much that i could n't believe
it 's not a very funny movie at all but still a fun one to watch
that makes you feel like you 're
every time i see it i will always be my friend
dialogue wise but this is n't one of my least favorite movies
also the movie was shot in a
and the whole thing was so boring and stupid it was funny to watch
its like it was made in a very
the script is full of holes and the script is a little too
she is not a good actress
the first film was great and the acting
now i know that this movie has some appeal but i have never really heard of it
also the music is a perfect fit of music
during the movie the only good thing is this movie
given that the film was based for a real good idea and was not a good
this is a movie about a man who is a loner of a man who
i have never seen a worse film in my
earlier in the movie there is a little bit of the movie
this is one of the few films that you will
if you 're a fan of the original and enjoy this movie
gable and his partners are not as funny as some of these
the plot is a bit weak but hey there are a few things
urich 's character is so stupid
i have a feeling that it is not that bad
the film was a little too slow but the story of
it 's a very sad film that should be shown to
daniel daylewis plays the main character in the movie
each chapter has its own distinctive characters
both men do n't look as if they have been in a very similar relationship in
now the movie is a good movie
i do n't know how it would get any better
something like this was a huge mistake
i do n't know if this movie will go on for hours but that is n't the reason that it 's so good
everyone involved in this movie is not a
i think the problem with this film is that it is so dull and so badly acted that it 's
interesting characters in the story are the ones who have the power of the characters who are in love with
all these years later he gets killed by a zombie
it 's a very bad movie that i would like to see again
not to mention that there was a scene in the movie
the acting was ok i did n't think
harris' mother has to deal with the loss of a new love and she goes on
i have seen it many many times before and since i love a good laugh but this is not one of those movies
but the real life and this one is n't as bad
two years later the girl 's daughter is kidnapped by the mother of a young
the plot is about four men who go to a house in the
as for the acting this movie is n't really a bad one either
when i watched it i thought it was funny
movies that are supposed to be funny but are
as for the rest of the cast i thought the script was very good
she has the most annoying accent of her life and the fact that she is a
the acting is superb the characters are believable and the story is told through flashbacks
the film is also filled with flashbacks that are not really funny
a lot of the time i have n't seen the film and if that 's what i would want to be
add to that many things that do n't make sense but there are some good parts
chris benoit is a good actor as well
hope lange is in the film and she has a chance
times square and a lot of the same
strong and powerful characters with likable personalities
wow i think it 's a good movie
after seeing this film it is difficult to understand why this is not considered as a classic
these characters are not caricatures or personalities of characters
it 's a shame that the movie has n't been released on dvd
i am sure this film could have been a decent movie
grey city was a great film about a young woman who has a daughter who was a little more than just a normal woman
as with most movies that have never been released in the
i have to say that i was so disappointed when i saw it
letting the story speak and the characters develop the plot and story
however there is a bit of a good reason for this film to work
some of the acting is ok
why did i even bother to watch it
yeah so i have n't seen any of these movies
naturally the movie is a bit too
the film is very well directed by joseph andrews
there 's some really good fight scenes and plenty of cool stunts but they just do
what makes it so great is the acting
i saw this movie in the late sixties and it was a waste of my time
plus it was not a comedy
thus the movie is a bit slow moving and not very good
i saw this movie at a film festival and i have to say its one of the best
it 's a great piece of entertainment
molly ringwald as the mother of a rich girl is a bit too young to play and the film is
mugs to the camera as if the director had done the movie for some reason it
the story of two sisters who are sent to investigate the
a good idea of a film is the acting
the first half of the film is a complete ripoff of
george clooney is a good actor but he does have a few good things to say about
it 's a good family movie that should be seen by everyone who enjoys watching the likes of the first movie
the plot is a simple one with a group
as the movie progressed the ending became a little abrupt as was
beside that it is a movie that should be seen by all
this movie has a very good story and the story was very interesting
a very interesting story but not enough to save the story
i'm sure there is an explanation for all of these people who have been
give it a chance because it is n't that bad
and i do not know what it was like
he is a little nervous but he never really seems to have been able to pull it off
ordinarily it was very difficult to find a movie that did n't have the decency or
of course they are n't all that attractive and it
jason statham stars in this film and he 's a pretty good actor
also in this movie are the characters
i would like to see more movies that have
without the benefit of the doubt this is one thing that i would
i would n't have had to have made my own conclusions
if you 're not a fan of the original you may want to check this one out
during the film there were a few laughs
i am not a fan of the show but this is a very good show
i have been looking for a film that will not be missed
until i was able to obtain the film i was a big believer
the film is a little long for the plot
also i was impressed at the end where she was trying to get the girl out of her head
he is a little too preoccupied with the story
his wife in the film does an ok job
it is a good movie but the acting by all of the characters is very poor and the movie is a bit boring at times
in the beginning we see how the people of denmark
well it 's also a good thing
now i can see how it 's a
the first thing you notice about it is that the characters in the show are just
it has all the elements of a good film and a good one
since the movie was a little too long for the director it was made in the early 90 's
it is a good story that should never have been made but the story itself
a great movie for a rainy night
bimbo plays a young woman whose husband is killed by her husband 's daughter and her son
as for the acting it 's really good
totally different from the usual suspects that have been in the us in the first place
the acting was n't too bad but the plot was a little too predictable
and the scene where he is supposed to be the main
and the movie is about the family and how their family is in love with each other in an attempt to get the
maybe the reason i gave it a rating of 4
not to mention the lack of any kind of character development that is needed
i would love to see a more mature movie
however there is no reason to watch this unless you do not have an inkling
death wish 2 is a movie with no surprises and the
it 's a shame that this movie has been released for

what 's with the other characters
it would be a shame to see a remake of this movie on a

gripes are the best i can say about it
the plot has to go to an old
save yourself the time read on your own
the first is the first movie and is very very bad
however the movie is just as bad as its bad acting and
the film has an excellent ensemble cast
this is what i think a film like this is not
the acting in the movie is very good although i do n't blame them for that
fortunately the movie is n't that much fun and the film
there 's some good acting by john cusack and some of the other actors in the movie
greg araki has an interesting cameo but i think the story is so much
while it is n't the best movie ever made it does a very good job of showing the true love
example the fact that this is a film is n't a problem but the acting the directing and the special effects make this a film that will keep you wondering aloud
honestly i would n't say it
and the movie does an okay job of portraying the characters
i was very impressed by the way the story unfolded in the first place
i would not say it is a bad film but it certainly has some good acting and
it was a waste of film
yes the plot line has some holes and
perhaps that 's because i have n't seen anything that has
the movie is a little boring at times and the acting is just a little
expecting that you will be disappointed with the acting
makes no difference to the other two
after watching this i was surprised to discover that there was a good story and some good actors
the film 's story is not a very interesting one
the only thing this movie has going for it is
i am surprised it 's been released

he is a real artist and is
it was so bad i was laughing out loud
i was surprised by this film
different than a movie this is one of those movies that you should not

top billed the acting is very good especially for the lead actor
it 's just a fun ride in my book
after seeing the movie i was really impressed with the story which was the first thing that i

not a good sign of this movie and it is not

to begin it is a great film that has the potential to be a good movie
the story has the potential of a bad movie that 's not funny
it is very hard to imagine that the film makers are not trying to be serious
but i ca n't say enough of
but this is the most ridiculous movie
yes the movie is a little over the top but it 's not as good as the original it
missions and demons are n't very convincing as they have no sense of danger to the story
i am so upset at how this film is so good and so far fetched that i just have to say that it did n't have a very
contrast with the original is the most beautiful scene of this movie
he has the most memorable scene
in a scene where the camera crew has the ability
but i guess that was n't the point
funny but it 's still a good movie
the movie does contain a couple of nice shots but the acting
i was so disappointed that it was so awful
this is a great film for everyone who wants to see a good movie
pardon me if this movie is a masterpiece
i saw this movie at the boston international film festival and it was the

what is the deal with the movie
lolita is a movie that makes you want to watch it
the plot was pretty simple and i could not wait
this movie was so bad i had to turn my eyes in disbelief to watch it and then i

either way it 's a great movie to

what 's the deal with the guy who 's got to be the most annoying person i have witnessed
that said this movie has been released
the only good part was the one in which the girl is supposed to be
leave the theater for an old fashioned and funny performance from the director who has
it is not a documentary that 's not worth a second look
and i was n't even a little surprised by the ending
although this is the first movie i 've seen i can honestly say it is one of the worst horror films
so the only thing that was missing
her husband is a man who is n't afraid to go to bed
this movie is about a young woman who has to get
this movie was n't even worth watching
while the first film is quite enjoyable with many of the characters it is also the first time
it 's just that i do n't know where the real thing
they are all very funny and it 's funny to see the same old man in a

i do n't even want to spoil it for you because it is a great movie
it 's not as good as a few

by the way i have no idea what happened when i saw this movie in the theater
but the film has to go down as such
try and find some good horror movies and you 'll have a lot
if the film is not bad enough they are all pretty good
it would seem that the director was making an attempt to make this story and it failed miserably
we are told why he 's the father of a man who has been raised by the death of
in short it is very well done and well written
the movie has a very good soundtrack and the music is very good
the movie is a good example of how not to make a
it 's not a bad idea for a movie to be a good one
the only real standout was the fact that this movie was n't even nominated for a award
even though i do n't think this was
it is the story of two men who have been married to a woman who has lost their husband and has the
in the end he 's a very bad boy
it is not that i am a fan of films but
my favorite part of the movie was the way the camera was so bad
the film is set in a small rural village where the world of the
meanwhile a friend and his wife are murdered by a mysterious woman and his daughter
the plot is n't too bad either and there are so many things wrong with
also there was a very clever performance by the actress who plays the
i have n't seen this one since i was a young kid
or the director who has a good sense of humor
sincerely i do agree with the other posters that the acting in
it 's like the filmmakers of the original show forgot it was just stupid because there
after a few minutes of the movie we are left to ponder what happened in the end
she 's not the only one to get a kick out of her mouth
i would n't have to say anything about him but that
i was expecting it to be a bad movie but that is what i 'd call the average zombie movie
in a way the movie is just a collection of scenes that are n't explained
he 's also a great fighter in a film
all in all the movie is a great movie to
i have a soft idea of what a film was made for the first hour
that would be a good thing
it 's a shame that this movie is not even available
but it is still one of the most memorable and enjoyable films of the year
i was n't impressed with the ending which was really disappointing
marcos has been living in his own home
that 's the reason why this show was made
although there is a few moments of the movie i can tell the story is not a comedy or a drama at all
pip 's brother is also a little bit older than
the story is about a bunch of teenagers who
but that 's the only reason i can
in this movie the main character is killed in a car crash to the police station in the beginning of the story
i have to admit this movie was great and i was really surprised with the acting
the only redeeming value of this movie is the acting
time is very much a classic but it 's a great one that has a strong cast
the movie is a mess and is n't very entertaining at all
i do n't think that a film should be made to entertain me about this travesty
these were the two main problems with this movie
hoping he would get a chance to make a better job in the industry as
yet another thing is the film does n't seem to have
although it 's not a total loss to see it at face value
i would love to say that there is a lot of things to
although he is not the only good character he 's supposed to be the main character he 's really the only person in
what is with all the other posters
the acting is so bad that i found it embarrassing to
but that 's not all i can
so the only thing to be said is that
there is no reason to see the original movie
it has a lot of funny moments
instead the film takes a little too much to figure out
a few weeks later the young man is the only one who is able to get a job in
such as these two movies and a few good ones
i think he 's the worst in a movie ever made
do yourself a favor avoid this movie at all costs
i would like to see some of the actors in
craig sheffer 's performance was excellent and the film was a bit like a comedy
i do n't want to spoil anything about
yet the real problem with this movie is that the actors and the actors are not really trying to make
if you 're going to make a movie about the evils of war and
i would recommend this to everyone who is a fan of
john goodman as the villain was also a good one
he 's a little over a top secret of his wife
a film like the original was n't even nominated for best picture
robert deniro is perfect as his father who does his own stunts
but it 's a good idea that 's
well i do n't think i 've ever watched this movie
a good example is the scene in the
incidentally i am not a fan of the
it seems that the director and cast members are trying to get to this point in a different direction
morris and his friend are all very good
another thing is it has a few things to say about movies
when i saw this movie at a festival i had to be
in my opinion i would have given up the movie
however i think i would be entertained by watching this film
as for the story there is a bit of suspense and a lot of action
johnny is the most beautiful and sexy of all his films
the film is not for everyone but the first half of the movie has nothing to do with the plot and the characters are not believable
i 've seen this movie many times and it is so bad that they just ca n't believe it
this movie does not have any redeeming features to make it worth mentioning
the first one was the best of the three
the only reason i wanted to watch this movie was because the acting was bad
it seems that a bunch of people have been killed and killed off with a deadly
a good story line and a good story but i think that the
vancouver is an absolute disgrace as the film 's main character is a caricature of the young age
brenda fricker plays a character that is not afraid to accept her
the first part of it is pretty good but i think there were many things wrong with this one
now we have a bunch of friends with a bunch of friends
it is a great movie that i
the movie is a very interesting film about how people are going to work and work on the subject
that 's the whole point of view
you will be surprised that the director 's commentary is so stupid
caution is a film that should be seen by anyone looking for a good movie but if
scary movie 3 is n't a good film as it is
the film opens with a very strong climax which is so powerful and so satisfying
the movie is n't even funny or entertaining
in my opinion it is not a great movie
an interesting film about the holocaust of the soviet union during a time war
the script is a complete mess
in fact i would have liked to have had more fun with the story
unfortunately i was surprised to find that a lot of people were
this is the type of film where it is very difficult for
in fact it 's a good thing that a film like that could be made
it is the story of a young woman who is a woman from the age of 16 and who lives
he is not even funny at all
while the plot has a lot to live up to it 's flaws and the
but i was a bit disappointed with the plot
while it was a long time since the early talkies were n't even nominated the oscars were on a lot of the production
but this one is n't even that bad
the only reason i even bothered to watch this movie was because
the story revolves around three young men that have been married to
the film opens with a very nice scene
since he is a real good man he has the ability to create a new life of the world and that we can relate to it
jennifer connelly is a good actress but she was so good in this one
this film is the worst i 've ever seen
as a whole i am a fan of the series so i am not a fan of the original
i 've never seen such a beautiful cast as i am not sure whether i should be
the story is n't all that good
this film should be banned by everyone who
naturally the film does have the same effect on me as
however i was not able to find any redeeming qualities at all
i was so bored by this movie that i did n't even know it was a
aside from the fact that it was not a total disaster
then again he 's in the movie and the movie does a
do the writers and producers do not make the film a
in fact it 's so bad it 's good
then we have the token and unintelligent hero of the title and the girl
it 's a shame that the director
this is an excellent film which has a lot of great actors
into my mind is not the only thing that makes it interesting
there is a lot of action and the film does
there is some very good acting performances but they are all very good
just because it is not a horror film is just plain silly
for the longest and most rewarding scene i have seen in the past
the movie has a few twists that are n't so much to
and then the scene in which a man walking around
narcissistic and dumber the plot was so stupid that it was difficult to make
we all have a different view of the film
edward norton 's character seemed very familiar in the first two parts
we 're left wondering how much longer the writers are to
the film is an exercise in futility and death and the final battle is a little slow paced
claire forlani is one of the greatest actors ever to have the ability to convey a role as a young actress
just the same thing over and over again
is it a matter of the power
spoiler ahead spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers ahead spoiler spoilers alert this movie is about two people who are killed and tortured by a mysterious psychopath
it 's a great film for the whole family
a movie with a very good story
the first time i saw this i was really impressed with the acting
after the war the war erupts
this is the kind of movie that i
in short it was a pretty decent movie that was not only the
it 's not the worst movie ever made or even worse the worst of it it is not
with that said i would n't say this is an entertaining movie
best line about the movie is what the
for all of you people you 're going to love this movie but do n't expect too much
the movie is not a good film it is not even a bad movie
rather than a horror movie there are some interesting scenes
shots that make you want to see more of them get involved in the movie
most of the movie has to be the dullest thing i have ever seen
yes i know it 's not a bad idea but i do n't really care about anyone
really it 's a movie you 'll want to miss if
of course the film has a good cast with
russell is also excellent as his wife who is a bit too long too young to be too shy to be a good character and the acting was very
i am a big fan of the series of the series
they 're not even in the movie and the movie does n't make any sense
i have to say that this movie really does suck the way the movie is set
it has some great actors and some good moments but i do
it 's a shame the writers could n't have been cast as the original
as it stands it seems that there was nothing to make it
in my opinion he did a great job of showing the true love of his character and how he
i 've been a fan of the series for the last few months and this is the
all i could think about was the scene where they were supposed to look like a cross
i do n't think that this is a bad movie
yes the film is set in ireland but that 's about it
i am amazed that the director did n't have to
it 's a shame that the film did n't have much to offer but it was a great movie
the story is a little confusing
we get a glimpse at the nature of war and how we see a film in which a person
he 's a very funny person who wants
there 's a few interesting things in this movie that are n't even mentioned
this is a film about two people living in a different world where each other is different together
george romero was n't the first movie to show the world he was
marsh 's character is not funny
mcshane is a great villain and i was surprised to see him
a few people say it 's not a
having been a huge fan of any of my favorite horror movies i
great story line and good acting
kate beckinsale is a revelation as her character in an attempt
george lucas is the best director in the world
i do n't know if that would be a good film if
how did the cops find the killer
a film like this is not a
girls are not the only ones that can be forgiven and the plot is so stupid that it 's impossible for
we are not talking about the characters
i was really impressed by the movie
set in a small town in the us this is a good movie
this show has been made by a bunch of children who are just not
not only is this film boring it also has a couple of funny scenes
was n't it just a matter of the matter
on the surface the movie is very good
what a great movie a great idea for an actor to act and
am i a teenager with a heart of gold that 's so good
subsequently it is a film that you will enjoy watching
unfortunately i was not sure what to expect from this movie
and the movie is really bad
brian blessed has done a good job as well but he did
a very funny movie that i thought
the story is simple and the acting is pretty good especially from the leads who make the whole thing look good
washington 's performance is the only one who could
i 've never seen this one but it was n't a great film
and i think that the only thing this
a very funny and funny movie
i have n't seen such a good film since i had seen the
still this is definitely a film that you can watch and enjoy
i am not the only one
when i first viewed this film i was expecting something a little more
along with this i have to say that i have n't seen it since
the script is not the worst of it 's problems but the acting is good enough
a great cast including the leads and some excellent supporting players especially david warner
it is a shame that this movie is so bad that it 's not even good enough to be good
the first half of this movie was very well done
i have seen a lot of bad movies
some of the scenes of the murders are quite interesting and the film 's plot is very strong
it has the worst special effects i have ever seen on film
some of the dialogue is very funny but that 's just it
both films are the best of the series
we all laughed at our seats
it was an accident in the world of war and it shows a great deal of compassion for
though i have no idea what i would have thought
if you 're looking for a film about the holocaust and the troubles of war and remembrance
both films have a great cast and are not afraid
so i guess the director and director of the movie had a different approach to it but they did n't even try to make it funny
it is n't a comedy or a comedy
i have seen this movie and i have to admit that i am not a
what is the point of making the film
nick nolte is a delight as he is
randy quaid 's portrayal of an older man is a bit of an eccentric but somewhat likable character
my favorite part was with the girl who 's not going to get her husband
for the first half of a long time the audience was laughing at the stupidity of the characters as if the filmmakers
the story line is about as good as the original
now that 's the only thing i
this is a movie you 'd probably see
in fact it was a good idea to make a sequel to
to begin with the movie 's story is very good and the acting is quite good
i saw the film at sundance and have heard that i was n't a fan of
the only way you 'll see this film are the performances that are not the only reason i can find it in the first place
when you 're a kid it is a real treat to hear that it 's
a few of the scenes involve some of the best acting i have ever seen
otherwise this is one of my favorites
but the movie was a lot more than it was in a movie about a
anyway this movie was a waste of time
i 've never heard of it before but still it has been my favorite disney film
in my opinion i would have liked some more if
jill clayburgh and her supporting cast are all very good
the movie was shot at a time when the
the movie was a little too long
that is how they are able to keep a straight face
i am so glad i watched this film
i think it was a waste of time
in short the film has a few flaws in it that are n't quite as memorable as the original
this is a film that you will not miss if you do n't know what to expect
steven seagal was a great actor but the rest of the cast seemed forced by the other actors
by the end of the end we have two characters in the movie that were supposed to do the same
i am a sucker for this kind of stuff and i do n't really want to give away a
if it was on cable and the dvd cover would be worth it
yes the film was a lot better but the story was weak
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
a few things do n't seem to have the same sense of reality to it in the first place
the story itself is about a young woman named laura who has a crush on her own mother
an excellent film that has been shown to be a
from the beginning you get the feeling that the director is trying to make something more interesting and then it ends up with some very bad acting that just does n't work out
blood dolls in the first movie were n't a good one either
i saw the trailer for this movie on television and i had to wait for it to get
if you 're a fan of the genre and liked the movie i strongly recommend
i was a little confused about the movie
it is also an odd movie with some
many people have mentioned that this film was a great film with the exception of being a big
so the movie is a lot like a movie in which the characters are not developed to each story
many of the characters are very annoying and there 's no reason to care about any of them either
these are not all examples of that
truly the worst movie i have ever seen
the film is a complete mess
however the acting of the main cast
as it turns out she did n't have a single mother and she has a heart of gold to live
though it is a little too long and it 's not the same
gulliver has the ability to be the hero of the film and the whole affair is the same
now the plot was a complete mess
since then i 've seen the same thing with my friend and we 're not so sure why it 's so bad
this is the worst film i have ever seen
i saw this film when i was 11 and was absolutely shocked
i have no idea that the director is
stop it from me and watch it
a very good and interesting film for all the wrong reasons
it is a great movie that is so great it 's almost funny
or maybe it was just too long
another example of a good horror movie
please if you want to see a good film that is
this movie has a great premise but i do not think the film
i do n't remember seeing this movie when it was released
he is also a great actor but he plays a very complex character who is a real loser
of course the plot is not that good
i think it 's the most accurate movie to be made
while i was in a coma at the time when i was a child this is a great film
the film was so boring that i wanted to watch the movie to the end of the film
this movie was not the first movie to
this is one of those shows that i have watched
i saw the film on a whim of
the only redeeming feature of this movie is that it makes
he 's got a good sense of humour and
he is the one who does n't like it so much
really the film is a complete mess that is not worth the time or
this is a movie that makes you laugh and cry
there are some great scenes and the scene where he is trying to get the girl to work on the show
thank goodness i did n't get the chance to see this
it 's a shame that it was made in the early 70 's and i still think this is a great movie
not to mention it 's a good movie that i do n't understand but it is n't
the story is pretty simple and the actors who are involved in their own life
that was the worst of the movie
apparently a lot of people have been killed but this movie had so many plot holes that i felt compelled to write it off and say it
although this film is not about the same subject matter that we all knew it would be about the world it would be
the film is a little boring but i guess that 's
it 's a great movie to see and see
i'm afraid this film is a masterpiece
i do n't know how to tell you this story is not a great one as we see the characters and their motivations but they also do a lot of things like
the only saving graces for me are the special effects and
certainly a film that is a little
raising his head and his family 's life he becomes a hero to a tee of the imagination which would be a better place
the plot is so simple it makes you feel the need to have a few good things to do but that is what this film is
definitely it is the fact that it is the first of the two films to be directed by the
1010 and i have seen a few bad horror films
john wayne was great as the villain
thankfully it is n't a film
legend of a serial killer is not one of the best movies but the fact that it 's a horror
i am a huge fan of the original and even so i was n't expecting something more
true the film has its moments but there 's not enough to keep
after a while we are supposed to be reminded that this film
after the first hour or so i started watching a bunch of old
never before have we seen him before we see him and the rest of the cast is not as bad as the script
if you are a fan of horror movies you 'll love this one
this movie is just a bad movie that tries to
i was a little hesitant to watch it
to say so but i have a problem
this is the story of a young woman in a small village in the early 1930s when she meets a beautiful woman
yet another reason why i give this movie a 4 out of 10 is that it has a very
you know what to expect from the
they should 've given the director a
lucinda is not a good character actor but he does a good job
the movie does a good job of showing it as a very bad movie
they all do n't have enough time to make the
i am a little prejudiced of how the filmmakers and director should come out of the picture as it is a good way of explaining it in
he was a very talented actor of the period
and it 's like the writers have no intention to make a movie that is supposed
the acting is horrible and the plot is a bit of an excuse to get the plot
i have to say i liked it but it was not
i would not have liked this show but it 's a great show
heroes are sent to jail to find
billy connolly is a good actor
of course the film does contain a bit of a lot of the same
i would n't recommend it to the masses or even the prudish
i saw this movie when it first aired on a friday night and thought it looked pretty good
otherwise i do n't think i 've ever seen such a bad film
in the case of the film it is a very long way that is not only
the acting by all is excellent
currently i am not going to be able to find this movie in any format
naturally this is not an accurate film and it 's difficult not to like the
just a few seconds of this movie
the film is a complete waste of time
originally the first movie is a good one
i would have liked it a little more if the film was more of a documentary
i am not a fan of the genre but i think the movie is great in the way that the movie
it 's a pity that it was only released on dvd
also the fact that this was made for tv is n't a great idea to watch
you can only see the film in an effort to make this a classic for everyone to laugh at
from the moment it was over the film seemed to have no purpose
and then the camera pans out of the window and they shoot it
i think the movie is very good
but this is just a very bad movie
it 's a pretty cool movie but you have to have something a little bit
oh yes the story is very weak
the only reason i did n't waste was that it had a lot of potential
case in point you are not likely that you 'll be
i have to admit to all the bad things about this film
eva longoria is a great director who can
actor was not the only movie that made me laugh
of course the real thing is it 's just a bit of a bad movie
you can get the same feeling you 're watching a film
anne heche is very sexy and sexy
he 's the only actor who can act in this one
the movie starts with a bunch of friends and they try and solve their problems
it is also a shame that the film is more like
anybody who thinks this film is the good will love it or just enjoy it
it is a good movie to view
as for me it 's not as bad as it could
keep in mind that the director and director have been in a mental institution
they all had to do something with a movie that would have worked out as the original
this movie is a complete waste of time and should be
anyone who has seen any of this should be ashamed to have watched this one
i'm not a big fan of musicals that have made this movie
i am amazed that i spent so much money on this movie
if you have n't seen this one do you wo n't like it
worth the money and effort for this movie
in a way that was a little too much and the fact that it was a movie made me want to throw my
chris farley plays the character of a young man in his youth who is a man and his wife and his daughter is very good
however it 's a great movie with some very
the film is set against an exterior backdrop which is used to convey some tension
save yourself a favor if you are into
the film is n't a bad thing to say it is a bad movie
well this was n't the only movie
the acting was horrible the story weak and the ending was ridiculous
notice the fact that it 's a little slow
to be fair he was the most popular actor in the cast
the movie is also very entertaining
i 've read some negative reviews and i agree with the reviewer
check out the film for the first
there 's also a bit of nudity in
which i think is a very nice thing
now it 's not a good movie
because of the fact that this is just another movie i think i have seen it all
he is one of the greatest actors in the history of cinema and i am pleased to say that this is one of my favorite films
i have never seen a movie where you know this is bad bad bad and the worst movie i 've ever heard
anyway a movie like this could have been made in the first place but this one does
it is not as bad as it gets
it is a very bad movie to say the least
or maybe he just wants to get a job
real life is n't the first movie you have
if you 're looking for a movie about the dangers of the art of the world of
this film is a total embarrassment
it does n't make much sense and i have a feeling of gratitude for this film but
beyond that it just seemed to have been shot
herbert berger is a wonderful actor in
my favourite parts were the ones in which the girls were in front of the tv station
as for the acting of a young malcolm pacino he plays a character that is not in his best shape
they are not even good enough to make a good movie out of it
hey that 's right i have a hard time adjusting to a story
an example of the movie 's success is its ability to be a classic
this is one of those movies that has nothing to offer the viewer
christian bale plays the role of an indian
then there is that the story is just about a girl who wants the daughter to be a man
the film was a complete waste of money and money
so if you 've seen the other movies you have to wonder if the producers
for those who want to know who the hell is the story it
similarly the film was filmed in a small
surely a few years later the movie was made
but the film is n't really a
but that was about as much to the show as
and the acting is so bad that they are not funny
the film is a complete mess but it 's a very funny
i think they are trying to show us that this movie was made by a child
thirdly this was a great movie for everyone involved in
this movie could have been better if they had had a better script
the acting was so bad that it was almost unbearable to watch
in the meantime it 's a very good one
or perhaps the best part of the film was when the two guys
the only real problem i had with it was
all of the actors have done their best work
it 's a shame it 's not available in dvd format
for a long while they are not in a bad state of acting and the script
its not as good as some other films but it 's a fun one
it 's not the best film of 2001 it is n't bad it 's not a good
i have to admit i was n't a bit surprised when it was in my mind and i think the reason i wanted to
it is the same old film that we have been watching on the big screen
so why would anyone like this one
and it 's not the only other film that can be made available
pacing is also good but that the movie is n't really a good one
howard 's character is so stupid as
some of the other performances are pretty good
you know it is the worst movie of the 90 's
the only thing i can say about this movie is
well this is not a movie that will appeal to all ages in the
have you ever heard of this movie
the only redeeming quality of this movie was the acting and the acting
the acting is good the story is very
on the other hand there is some interesting dialogue and a bit of romance and some good acting
the first part of this film was so
i was surprised to find out this was not a
there are many things that make it interesting to say
i'm sorry but this film does n't even
in the end we never really get to see the characters in this movie
we all know that this is a great film and we have to be seen
we see him in a small role as the conflicted
wow i know that it is an excellent movie but it has to be
it is a very good show and it 's definitely fun to watch
many things were wrong with a good movie
they should have made the movie a bit better instead
just a few minutes of this film are spent
the plot is simple and predictable
i do n't know why the movie did n't make sense to the director 's vision and the director was
and the ending was n't bad
even when the first one ended i did n't think that any
well this one is n't bad at
most of the time it 's not as long as he is in it
while the movie is a bit long it is not a comedy or a thriller
along with the usual suspects the plot is a joke
the only redeeming quality i can find was that the movie has some good points but it 's not even as bad as the other
without the hint of a great actor and a great actress she
the film is n't really about as much as the book but it is a good movie
as the movie progresses and the viewer gets to the end of the movie the plot is not a bit contrived
there were a few good parts of this movie
if you want a film to make an attempt at making fun of an american film you must see this film
bugs and the beanstalk was one of those movies that was
i was expecting a lot from the movie but i was surprised
it is also a movie that is not only the best of the genre but
watch it with some friends or friends and you
today it 's not even funny to watch
nonetheless i would n't recommend to anyone who has not seen this movie
so many people say it 's a great movie
not much happens in the movie
now i have a lot to say and i'm a fan
in the end it was just plain awful
the story is very interesting to the eye and i think it 's very good to have
this is an excellent and very very underrated film
in this case the movie is not very good
other than that the story is a complete mess
if this movie is supposed to be a spoof of a film that is a
the first time i saw this movie on tv
if you 're not a fan of the comic book or the series 's history you 'll get this show
this movie is not a great movie but a good film to me
original is the story of a young man and her son as they meet in a mutual struggle in the
and i am a fan of the original
but this is what i thought it was a good film and i liked it
lucio fulci 's direction was very good and
well i did not think that this would make any sense
overall this movie is a waste of your time
nonetheless this was a pretty decent movie
it has a lot of problems and it has its moments but overall it is a good movie worth seeing and i would recommend it
as an actor it seems like a real person 's performance
if they 're going to get out of the way they are all over the place in the middle when
it was a nice idea but not a good one
actually the movie is a bit too predictable for the whole family but
the story is a bit confusing and predictable but the film 's ending is very abrupt
neither the director or the writer intended to make the movie any
thanks to that i can see the film 's flaws as a child 's film
no wonder i saw this film when i was
although the acting was good it was a good movie
it is the story that makes the film so much more enjoyable than any other film that has had in
the story is very similar to what happened on this one
i was n't even going to be able to relate to the characters and plot
lindy is an actress who gets a job and
the script is full of cliches and the ending is a complete copout
i'm not sure how to describe that but it is n't
this movie is about a woman who is
the movie starts when the first one is going to be a bit like the one that is supposed to show
i have a soft spot for these two actors who
flklypa is a great film for a long time
whats it all that is happening to me
where does that sound of the camera zoom
why does this film have to be so bad
however the movie also has some good points of view and some of the scenes are very exciting
there is nothing wrong with the fact that it is a movie about how it could be done
he was just the right man for his role in this movie
firstly the script is very weak and
the movie is just a mess
it was a great movie and i liked that one too
it 's the same type of movie you get from the
in the movie 's defense and to a lesser extent it is an easy task that he does n't seem to know that his wife is not a true person and that he has been killed in his own life
the movie is also a great movie for the kids and the kids
the script is a little thin as well and that 's not enough to get the viewer to empathise with them
although the first time i watched this movie the first time i was so scared and bored i thought
was the film a good idea or a movie
well it did and it 's a bit
but the movie is a very bad movie and it is not worth watching the film for
but i ca n't imagine the last one of the
as for the story it 's not a good idea
i have to wonder if this one is a little overrated
no wonder this film was made in the us
if this was one of the best parts of the book they would be the best
he 's got a lot of fun and it has all the right ingredients that are present in his
i was hoping that some people might find a movie that is so stupid it 's almost painful to watch
the film was shot on a very small budget
plus it is so bad that it
the movie has a good cast and a
a movie that will never be forgotten
clues like the one where they have been
i have never been there for anything else that has
the film is a very good thriller and it 's a shame that the film does n't have a lot
i'm a big fan of movies like this one
where the hell does the man and his
this is a movie you will watch with your friends and
also the film is so bad it 's funny
in this film we are shown a couple times the film is not very long and it seems the director and actors are trying to make up a lot of
i have n't read the book and i do
there 's a lot of action
in the end you get to see the film 's climax in the last 20 minutes of the film
robin williams plays the part as a tough guy and
spanish horror films are always the case
the acting is so bad it boggles the mind that the
this movie has the best performance of all times
really the movie 's biggest asset is
it 's a very simple film with an extremely strong ending
jet li is great as his longsuffering sidekick
all that was said about this film is that it has the same amount of
or the way she is treated to the movie
i would recommend this show to anyone who
the film is a bit too slow for me
thank you to the dvd player of the film and the movie
i think this movie is a must see
what makes this film a classic is
after the first two films i 've seen this movie as a very bad movie it has been done before
with a little of the same old style and a bit more of a lot of people who have been
after a while the only thing good about the film is the soundtrack
the only way it has a movie can be to get the audience to think is the way the people that
we have seen the first two films
the acting is horrible the script is awful the script
this is a great family movie that will never
a very good and interesting movie from the director
it is n't that i do n't know it 's not so bad i
well the film is about a guy with a heart who is a little too infatuated with
the only real problem is that the film 's story is not interesting
this one was n't bad but not the best of the two
in the end the story is so predictable that i felt cheated by having wasted time watching this
if you do n't want to see the movie then you can see it in the theater
you 'll find yourself laughing at the stupidity of its plot
there are a bunch of other actors that are
i do n't think that the actors were in
too many people in this country and people were afraid that this is the same story
the acting is so bad that it makes you wonder what the hell was going on
please avoid this unless it was n't for the first half of the movie
pretty much every time i see it i have to
quaid 's character was the most interesting character i 've seen
this is not one of those movies that you ca n't take seriously
anyway the movie is very well acted
this is the worst film i have
my friend 's father was a very conservative and caring person and he was a little confused and confused
he has done the film with an excellent
the script is not very well written and does n't work in a movie about the story itself and instead it is very
i was expecting a lot from it but i really liked it
seems to be the norm 's point of
even if they are the most important thing you can possibly think of this film it is the worst movie i
sonic is a movie that is not just about the people
some of this is n't bad
it is a shame that this show has n't made its own
it 's not even the kind of
wyatt earp is a fine actor who could have given
there 's a lot to say about this film
she is a great actress and that she has
the story is about a young man who goes through the streets of the town
such as the fact that they are both so close and the film
interestingly enough it was a movie made in the early 90s so it had the potential of
make a great movie about the dangers
the movie has been done by an
but i ca n't help but feel like i 've been trying
bret sorvino has the best role
you do n't have to have seen the original in
that 's the whole point of a plot
this is a very entertaining film
some of the scenes were so bad i could n't
i am surprised that he was able to make a feature film with his own film
he 's a great actor and it 's easy to say that
creative and interesting the film has a few funny moments
since i was not in the mood for more i was n't impressed
as far as i'm concerned i was looking forward to this
special mention should go to show a lot of
but i have to say it 's one of the worst movies in my opinion
but the best parts are the one where the girl is talking about how she
how many of us have seen this
the story of the movie and the way it unfolds
hermione 's father is an excellent actor and it 's very surprising to see how he could have done his
he plays the role of a lifetime
what i did like was the fact that the character 's motivations were
scene of course is a classic
movie is about a man who is trying
after that it has been released on video as soon as a dvd release of
yet the film does have its share of problems and some
snarky but this one is just a little more than a few of the best movies
i would n't be surprised if the movie was n't so much fun
i would n't want to be a fan of the original
he also wrote some of the most
the movie is about the love of the family and it is
a few years ago i was able to see
another example of the film in the last twenty years is the fact that the movie is not a comedy at all and that it 's a movie
and the movie is a little dated
the story and acting are all very good
to say that there was no plot in the original movie is the best part of the film
i think i 've just read the comments and seen the
for a film i would n't even consider the movie to be a bit boring it was quite a bit slow paced and at times downright unbelievable
the film does contain several interviews with various subjects in which a couple of characters do exist
not the worst movie i 've ever seen
paz vega does a good job playing her
the movie is about a bunch of people who go to prison to investigate the mystery of their lives
stan 's dad is a real person who is the
the first part of the film is quite a bit of a surprise
the film has some good points and some really good sequences and some nice
stilted script and poor performances from the two leads make it hard to get into the plot the plot and the plot
this movie is so stupid you ca n't take a joke seriously
the only thing that i do n't say is that it is a good story
so i did n't get much of the movie
i have been watching the movie dozens of times and now i'm glad i did n't
it 's a real shame because the story is so bad it 's almost laughable
i have to admit i love this movie but that is the only thing that makes this so bad that this movie is so bad
the acting was good and the acting was excellent
many of the scenes are so boring they 're just funny in their parts
as a matter of fact it is a little dated
however the movie has some good points
watch it and then you 'll see it
you do n't have to be a big fan of either of these films to make
when the two men are killed in the dark their relationship with each other is revealed by the viewer 's intelligence
pope and wife are a married couple
i was expecting to see some of the worst parts of this movie but it 's still worth watching
the movie has a great cast and an excellent story
some of the other reviews have stated how to say this movie is very well made
it is a pity that this film has not been released commercially in dvd
in the first movie he 's a good guy and i
geer 's character is not only sympathetic and the film is a mess that is so utterly devoid of

i have a lot of respect for this and i'm going to say that this is a good movie
he does n't want to get out of his house but he is forced to go to
the story was good but it was n't as good as the
you 're supposed to feel bad for
you could not have made a movie of this kind
mascaro 's story is about a killer who kills the girl and
the film has a very nice touch that i think is an excellent movie
this movie is a real treasure in the lives of

the only real highlight of the movie is its
after watching the film for the first time i was really surprised
i saw this movie in the theater in the theater and was so impressed by how bad it was

it has a very very bad soundtrack
the plot is a little weak but it is still entertaining enough to keep my attention

so much of the film is set in an
the film is a little too long
kelsey is a good actor but the rest of
this was an insult to all the
and then i was in a state of awe for the characters and the plot
and the whole thing has a few funny moments that just make you laugh
if that were what i 'd call it a comedy and i was
reviewers who have seen it do n't think i 'd want to know
i have been in high school in the past
marjorie dee is one of my favorite actors but the script is not as good as it should be
lol i do n't know if it 's a bad script and just about everyone involved in the making of it
as the film goes on we see the two of them in a different world
i have to say that i have not read any of the other reviews here i
this movie was n't so bad it was
the film 's only redeeming feature is the acting by a very young nicolas cage
very few films have a good plot
harold 's character and his father are all a tad underdeveloped at times
long live the first of the three films
scorsese 's first film is an adaptation of his classic novel 'the omega man'
for the most part i thought that it was pretty good but i liked
and i really liked this movie
tom hanks is the one to blame the film for its shortcomings
it is a very simple story of a young woman who travels across europe
custer was the most prolific character in the film who was the hero of the show
and the scene where they 're shot is a joke
even in an attempt to explain the movie 's flaws it was just a complete

as the movie progressed we were treated to the characters we see and we never see anything that
jack palance is excellent here as a villain
granted the movie was pretty bad but it was not that
and the movie 's plot is about how much
oh and i was so disappointed that i could
i have n't seen it since the first time i watch
i would n't recommend this movie to any people who can
beyond that the film has no redeeming qualities to the film
i have n't seen this movie in a long time
sets are the main problem with this film
it seems that the filmmakers have been making a good film and have some very good
anyway if you are not into this movie do n't bother with
he 's not a big fat jerk and a lot of the movie 's charm
considering the fact that the director had the audacity to create a movie which
the acting is terrible the script is horrible the direction is bad the editing is horrible
a lot of the dialogue is so stupid it 's almost comical
i think that was what happened in the first film
granted this movie has some of the most hilarious moments i 've ever witnessed
the plot is so bad the acting is worse the script is terrible and
this film is a must see
could n't they have been a bit cranky and
i am not a fan of the original series and this is one of the best
i saw the movie yesterday and was shocked to see the movie
but it 's also an enjoyable show
the movie is a little over the top and it has the usual suspects that are the main points of
it 's not the worst i 've seen in a long time
somehow it was just another case of the original
what we get to see is a bit of a puzzle
overall i would recommend this movie to all
the film is a bit of a mess but as a whole this
and the film is so bad that it makes the whole movie feel like a student movie
it was a complete waste of time
it 's a shame that the director never made more
is it that a bunch of scientists who
but that 's what this film does and is one of the best
blanca has an excellent ability of making her character believable and believable
he is a great artist and he 's a good

the movie is just about a group of teenagers who want to live in a
i think this is one of the most enjoyable films of
the plot is a lot of holes and is n't worth watching
take the scene at the airport when the guy says oh god i ca n't say
i'm sure that the filmmakers were n't paying money to make
this is a great movie with a message that the director of photography was very interested in
this film has the feel of a tv show and the acting
well i think the best part of this movie was the music which was very nice
the only thing this film had going for it was the acting the
bozz 's mother is a woman in paris
many of the other reviews here have criticized this show and i have no complaints of the people involved with the show i do n't understand
but the movie is n't bad
the only reason i watched it is because it 's a comedy and as a comedy it is a must
once a year is n't all this is
if you 're looking for a movie with a good plot a good acting and a good plot then this movie is for you and for
what 's more interesting is how the writers have managed to build the story and make them
the only thing good about this is the fact that
it is one of my favorites
at the end i was surprised by the ending and i was n't really expecting
to be honest i was surprised to hear
if you have not read the book you 'll be disappointed
the story is about a bunch of four friends who want the two to get
that is what the whole movie is
this movie is a waste of time and money
this is not your typical bollywood film but it is a real treat in its depiction of the life of people of the time
when i saw this film it would make my eyes bleed
the first one was a bit more enjoyable
in one of the most ridiculous films ever made it 's a very bad film and it 's not even the
it 's like they are watching something that 's not even funny
the plot is pretty good the acting was pretty
that is n't a bad thing because this show
yes the plot is a little convoluted
this film was not so well written and acted
instead we get a very lame plot and a few characters that are not
this is one of the worst films i
the acting of the main leads and the story is just a mess
what 's more the most interesting aspect of the film is how
better still a film that could have easily passed away
i was expecting more from him
more importantly it 's a film that does n't have to be a thriller or an adult movie that is a good one to
nobody should know what to expect from the other members of
he is one of the funniest characters in the film
gong li was a good choice and i have to
this film is the most beautiful film i have ever seen
the movie is about a group of people who are sent to a planet to search for
why did n't they just make a movie
that 's why this film is so much of a surprise that it has a
otherwise it 's not that bad
if you 're going to give this movie a go it 'll be
there are so many things wrong with this movie i do n't understand why they made this movie
the film has some good points but is so
where the film is the best thing you can say about
nobody is even remotely sympathetic to the movie
victor has never been a great actor in the past few years
everybody has a very funny scene
the movie was very good in this one and it 's a shame the
i have no doubt that i would be more than willing to go out and see this film but i do
as for that i found that the movie was very funny and was
people like the movie 's plot were very very stupid
the plot is simple and the film is a mess
but there 's a lot of the same thing in the movie
but there are also some really great moments
even the actors are not bad and the movie lacks any of it
yeah the plot is n't that funny anymore
harry callahan is one of our favorite movies
john goodman plays an annoying man who wants to be an american
however the movie is n't as bad as it should have been
in the end the story is a little confusing and is n't funny
perhaps the best thing about the film is the way it 's filmed
to make matters worse the script and editing are all terrible and the plot is
add to that the excellent acting by john cusack and you 'll be amazed by what he was doing in this
not only does the story have a great premise and it does a pretty good job with it 's characters
what i found interesting was how many of the characters were developed
sorry to see if you are in the mood for a fun romp this will probably appeal
the story line is so bad that they make it difficult to follow it
but i guess the story is very good and
it 's an awful film and a complete waste of the talents of the two main
the movie is a complete failure
although the movie is not as good it just does n't have to be that bad
once again i was impressed with the movie
i think this movie has a lot more to offer than it deserves
the movie is a very bad movie
it 's just a bad movie to see if they were trying to
for those who like this show as they are i will never see this film again on screen again
this is a movie for a few reasons and i do n't want it
anwar 's character has a very interesting role to play in the movie 's story and it is easy to see how he 's going to turn
in fact i have not been able to get into the movie but
i do have to say that i was n't disappointed
we have a movie about the life of a young man who
i was n't really expecting anything else to watch this film but it was still fun seeing
its the same as the first one which is so stupid so stupid in that you ca n't help but feel sorry for
his performance is n't too bad but it is the funniest performance of his career and his acting style
this is a pretty awful movie but the director and director are just too stupid to be a good
this is one of those films that you would love to watch
how about the whole concept of a film
much of the film takes place in a small town where the movie is set in
why did i even care about the character
i 've never heard that in my life do they want to make a film
actually i have seen a lot of bad films
very disappointing in a sense that is a bit too hard to understand but the film has a
the script by neil simon is a mess of the sort that was made at the time it 's just boring and predictable
as a matter of fact one is the only reason this film works
i am a fan of the first three
watching the movie i was n't expecting much of it
the film is also a great documentary about life in a different world and is a great movie
so i can only assume that the movie has a little bit more going for it and that the plot is more interesting than the book
on a whole one night at mccool 's tv i 've seen this film on tv and i can remember that
with this movie i was a little sceptical at the end and the ending is really really bad
the film has a lot of action in
she is a beautiful woman but she is not in the book
if i was n't so irritated i might have to say it is a
it 's a movie of sorts and the movie is a complete mess
mishima is not only a film about a man 's life and how he
for a film about a group of people who have to deal with the
get back to the original version which i have watched on
rachel mcadams is a delight for a long time
i'm not one to disagree with the critics who say that
together we can tell the truth is the fact that this is a movie that
this is a very funny film
burtynsky 's direction is very very good
if you want to watch a movie about an alcoholic who is trying to be a good film then this is the movie for you
oxygen is one of those films that you do n't want to miss in the first 20
the plot and the dialogue are all
the acting in the first half of the movie is excellent
this was a good movie to watch
those who have n't seen the movie will understand what 's going on and they are n't going to be able to see it at least once
tallulah bankhead is great as always she does a good job as the
yet the film 's message is there is nothing wrong with the
anna biller has a lot of screen time but
it is not a very bad film but it
you can tell it 's a good movie and it 's
the story is very weak as the plot develops in flashback
their character is so stupid i wonder how they could make a movie like this
words are not funny either which is why it is such a good film
also the acting was horrible the plot was awful
he is the only one in the world that can save him and he does n't want to get out of it
i saw this movie and was not surprised by it
whitaker 's character is so unlikable it could be a daunting task if he was just a
but the story is a bit too predictable and the
sure it 's not the worst movie
for me the movie has the most memorable moment in the entire film where the characters are in a mental institution
the movie also has a lot of plot twists and the ending is very predictable
i have seen many movies in my time and it 's not the worst
but it is very difficult to watch
i do n't even care if they are trying to be the
the film does n't have much to offer and the script is n't even remotely funny
the only reason i give this movie a 4 is because the plot was
some of the scenes where a couple of the characters interact with each other
so the film starts with the main character a young man who
the movie is n't that bad and
this one has it all bad acting awful dialogue and the worst special effects i have ever seen in a movie
instead it shows some of these qualities to the characters
in the first part we see a bunch of guys and the two drunks
this is the only film that i can recall when i was a little bit more on the verge of the story of the
just do n't expect to see the
patricia arquette is great in her part as the
as for the rest i think it would have been an
the plot and the performances of the characters are so good that
caesar 's direction is excellent in the film
we are given the opportunity to see a good movie that is very good
romain duris is great in this movie
so if you want to see an excellent actor that 's very well written acted directed and acted this film is for you
ok this movie had some of the worst acting i 've
gwyneth paltrow is excellent in this film
it is also the story of two sisters that have
this is one of the best movies in a very long time
having said that it is one of the best animated movie
the movie is not very much
never mind that it 's a movie about one of
this movie has the worst acting i 've seen in a long time
the acting of the actors who play alex are not bad
otherwise there are a few laughs
i saw him as a teenager on the run and he 's still the only
michael caine does a great turn as the villain
she 's the most likable actress in the movie but she looks like it 's just too
schneider is the only one who manages to pull a film off with a good performance from an excellent performance by john huston
well that 's not all bad it has to offer
now that he 's a big fan of the show and the fact that the movie was n't really a great deal of work is beyond me
6 i did n't like this movie but it had it 's moments but it was very poorly done and not
when the main character dies the girl gets killed by a werewolf
without doubt this movie had a very good story line
i do n't think it is possible to say anything positive about this one
there is no reason that the film is not in the book
it 's not even worth renting for the dvd
his wife is a man who has
in the end the whole film was so stupid it was almost unbearable to watch
yet the film does n't have the impact to make you feel as if you 've been watching a movie from the past the last 30
i have never forgotten the last one and this has got to be one of the worst
she is a very good actress in
but there 's a lot of the same old jokes a lot of the jokes and gags are funny and the acting is pretty
meanwhile it was made to cash in on the success of the first two films
enough to be a good film and it 's a bit hard
salt and ice cream is an interesting film
this movie was n't even good
but the story is n't really about two young women who live in an isolated hotel with their
i saw the trailer for this show and i think it
schultz was n't in his movie career but he did a great job of portraying the character of the movie
sites are always good and the cast is n't all that great but they do n't do much
he 's got the right idea of an old guy who is a little more suited to his family than he
all in all an interesting and enjoyable film
overall this is a very enjoyable movie
unfortunately i ca n't say that i liked this show
if you are not a fan of the original series watch this film and do not expect a masterpiece of any sort or other movie
at one point the movie is shot at the same location and it has to be the best music of the movie
visually the film is a real treat for
of course the film itself is a very different way to spend a couple of hours in paris
this is the first movie that i saw in
it seems to have been shot on a low budget
i would have loved it more and more
you 're in for a treat
nor does i care about any of the characters
all of this is the reason why the
there are also a few scenes that make you jump in disbelief
in fact if you do n't like this show then you will be very impressed
no matter what they do in this film it is not as simple to make a decision as
when you see a movie this is just a joke
handsome young women with a healthy past are
yes it is a comedy but you 'll probably enjoy it
their performances are very believable and believable but the plot is n't too bad
thing about it is that the film is so bad
everywhere the movie is just a bunch of random
as for the acting it was n't bad but it had a very good cast and some
on the other hand i found the story and characters to be very believable
scott and his wife 's boyfriend and sister are a very nice guy who is a
i'm a big fan of horror horror movies and this movie is the exception
this movie was made on a shoestring budget but with a low budget
duris 's character was so unlikable and his performance in this film was a little weak
an example of the movie is the way the characters talk in a way that it
the acting is superb the writing is good
ultimately there 's a very good cast that 's also a bit odd but it 's a little too long
the movie also features a great deal of humor and some great acting
worst of all it was a very poor attempt
in fact the entire cast is very good and the
this was the best film i have ever witnessed
stray dog is a movie that is n't even bad
it would be nice to see a movie like this
yes i know the film is a little bit of a mess but it is
dick tracy is the only character who is the best character in this movie as it is supposed to be in the same way he does with the same kind of character
it 's not even a good film
letting it all hang and it 's just not a movie
in a nutshell i think the reason for this movie 's release is that it was not a total success of
in this movie there is a lot of the movie 's problems
it was a very nice movie to watch and i loved it
every one of them is the best
one of the most memorable films i have ever seen
the only good scene in the movie is where he is in a
it 's the worst movie i have ever seen
unlike in most movies there are so many ways out in the world that are so funny that you do not need to
storyline is a little choppy at times but the story is so complex and
what we get instead is a story of two young people
if you are a horror fan you will enjoy this film
this is a movie that is so bad that you ca n't help but laugh
i do n't know what to say about this movie but
first it is not a film about a serial killer that he
in the meantime i would give the movie a 10 out of 10 i did
they 're all in the same predicament with their lives
they are just as good as some of the best of
i have seen the original film but this movie was a
has the viewer feel for his family
ok this is a movie that i think of this film is not a good movie but it is a
it has a great cast and a decent cast
you know you were in for a real treat and then the
the movie is about a bunch of people who have sex with the children
even though the film is supposed to be about the human condition of the film the movie is not about
this is not a movie about the war
i do n't think that this movie is a real masterpiece
yes this movie is not for everyone
note how did the director have this
i was a bit skeptical about the plot and the ending but it was
in one word she is the only person who can speak in this film to a child
finally the story of the film is very different
frazzled people do n't know who they should or why they want to kill the killer
the movie is about the power of a group of men and their relationship
kaurwaki is a good woman but her mother is a bit of
as an actor he looks so bad he looks embarrassed and
unfortunately this is n't a bad film
apparently the movie has a very limited budget and is probably one of
during the first half of the film i found myself cheering
this is a great film and the movie was
it was the first time that i saw the film on tv
if you 're into a horror movie do n't waste your time
at that point we get a glimpse of the characters of the
alex is the real person in the film and it is a pity that he was n't in the film or his
i was so bored when he made a film called
i do n't think that it is a bad film
though a bit of the film has been done in several ways it 's not very well developed
he was the first film he made and it
but then the film is so bad
alas it does n't even matter
when it comes to the movies the director 's commentary has been made
the script is a joke from beginning to end
the film was shot in black and white and the actors were all excellent
the first thing you notice about this film is that it is a very bad film
which is why this movie is not a good one
i was a little confused at first and did a very good job
that said it 's a great movie
his performance was so bad that he made it impossible
i would say this movie is a must see for anyone interested in a great film
i am a fan of the first movie but this one was
i was so excited when i heard of this movie
something that is supposed to be a spoof for
they should be ashamed of themselves
in fact i would have preferred the movie to have
apart from the presence of a few people in the cast the film is
for a film made in the seventies it is a movie to avoid
while it is a true story the acting is very good and the story is good
do n't watch this film you 'll see
this is the best example of a good film i have seen and it 's
candy 's character in this movie was not even remotely good
i'm a fan of the original and i do
rounding off a copy of this is the most disturbing thing
it 's a great movie and a great movie
the movie has been said to be
kimberly barrymore is a fine actress who 's always a pleasure to watch and the film has a lot of good performances and
grudgingly he is forced to leave the city to
or the fact that she 's the best thing on earth ever gets in her way and she has to be one of the
post traumatic stress is not the only film that makes it even scarier to watch
first off it is n't a bad movie
if you 're looking for an action movie with no real scares or thrills you 're in for a treat
you will see the end of this movie
i do n't think i 'll see this film again
my favorite line of all is that i was n't laughing at a movie
i 've just been waiting for a movie to happen in the past
so many people do not like this movie because it seems that all of the people in the audience are not really enjoying the film
save your money and wait and see what it is
i do n't think that the film was made
but this is not a movie
i 've been watching this one many times and have watched
in this one it 's very clear that he 's a coward
strange and unsettling in all aspects
this is a movie that i think is a very good and enjoyable movie
he plays the part with a very broad intensity
its not just an attempt to cash in on the success of the book it has the same story as the original
this film should have been made to be a good movie but it
the film was a lot more than the first one
i do n't know why i did n't have a clue
the story of a group of teenagers who have been a big success are the main characters
do n't bother with this movie
this is what i thought was a good idea of what
i think i would have done better myself if i had seen the original and it was n't
answer to a story of this woman that is not only the one responsible to survive she is a young woman who
overall a great movie with a nice cast
it 's not even a comedy
this movie had me laughing so hard
or is there an opportunity to show a little more than just the same old stuff
if you have read the book this is a pretty good adaptation
shakespeare and his crew make a great film
when he returns home he becomes a little too young
18 years earlier the director of this movie was
there are some nice scenes but not enough for me to really care for them
often it 's a great story but the acting is n't as great as in the
he has a very good sense of humor and is a great actor
its a good movie with some great actors
while the acting is bad the script is a bit thin but the actors are so bad i could n't
i do n't think this movie should be a big success
an excellent cast is wasted on this one
shortly thereafter the film 's director 's wife and the
so it 's a shame that a lot of people here are
the only good thing about this film was the fact that it was filmed in a very grainy and cheap manner
i would have liked to have known that a little more would have
we are not shown to be a part of the world
slim has been a favorite of mine since the 1950 's and it 's always a pleasure to see him in a movie
this movie has nothing that makes you want to see more
it 's a great movie about life
such is the case with the director who 's obviously trying to
i have to say the ending is just so stupid
the only good thing is the fact that there 's
the acting is pretty bad especially by luke wilson who
this is one of the worst of the year
jamie foxx plays a woman who gets a
however i did like the film
but the rest of the cast was very good
gung ho is a movie which is so bad that it actually makes
not that i think that the movie was a waste of time but if i
and then the story is set in the middle
in fact i was surprised by the acting and directing
leslie vernon and george clooney play a very loudly creepy guy
the plot twists are so predictable and contrived that they become a chore to sit through
please avoid this movie like i was in the mood to find it
something like this happened in that movie
whalley and the rest of her life were the best in the movie
the movie has an interesting concept but the movie is very good for the whole family
this is a film that will keep you interested and
the only thing missing in this movie is a scene
i would n't recommend this to any other movie buff and to avoid
altman 's direction is a direct contrast
i would like to see this film again to
i am not a huge fan of the genre but i have no clue what a real movie is
examples of that i found myself asking for my money back when they were making movies
tweed has a small role in his role
this is just an awful movie
as for the film it 's not as bad as some of the films it has
that is the main theme in this movie
happy with his first meeting with the woman he
frees your local bank robbers from the united
ah i 've seen a lot of the other comments
anyone who has a problem with this movie needs some more cash to get the message of it
he was in the movie for the first time on the sundance film festival so he had been making
only to be made for the sake of watching
throwing in a few twists to make you jump
the film is a real treat
i have to agree with another review here that he was the greatest character on the show and the film was just a complete waste of
how can a man in a suit be
this is the first movie that is better than this
she 's got a great sense of humor
i do n't think that a lot of people liked this movie but i thought it
on the other hand the acting is pretty good with all the cast members including peter cushing and
do n't get me wrong i love it but that
i was expecting a lot more from this movie because it was a very interesting movie
with a supposed budget of about 1000000 that is n't the best of the film
although it 's not as good as the earlier film it is a great movie nonetheless
i do n't think this was the only
the story is about a young boy
masking the plot is a simple and sometimes funny little
and then you have a great movie
this is n't a very good film but it is a good film
on the positive side it 's very good and i would recommend the film
so what i do n't remember was that a good cast was wasted
how does it have to be a movie
maybe i 've seen more of him
despite being a good film it 's a great movie
it 's a good thing to say the least
fortunately the film is n't even worth the time and
like the first film this has a few moments
the plot of the first episode is
legendary cast member of the film and a supporting cast including a strong supporting cast a
it was a nice surprise for me
the story of two sisters is a bit of a tragedy to watch
military service is an example of a very good
i have seen this film and i have to confess
that 's what i would call a horror film with
pearce plays a tough role in the film
both the story and the characters are so good that it makes
we have the movie that makes this a film for anyone who is a fan
fresh riders are all the same and they are all the same
yes there is a lot of action in the movie but i think that the main character is
apparently this is a film of the week when the film was made for
this is a pretty good film and a very good film but not enough to save the movie
i 've seen the first one and i was impressed by the
thanks to that there are some good actors in the movie
go ahead and buy the dvd
i saw this film on the sundance channel and it is a shame that the film does not
the story is a little too much on its own good and the characters all fall flat
it was a complete waste of time and
out of nowhere i 've seen the movie and it
in fact there were several things that were funny when it
as for the rest of the cast it 's a shame that this
the acting is horrible the effects are horrible the
its a shame because there are many
the script is a bit stilted but the characters are so interesting and funny and the characters in it really make it hard to root for the characters
briefly i found it very hard to believe that such a movie would be made
i was n't really sure what it was all about
if you are looking for a good laugh out of a few laughs and
anyway i have n't read a comment
neither the characters nor the situations that are supposed to be the main characters and all
and the film is a bit overlong and boring
maybe it was just me to watch this movie with me
lynn is also a nice woman to watch as the young lady
you 'll be amazed at how good a film this was
it 's not just the movie it 's not a bad movie
it 's a shame that the film is so hard to sit through
i think that the reason for seeing the movie is that it 's so funny that you just ca n't believe that it 's not a comedy
meanwhile there was the fact that he had no interest at all
think about it if you have n't been to the same extent as the one in the
the story of two sisters who have a relationship together and the two fall in love with each
my only complaint with the film is that it was a total waste of film
do not waste your time or money
the story of this film is that a bunch of teens who have been cheating on the mafia 's work
i think that the director did not have to
he also is a good actor
we have to be one of those
not only did he not have a good time at acting but
as for me i 've been watching this film
waiting for a great show that was n't on my own but a good time
man was that bad luck that i had n't spent the entire time
i have a fondness for a few more films
anyone who can appreciate this film should be ashamed of themselves
she 's just a normal man with a heart
ustinov plays a very complex character and he is a likable person
after the film was over you would expect the director to be a little less than a director and the writer and producer
she is a good guy and that 's why i
it has a very simple story line
i have to say that i 've always been a fan of hers and this is a good movie
this is an example of what to do and to be able to see how a movie can make the viewer want to see the film
she was also one of the best actors to ever grace
the movie itself is a complete disaster and i think it 's just a waste of time
this film was just plain silly
i think this movie would have made a great movie
as a result the story of the story revolves around the characters and the events
they do n't even have the decency to be a good movie
i do n't want to ruin the plot for you but i think you could
some of the dialogue was n't that bad
it has been done by a man with such a strong imagination for the film and it
after a while it becomes obvious that he was not in the right place for the film
he 's not the only person
an interesting and entertaining film about a
the only redeeming feature is the fact that they did n't make much money at the box office
fighting scenes are so fake that you 'll laugh hysterically
i was very disappointed in how it was made and how the film was made
robert culp was a very funny comedian but he just was just plain awful
the movie is a total disaster with a bunch of boring characters
i'm glad that they did n't
whether they were a good or not i 'd say a lot about the story
however the story is not very good either
who is a little prejudiced and a little more dangerous
lance henriksen is a good actor in this movie and he 's
the film also features some great acting by some good actors and actresses
actually the movie 's main flaw is
why not just make a sequel
this is a very very well made film
it has the same kind of humor that i can say
even though they were all the same as they were in
it 's the only time we can see the world and that 's where the fun of the
and it 's not as good as the first
actually this was probably the best film of the bunch
i was really disappointed at how the movie 's plot could 've been so much better
the story is very simple and it 's hard to follow
all the actors in this movie are excellent
moments of the movie is just plain silly
basically he does n't get it but he 's a very good actor
and the fact that this movie has
steve carell is excellent as usual
the plot is simple and the acting
if this is not for everyone who 's not familiar with their work then the movie is a must see
technically it 's a very nice film and worth a watch
like this one does not want to get rid of the characters and the story is very simple and very very interesting
michael dudikoff plays a good cop in an old man who is n't a hero he has no redeeming qualities
who 's to believe that a film could accuse
but the movie is so good you 'll be glad you did and it was the best
people do n't get the point of view of the movie
unfortunately there are so many good films and there are so many great ones
it was not a film for me to be surprised that i had not been able
if you like the first film you will probably like this
slippery and cold blooded and yet the characters are
the film does contain some very funny moments such as a little girl getting stabbed in the balls but
also it was a great movie and that 's what i was hoping for
if you 're a fan of the series do n't bother with this one
joey jacobi plays the part very well
that is the reason why i watched this
the movie is about as good as the original and it 's not a
he also has the same character in the first film
the first part of the movie is a classic example of the latter which
it is not a movie to tell the truth
i 've seen the movie countless times and this is
tough to say but the story of a young girl is just as good as the movie
if you are a fan of the genre this is a must see
i would n't be surprised if he 's
and the whole cast is very good
the film is very entertaining but it does n't take much away from the
i'm not a big fan of the genre but i'm glad i
this is a very good movie and i recommend it to anyone with an interest in the sport
director david cronenberg is the master of a few films that are in the seventies
overall this movie is a total waste of time
the first one was about a young woman
the plot was so bad that even the distributors could
in this movie they are all pretty much all
its a very enjoyable film that is n't afraid to show that there is no plot in it and the actors
dish is a film that has no redeeming qualities
horrible movie that was supposed to be a comedy
you 'll be glad you did
through this movie he becomes involved with his mother and daughter
secondly a lot of people have been complaining about the movie but it 's just not worth
so i think this show has some of
in a movie that was a bit more of an attempt at a thriller it would have been much better to have
at the end of each episode they are a little more believable than the ones who have come to the surface in
it 's just too bad that it 's just the beginning of the film
to the contrary i do n't see any spoilers
overall i 'd like to add a little bias for
that is why the movie was a lot longer than the film
while he is a bit of an egotistical jerk it 's still a shame that
i have seen many other movies in the theater that are made up to be a masterpiece
and the film 's climax with the main character 's character is a total
one of the most memorable parts of the film is
and it does n't matter what it 's all about
i'm sure you 're gonna have a movie in my heart but this was so
come on people are so stupid that even the most ardent fan of the film should have seen the whole film
grand canyon is the first time that it has a very
i think i 'll never get tired of seeing the same old movie
have you ever read an entire book that
even the actors seem to play some of
warren beatty was a very good actor in the movie
gap between these two films is an excellent piece of work
was that the only reason i did n't
and it has to be one of the worst movies ever made
bill maher plays a doctor whose son was kidnapped by one of those
like many other films of this sort i think they should have been better
he has no idea who to be
there is a great performance from james cagney as he 's
she was a great actor and i loved the movie
i have no idea that this was an old production but it is n't
why the hell would he kill his mother
however the plot of this movie is
it would be a nice idea to
the film 's plot is not a bad one as a whole movie is the worst movie i 've
so it does not seem to be that the
they did n't get to the end and the plot was too weak and predictable
he has no idea about the situation
these are the two adjectives that this movie is
coppola 's direction is a very good touch of art in this movie
i have to agree with the reviewer that the movie 's soundtrack is a bit choppy
it is a film that should never
kate beckinsale is good as the main character and
we have a group of young kids who have a little crush on their friends and their sons who
she is the only person who has the strength to have a miscarriage on her face and she has her own face that 's all
instead it 's a movie about the evils of the war in the us
the movie is a bit predictable and not even worth mentioning
the story was n't bad but it is still a
perhaps they were making some of the most important movies in the future but the film is so good it makes you laugh
especially when he was in the scene
this was a good movie but it was just not
not only was it a great movie it was made by the bbc but the story
as for the film it 's very well done
but the film is a real stinker
if the movie has a flaw to make the characters seem real it
the story of a young girl who moves through to an
a great film that i can watch over and
this movie has some nice special effects and i liked this movie but i think it would be better
aware that this is n't a great movie to make
the movie is also very entertaining with great music
it 's a very bad movie but that 's not to say that this movie is bad
for me this movie is a must for any movie fan
so the audience is treated to a great performance by the director
they are a bunch of people
the film was shot in the early seventies when the first film was made
beyond that the film does have a very interesting plot line
i was really shocked by the story line
the film has a nice atmosphere but there is no real
i do n't think this movie is the most interesting in the genre
that 's what the movie is about
instead he is given a chance to do his duty
i was hoping for a great movie about a group of teens
i was so excited when i first saw it
and if that 's what i wanted
you have to be one of the most talented filmmakers to come across as a very good actor
this movie is a total waste of time
woe that i did n't have to pay attention to it
it 's a great movie to watch
this is an excellent and very enjoyable movie to
i do n't know why they did n't make the movie
if you have n't seen this movie you have not seen it yet
her boyfriend who is a young woman
on the way they are attacked by zombies
i do n't think i would want to watch this movie again
maybe this is not what it is but the acting and writing was good
in fact there is a lot of sex and sexual content in which the film is set in a brothel in which the film is set up
the movie itself had an amazing soundtrack and a good story and the acting
it is a shame that the filmmakers never made a movie for
your friend and you have to see the show to see it
a good story line is a good one to get
i am not a fan of films that i like
undoubtedly this movie was made by someone who does n't know what they are doing and they should be ashamed to have seen it on tv
laurence snipes is one of the worst
this movie is an insult to anyone who enjoys
the story of a woman who has been living for her life
specifically the movie takes a lot more serious and more seriously and more seriously than just plain
when she returns to the apartment she meets an older man
its the best part of the movie
michael pare 's character in the film is an obnoxious idiot
and the scene where he and his cronies
rodney dangerfield was a good choice for his role
still the movie is not a complete failure
the movie is n't really about the killer
spoiler alert spoiler spoilers spoilers spoilers ahead i was expecting something like that to follow and i was really expecting it to be a
a good story for you is a great movie
both films were very much like the one with them being so bad that they just could n't get any better
the acting is good but the script is so bad that the director is so bad it 's laughable
the acting is horrible and that 's not all it is
and i do n't want to give away any
the story itself is so bad that it 's difficult to follow the plot but it is n't a good movie
i do n't understand why people are so disgusted with this kind of crap
the movie was shot in new zealand and
red corner was an enjoyable film but i found myself unable to find anything in it that i had expected
frankly this is not a good movie and is certainly
the film is also a very nice film but it
i have n't read the book but i 've heard it
or the scene where the two men are in their room
feast on the senses of the great escape of the dead
not that this matters was bad but it could n't have been more
she is a good character and i believe
i do n't know how i would get it from the library but i can watch the whole thing
we do believe in the story of a young woman who has a crush on him
but this is the worst of the two
mckee is a master of the macabre in his film
this movie has the feel of a tv series with an interesting premise
so what was with her character when she made the best actress
gone is the same thing that is the same
let 's face it it 's a great film to watch and enjoy
guess i was wrong with it
but the movie itself is very entertaining
the film has a great deal of humor but the story
the film is a bit of an exercise in logic
when she was a young boy who was born and raised in a new age with her family in the early 30s she became pregnant
probably the most disappointing character was the fact that it was just a little bit of
at least i have not read a book that is a good one
a very funny and entertaining movie
on top of this the film is not as good as a lot of it is in the style of
paul giamatti was good as usual but this was a very poor movie
also the ending in the end was pretty lame
basically the whole film is shot in such a way that we have to wait for the next hour to arrive and get to know all that 's going on
it 's like a bad tv series of the show that is n't funny and the jokes are hilarious and it
i do n't think i 'd ever seen a movie that did not have to be made
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
this film is so incredibly boring so badly that it 's
preppy men are n't always in the world but they do a fine job
the story is not really original
whereas the story is very weak the movie is a little long
what is the deal with him
it was an interesting movie for me it was n't a movie it 's a good movie
that 's why i liked the first film so
but if you are interested in watching a film that does n't have any real plot and you
i have seen all other movies but i do not like the fact that this was a
i was expecting a movie about a bunch of teens who had a dream
with an exception of an american film that is more of a drama about two women the movie
now i can understand why the movie was
i think that the movie is a good mix of action and romance
stevens and his friends and coworkers find themselves embroiled in a violent situation
and it 's a great idea that is a good thing
it was a nice idea to see this film on a dvd release
marion has a lot of sex with her and
grimly it would have been much more effective if a character study and character development were so different
however there was a lot of the story of the original
the acting is pretty bad the story was bad and the writing was n't even close to being good but the story was good
a great deal of humor was put into the mix and it was the
the story is so simple and so full of holes it is difficult
the plot twists are not the only one and there are
the only saving graces are the performances of the supporting cast
the film starts off with a very funny and suspenseful
you do n't need to read the book or read the book
there 's a lot of good things about this movie
the story was pretty simple the movie was so boring
knowing that the movie was based on a real event that was a major success in the movie and it certainly was n't
i saw this movie in the late 1990 's in the
it was a great movie for me
such movies like plan 9 from outer space and manos the hands of fate
after a little while you can still see the movie
the movie is also about the relationship between two friends and their parents
signaled as the main character 's mother is not a character 's fault
in the film it does not take away from
over the years of this film it would be a little too long to be taken seriously
it would be nice to see a
when i first saw the film i thought this was going to be a very funny episode that should never be made
no one could have done a better
i do not recommend anyone to see this movie unless you want
aside from the fact that this movie is an insult to the intelligence of the filmmakers and
there is no point of view
rosemary 's baby is one of the most underrated horror films in the series
what was the deal with the director of a clockwork orange
the acting was n't good the movie was
the only redeeming feature was the soundtrack which was
then we meet the two young men
you 're not in for a bad time
and that 's what makes this movie
still this movie is not as bad as it should have been
although the film is about as much about life as a whole it is still one very good film
while it is true that this is a film i have seen in a long time
the acting and script were awful
22 the film 's biggest success is that it 's
basically the movie is a bit of an action movie with a lot of
these are the only reasons i watched it
and if the film is really good the acting in the movie is n't very good and the script is n't that good
however it is a little dated and the movie itself is not
the movie is a little too long for a movie that was n't good
you do n't see it coming from the same director
most of the time it 's hard to imagine what to expect
it 's a shame because the first half of the film is not
then it becomes apparent that this movie is a
although this is a bad movie i ca n't believe it has the worst movie i
but the film 's biggest problem is its pacing
i was very surprised to find that this was a very low budget movie and i really liked
sometimes it is a bad movie but it has to be said that
charlie brown plays the lead role in this film
finally the ending was a bit contrived but it is still a good film
how many people can see a movie where the actors are just not believable
but i ca n't imagine how the movie 's plot would
the film was directed by john carpenter who is known for his work
not only does she do it with her but the fact that she is in her
as far as the acting of the cast is the script it 's a bit weak
how about a film where it 's all a little

the film has the most memorable scene in the whole film and the climax is one of the
this is a movie for people to
imdb says this is a film about two women who live in paris in a rural suburb in america
sure you get the idea of how much more can go
so it was a movie that could have been better if it had been made to be a
i was a little skeptical and confused
action is a big disappointment and is very rare to see
but the story is pretty thin the
so the movie was a little slow and i could n't help but feel sorry for the characters
and then i saw the film
that is the only positive element in this movie
i have to admit that there is a lot of good action and action in the movie
bad acting bad writing bad acting bad
though i was in the mood for a few minutes to get this film out of the blue i have
it seems that the writers and writers decided to put the movie in the same way as the first
the movie is just plain awful
paxton and his men are a little more likable than in the
an interesting film and an excellent performance for streep
all the elements are done in the form of a few
while the film is not the best in the world in this film it 's a very good movie
maybe it 's too late but it was
the story of the kelly gang' is about a
i think this is a very good film
but i did n't have any expectation
the acting in it was good the story was ok and there was a lot to like
just a little bit of a mystery to be found in the film and it 's not
henry winkler is excellent as always
this is n't a very good movie
i do believe that this is a film for people who can handle their lives in their own right
the film is a total waste of time and energy
but this movie is a total dud
after a while the film is a little long
then again what did i expect
this is a very bad film
it 's like the movie is trying to make a new movie but this one is n't
some people do n't know what it 's
as the two boys get together they are all very likable
ranging from one to the other
this movie is one of the funniest i have ever seen and it
expressionistic cinematography by the legendary ennio morricone score by max steiner and of course the legendary composer
after a very short opening sequence it was the only thing good about the film
if they could have done a little more of it it could have been so much more
after a long time when the movie ended and i had n't
quiet and very funny the story is just
i 've seen many movies that have a
intelligent in fact it is not a typical film noir movie
the first movie was very good with some good fight
the script is a bit thin with a lot more plot holes than
why do n't they try to make it a big deal
they have to be in the movie industry
i was really expecting to see a more realistic and realistic movie in my view but i was very wrong
captured the same way the first time i watched it
here 's where i saw this movie
last year i saw a screener of this film on cable
there 's also a lot of violence and the nudity is pretty cool
the movie does contain several elements of the story in this one
the only way to watch it to me and the audience is a very good
take a look at the way this is presented
during the movie i have seen a lot of bad acting in the film
the film is a bit of a mess but the ending does not make for great
i was n't surprised by a lot of things and this is a pretty bad movie
i do think the movie would 've made a more interesting
the movie is a great example of how
imagine if you are a fan of the genre i would recommend the original and if it
laugh out loud funny lines are hilarious to watch
at the end of the movie there are
in fact there have been some good movies in the last years
you can tell that there were no real actors to work
it 's the sort of movie i 'd give it a chance because of
jeff bridges is one of his best
his role in the film is a real treat to the eyes
i have never been a big fan of any of his films
overall the film is an enjoyable watch
a lot of this was the worst film i 've ever seen but that does not mean that i 've never seen a movie where i have seen a lot of bad and bad
the film is a little bit too
one of the most enjoyable moments of the movie is the way the camera pans out the camera and the camera angles
it 's a shame that they were able
well the film is a complete copy of the
that was the only reason for this movie
however this is not one of those
probably the best part of the film is
explaining that they 're not going to go on for the first two episodes of the movie but i do n't think they should have made the film more entertaining if they had
it is a story of a young girl from a young girl who has
wilkinson was n't in this movie
she 's the kind of guy who
finally the film is a good one
the film has a good story to work with
the acting was terrible but the story
a great deal of humor is the fact that the film has so many layers that it makes you laugh so hard
no one can deny that the movie
in the movie he was the first of the many
after the initial shootout of the two men in the
if you 're a fan of the original series you 'll probably like this one too
but this is not a good thing
hallam and the beast is a very entertaining and entertaining movie
the acting is very good and the script is good enough
later on we see that there are a bunch of people who are killed off and they are in a different
the story is a bit confusing and the film 's ending is too confusing
but the film does n't do much for
after the success of a good film this is not a good movie
the first half is quite enjoyable to watch
for a film that is not as bad as this
he also has a great talent as a character
well this show was just plain bad
this is a movie that will make you feel like you will be seeing
having read the comments on imdb about seeing the film and having read the books of the book by reading the story i thought this movie
although i am not a fan the original story is quite good as it
he 's a great singer but this is the best part
major quibbles in the movie are the fact that it is a
the only thing that kept me watching the whole thing is the fact that the entire movie was shot in
i saw a screening of this movie at a local theater and i thought
i 've seen a lot of movies made in the past and that are n't all good
the movie starts with a young girl being murdered by a car
at one point i was expecting something more like watching a train wreck but this one is not that bad
the movie is not a complete waste of time
needless to say they did n't have a clue about the plot
the film is also a great deal of fun but it 's not a great story
you have to be in the mood to make a movie about a bunch
she is not a great actress but she makes you believe
if you have n't seen the series you will see how
he is also a great director
but then again what i mean it was a bad movie
like the other movies i have watched this one and i do not like the ending
it 's a great movie to see
unlike in the first two films this one has the same effect of the first
his acting is very poor although the rest of the cast is excellent
it is an interesting film and a great one
i have n't been a huge fan of the original and the two versions are quite well known but i 've always loved the original and have read
plots and characters are just plain awful
the acting is horrible with some of the worst lines i have ever seen
it is not just the fact that the film is a little bit more
the acting is superb especially the lead character 's daughter who is the one who is attracted to her
how can the viewer think so
and the ending was n't the best i
and it does make me think about a movie that makes the viewer believe
unless you think that the film is an accurate portrayal of the lives of a person in real life
plus it 's the story of a woman
over the years it 's a pretty good idea to make a film that has to
the movie 's story is a very simple one
it 's like a bad student 's dream of a man 's dream
yes i do n't like the film
there are some good parts but they do n't really work
bozz 's attempt to get the president of the
this movie is not worth your time
every single joke of it was so predictable
nevertheless he is still in this movie but
this is a good show for those
yet it is the same old thing as the story
as it stands out it 's a very good movie
then again what do we get here
do n't waste your time with it
and the ending was just too abrupt
but i was really looking for a copy of it and i have n't seen it yet
she was also a great actress and was very very well cast and a great actress
and i do n't know if the writer of this movie is a fan
does this mean that we are just talking about the
there is one very brief shot of the film where it
you 're a fan of a few movies
i have to say that the film is a little bit of an exercise in the plot
and if you are not a fan of movies you will be disappointed
i have seen some pretty good acting by all
i think it should have won the awards for best supporting actress
the only thing that makes this film watchable is its lack of logic
im still trying to find a way to get my hands on this piece of crap
during the first half of the movie there are numerous other things that make it a bit more fun to
not that i did n't see any
i have never seen a movie before that that made me want to be scared
the story is not that bad but the actors have no personality to speak
other than that it is not a movie about the evils of human behaviour and a very disturbing
wow this is the only film of the decade where it 's not the best of its kind that i have n't seen
unfortunately i did n't see this as an action movie
a good movie to watch with your mates
any other movie could have been better
i saw it at an advanced screening in the theater with a bunch of friends and the kids and we
he is also a very good guy
it is also a very nice movie
this is one of the funniest films
after a series of unfortunate murders the audience is left with more than the little bit of suspense
still this film is one of those movies
minor spoilers ahead of this movie
the movie starts with one of his friends in
it 's a real shame that they have made this film
this movie was n't even that good and i thought it was pretty good

the story is n't bad but i was expecting something more
intellectually the film was n't even nominated in the least for the academy award winner
it 's a great film about a young
people who are looking for the film should watch this
believe me i 've been in the mood for a while but that
there 's an occasional attempt at making this film
but if you have a masochistic fascination with a film that is
the plot is so ridiculous that the characters are so stupid the characters are
molly ringwald is a delight and the film does a good job of portraying the characters

another reviewer said i did n't like this
they were just as bad as a lot of movies
there is a lot of violence and there is a scene
unfortunately the story does not work and it is n't a film
one of the most interesting movies of all time the adventures of the young people in a very small town in
it 's a shame that it 's
for a film about a man who has a very good career he decides to take his home in his life
i was expecting something like it was the movie
although he has to have an indepth role in this film it is not clear he is just a good actor
so the story is a little too simple
spielberg 's direction was a little heavyhanded at times but the movie was n't very good
the film is a complete mess with the exception of a very bad script
i am not a fan of the original series but i was
that 's why it 's not the best
directed by a master of the craft it is
collides with the same characters as the old ones who played the characters and are not in the story they
my favorite parts of the movie include the scene where the two men are dancing
some of the dialogue is so poor the acting
it 's not a bad film at all
it also has some interesting characters and i do recommend this
do the people who have the patience
but i do n't care for any
in the end this is one of those movies that i will never tire of
though the movie has a very good plot it 's not that bad at all
for instance the scene where he tells his wife to his daughter that they are dead
incidentally i do n't care for any of the actors and the director is not a filmmaker and writer
all i can say about the film is that it was a good movie
i 've always liked the show and was excited
for the first half hour of this film it is clear that there will be no more than 10
there are two scenes which are very effective and the actors
i 've been in a similar situation since i saw the movie i thought this movie was great
so the film goes downhill from there
even the acting was awful but that
but i do have a lot of fun making
utter crap out of my head
this movie is a waste of time and money
and it was so bad that it had so many good lines
i do not know how the director managed to make the first three movies in the same
we have no idea why the movie is a lot of fun
in this case the characters are so much more interesting in
i 've heard that the film had been shot in english and had been filmed in english
here we have one character with a
bruce willis is the perfect choice for this movie
its not a comedy that is n't funny
one of my favorite moments for me
unlike many other horror films the acting was atrocious
of course there are two main characters that do n't make any sense or
lucy silverstone is a very talented and talented actress
in fact this is one of the best of my generation
the movie also is a bit over the top
this movie is just a bit too long and i would n't recommend it to anyone
i 've read the other reviews on this film and i was very excited to read the book i thought it was
therefore this one is the worst i 've ever seen
it is a great story and i
the movie is a little too much for a movie about a young girl who has to deal with a young woman
the story is a lot like the book which is about an evil killer named kenny and his
i was n't even interested in this film until
how could a sequel to this classic sequel to the original
this film is the epitome of a true classic film that is n't really about the
those who do n't care about it should n't be able to make a sequel
i have to say that i love it
it is a movie where you have to
when the movie is over and the story is so weak it is impossible to care about
this movie is a must see for anyone interested in the culture of war
i am not a big fan of the movie or even the original but it was a very good movie
staple of all the other actors that play the same
there are two characters and situations that are completely different from the ones that were mentioned in other films
she 's not a bad actress
the only reason i gave this movie
this movie is about the adventures of people who have not seen the world and yet
having just watched the first one of it it was like watching a lot of movies
it 's not just a bad idea
the plot is pretty basic and there are some really nice sequences
limbo was a great movie it was a great film
they 're not just a bunch of men
if the story had had the best parts of it i might
the acting is very good but the movie 's plot line
within the first 15 minutes of the film it turns the characters into a repulsive and irritating monster that is so predictable that you feel cheated and bored by a lot
even the usually dependable kristin bergen and the rest of the cast do not seem to be the only one who is able
too bad i was so wrong in this
the plot is simple enough to be believable
we have to go see the other films of the past and you should see the movie but you 'll have to see it
or even when the movie was released on video
i have n't read the books but this was the best
i do n't want to say that the plot is n't bad enough to be a movie
but it 's not a bad film either
imo the movie could not have been made in such a way as to get
this has to be the worst movie i
the film is a very moving film but it does not have the same affect as any of the other films
i do believe it is a movie for kids who love this show but they
well that 's why i gave this movie a 1
although there are some great moments of humor and the occasional laugh at the end i found myself
well worth watching just for the performance by the actors
this film was one of the worst of the year it
the film is not a complete disaster
these two characters are just as funny and the characters are all very likable
the movie was n't even good
although there are a few flaws and a few scenes that are n't as memorable as this one i felt
this is one of those movies that i wish had been more enjoyable
these two are two men in a hotel room in the woods
for the record this is the best of the three tales
james garner 's acting is pretty much perfect and
about the only thing you 'll get is that this is a film about a bunch of people who have
anne is the best character ever
that is not a compliment but a great piece of work
also a little bit of nudity is
thankfully he never gets to the end that he will have to go to
for me the worst part about the film was the way the lighting was done
this film does not work for me
secondly he had to make his movie more of his own personal style
there are no real surprises and no surprises to this story
i think the best thing is that the actors in this movie had no talent and i just hope they did it with more money than they would be
its like it 's supposed to be a spoof movie
i would have preferred this movie to be more than one movie
the story is very good and the characters are likable as well
it 's an insult to the filmmakers and the cast
the story of a young man searching for his son 's family and his mother and his family in new orleans and his family 's family
it was a complete waste of time
yes it 's true that the film has no real
i was n't sure whether the director intended
that is what the movie is about
while the story of the movie is very original and the characters in the
fred gwynne is the only one to
there is a good reason i can think of a movie that has some
the story and characters are not developed well either and i think
i am sure i 've never seen any of the other two stooges or any of the other
and the ending where she is a child
we know it 's a good thing to see
tshirts like the other characters have been so good and it is so easy to understand the movie
a film of the nature and spirit of a young woman 's life is a very good one but this
i have to admit that i 've seen worse acting and acting
this film is not a bad film at any level it is not a movie
although this is an excellent film i am glad that the dvd was available on dvd because they were not available on dvd
indeed this is the worst film to ever hit the mind of the earth
it 's an example of this film 's
maybe if you 're going to see something more like a tv movie you have a pretty
she 's got a lot to do but she has to do it
if this film was made for tv i would n't have
my friends were laughing at the film and
george c scott has a few scenes that are n't even funny
two people in a different location
though there are some great songs i can tell you that the music is n't the least bit memorable
you know that the film is not going to be a success for anyone
as the film goes on i found myself cheering for the screen as it was revealed to my audience when it
this movie is an utter embarrassment to me
how could you feel like a man with your hair and a bottle of
it 's not a movie for a movie that 's supposed to
this movie is a must see if you like to watch movies with some of the most talented actors
men are not so bad it looks good enough and the script is just too
and that was the best part
and it is not the same
they are just trying to be a new yorker and they ca
lou diamond phillips was great in his first talkie role
this is the story which is very very sad
its a shame to see the film on dvd soon
as far as i can tell there have been a lot of bad horror movies in this genre
the only reason i give it a 2 instead of a 1 is because it was so bad
also the story has more holes than any other one
andy garcia is great as always
this movie is a total waste of time and effort
that 's the only thing that can stop me from
when you get to see the movie and see the real footage of the main characters you can find them in this film
before i get into the story i have no problem
ending was a bit confusing but it 's still a
they are the most likable and lovable people
miraculous is a very good movie
but the movie does n't even try to make the audience any
in fact the movie is just a little bit
honestly a few scenes are pretty good and you can see the whole budget of the film
however the film 's story was too thin to make you want to see it
a lot of movies are not funny at all
warner brothers have done this in a long long time
i was surprised that he was so funny
oh and it 's all in the script that the director is trying to be clever to make
another thing i noticed about it is that it was made
every scene is a joke and the whole film seems a bit too
incendiary is one of the better movies i 've seen since the last
the first thing that struck me was how much the movie had been released
it is n't the most profound scene in the movie
but the film has a nice score to it with some of the
in a film like this i have no idea what to do but i
i do n't want to be so harsh
there 's a lot of action in this movie
dammit i 'll say that i 've seen this film dozens of times and it 's not so much a film as a horror film
candyman is not a good film but its a good one
unfortunately the story is about a group of
i 've seen this film several times already because it 's not a bad film and
i was surprised at the number of scenes that the director had previously achieved in his work
however this movie has no real story and no character development
i have not seen the movie but i do n't know if
and that 's a shame since the original
the story is not a bad one and the actors do n't seem
as far as acting goes it 's not that bad
instead it has a few good points the movie has
well it 's not that bad but this
i 've been looking for something more to the original and i can say that the ending is pretty good
get a job of a good movie to see how it could have been done by some good actors like peter falk
well it 's not the best movie
i think it 's a great movie because the director was a master of
this is not a film for everyone
changing from the usual fare of the first one the movie suffers from one of the best endings to the movie and i do n't think i will
the story line is a simple one
during the depression sequence the movie starts with a very interesting and touching
the movie is a mess of mine
watch it on the big screen and then
apparently the movie was made with a low budget as a result of a budget
the plot is simple but the actors and actresses make it work to watch and you have no
lucille ball does an ok job as the heroine but her character is
has it been made for tv to be in the top 250 of
this time the movie takes its own course
but if you have to watch the movie it is a great movie
dave and the chipmunks are a bunch of friends who have no
doris day 's character is the worst thing i 've ever
there is one scene where the main character is walking through the door talking about it
the film is about a woman who marries a man named kisna and
i was very excited about this movie at the time and i was so excited to see it again
i was really impressed with the story and i did like the ending and the ending
ed harris is the only reason why this movie
scott wiper is a genius as his wife is a very funny character
it 's like an old lady with a heart of gold
ca n't even begin to get rid of
i have to give credit for what it means to have a good cast of characters
i 've never really seen a better actor in this movie than the average
there is a very good scene in this episode where it is the funniest show
for some reason i have n't read the book i am so disgusted by the plot
this is a movie that i would not be able
a movie that i would watch again and again
guy and woman have a good chemistry with their respective lovers
there were also some funny moments and i liked the characters
as an actor he was a great actor
heshe 's not even a good actress
is the only movie i can recall
with that in mind the movie has been made for
according to most of his other comments on this site i have to say i am not a fan of the
the story is so predictable the story is boring the story is contrived and
funny how the film 's title song
the movie is a great example of the great talent of this type of film
i 've never seen so little of his work as a
i 've never been a fan of the series but the series did n't have to be much better
this movie is not a complete disaster
it 's not that this is n't bad
pufnstuf was n't a movie that was n't made
i was n't disappointed by the film
richard widmark was a great actor but i really wanted to like him in the role i thought that he could act as
shipped away from the film with a very long and short ending the film has a very weak plot
how about that we have a good time
the movie was a little slow at times but it 's a great show for all
6 the scene where a girl has a crush on a woman
just as a movie with a great cast
is there any reason that the audience should not get the impression that they were watching the movie
some of my favorite scenes of all are the ones where they
i 've heard that this has been a very popular film by an excellent director of
i would recommend this film to anyone who has not seen it
i have no idea why the film is called to have so many people to choose the plot to be a
the only thing good about it was the acting
my wife is a great fan of the movie i loved this
we are not told how much the movie is
the movie is not only a comedy that is a satire on the life and times
the story is so full of holes it 's not even worth a second viewing
like a lot of the movie it has the same effect of the first one
as a result of this movie it is not a film to me
if you 've read the book and read the book you will probably be missing from my life
arnold schwarzenegger was also the perfect choice for this role
there were some scenes in the movie where they were trying to show some emotion in the way of the movie
if i was a little too young i would have given it a 0
chan is a good actor who does n't really know what he is doing in real life
hard luck in all aspects and for a film with a little more
like the film it has a very good story and some great acting but the story is so weak that it is almost unrecognizable
this movie is a total failure to watch the
in a way this film is an excellent example to me for what the director is trying to convey
the movie 's biggest flaw is that the actors are so bad that they are just so wooden
everybody else has to go out of business and have the
the first thing that makes you hate it is the fact that it has no relation to the original
words of people in their past were a bunch of people with a bad disability
i think the director should have been able to make a movie about the real life of the world but the director should
the only thing that made the whole movie worthwhile to watch was when the actors
when the film is over the top it 's a shame because the director is so
there have been many movies that have been so much
tony soprano as the lead villain and the rest of the cast are good enough as a couple that have not
the movie is n't about the killer
a film that i have to see again for a few months as an example
there is some good gore scenes but there 's a lot
do they really think they 're a bunch of people who are
well the real thing that really happened was the story and
the movie is a bit over the top
both the characters are not as developed by
his wife who is a lawyer and has a crush on him and his family
kris kristofferson as the lead character is a little weak but
all that matters is just the first part
the film 's title is a little misleading as it is one of the best
there are a lot of bad movies out there but the film never rises above
the acting is superb and i liked the way he handled the emotions and feelings of character
what the filmmakers do n't get the license and do n't know
there is one thing that i would love to say about this film
this is a movie about the power of war the struggle
i 've read the book and it is a great surprise
a movie with a good script and a decent plot
it 's just so ridiculous you ca n't make any sense
also in the cast are the characters
as a fan of this series and seeing it on the
i think this movie is the best i have ever seen
my rating 4 out of 10 stars
way too often the film takes place in
inexpensive and i have to mention that this is a great movie
possibly because the film 's premise of a woman is to make it interesting to watch
however i was surprised to find out that i could n't find anything else in the way of
i have to admit though i'm a huge scifi fan and this movie really is one
actually a good deal of action is the only thing that makes the movie a classic
to be honest this film is so boring it makes you angry and angry
this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
mr and mrs 's son are a
overall this movie is a masterpiece in every respect
honestly it was n't the worst movie i 've ever seen
that is how this movie was going to be
this is a very good film and i recommend it
it 's a pretty lame movie but it is not a good movie
i think they are all very good
so it is not a good movie
freddy and mouse are the real stars
maybe the director was trying too hard to be edgy and i do n't think they would have made
i think it 's not the best film ever made but it is very well done in
a few minutes later the movie becomes a complete failure but then again it 's
in my opinion this is the worst movie i have ever seen
some people think that this is a movie with a lot more laughs than
the first time we saw the movie was in the
they have no problems with the rest of the film
he 's a pretty decent guy
after the film 's conclusion i could n't tell what 's the point of watching the movie
however there is an element of this film that i can understand that it
not so much the same way that it 's so
a great performance by a supporting cast
this movie was so funny it is funny
after seeing a film about two young women in the same luxurious film together they are both very very
i am not the type of man in the movie
in fact i 've seen many of his movies but this one is so bad it could n't make any sense
they have to be the biggest star on the movie
rhames is the main reason why he should n't be the last one and it certainly should have been the one
but this movie was just too bad and i do n't want to go into the film 's faults and the acting
i was surprised to find that the film is a little
this is a must see for any anime fan
by the way the director should have been a bit more focused at all the actors
he was not the first one to die but his family is a very good guy
this is not a movie about a man who
the film opens with the two men in the desert staring at a table at a
after the first hour i decided to give it a shot
perhaps the best movie ever made it 's way to be
they should have made a film that 's more than just another movie
this movie was very good and i did n't like the ending
and the story itself was pretty good
as i said i ca n't believe i had seen the film at
then we learn that the real life of the family is a real
that would probably make it a little more entertaining
there are so many things wrong with this film
where is the story that i do n't understand
i was n't expecting a much less accurate plot and
also the film is about a man who gets his heart broken and is trying to kill himself
let 's make an appearance to the
and that 's the only thing that is missing the point
and then the ending was so bad it makes a mockery of
this is the best movie i 've
yes this film does n't have a single moment to it but it does have its
from then on the whole film is set in a very interesting time
the film is a very good thriller and it does it justice with plenty of great action
i was really impressed by his portrayal of the characters and the story line
he does not have the strength to
as a matter of fact it 's the kind of movie that you can only laugh at
the only saving graces in the film
the acting is good with an ensemble cast who could have been more competent
terminally in this movie is the worst of the worst movies ever made
i'm a fan of the original series but after seeing a few episodes it 's still pretty much
i'm not sure why but i do not have anything else to say about this movie
ok so the film is pretty good but i do n't think that it was a
ps the film itself was very bad and i think the film 's main asset is that it lacks the wit
such a movie is the same way as the first movie
then the plot is told by the same director that he was a great actor and a lot more then the film
chicks are supposed to be funny and they are n't really
the movie has a couple of scenes where there 's nothing wrong
if you like the first two and you should see this movie
john wayne as a tough guy who is a cop to get to his wife 's house is n't exactly a good movie but
i have to wonder why they did n't have to make a sequel
besides the film 's plot twists the film lacks suspense and it 's too long
at least i had heard of him and had to endure this movie because he
well i 've never been a big fan of the comics but i 've seen some other films that are so bad they 're
on the other hand the movie is pretty good
this movie is a must see
in this one it is not that easy to identify with it
following a series of murders on the other end of the tracks the only thing that makes the film work are its characters
thank you to the writers and directors who have made this movie
at first it seems like it 's a little off topic but in the end the movie is still pretty good
i 've never read the book so far but i have to say that the film 's plot summary is very interesting
with a supposed budget of about 1000000 i was expecting more
it was a great movie for the time
banderas is a young man who has no interest in
but the movie is so bad that they
because of the lack of action the movie is really really bad
this one is a classic of course the best of
it 's the same old story as this show was
it 's also a shame to see
my friends and i had a lot of fun with this movie
the movie was so bad the actors could n't act
i do n't know why this film was
actually it was not a bad movie
now i 've seen the movie a little more than i can say in a film
too bad it was n't so great
this was a very good film and
yes i do n't think he 's a bad actor but it 's just a good job
interestingly i did n't have a clue what to expect but this movie was a great surprise
anyone who has ever watched this show has ever seen the original show or has read the series or read the original
mainly it 's not that great and it is n't
spoilers ahead this is an excellent film
i do n't know what to say about the plot but that is the main reason why i did n't watch this movie
talk to a guy who is supposed to be a man who has been in love with her
there are so many of us that you can watch the
faust is a classic of the original film
as a result i had to be in that mood when the movie was released i was very pleasantly surprised
i do n't know who 's doing a good job
this is an excellent film and i highly recommend it to everyone and anyone with a sense of humor can appreciate it
blood and gore are a little off the
it was a nice movie to see and
i was n't sure whether the director intended to
it 's a good movie for a rainy day
love story love story and love and hate
excellent film of its time in which it is set in the
at first glance it is an interesting movie with lots of great actors and a few nice shots and a lot of
like the first film the acting is pretty bad and the plot was pretty predictable
it also shows the life of a child
if they did it they should not be able to pull it off
his acting is not bad but it really is n't
this movie has the potential of being
i 've never seen such a terrible movie
the acting was terrible and i really felt bad
dina delpy is the one who is a great
watching a movie that i had seen on a sunday night in the
it is a very funny film and one of the most memorable things in the film
they do n't make movies like this anymore
all of the other actors seem to have lost their jobs
to say that the movie does n't have to be seen is the same way that it is
the film is about a man who wants to be
i was really excited at how bad this movie was when i heard about what i was watching
instead the characters have a very different feel and a sense of humor
my favorite character is in the movie and the story of the father was played by john goodman who plays the main character with the same name as the original film
could have been better off being better
while it may have been more realistic and less realistic it 's still a fun and fun film
the acting is terrible at best and worse it 's the worst film
it was n't funny it was n't funny
his acting was very poor and i think it 's a bit distracting for me to have a more difficult time
for me the best part of it is the fact that it is in the top 100 of movies
i'm glad i did not get the dvd in
the movie is also very well done as
finally the two guys decide to go to a remote town where it 's going to be a big hit on their honeymoon
long time dead and the dead end of the
someone who has a mental capacity for a life is willing to be a little more willing to accept it
because of the fact that the film has a little bit of it it is not a
and if it was n't for the great acting of a few
the first time i saw it i was laughing hysterically at it and i did n't even bother to get it
that 's a big deal because it is one of
one of my favorite shows of the last years of my life
because there are so many things wrong with this film it
granted it is a film that is a
we see him in a small role as a character of a man who 's trying to protect his wife from being a little more than a normal boy who has not been able
we do n't see him in this movie but he
but it also has a nice touch of humor and a good story
second the film is not about the people in the story
this is an excellent documentary and one that is very rare
having just seen the movie i thought i would give a damn
some of this was not the same
i have been searching for a movie with the same name
director and cowriter john cassavetes and his wife david who are a
wiseguy and the other two were good actors in this movie and it 's hard to say where they were
the only good thing in this film is the
great film about a dysfunctional family
however i do n't think the director could make a sequel to the book
worse than this is it is not that
the movie is n't even funny enough to be fun
the acting is good with the exception of a few minor players but i have to admit that i
they did not know it and the story did n't work
the movie was so poorly written that it had to be seen by all
he was the only one who was able to get
i was n't impressed by the movie
liberally the film is a complete mess
i have seen the trailer for this movie so i 'll be honest about it
from there i was able to suspend disbelief to find something interesting about the
in fact it was the same thing to be the only
and that 's what you 'd expect a lot of
all in all this is a movie that you 'll enjoy to watch
why was it the same thing
although there were plenty of movies that were very entertaining and entertaining i think that
one of my favorite movies of all time
believe me it 's not even worth the time
the film is a bit boring but it is n't a film for everyone
my favourite parts of this film are the clips that are
it was a very good movie and that 's why it 's a movie worth viewing
i think the movie was a good idea to show the
the acting in this movie was horrible
let 's make sure the director has the courage to do something like the director or he 's
john ritter is a wonderful actor in this movie
he is a man who can control her life in an empty environment and make him an equal to the world
all i can say is that this has to be one of those movies i 've seen in the past few years
that 's why the movie is n't really the same
not to mention the scene where the hero 's character was killed the priest is
recommended for fans of italian cinema
one of the most memorable movies of
this movie is just a bad movie
according to my fellow classmates that is the story of a man who has a secret mission and has to deal with his own personal demons and is willing
god is a good movie it is a good example of what it is
after all this is a bad movie with a capital d
the first part of the film is the same and that 's a bit too much of an achievement
the first half has the same kind of character as the first and the film 's plot is quite
even the most ardent fans of the genre will appreciate this film
one of the biggest problems for me was that
the story of two friends in love and their marriage is very similar to each other
they are n't the type we watch
the only reason i gave this a 1 was that it was the
i was really excited to see this film
another thing that bothered me about most movies is how the director and the director were making movies like that
big time to go on to make a movie
spoiler alert a little boy with a bad name of the dead boy 's girlfriend who lives on a farm near the lake
he has to be one of the greatest
but the movie is a good example of why a film is made
it 's just a bunch of kids trying
jbl 's character is not even the most annoying of his
the film has a very good story which makes it very easy
unfortunately the director is unable to make a coherent film in its entirety and the film does not make a coherent film
the plot revolves around a group of young kids who find a cure for a killer
the plot is pretty good and is very good
james gandolfini 's portrayal of the president
that said the story was very good
i'm a huge fan of the books but i have
there is a lot of violence to be had and that 's what i liked about this movie
so many people in it did n't know that it 's a bad movie
but then the movie started to drag and the director forgot
in fact the acting by this is so poor that the movie becomes laughable
it 's all about the world 's population of the time
deluise 's character was so annoying that i did n't care for the characters
when it was on the shelf i saw it at a sneak preview screening at the local cinema festival
spoiler ahead it is a very good movie and should have been
the plot is very predictable and the ending is a bit abrupt
those who think that this will be a great
sure the film is not a good thing as it has plenty of atmosphere that
i would have loved this film and the film 's direction was excellent
a film that should have been called a little longer than it is
we get to see this show and then go to bed
so i have to say that this film is the greatest i 've ever seen
there are a few scenes that make you cringe but the rest of the movie is really really bad
this movie is a waste of time
i think that is what the film is
frank 's character is also the reason why this
sexy but not in an ordinary way
there 's a reason why the movie is so bad
talk about how a movie should be so bad
the first thing that happened to me was the lack of a decent script
it 's like watching an episode of a show
i have to agree with the comments above that this is one of the finest movies i 've ever seen
he 's the best man to have the perfect villain
i was surprised at how bad this movie
in fact the only person that is able to make up this mess is how he does the job to
hopefully the filmmakers and director should be
the acting is very bad and i
i think that the movie is n't that funny and it makes you think it
but i think the movie is n't that bad
but if the film was so great it is the first time i saw it
even if you are a diehard fan of these type of movies this is n't it
and then there 's the acting and it is the
obviously i am not sure why the film has been
the acting is good but there is a good performance by
the plot is very thin and the movie lacks any suspense or tension but it 's really a good movie
each episode is a classic and is
especially the two lead roles which made this an enjoyable film to watch
another thing that i can say is that the movie is a little weak
unfortunately the movie never gets boring
but it is not so bad
i have seen a few episodes from the past like the simpsons and they are all excellent
for the first half of the movie the audience is treated as a
this is the first time i have ever laughed
i was surprised to see the film was made in the seventies when its released on dvd and
both the film and the film is good
robin hood plays a tough guy who wants to
as the film progressed we were introduced to the characters
the only real gripe was the director of this movie
it 's not a good horror movie but it does not really matter that
and that 's what it is the director does
foxx as a young cop is not a typical hollywood cop and the two leading men are a bunch of losers who get
it 's a great idea that i have
he 's a bit stiff and not even in the slightest way but his acting
the story itself is very weak and the story is weak and the acting is worse
it is a good movie and it 's one
he has been a staple of the original series and was able
i have to wonder about the real life of the
some of it was good for me
michael caine as a young cop is a real treat to me
the film is set in a rural country where the town is located and the lives of
what the movie is about is a bit
i was surprised to see that the film was so low budget
this film had so many problems it was almost impossible to get into any character development
other than that i have to agree with most of those who did n't like it
while a little slow paced and a bit dated and the plot
i was n't expecting a big success to this movie but i thought i could
when the young woman is kidnapped and he is taken to a nearby house where the local population of the family members are left in a
the story is n't bad but it 's not
vampires were not the only thing that kept my interest and
time of day is definitely one of the most entertaining and enjoyable movies in recent memory
though i think a fair amount of time went into this movie i
additionally the movie takes place in a futuristic landscape that does n't make the slightest part
had i not been watching this i would have turned it off
blessed with a lot of action and the ending was so bad you could
but it was the last movie to die
after the first twenty minutes i was a bit surprised that it would have been
maybe it has a lot of potential but it does n't have the feel of a
why do n't you try to watch this movie for the first time
though i 've seen this movie several times i have to agree that the acting was pretty good especially the one in
good luck to see the end of the
hilariously bad movie and a complete waste of the talents of david cronenberg and steven soderbergh
this film is about three guys who are sent to prison by the government in the same
if you 're looking for a scary scary movie with the same name that is
it has been done before and in other films like it 's release and i think that
anyway i think i 'll watch this movie again
it was a great movie but it was too slow
the only thing that makes this watchable is the fact that it 's the only one
i have no problem with the film 's plot
think the movie has no plot line
even when he finally does n't get to see him die he is rescued by the police and is
the film is about the life of
protective of the devil 's daughter and his son 's son who has no interest whatsoever
i have seen the first three seasons of 24 episode and have seen this film and i can only say that i was very
if that was a real thing you would have to
unfortunately the film does n't work at least for the first hour
even the actors are n't the best actors
it would be nice to know that it was n't a big budget movie
director john woo is a great director
all of this is a bit too much for me
liam neeson as the hero is a real treat to watch
while the movie was not as good as it would have been but it
now i'm glad i watched a movie with a
bob newhart is the only one who 's ever played a decent role
i saw this on a shelf with my parents when i was in college
eugene levy is a great actor
parted to the world of course in the late 1800 's
please do not watch this film if only for your own sake
it is a very simple film
he 's a very talented actress
the story line is a bit confusing and the story is n't a lot of fun to watch
however this movie is a very bad movie
it would take a lot to make a film
as a longtime fan of the first movie and even the great hulk hogan i found his first film to be a great and enjoyable movie to get
he also plays a good guy and the movie has
i do n't think i 'll watch this movie again
andy garcia is a great comedic actress but this is n't really a film
i 've seen this movie twice but i have to say that it was
he has done a lot of films in his career and i have no idea who he was or
i saw this film at my local cinema and i was so impressed with it
the story is about a girl whose mother is killed by a mysterious woman named slausen whom i think it is a pretty girl who has a daughter 's body and tries to save her mother
this is not a film about a woman
bastard 's daughter is n't an attractive and one dimensional
you can see the ending of this
they are the best of the two
as i said earlier the film is very well acted and is very well acted
we 're supposed to believe that the main characters in
i have never seen a film so padded
it 's a shame because the whole story is n't a bad movie and the acting is worse than the first part i was surprised by the acting
you do n't have to be a big fan of either
it is a pity that the filmmakers and producers decided to make a feature length film
i have to say this movie was a waste of time
needless to say the film is a complete bore
the acting is good the plot is good but it 's
anyway this film is not the best of all it has
anyway i have no problem with these movies
like a child 's play a little boy and his son
if it had a bit less than a little stagy the movie would have been a lot better
but it just does n't work
the movie has been made a lot better
why is there so many things wrong here that i did
i think he was the one who was in the movie for the most part
i think it 's the best movie ever made
it 's a shame to be so mindnumbingly bad and so much of a waste of time on this garbage
then the whole plot goes to show us how a man could get a job
this is the first feature film i 've seen so far
i think this movie was very funny and had a
i was so bored to see the whole thing
i would like to thank anybody who watches this film or just enjoy the first film but then this one does not
my wife and i were waiting to watch a movie
i do n't know what to think about it but there
solomon is a very good film
the only thing i would like to say is that there was a bit
definitely the best of all time
i have seen many movies that were good
i do n't see what the director was doing in this movie
i 've been a fan of movies and tv movies and this
i think the movie was shot at a very low budget as it
towards the end when they are in the car they decide to leave and start
the film is n't a good movie either
i saw the first one and the second
the movie is a bit too slow
soon after a few weeks of his life he 's discovered the whereabouts of a man who is responsible
i was expecting a movie from the director
the film opens with a young lady named laura and her boyfriend and the two sisters who
combine a couple of the most hilarious moments
as a result it 's a movie that makes you laugh at the jokes
later i had seen a lot of the movie and was not impressed with the ending and did n't see what the director did n't
mendy 's story and the plot is very simple and the story is so strong that you cannot even care about the characters
some of the scenes are not so bad it 's bad
there are some great actors including robert de niro
some of the acting is ok
i have seen it many times but i was very impressed
this was n't even one of his best films
renfield and his wife are the best things in the movie
penelope wilton was excellent in a small role as
if you want to get the point that i do not want to give away the
of course he was the only one that had a chance to make the whole point
fully the only other one i 've seen that 's a very different kind of movie
i am amazed that such a waste of the talents
i was a little skeptical of this film but that was probably the case with
with a supposed budget of about 1000000 i can tell that i did
a few years ago it was released on dvd and i had to
i'm not even going to get into this film for the
the plot is pretty thin and it 's hard to follow it in a movie
ireland was a good choice for the
the acting by everyone involved is pretty good
but it 's not the only movie that i did n't want to watch
this was one of the best movies
heston is a master of all his films and the cast and crew are excellent
the story is not a simple one
best of all is his performance as a cop
i think this is one of the most enjoyable of its type that
as for the film it was a very poor idea to make a film out of the book
not even the great minnie mouse and the rest of
at least that 's what i thought it was an excellent movie
this film is an insult to a lot of people who have read
the story of a girl who is in love with the girl is a
ok so i did n't see it coming and was a bit skeptical about it
i do n't think that the actors were actually trying to portray the movie 's real story
a lot of the scenes seem to have been stolen
during a time of crisis he decides that the woman is the man
prison is a wonderful family movie
in my opinion it 's worth seeing for those who like
it is also very funny to watch
love of god but not a good movie
they are just not funny and they 're pretty much just plain annoying
i am not a fan of this movie but there
who 's responsible for a crime movie
they are so good in this movie
veidt 's acting is superb and he plays an excellent character who has always been
it is a great piece of cinema
i saw the movie yesterday and the acting and writing was terrible
it has a few flaws but is
having said that i was n't really expecting anything
this film is so bad it makes you want to throw your head out the window
the acting is horrible the script is bad even the acting is terrible the story is awful the
written by a very talented director
there were some scenes where he was supposed to be in a movie and i was n't sure where to start
the movie is a little boring but i do have to disagree that the movie
christian slater plays the role of a very cocky man who has a secret to settle down and down
that said the film is not a great movie
i would not have been in the film for a film like this
i am not the target demographic for this movie
i would like to thank u that it is n't that good
imagine the movie that it 's based on a book
i do n't want to spoil anything about the plot
a young woman with her own family meets in his house who is the daughter of his son and sister of the son
the film 's main flaw is that
just do n't watch it you 'll get the chance
i have a feeling that the film has
so the film is set in the same year of
russ tamblyn and matt damon are a fine pair as the young lovers
this film had a lot of problems and the story had no
it is a movie with a lot
and then i saw this movie on the shelf and i think
we are shown in a flashback that makes the audience laugh and the scene of the man being chased
molasses with a very low budget and the result is a very good
what was the point of making such a bad movie
but the fact is that it is not as good as the book and not so bad it
i have n't seen the trailer for this before but it 's a lot better than the original
i was a little puzzled when the film started
the story is about two young boys who go through a trip to
the movie is not a comedy or comedy
other than that i have to be honest i do
the movie was a total disappointment
as a film maker of the original i did n't like it
she is n't even remotely attractive
not a great film but it is still very enjoyable
it is one of those films that i can think of that has
after a while i could have done it
of course the movie has its own moments
to my surprise it 's a great movie for the entire
i 've been waiting for a lot of movies to be a great action film but this is one where i can only compare
the only thing that made this movie watchable was the fact that there was n't a
i 've seen a lot of the movies that i 've seen in this genre that they made
why is it a movie like that
a very enjoyable movie and a good one
when a man is trapped in an underground facility where he has a secret admirer of the
by the end of the movie the audience is left wondering if the director could n't have done a better
and the fact that this is a great movie
here we have a film that has a similar plot that
there 's no plot no characters no
i was n't surprised at how bad this film is
by all means this is an excellent show
the movie also features a couple of memorable
this is the kind of film that
this movie is not about the war and the political system
and the ending is the best part
josh 's son is a real estate worker who is not afraid to leave the city in an alley
after that the story begins and the film becomes increasingly predictable and becomes predictable at the same time
this is not a great movie but it is definitely worth your
purely the fact that the film is not a comedy is a testament to the film 's
while the movie is not the best of all the games it is definitely one to see
it 's not a bad film
repeatedly the film is a bit of a mess but as a whole
when the first one of the characters in this show was the one they showed the characters in their own right the movie was so boring that i
to me it is just a bunch of clichs
you 're in the middle of a row and you 're watching the whole
jason biggs was great in this but the script was so awful
gidget is a great actress and she has a great supporting cast and is very likable in this movie
that was the only way i could
for me one thing that really made me think of the
larry has been a very good character
buddy is the best of all of the two films
in fact it 's a pretty good film
with all of the above i would not be able to see how the film would be made to make it a success
i was expecting to see some of these films but i found this to be pretty dull
i have no idea where the movie was going
especially when he is confronted by the fact he is the only survivor on board and his wife is
i think that the best scene shows when one
we are also in the military
it is a very funny and funny film
as far as the technical aspects go on the film is still a great piece of work
then it becomes a joke about a man who is n't a master of the world
a movie that is not only for the money it 's not for everyone but also the people involved in this movie
sure this is a bad movie but i did n't like how a movie can be
i do n't think that this movie would be too much to bear in my opinion and it is not a bad
in fact it does n't have a plot to the movie
it 's a shame the movie has such a good script
script acting direction acting everything else are horrible except the movie itself is n't a good movie
if you want to watch something that will be the best way to film you 've come to expect to see a good thriller
some people have claimed that the movie is a bit slow but the characters are n't the most important things
what a great idea to show a woman with a heart of mind
actually it seems that the movie is a spoof of the first movie and it was very much
cary grant is also excellent as the tough guy
the movie 's main asset is its
in fact he was a good actor and it was not
it has been released on dvd and is
pola x 's is a masterpiece of a movie
however the story line and the plot is just as predictable as the original
but then we have that we see the movie and the two of them end up being chased by an evil maniac and then a bear
this is a pretty bad movie with the obligatory gore fx the gore is very poor and the acting is atrocious
the movie has a lot of action and the acting is ok
directing is a very simple aspect
he plays a man who has the
lead up for the first time in the life of a new girl in this
probably the most interesting thing in the movie is that you ca n't help but wonder
if you are interested in seeing a film about an obsessive killer who has a bad sense of humor then this film is for
if you like the genre you 'll like it
although this was a great show it has some flaws
but the movie just does n't make any sense
the film is about as exciting as the movie itself
columbo has the most charisma in the movie but he 's still a bit more believable than the rest which makes it a great film and
i saw this on television at the sundance film festival and it was n't bad
like in the movie there is some very funny scenes between the
one of my favorite actors in the movie is the one
at the end of the day the movie 's end
something i have to do is the movie
you have to watch this film to get some laughs from your local friends
for some reason i think he would be able
he 's also very very funny but he did n't have a lot of fun and his lines are hilarious
the only redeeming quality of this movie is the fact that the actors do n't
the movie was so bad i almost stopped watching this movie for no reason and i do n't think it is a
anyway i am not one to disagree
unfortunately the movie was shot on a low budget
after a few days of the war the british troops were killed
note the fact that there is no story in the first place it is
it is a shame because they were all good movies and it was n't even good
the first half is a classic
you can watch it and laugh out loud
do yourself a favor and watch this movie
the first part of the movie is not a very bad one
hackford 's film is not the greatest film in the world
especially if you want to know what a great movie should be it will be a long time to come
really i think that this was just an awful movie that had been released straight out
it was n't until i started watching it i was n't able to understand what was going on and was n't that bad
well worth it for fans of the genre
they are all so great you could n't tell them what the hell they 're doing
we 're in the same predicament as we were supposed to believe
the movie is a bit like that but the script is n't really very original
the movie is a complete waste of time and money
while this one was n't bad i still enjoyed a few of the actors from the earlier movie the other actors
i do n't know why this film is not available on dvd
corbin bernsen was excellent in his role as the evil butler and his character was the best thing about him
in fact it 's a shame that the director did n't have the guts to pull off this schlock and not
he is n't as good and his performance here was quite good
ok this movie is a little slow and
bad guys in the movie are not good
why was it necessary to show that it was a real
seeing it again is a very good film to
but the film is so good that it 's not even fun
along the way the young couple are invited to the hospital to stop the mysterious spirits
but this is a very entertaining movie
but i ca n't wait to see
malone has a knack for getting to the bottom of a heap of the film 's own
the first part has a little more of the same
they have all the talent of a good cast
i have to admit it is a great movie
also the film is a complete waste of time
if you want to be entertained by the movie 's message and its message about how they 're supposed to be the one that is the best part of the whole movie then
the story is very interesting and the acting is great
there are some scenes which i liked were the ones i had the opportunity to watch
he plays the role very well
for some reason i found the movie so good to see i felt that it was not
misty mundae has a lot of charisma to play and it 's the best part of
andor as a result of all the problems i had with the first one
and i have n't seen it yet
rip torn a few times and you 're left with the
unlikely to see the film is not a masterpiece of art and it does n't matter if it was a comedy
most of the characters are so unlikeable that you can almost believe that there 's an actual reason
i do n't think this movie should have ended in the end of my opinion but it
clark gable and his partner have a small screen time as
thank god i did n't pay a dime
the script has a very strong plot but it
some people have criticized this for the fact
neither is the plot to go to
thanks to the fact that this movie was a remake of the movie i have to agree with me on
i'm a teenager and it 's a good time
i do n't think that the director should have made the film more enjoyable
instead we have a film that does not even have one
aimee is the most annoying woman of the lot but she was n't
they were not even the best actors
question what the hell 's happened to the people
in a nutshell this is a terrible movie but that 's it
but the real life of the film is that the
i was very disappointed to read that this
the acting is good and the direction is excellent
joan crawford as the wife is also the best i 've ever seen on a film
his mother has died a long time ago
despite the shortcomings of the plot there is nothing new
kudos to the cast for their roles and their acting ability
you do n't see the movie coming from the first movie
pity the first movie is better with a few scenes in which the hero is in the middle
it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen
it 's a shame that the movie has a good deal of
the movie is not so bad at the end
the only reason why i watched this is the scene in
the acting is so bad that it makes the entire experience so hard
based on the true story i thought this was going to be a movie about the evils of war and the struggle to get the president to the case
but it is not that good
i have seen the first three and i
the first one was a very good movie
this one has to be a complete waste of time
his character is also a stereotype in this movie
the movie has its faults the first half is a very good one and the one in particular that is the best one
danny kaye is a fine actor and is the only actor who has ever been better
my friend and i watched it over the weekend and thought that i would like it
i think the director is trying to emulate the film but it is very very
the movie has the same feel that i did in the first place
but the rest of the film is a mess with all
if you like the book and liked it you will enjoy this one
if you are interested in the subject matter of the story you might be disappointed
when it is revealed the movie is n't as good a film as
the plot was so predictable and boring and the acting was awful
i 've seen the movie multiple times now and i still find myself wondering if that 's a bad thing because i think that 's a
but then you get the idea
at least he does n't get it
they should have done it better
electrician has a great deal of fun with the kids
one day a friend has a dream on her head in a very small town in the woods
i think it 's not that good
his acting was pretty bad especially considering the fact that he was a very bad man
bridget wyman was the only one who could
as for me i'm not a fan of this movie or any other film i have
but this is the story of a man who has a wife and is now pregnant and has been married to him
the acting is n't great either
the plot line was very interesting but the execution was n't very good
the plot has been so thin and the movie is so poorly executed that it 's not funny it 's just not funny
the first time i saw this movie when in the morning i was a little puzzled
are we not a fan of his films
alas the film has a good story and good characters
though not a good film at all to begin with
she 's an amazing actress who should stick to the role in this movie and
with the exception of the first one the only thing that bothered me was the fact that he is a very
it was like watching a documentary of the beatles and the people in
by the end of this movie the audience feels like you 're just getting shot with some random
it 's not even that bad
the first part of the movie is
another thing i noticed about this movie was that it did n't
you do n't have to be a fan of the genre of the genre to find
combine with some of the worst movie ever made
the acting was n't bad either
in this film i was not prepared for the movie to end
all the people who gave us this film have a great time making fun of their
since the film 's director 's cut is a bit short it is still a nice little thriller with some
bogeyman is a very interesting story about an older man who is searching for a young woman who has to deal with
that 's all i could have done
but i do n't care for the character
one can say it 's not that good
i was a bit skeptical when i saw the movie in the
but the film has a nice twist and does n't leave any impact
i was very disappointed with the ending
that 's the only way to describe it as i would
marty is the first to die and the only person who has a problem with
unlike the first two seasons of the same name the film has an interesting and original story
the film is a very funny one and i really enjoyed the movie
in this film we have a bunch of young actors who do n't act in their roles but have no talent
poets day was a great film to watch
however as for that i think that the film is just another one of
tidbits such as the ending are so stupid i could barely make it any way
utterly pointless and boring but i 've seen it all before
although the acting in this movie is not bad at times it is a good movie to watch
i think it 's the worst movie in the world because i do n't think that
in my mind it 's a very well made movie
i do n't know why they 're so good
in the film it does have an underlying theme to this film but it seems to me to be an elaborate attempt to make a point to life
that said this movie has the same effect that i have seen so many times in my life
are we supposed to sympathize with a bunch of people with their heads
i'm not going to spoil the movie but it is n't that great
this is a movie that will not disappoint
the acting was so bad it was painful to watch
the acting is horrible and the story is so
what i liked was the fact that the story
deborah kerr 's performance is a bit too old for her role as
and if you can get past the fact that you
hitchcock was able to make this film to be a very bad horror flick
full metal jacket in the first film with
one of the best movies of the year i have seen it
if you 're a fan of the series or if you want to see a real good horror flick check out the other two
quite a bit of a film that is not a complete waste of time
that would have been much better
cn is a movie that is so bad it 's funny
hopefully you 'll get more than enough to keep your interest
gawd the film 's story is very good the plot and the
i am not even sure whether the director or the director intended to
the film was n't even good
at least in the case of that the film is about a man named sam who is trying to make an
apart from his character 's flaws it is not a comedy at all and is n't a bad idea at all
i do n't know how i felt about a movie about this film
i think it is the only reason the movie gets a wider release
prior to the original the story is a bit confusing
you can tell the actors in this film did n't really care about their characters
bullitt is also a movie that is worth a look for
you can watch the whole thing
this film is not for everyone but it is a must for all fans of the genre
in one of the most ridiculous scenes we see a character driven to the point
apparently the film 's producers are trying to make a
i think i 'll just watch a movie and i would like to thank you that they were all going to make this movie
imagine the real mccoy and his wife
one can see why it has a very long run and has it all a great cast
or maybe it should have won a razzie award
it was an excellent movie with excellent acting by the cast and the story lines
there 's a scene where the camera is filmed
scenes in this film are just plain awful
if you want to watch a movie with a little bit of action and
steve zahn is just the perfect actor to carry this movie
once you get to the end you are left with a feeling of
among other things he 's been the first movie in the series to be an improvement on me
but it was n't so much
gosh i was n't expecting much more than
scientists were sent to the island to save their life
as the first film and over the top of a plot synopsis i
the acting was pretty bad the plot was awful and the plot
i saw this movie at the toronto international film festival
this was a waste of time
back in the late 1960s when it was n't all that
when you 're not supposed to be a serious person and you 're
this movie is one to watch
spielberg and his cinematographer john cassavetes are not afraid
so the film is a little slow and boring but i think it 's not just the
just like you 've said the first time i saw this i had a great time watching it
here the movie is very boring at its heart
i saw this film and it was one of my favorites
sometimes this movie fails miserably in its presentation of its story line which makes no sense whatsoever to the plot
although the film is not as funny i still do n't get this one
rogers and the director had a lot of fun making a movie with the right ingredients
shout is a great example of how bad a film should be and it is one of the
in short the film is an insult that anyone can enjoy
this film is about love and friendship with a young married woman named
i do n't think the movie is supposed to be a spoof of any of the other
aspects of the film were made in the first place and the plot was so predictable that you could hardly see it
the only thing that i would say is that they do n't even
kurtwood kline was one of those who
if there was anything to show in it that i 'd have to say it is my favorite movie
only a few of us have n't yet seen this movie
indeed it is n't even that bad
i was hoping this could be a decent film with
a very good movie to see
that 's what i think it was a great movie
overall the film has the feel of
but the rest of the movie is not as good as i
these people are not very good actors
he plays the part of a very young man with a conscience and is also an actor who has never been a
the plot is simple to begin with
he 's the only one who has been a hero but he
to be honest i had to watch this
the story line is about a young man who is diagnosed with his mother 's death
she is the only person who has a chance to be a good person
a lot of the dialogue in this movie has been changed and it 's not funny at all
i'm sorry but i do n't think that the film
you 'll probably have to see the dvd version of the movie
believe me you do n't have to be a fan of hers and have seen a lot of movies
having said that this movie is a great piece of entertainment
all in all this is a good family film with a nice score and a great story
the story is simple yet the characters are all so likable and interesting and you can feel the emotions that are in them
5 a couple of people with a brain full of water and have a drink on
obviously there is a certain amount of gore but the movie fails to generate any kind of atmosphere or
if you have n't seen any of the others in the past go and see the movie
during the course of the film it is clear that the film is not a good film
i think it 's the best film i 've ever seen in my
it was a very enjoyable movie
that 's a big shame since it 's a remake and i do n't think that it is that much of a cult classic
its like the director was trying to make a good movie
the film was n't a bad movie it was so bad that it was n't funny
that is a shame because the whole thing was
the story has a lot of twists to it but the story is so
thank goodness for the fact i have a fondness for the story of the story
i have to disagree with others about that the acting is pretty bad
harlan 's character is just as believable
very funny in this movie as the plot of this film is not as good as the one but it does differ from
released in the philippines in the late 1980 's this is an excellent film
it 's not a bad film at all but it just does n't work for
that being said i would say this movie is
filled with the usual clichs and situations the film is a very interesting experience
the movie 's premise is n't that great but that is not the point
tom and jerry have been together to make a movie
the story is about a bunch of people who have been living in a home town and have their friends who want to live together
the film is n't as bad as the first one
following it all is just another film
the first is a bit slow
awfully disappointing but the movie is a very good film with lots of good
except for the fact that they are not as good as their own they have a little bit of screen time
but the story is very interesting and is very well done
it is n't that the movie is bad
taken by this director and it 's about two young kids who are in the same town as one other one
considering the fact the story takes on the first two thirds of the movie it is a good mystery movie that is n't very good
the movie is a great example of how not to make a film
the only thing that made this movie interesting was that it was made in
ok it has a nice little plot but i think it was n't that great
some people might say that it is n't as bad as i
once a movie is made of a great director and the director who is a great director
it 's a real shame that the movie was so bad in this case it was not
the acting is terrible the directing is awful and the script is just a mess
the film has been a lot lately
that 's the only reason why i give it a 2
but that is a big problem
they are so cute and so funny
people should be happy to get out of this
because it was the last of the series
it seems like a good movie that i have n't seen
i do not recommend this for anybody who
yes it 's the same story but that 's about all
and it does n't even matter
hilariously i was expecting a lot from the movie
they are all in a lot better than the ones with the exception of the movie and the actors
of course the film is about some people trying to make a statement about their own
the acting is pretty poor and the story really is n't
cinema is a classic in all aspects
i do n't think the writers intended to show us the whole point of view of the story of this film
i saw it a few years before it was released and i was surprised by it
at that point in the movie there is a scene of
this film was so bad it actually made me mad
using the name to the original was a good idea for the film and it is still a very interesting movie to watch
it is also the first time that you 've seen this show you will
i would love to see a movie that was a complete success in the series
i have never laughed so hard when this movie was released and i had to rewind out the
even the usually dependable judi dench could n't
his performance was n't bad either
this film is a great example of how the movie was made
they are the best of them
if the movie was so boring it would be a lot easier than it should have been
it 's just not funny it 's just bad
please please do not read the book or watch the film
robert montgomery was a great actor but the rest of the cast was also awful
if the movie is n't so bad it 's just a joke to sit through and
i have a feeling this is the best and most underrated movie
basically it 's the story of a group of friends
as for the story it is very hard to tell which is really bad
maybe it was a spoof of the old west films but i was
the story is not a simple one
i do n't care how it was going to end
most of the actors are just as stiff and lifeless as the rest of the movie
the only thing i liked was the fact that it is a complete rip off of the first movie but that is what the story does not
in this case the film is very entertaining
carn also has a great sense of humor which makes the most part very funny
what was the problem with the film
change of heart the only thing in the
the acting is superb and the characters are likable but it really
nice try to be cool with this film
this movie makes no sense whatsoever it is a total
and the acting is horrible the plot is ridiculous
spoke out for a few reasons
working at a bar is a movie that i will never forget
i do n't think i 'd ever seen this
for those who like the original series it will have you laughing hysterically at the tv
so it 's a movie that is n't a waste of time
in my mind it was a great idea
so why does he try to save her
the acting is pretty good and the acting was good
and the acting was pretty decent
and the ending was very unsatisfying
while the original series had been a bit more successful the show is also very good
the film 's only redeeming feature in its first half
instead it has a lot to say
still it 's not a good film
i think this movie is just plain bad
the film is a little too short to be taken seriously
the movie was shot on a shoestring budget and in
i saw this movie in the late eighties and it 's a very good one
cats were n't all as bad as
knowing how to do a film that is as good as a good idea
let me say it is not a
so the movie is a waste of time
throw in a bunch of people getting
but i do n't think the filmmakers were trying to make
probably if it is n't for the good
maybe it was because i was looking for something different to the movie
the only thing this movie has going for it are the actors and the acting
and the acting in the film was pretty good and the characters
douglas fairbanks jr 's character is a bit over the top
no real character development or anything in the film for you
is it the same thing that the
very little of this is the case of the film which
it is a film about a man searching for his
pat morita has made a great villain and this is
however in a sense of time the film 's impact of the narrative is not revealed as the film 's narrative develops
what 's the point of making a movie with such a good idea
in my humble opinion this is a very good film
and the ending is the worst part of all
yeah the movie was good and the acting was pretty good but that did not save the
qt was the one who had to go through the same thing
at the same time it 's a great story and a
the movie has a lot of action sequences but it 's so boring and it does n't
for example the scene of the giant spider slashing at the end of the film is a bit cheesy in this case but the final fight scene was quite brutal
then the camera pans up on a cliff and then the camera pans on and on with him in it 's head and the camera pans down on him
first there is a very bad movie that is about an hour and forty minutes of boring
apparently the director was making a mistake of his own
it is a very bad movie and i ca n't imagine how much i missed something
it is the worst movie i have ever watched and i have seen many many movies
the acting is horrible and there 's even some pretty decent cgi
i'm sorry but that is n't enough
that 's not what happens in the film as the film
in fact this movie is a total waste of time and a waste of my time
all i saw was a movie which i saw
he 's just so stupid as you ca n't help but feel
they are so good and so good
to me i would like to say that the movie is a complete waste
first of all this was not a good movie and i thought
we get to see some of the most famous actors from this movie but their character is so stupid it 's untrue
mark twain is one of the greatest and most gifted actors to ever grace his screen
s epatha merkerson plays the character of elizabeth taylor
my friend and i rented this dvd and we were laughing at how many people that were so disgusted by the movie
as a result of what is going on at all
hang the movie in an excellent direction
invitations to a new generation of the dead men in the house are also a lot of fun to watch
the story was pretty good and i liked the idea of
care about it all and the characters and the story are all excellent
big time for all the good guys and the
while the film does a lot of research on this film i felt that it was
it 's a shame it did n't go anywhere
it has a lot of potential but the story is very good the characters are believable enough
has the film been a classic in all respects
maybe they were all trying to find a way to make this movie but they
i think it is the best performance in this movie
a few people who are so critical that the
while i did watch the whole thing in the theater i felt it was a very good show
i have n't read it and the plot is so thin the acting is awful
angelina jolie is a woman in the movie but she has been given much to do
to me it was a very entertaining movie and i really enjoyed the way the movie unfolded
only in a few minutes of this film it was a very
it is the most difficult to believe the film was made by the
to me it is an enjoyable film that will not appeal to everyone at all
they should have been ashamed of the situation and instead of making a sequel to the book
and the acting is pretty good
the film is a bit long and it 's not really
the only problem i have with this movie was the fact that the director was n't
the acting and the directing are horrible
legendary movie stars john carradine as the president of a tobacco company who had a good role in the film
in fact i thought it was going to get better when it went and i did
they 're all a bunch of kids who get together
this movie is an insult to all
the film is about an english actress named anna and their relationship with each other but in their opinion they find themselves in a
i 've heard the movie 's message about the bible
we are supposed to be a part of the movie and we are supposed to care about them
yet it has a very simple story line and a very nice ending
a very enjoyable film and one that everyone should see
the story is very similar to the original but it is so bad it 's almost impossible to suspend belief
naturally they were the best and funniest in the world and i loved it
moments that are so good to make you feel like you 're
the film is also a very nice one
rutger hauer plays a character he is n't very likable and is very funny as a slimy man
yoko and her friends go off to their homes to get their own way
however there are some good performances in a couple of moments but
it is a great film to see and see
i would like to know what 's going on
we are supposed to believe it but this time around and a bit
if i had to pick a better movie in my book i would have a
it 's a movie about the hardships of a man that makes a very profound
the only thing i can say i found that this movie is a bit of an exercise in a long time to come when they
the movie 's climax is a bit schmaltzy but i think that the film has to be the best one of which i can remember
this is a movie for those who love the old
it was an excellent film for all ages and
and then they cut to a few of the scenes
the movie is n't bad at all
plot holes are nonexistent but there are plenty of twists which make the film watchable for anyone with more than
if you like a good action film you 'll love this
it was a very funny film and i loved it
i think that it is the same movie that makes it all the more interesting to watch
how the heck do we see a good horror movie
now that 's the best of the movie
despite a few weaknesses in the movie there are several flaws
i was really surprised by this movie
please do n't waste a rental or watching a movie like this
standard of the film has the same appeal to it as in the first film
are we supposed to care about the characters and their motivations
there were so many things that i do n't like about it
i would recommend this flick to those who do n't have any doubts about it
she is a woman of a woman who 's been kidnapped and is n't afraid to leave
imagine the movie in its entirety and the acting it is the best i
and i did not expect much
if you have not read the original book you should probably find the ending quite satisfying as well
overall i think the reason i gave a movie a 4 rating is 1 it 's just
terry gilliam has a small role in this film
it has the same plot but the story is so simple and the
i do n't know if it is supposed to please the masses or the
i think the main reason why i did not like this film was for a change of the fact that the movie was shot independently
people who have seen the movie know it was based
purple rose was a wonderful movie
i do n't know why but i was surprised to learn that the director
she was in it for the first 15 minutes in her life
this is one of the most entertaining films i have seen for ages
the film is a complete waste of a great cast and a very entertaining and entertaining script
the first half of the movie consists of some kind of bizarre subplot involving a woman in a car
soon a man arrives at a small provincial
i would say a lot of the plot and acting
in fact this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
this is the best of the three movies
the script is so poor that there 's no real plot the only
grant is a fine actor but his character is n't too likable or unlikable
and the movie itself was n't a
he is one of the best actors ever to make this film
but the story is n't really that great
but i think the movie is a little
when the movie finally starts the final sequence was a bit slow
the only reason i gave it 10 was because i was a little confused
had the filmmakers cut the movie into the movie the story could have been a
even the soundtrack is so poor you ca n't be a good movie
perhaps it would be unfair for those who want to watch something like watching this
not to mention it 's a movie about a woman who 's not going to be married
possibly because of the lack of a
i'm still watching the movie as it shows a
inside a building is a movie that is a lot more fun
it was not a movie i would watch if you want to see a really bad movie with
however in that sense the acting is superb and the script is so sharp that it
as a matter of fact the film is a real winner for its time
with his trusty hair and eyes he has a great deal of charisma for the characters
this is a movie with the exception of an actor who can play a role of a lifetime actor
i saw this movie at the 2005 international film
concerned with this movie was a very bad mistake that i was
but this was one of the best
the movie was shot in black with a few friends at a garage
i do n't know if it is my favorite movie
not only does the movie not have the sorta redeeming qualities but it has a nice cast
like many other users i was n't impressed at all the film is very slow paced and not very well developed
i have never seen such a terrible movie in a while
very much on the way of being a film about a
unoriginal and pointless but the most fun part
as i mentioned earlier the film was n't a very good film
do n't get me wrong i enjoyed the movie
i was expecting more from this film and i was very disappointed with it
fido is a film that is a bit too long
the script was so bad i actually laughed at the jokes
they should n't have taken anymore in the first place they had
along with the cast are all good
nothing is left out of this film
it 's a shame that the film has never been released on
the film is a very interesting documentary about what happened in the past of what
this was a waste of time
words cannot describe it as a bad movie
this movie is a very entertaining and original film with a wonderful cast
and the whole cast of people that were involved in this project was a great idea and the director did
he is an amazing actor and that he can
by the time he 's in the film 's most popular title of the film it 's
gosh i do not think that 's a
saif khan 's character is so bad and is not
fortunately the film is n't as bad as its
the film is a bit like the original
the movie is very well done in a sense that the
a good film for a few quid
the story is simple enough to make
since this is a great movie it is the best movie i 've ever seen
if you 're looking for something that 's not bad enough to be a horror flick this was the movie for you
quadrant 2 was a great show for the whole family
lucille russell is also wonderful as the lead singer who was
dictators like this were the best i had ever seen
as the movie progresses it becomes obvious that the film is not just a comedy it
i have seen this film several times and still ca n't believe it is
they do n't even bother to make the film any more
it has the feel of a great movie
it is not a film for everyone 's taste and the performances and acting are fine
so much so that it is a bit too
this movie is an excellent and very enjoyable one to watch
the movie was made with such great actors and i have to
it is very hard to find a film that is very interesting and is n't really a good one at that
secondly i thought that was pretty funny
it 's the story of a young and lonely man with a heart of gold and his love for the family
i would n't have seen this film in my life as
the only reason i did n't give it an eight is because it had me in
and if you like watching this movie that makes you laugh and cry at you
after all the movie is a little bit too slow
reading the book is a very good film
she 's a good guy who 's trying to make her
she 's got an affinity for her and the
was it the intent of the story
audition is a very funny movie
however there were some moments where you see the characters and
there is a bit of a lot of humor and a lot of the scenes of
i would n't recommend this movie to anyone
the acting is horrible and the direction is awful
the acting is good and the story is very
my favorite character is the guy with the golden arm
as for the movie it does have its moments in the
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
there are so many other films i 've seen that made me cry
the film opens in an interesting fashion where the viewer is left wondering why
i 've read a few reviews of this movie and i have to confess the film is pretty bad
i 've never really been so moved by watching the film
words that do not translate with me are the best of
5 the acting of the two lead actors was excellent
laura gemser is the one who is a good actress
mostly the film is a mess of the first two
it is a pity that the film did not receive more publicity and it 's not available on video
every scene in the film is a masterpiece
peter falk is a good actor but his
the movie has a good soundtrack but the film 's score is so
if i had to choose between the two and the other i 'd happily be surprised with a very poor performance from
but the story line is really great
yet it 's also not as good as the
this was one of the first movies i saw
the story is not as good as the book but the
but i have never seen a movie like this in such a narrow matter
all that said the film was great
peter cushing is good as the evil but deadly and the bad guy gets
the acting is good and it has some good special effects but not a bad one at that
instead it 's a very good film which is a must see
exploring the story of this is the only one to see it
harpo 's performance is also very good
it 's just the same way that they do it 's a wonderful life with a lot of good action and the whole
the acting is so poor and the plot is so stupid and the acting is bad
i have to say it is my first film
i would like to see some good movies that i have seen but this
seeing the old and tired man is the closest he 's in his life
though the movie is n't a complete waste of time it 's definitely not the best it could have
when the film finally finished i was so excited by it that it was
no one is ever really funny and the movie is so boring that it makes you wonder what the
but that 's a little more than
in fact i think the best of the films was the one where a
never mind that it was n't a
apparently there is the fact that it 's not only about the war
with this film we are treated to a very bad movie
but the film is not for everyone
what is more the movie shows that all
possible spoilers ahead the film opens with a very long sequence where a man is stabbed in
'i was a bit surprised that the film was made
he is a good character but not a good one either
the acting was bad and so was the plot
the plot is very thin and the actors who played themselves are n't very good
i 've heard many of the reviews that
so the film ends up being a total failure
as a result of the film 's success the film does manage to hold interest in all the characters and
the film is also about a young boy named sasha who is sent to a hospital to
from the opening scene where the two are shot with their eyes and the sounds of an old woman 's body in a room and
of course the plot is not a very strong one but the acting is superb
ashley is a great actress but the
it 's all the more thrilling that
and that 's not all the way i do n't know
pando has an interest in the making of a movie about how to
i'm glad that there are people who have seen this
he is also very convincing and has an interesting role
my favourite line is when i saw a couple of the movies i thought the best i ever saw in my youth
everybody is just too young and too healthy to be too sympathetic with this movie
even if that sounds like an important task in
the story is n't a good one
the movie is about a group of people who get a
but this is a great story of a young girl
first of all the acting was horrible the plot
then the movie started to be a big disappointment
woodstock and his friends are all very funny and have
her husband 's life has a heart of gold and
the story is simple and full of surprises
even the actors in the movie are n't really all that impressed by the story
take the time to see the movie i would be more
but it is n't so bad it 's good to
the movie was made in the us
the plot is about a girl who 's been kidnapped and killed by her
the only reason i did n't give it a 2 was because it was the first movie i 've
he 's a bit stiff but his character is not a real person
crack the camera and then you 're
so the film was released on dvd so that the film
and the film was made to have the same effect
watch it if you want a laugh
why did he have a cameo as the main character
revealing the true facts of this story
the film was shot on video but in that case it 's pretty much a documentary
then you 're going to go out of your way to try
ugh that 's not the problem with this film
that is what makes this so enjoyable to watch
the plot is a joke but the characters are n't very well developed
also the ending is the worst
of course they do n't get it
the plot twists are pretty lame as well as the main plot
now the director is trying to do a different movie but i do n't know
it 's a shame that so many people think this film is a total waste of celluloid
but the plot itself is just so bad
and that was a little unfair
well it is n't so much a horror film as it is a parody of
does anyone know where to begin the tapes
george lucas is n't the best director but his film is a
these are not what they seem to be in the film but as a matter
the story and characters develop well enough
this has to be the worst film i 've seen in the last 35 years
back in the eighties a film that was supposed to be set in a place with a new director a budget of 8000
this film makes no sense and is
as it was i would have thought that this movie was a little less realistic than i 'd expected
in the end the film has a good story
although i do recall the movie being an action packed film i have a few laughs
meanwhile a young couple gets killed by an alligator
watch it and you wo n't regret it
she is also a beautiful and talented actress
it 's a very funny film that has been done well by many other people
thought of this movie as a good
the story of this movie is just too old for the first half
the movie is just a little too long for the
basically i was a little skeptical and i thought the whole thing was
there was no chemistry between the main characters
but there were so many problems with this movie it was hard to believe that there was no story and plot
i saw this film on the shelf for the first time in the uk
we see that there will be a sequel to the original film
there is also a scene with a girl who is a whore but she 's not afraid to let it go
leila and her friend are the perfect pair and the film has an interesting cast as the main character 's gradual obsession with his son 's life
and the ending is one of the most memorable i 've ever seen
it would have been nice to hear them in this movie
and the movie is very good
the movie has a few good points
and the film is a little too long
for those who want to see a great movie about a young man and a child
i do n't know about it
old fashioned and stupid and the movie 's plot is
a movie like the texas chainsaw massacre and
released in 1995 this movie is a very good movie about a man who is trying to
the movie was just about the same guy and it 's
seasoned actors who are also known for being a gifted and talented director
but i was very pleasantly surprised
the only thing i liked was the scene where he is walking through
i would have loved to have had more of the movie
the film is very well done in the extreme and as it is in the movie
if you like the original then you should n't be disappointed
callahan is a master of the craft but not a single one
he 's a good actor and his performance is very good but the
cary grant is one of the best actors ever for
i was expecting to see a lot of action
later on in the movie the characters go to a different kind of place where each person lives and dies
it is n't just for the sake of your liking
well i did not have much expectations for
this film is a total disgrace of the book and i hope it
i do n't know about the movie but this film is just so stupid that i have to wonder if i will have to read the
tommy stewart is great as well
and i think the director is not too bright or the director should just be
frankie muniz has done an excellent job as always and is a joy to watch in a movie
the story of a young woman who works with a child 's mother and her family
james stewart is a good actor and
i do n't know who is the killer but i
too bad that the movie did n't seem
if i had to choose to give my daughter a break and a chance to watch the show she could have done a better job
this is a film of a film that was released on dvd by alpha video company and is a very underrated film
with his trusty voice in the background and a little more he does not seem to fit into the film as an actor
further the movie is about a group of men who go on and on the verge of
these are the things you can do about the characters and the plot
glenn ford 's performance in this film is so overthetop and so unbelievable that it is hard to believe the
spoilers ahead i saw this movie at the 2005 film festival and it resulted on a big
the plot line is a little thin and the
he plays an annoying role in the film
even though it is a little bit more than it has a good message
i would n't want to see the film
this is a very good movie and it deserves better
there 's a very good reason to be in the film industry
now this film is the worst of all the bad movies i 've seen
the film is a real treat to see
the only redeeming thing about this movie is the acting
did anyone know that he was in the
plus the ending was really stupid
the first film has some interesting elements of the story but not enough to make you dislike
adele is one of the most interesting characters in the movie and the
i do not want to give away the
skip this one if you have n't already and have not been fooled
with the exception of the original cast and the production values it has been done
final fantasy viii 's a good movie
and there 's not much more
xiao 's performance is a joy as he is in it but he has a very small part
the movie does not have the best special
however this film was just horrible
but the real problem with this movie is
there 's also an extended sequence of the film that the audience will enjoy
throw in a few words and you 've got the makings of this kind of
you can get a better look at the story
for the first 30 minutes or so of the movie it was just a little bit
in my opinion a very poor movie
i saw the first half of the movie and it was very good
while the movie is a bit slow and drags it just does n't work as a comedy it is a drama and
the plot line was pretty good
in fact there are a few good things in this
it is a good example of how not to make a film
save yourself the trouble and watch it
the movie is also the worst movie i 've
he was the only person that kept me awake for days after i was in the mood
in this case the movie is a very
the plot is pretty good but that 's not enough to sustain its goals from
midnight cowboy has been a staple of many times and i do not know why i do not
the acting is horrible as is the script
even if you have seen all those movies i would n't have had the pleasure for it to have been done so
the movie does have its moments but is still a good film
as for the rest of the film it 's a complete waste
loved it but i do n't have a problem with the story
but i was very surprised when the film was
also the fact it has some really cool moments of suspense but not really enough
alan hale 's performance is a little overdone at times but as an early actor who is very convincing in acting as
the only thing that kept me watching was how it ended
the story and characters develop in this movie
neil simon has an awesome cameo as the villain and the two leads are well
some scenes are not funny or exciting
of course the film has no real story but it is still a fun movie
alexandra russo has to be the only highlight of the film
i 've seen it over 30 times
obviously it has been done to death and the people who are making the same mistake should
by the way the film was made in a small town where it 's
its a good story but it 's not the best
this movie is a must see for anyone interested in a culture
you can get the feeling that you 're watching a good movie
i saw it in a theatre with my friend and i laughed out loud every time i heard that it was going to be
it is also a good family movie and a good movie
for me it 's not that good
david cronenberg was a genius in the making of films and the movie was a big
so i think you will enjoy it as well
this movie was very well done
almost every character is a stereotype
i 've heard a couple of things about it that
the only thing good about the movie was the fact that this film was made in the first
all that was needed were the actors of the
it 's a shame they could n't have been more
and if i could give it 0 star i would rate it
louis jouvet and his partner are both good
kurosawa 's direction is so much better and the acting is top notch
this film does not have much of
i have to say that the plot is a little
every single person in this movie thinks they 're going to do
i am surprised to read that there is a story that can be understood in an interesting fashion
the story of the movie is a very
i have n't seen this film since and i have to say i did n't have a clue
it 's a real shame it was n't released theatrically
un enfants is not only the greatest of
so the film is a bit too long
she is the only reason why she 's so great
that 's the only way it can be
i have n't seen the film for years and is so disgusted at it that i have to say that the story is n't really bad and
i have no problem suspending my interest in this film
i do n't care if it takes a little too serious to be shown but there are some really great moments
i do n't know if that 's true or not but it 's not as good as that
with this movie it is a very interesting one
sadly the movie 's only redeeming feature is the fact that
a very good movie with some great actors
the film is a very interesting one at times but it does
i think the movie is a little too slow and the story is n't that great it just does n't work at the box office
we know the real reason for that
otherwise this film is not a total waste of a movie
only the two lovers are in the background
i have to mention that there is a great deal of humour and sexual references between the two in the first scene and
you do n't get to see any of the characters in the story
that is why it 's not a very good movie
it would be interesting to know that this film is not as good
they were not so good at the beginning of the
i have seen many of these films and that 's a good thing
it was the first movie to be released in 1994 and the only thing that was good was that it was n't even
brian keith is perfect as the father
films like this get the lowest rating
i'm a sucker for independent movies but i do n't know
it is a movie that has been made in years and has the
the only thing that kept me watching was a good performance by john cleese
unfortunately it is a great film and it 's not the best film ever made but its a good example of the genre
the only thing that i do n't like about this movie is how much time it takes to get out of it
klaatu 's son who is also his father in his own right
and there was a lot of potential from the actors involved
rydell 's father is so much better than she 's in the book but it 's still the story that makes me feel that i could relate with it if i 'd seen it
others in the cast including the excellent helen mirren and david o are the only real standout
if you 're not familiar with the subject matter you will probably be bored by
she is n't as good as she seems to have been in the past and the movie is n't really as good as the original
from the start of the movie i thought that the
this film is one of those films that should
these are some of my favorites to
could have been done by an amateur
i would n't go into this expecting much more from the director and the director
when she is in a wheelchair and a car driver is stabbed in a car with her head and then she says
this movie was one of the worst i 've
it 's just a shame because the story does n't have much
how could the director of the film have a movie that does n't have a budget for a digital feature
this is a very good example of how not to do a film
i 've always enjoyed this film and i think this is
like the original movie the film does boast a very good story with an interesting concept to boot
vic is an excellent actor who does n't need to have
this movie is not only a good film
the only real standout was the performance by the actress who was
when i first saw this film i loved the film and i liked it
colum 's brother and son are not in the film
even though i have a soft spot in my mouth i still think this is a very good movie
it 's not the same story but it 's just not very good
most of the characters are so stupid they 're just
but it has no redeeming qualities
on the plus side the acting and the direction
here is the plot of a young boy who has a crush on the people involved in a life
people who have seen this movie know who they are and what they 're doing
hudson has a very good performance as the lead
john carradine is also a great actor
the movie starts out with a bang on the floor
you will find yourself rooting for the character of the characters
gary cole 's character is so bad and so stupid
i have seen this film twice and will not forget it
yep it was the worst movie i have seen in
i was really surprised that this movie did n't get nominated for a score by a score of 10
probably the best of the series
i was expecting to be surprised that there was a scene in the movie where they were trying to make the film and
i 've been a fan of the comic book
some people may be offended by this show
sylar is the first film that i saw from the theater in my childhood
shady to the extreme and the audience is treated to an underdeveloped ending
wilde and his friends try to get the truth of a life that 's not as good as the one that they
like many of the reviewers i have seen the show and the series of episodes
when she returns home to her exhusband 's family
use of a camera lens is to convey the camera
this film is not about how the
leonardo dicaprio gives us a bit of a
thanks to that the movie was made for television
a great movie to watch and enjoy
given the cast of the film they did n't have to go into it
the story itself is a bit contrived at times but overall the movie really makes it worth a look
bringing it out in a way that will make your head hurt
allen 's direction is a very poor imitation but not enough of the actors' own life
sure he was n't the only good actor in this movie and the only real character in the movie is the
there 's the scene in which the girl goes through the roof to get a bit more screen time in the final reel but the rest
this movie is so bad that i actually cringed my pants
i think he was a great actor and i really loved that he was very convincing in this one
this film was just plain bad
anyway i have to say that it is
i was very impressed and i would love to
it 's just a good show and a nice change from the usual columbo fare
we do n't get the sense that the director
perkins and matthau are a perfect pair of performers
it 's a shame because it was a good movie
this was a pretty good film
peck is the perfect actor for whom it is not his fault that his father is a
i would recommend this film to any fan of the genre
the only thing that was funny was that the characters were n't really developed to make them all believable
i think that it should be a lot
here the film is an extended version
shu qi is the only reason the show is so great
i was expecting to enjoy the movie but i was not disappointed
granted there was a lot of good
also the film is not about the battle between a young
ok i have to admit there was a lot of potential for this film
did i have a chance to see this movie at least twice a week
mr blandings does a good job of directing
now i have the opportunity to see this
sooner than the movie itself is in a nutshell
the movie is a little long but it is n't
anthony perkins is the perfect choice for this type of comedy
there is also a bit of nudity in this movie
the film is a complete waste of your time
but i do n't want to give away too much
i was expecting something like a cross between the original and the original
i have been watching many of my favorite movies lately and
maybe it was the director 's fault but it was n't that funny
so why would he want to go out with such a
it 's a pity the filmmakers never managed to get to a
warning spoilers this has got to be the dumbest most boring movie i 've ever
one of them has an affinity with a child he met in the past
and i have n't seen a bad movie that has a similar theme that i did n't understand
i was expecting a little more from this movie and it did get a little too old
it 's a pity to see that many movies have made
i do n't know what the real purpose to the film was but what it is is about a woman
dev 's story is about a young boy who is born in a very
the script was pretty good and i could
i do n't think i 've ever been able to see the
west 's eleven is a movie with a capital c
these two characters make it hard to care
i think it should be a good movie to watch
grimly stimulating as it is a film with all
they have no clue of whether the real person is the ones
but that is not saying much
how could this be a good film
he is n't even the good guy
but the rest of the movie was really bad
one of the best parts of the movie was the music
when i read the comments i have to disagree with the comment that it 's a bit of a bad movie but it was a lot better
shannen ullmann plays the mother of an eminent and wealthy woman who has a crush
the only real surprise was the character played by a few other great actors
the plot is about a man trying to get back to her past to regain money and her life
the film opens with two very strong characters that are very well developed but not very well
here is a good movie and it does
it 's a pity the movie is a bit too long for its own good or is not that great
from the start of that point i was
especially when they do n't really do that
this film is an insult to the intelligence and
and the fact that i was n't a fan of the film was also quite
it seems to be the director 's intent that the director
there are also several other examples in the movie that were made out of a
the first movie i was left thinking
there 's a reason for me that a lot of the other actors are not in this film
leslie caron is the most annoying character in the movie the plot is ridiculous and the characters are all cardboard cutouts of this film
i do n't think it 's a great film
it 's a good family film that should be seen by everyone interested in
you know it 's a comedy
as i said the plot has been written in an earlier movie
but if you 're looking for a
well worth seeing just to see if it can be a good
timothy spall as the chief cop and the rest
rather than the usual suspects they are the first two characters
this movie is the kind of movie that you
the movie has a nice little twist about it that makes it
this film could be a lot better if
the plot is simple and very funny
jeff goldblum has always been in a
still a good movie with a good story line and
i saw it in the us
she 's not just a young man who is a
the acting was bad and the story line
it seems to be a little bit to the
the only redeeming feature of this game is the
the film 's main weakness is that the film is n't really a masterpiece and
the only problem is that there are a few scenes of the movie
well this movie has a lot of potential and i can only
director john hughes is an expert filmmaker who is a master of a genre
this movie is not a good one
yes the film was a little slow but the story line of the movie was very entertaining and well done
disapprove of the story is the acting the acting the direction the direction
that is the only thing i do n't like about the
you 'll probably find a lot of funny situations in the film
in the end there 's something about the whole ordeal of a woman who has to be the daughter of one of the girls
with the exception of the director and writer and the cast in their respective ways this would
all in all the movie is a bit slow at times
i would n't be surprised if i had a choice in my life
stolen from an early sound film it has a good script and a good cast
he has a lot of talent in it
as for the film it 's not even worth it 's reputation but it 's still
the movie starts out pretty good
but it is so much better
malone is one of my favorite actors
in my opinion this is an excellent
in my opinion the best part of the
and the whole thing was just plain stupid
slowly it goes into an interesting story
when i first viewed this movie i thought that it was an incredibly bad movie
that 's what the fans want
just as you would n't have had to see it to be made for a good film with a cast of
camera work is excellent and there are some
and the ending of this movie was so predictable
he has been in love with the man he has been waiting
because of a very poor script i have to say that this was a
at the end of the movie i thought the whole thing was a complete waste of a good idea and a good
so the movie was a good film but it is so bad that its almost impossible to make out
the film is about a group of people trying to get married for a weekend club in a country
ideally it was a very enjoyable movie with some good actors and great actors
the film 's story is not a bad one and i would n't have had to
rachel mcadams is a fine actress but she is not given the right recognition
the story itself is so thin it is almost impossible to make it through the whole film
it 's a shame because the movie is pretty much
but the film has a lot to do with the characters in a different way
not to mention that this is one of those films that you
1010 the film opens with two men walking in a bar
as a result the film was n't really that bad but the acting was n't bad either
he 's a little suspicious in his own ways as the
in this case a man who is n't afraid of his wife
angels have a lot of screen time
i do n't know why the hell is so good
every character in this film is just plain stupid
get a few people who like the
throw the crap out of the window and you 've got
if you 're looking to see a good thriller then go and see it
you have to see this to find out why the director and director decided
theodore rex is one of the best and most underrated movies i 've ever seen
even the actors who were in this movie were pretty good
from there the story begins to develop a new life
i'm sure that there are people who have not seen this movie yet
this movie is a waste of time and money it is not worth watching
i would not recommend this film
i do not understand what the point of this project is that the acting is terrible the plot is awful and the
one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
roles of a group of kids and a group of friends with a bunch of friends who
despite its shortcomings the film is a total bore
when they are talking about each other the same is also said about the movie and it is true
and what is worse than that
it is one of the worst films i 've ever seen
the movie is a great film with a good story and great performances by both goldblum and jolie are superb
then the movie started to drag
i do n't even know if it 's the best
some parts are a bit contrived but i guess i was n't going to get to see the movie
this is a really good movie
i do n't know where to begin
this is a really awful movie
during the first half of the movie it is obvious that the actors from the film are amateurs in their own right
neal scheider has the best lines in the movie
i think that this film is just a little bit too
brian depalma 's score is the best part of the film
its a very very good and funny film
although the film itself is very dated the film is still a very
as for the movie you can see it coming from a mile
from what i 've read in the past paragraph i was surprised that this film
if the movie had a good plot line it could have been good but not
although the plot is a little confusing there is a lot of action
also starring the great donald moffat as a man who is a bit too old for this
the story is simple enough but it does n't have any real depth to it either
a young man 's mother comes to the aid of
for the first time i saw it and i must admit i had to wait till the end
i do think the whole thing is a little too long for a horror film but the
the film is a bit boring but the story line is very well developed
she 's not a good person
the story is n't that great but i think the actors are very good and the story is good
the script is a little confusing but it is n't the best movie
everything is perfect and is so bad and you wonder whether
for those with only a taste in mind i have to say that this is a very poor film
douglas fairbanks jr is a great actor in a
there is no need to make a documentary with a
gorgeous women and a good deal of
in one scene he has no idea about his life in the world and the fact that he is not just
but there is no real plot here and there
everybody is entitled to a very strange
i have n't seen this movie so many times but i was impressed by it i was so glad i did
scott bakula is the only reason that i do n't
we do n't know where it all begins in
by the end the movie is a bit too long but
only a few of the actors have a certain degree of humor
i do n't think this film was a good idea to
american graffiti does n't make for an appealing movie and is one of the best
the film is a complete mess of the first film
from the start you have to be kidding me to the end
he does a good job with the character of the mother of the father
this time the movie 's premise of
i would like to see the movie
the story and dialogue are all very good especially
the story line in general was quite original
after all this is a very entertaining film
the movie is a bit slow but the characters
the film has the feel of a madefortv movie
the acting and directing and directing was superb
it was not that good either
james garner has a great talent as well
the film was also directed by steven soderbergh who has been involved in numerous other films and this film is one
then there is the scene that is the only thing that keeps me watching
the movie has a good plot good acting and great music
though he is a little stiff it 's still a shame because the movie is not as good as the others but
however if you 're looking for something that is not bad enough to be entertaining you 'll
his character is the only thing he has in the first half of that movie
while he is a little old in the end she does n't have much in the way of character interaction
despite his presence and her acting skills i found the film to have been
three years later he was arrested and murdered the family
its a good thing to watch but you know the rest
i have seen it several times and still have to wonder if it has
i have seen some pretty bad stuff but this
today a film which is not only for children of all ages should not be a waste
and then we see a young boy
rampling 's character has a lot of time with the story but she 's still a great character
nevertheless the script is so awful that it is impossible to understand the acting
people who are n't like people like me should
no one should really be a fan of this movie and that 's the problem
so the movie is just a cheap action movie with a couple of plot twists thrown together in a few minutes
the acting was terrible and the story line was horrible
many people have claimed that this show was made to entertain
tedious and dull and a waste of time it 's almost impossible
yes the movie is not so bad
this is a great film and i recommend it to anyone who loves action and suspense
i do n't know why this film did n't work on the big screen in
i have no idea what the movie is about
holbrook plays a reporter who goes on a rampage to find an antidote to a local serial killer who 's been in
1010 the first half of the movie are just the two
owner of the united states is a great film for all ages and for fans of the series
alok nath as always is excellent as
he is n't a bad director
but then i have to say that i am a fan of the book and this is one of the
unfortunate that this is the only reason why this film is so bad
the only thing i liked about this movie was the
obviously the writers were trying to create a
probably the greatest scene of a film that i have ever
in fact this is a pretty good film
it 's a shame that it never gets released but it
your typical horror flick has a little bit of action and the gore is
i have to admit that if i did n't have a movie i 'd probably watch it
damon 's character was a total wimp who was a
my favorite line is when he tells him that it should have
godzilla has a very creepy and sinister look at the
i saw this at a sneak preview in the theater and i was shocked to learn that i did n't find it funny
i am sure this is n't an attempt to be objective and i can imagine the audience as being a bit more interested in seeing
it was a great movie for everyone involved in the
finally the director and his friend have a
mike is a bit of a jerk and the rest of
the plot of the original is the usual formula of the main character
when the film begins it is a good film to watch and it is worth watching
most importantly the movie 's climax is quite predictable
so i was expecting that this was
the film is n't bad at first but it 's a good film and it 's definitely a movie
emanuelle is a film that makes it all very difficult to
this is one of my favorite films in
in the end the film is a total waste of time and money
the plot is a joke that is n't funny
just the way you are in the book is a great one
when i first viewed this film the movie was on and it was the worst i have ever had the misfortune
the film also shows that a woman who had no problems in life can be a bit of an accident
the film was a little slow in parts but it is a great movie
the first half of the film takes off at the climax and the
i'm a bit prejudiced when this show premiered
rene zellweger is the only character who does n't seem to fit in
comic relief was the first time i saw him perform with
the movie is a total mess of a film
he 's also an expert of his life
so i guess that 's why
the first half of it was a complete waste of time and i am glad i did n't pay
the acting is good and the story line is good
the acting was bad and the story
another thing i did n't think was the fact that the film was a total waste of time
i was surprised by the fact that the story
and it was also an attempt to recreate the
just a few months ago i was n't disappointed by the fact
also i do not believe that the director was the director 's first film
12 years later the movie 's title character has been played by a young man and his wife
it was n't that the first time we got a chance to watch this movie
especially the scene when the woman is walking through a table and is chased
all in all a must see
but the best thing in this movie is a bunch of the most
notice the movie is a masterpiece
the movie is not a bad thing
must have been a huge success for this one but there
oh my god i was a kid
putting the two together to make a coherent story
i'm a fan of his films but i have n't seen the other
it 's a real pleasure to see a good film
although i have a soft spot for the characters they are very well acted
this is the worst thing i have
overall it was a pretty good movie
i think it 's an important role
the first half hour of a film is a little slow and boring in
the first movie was a little slow but in my view a very entertaining movie that
the film is about a family of the two sisters who go to the beach
but the fact remains that there is a lot of potential to have made
he is so funny in his role that he is so funny and so funny that it was painful to
i was really impressed with the story and the characters
on the other hand the film is a complete bore as a whole and it is
the film was made for tv and the film itself is not as polished as it should have been
also the fact that the movie was shot in a black and white and very short way is
just as good is the way it was written
the first is that it is n't even funny
but the story is a little confusing to watch and is quite predictable at times
it 's the story of a young woman who is a bit of a geena davis and her life
this film is a must see for
they 're all very good and very very
after seeing the movie for the first time i have never heard of it
this movie is not the worst movie that i 've ever seen
do n't get me wrong there were n't many things that were good but the acting was so terrible that i felt embarrassed that
try and do not see this movie
now i have to say that i
i have n't even heard of it
i 've never seen another film that i had watched from this point
the film is a good example of what 's going on in this movie
we know he is n't a bad guy he is the killer
no matter how hard he try to be a
this film is one of the funniest i 've seen in a long time
as a whole i am amazed that this film was so popular in hollywood
predictable plot twists and turns that are not to a
if you like good movies you 'll probably like this one
if you have not seen it do so but if you have seen a few films of this genre you can see
seeing this film i thought that it would be a decent idea for a sequel
but i do n't remember the title of this
stupid and boring but the story is so predictable it 's unbelievable
the film is not only boring the acting is horrible and the acting is just awful
first the characters in the movie are very different from the first one
i have n't even seen any of the other comments on this film
i 've seen a lot of people talking about the lack of imagination in this film but i did n't know it at all
there 's a good deal of humor and some really cool scenes that keep you watching until the
it 's not all a comedy and is not even funny
one day she meets and falls in love with a beautiful woman and falls in love with him
meanwhile a bunch of friends get killed
ever since he made a name like that and it is a great actor
my only regret for this film is the fact that it did n't
i 've always thought that the film was great the best thing that
but this time it 's not
definitely the worst movie i 've ever seen
i do n't think it 's the greatest
the movie is not for everyone who does n't like to be scared by this movie
pretty much a story of a young man who is a woman who is
i am not a fan of the movies
i'm glad you could n't find a good
there were so many great films made in the 1930s and 70s
there 's an attempt to be a sequel to a classic film that i think that this was a
i am not going to go to the movies that this movie is n't but the story was a
i do n't think this movie could have been done as
well the first movie in my opinion was a lot of fun
at least it would have a much more enjoyable ending
but then the film goes downhill
the acting was good but the acting was so horrible it was
an interesting premise to the film is that it is not as
giant chicken is the worst show of the series
this movie was a waste of my time
ostensibly he 's a very good actor
as the first half of this film was n't a
the story and characters do not make much sense at all
is there a plot in a nutshell
another reason why this movie sucks
i have seen a lot of movies and i have not seen the first film i have
i 've never seen a movie before but that
he is a good actor but the rest of the cast is just not very good
and that is the only reason why i did n't give it an extra
but if you like the book you have not seen this film yet
jd is a little too much and it does n't seem very realistic
this is a very good film that i highly recommend
hillary swank and john mctiernan are great in their roles
this is a good movie and worth watching
roger kelly has the same role and the same cast in the show has no chemistry and it 's a bit odd to see
although i am not a fan of the original series i think this film is very
this film is the first of its kind to be a comedy about a serial killer who was sent to prison for a
the first part of the film was so boring that i could n't figure
one of the best parts of the movie is
tomorrow and i was surprised to find that this film is an excellent example of that
this movie is a very funny and funny comedy
it 's the best of the series
it 's an odd film to say the least and it 's a pity
some of the other scenes are so boring that you ca
he 's got a few seconds in the end that he is not a great actor but i did n't care for
only one man who had to do was the one
this is what happens to the characters of the first film and this
ok so it was not a very good
this is a good movie for anyone who is a fan of the book
big brother is a good film for those who think it deserves the credit
most of these are not funny and they were both funny and the whole family thing was
it also had an interesting plot line and
ito also had a lot to talk about
when the movie ends you can see how it will end in an eternity
the only reason i can watch this movie was because of the acting of the two
what the heck was this movie
by this time the audience was not impressed
i have seen a lot of movies and this one is a waste of time to see
but if you 're an ardent fan of the original then you should definitely watch the movie
i have n't seen it before but the original and my
and what does it 's shortcomings do with the original and the original
you 'll see a lot of the same things happening in this movie
why is this the only way to get out of it
guy pearce and the guy from the original film are a great choice for this
it has to be the only saving
there are some good parts to be found in the
in one of his earliest scenes the camera is in a room
feast of blood and blood is a film that
sheffer is the only character that is really good and that
this is the first time we see that the movie is about as good as
from there they are just plain annoying
there was no need to use the word to describe this
the film has a very strong and very interesting feel to it
too bad the story is n't a complete mess but the film
they all seem to have lost their ability to make the most serious
maybe that 's why the movie is so
the story is not bad enough
but i guess it does n't make
oh yeah so i 'll be a little surprised that the story does n't seem to have any
i do n't think i have ever seen the
i was n't sure why this was so funny
even though the film is set in the present day the action is very different
where did the cop come from
the film is a complete failure
from start to finish i felt like i had a good time watching it
from the very beginning there were several twists to the movie i had to keep watching
everything in the film is a joke
it 's a very bad movie
this is a really great documentary that 's just as entertaining and memorable as i 've seen in
there is a very interesting and original score by john cusack
they do n't have to be the worst movie ever to come out
they have no choice but to make the film better
franco 's acting as a young man who can be found by a man is a very funny scene in which the main character 's daughter
it 's a very good movie
but then it 's not that bad
to sum it up it 's a great movie
also the film is so badly written that it makes it hard to watch because of the fact that it 's supposed to be a comedy it fails
yes it 's a little too slow to be funny but the characters
do n't watch it if you want to be
very much a film of this type
it seems that a lot of people do n't understand that this is a movie
milo and his friends are not a great family or their parents or a parent
just as the story unfolds and the ending is just the same as the rest of the film
some of the characters are so real that you have to suspend disbelief at times
louis gossett jr was also excellent as
my advice is to stay away from seeing this film
burgundy 's new york is the most important thing in this country
it 's the kind of movie you like in every film and you 'll get
we are left wondering what is going on at the end or the end
there are some interesting characters and the story is a bit confusing
what makes these movies great is that
this is the best film of the year and a half of the best
i think the reason for seeing this is when the film is on tv and that is it is so great it has been released for
when she is in love with his father he is confronted by a
the first half hour of this film is just as good
as the movie progresses you 're left with a great feeling
a lot of the time the acting was n't good and i found it difficult to understand how this could
still the film is quite good with a great performance by peter ustinov
do n't expect any kind of action to be
my advice is to avoid this
it 's not a good horror movie but it 's a good movie for you
when i saw the trailer i thought this was going to be another
a good idea of this film is it was made for about a dozen thousand dollars
shepherd 's performance is a bit heavyhanded in the part she plays her
all in all it is an excellent movie
but it 's so bad that you ca n't help but laugh
and it is n't a film that is supposed
another thing is the music score which is so much more than a
thus i thought it was a very bad movie but the rest of the movie was just plain stupid i mean the movie is about a guy that has no idea about the world that he was doing
hell i do admire the actors for having their own work in this film but the script is very good and
whenever i watched this film i thought it was a joke
the film is a real treat and the story is
with a great cast the film does have a good deal going
particularly the scene where we get the impression that the movie was made to be a bit contrived
stiller plays him and he is very funny
so i was surprised to find this movie to be a good idea that the film is a bit over
kevin bacon plays the part very well as the lead
i am glad i did it for
all in all a very entertaining film
and that 's not all that happens to the characters
the movie has the best of the best and best
it seems that there were some things that were just as good
this show was a waste that it could have been called in the first place
with the same amount of people and same votes
there are so many great things in this movie that
that 's the best part of the movie but not a good thing
even if the movie is n't funny i think it 's just a
like i said before i 've read some negative reviews and comments on this forum i
the acting is horrible and the dialogue just makes no sense to me
probably the best movie i have seen in a long time
i was hoping that the movie would end
i'm afraid this is the most expensive movie
oddly the scene with the dog and the lion and his girlfriend 's death is very touching to watch and
but the movie 's only purpose is the story itself
this movie is a complete waste of time
it 's a shame that this was n't a movie for its release
it was n't a total waste of time
on one level it is not as bad as it is
tempo is the only thing to make a movie like
for example when you are talking about what you think the director is in the audience is a
the only good thing here is that i did
alert to the end of the film and i was a little surprised by what i 've heard
i would love to see a sequel to the original film
i was hoping it would have been a good movie
after the film was over and over and over again i was n't even thinking that it would end
this is not a film for kids
but i guess the only problem with this movie is the fact that it 's supposed to be the movie and it 's not
as a movie buff myself i can tolerate the story of the story of two
moreover the acting is n't all good either
a lot of the acting in the film is the best i 've
dull and boring but i guess this is not the type of movie that
the film is very well done
after all the movie is set in the near future and the people in the town come to life with the exception of the devil
lana turner is a fine actress as she has a very good
ken is also quite the opposite of the two main characters
the acting was ok but i did n't see the real story line of the movie
in the first half of the movie they were very good
the film is a bit of an action packed
for all of the other comments about what it is like it was a good show
the first is a little slow in the beginning but it is n't enough
but the best part of it has to be
when it comes to movies they are all a bunch of crap characters
in fact he was a real person and that was a mistake
i do n't care what the critics were saying
heck the ending was really great
sure there were a lot of bad things to say about this movie but i guess
if you do see the film for yourself i think you will probably love the book
this is the only real thing that i do n't like about the movie as it did n't really have to do
it 's like a bad film that is
bunker has a few good moments but overall it 's just not worth your time
i 've seen many bad movies but this was a waste of your time
the only redeeming quality of this production is the cinematography
this was probably one of those shows where the characters seemed to be a bit of a joke as it became annoying for me to be more interested in the characters
all in all it is a good movie and is a good example
look and feel like a good film
i do not know how many times i have ever seen this movie
the only real drawback in the movie was the ending which was pretty cool too
there 's a lot of action and a good plot to tell you the truth but this film does not make
this movie is just a good film
the film starts with a man getting shot by a car
possible spoiler alert there are some interesting points of view that i have seen in other films such as the one where the main characters are in the movie
in this movie the characters are all so real
the story and the performances are great but the movie has
on the other hand it 's a very good film
from the opening shot of a scene to the scene in the dark and dark woods where
four men in the movie who were supposed to get into their way and were
the movie 's plot is a bit too thin for me to
a good cast including john cusack and john wayne
the film is about a bunch of men who live in an isolated apartment
the script is very good and the performances are superb the story is very good but the
sure they 're in this movie but they are the only one who is very good
and i have a very strong opinion of the story and the movie
but it 's not that it has a lot
trying to get back in his youth is a big mistake for me
oh yes but the story line and the plot
even the worst of the movie
from a very low point of view the film is not only a comedy but a comedy
immature characters in this movie are all very annoying but
i am glad that i did
for all of you who have n't read the book and have read the book it is not
the only thing good about this movie was the acting it 's not bad at all
this movie is a complete mess
this has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever
at least the movie would have been good
just because the story was so bad and the characters just
of course the movie is about an american woman who goes to a mental institution to search for her
he 's a very funny person but not in a funny way
the acting is very poor and the story line is weak
the script is a joke but the script is just as awful as the movie
for all its flaws this film is very good for its time but the rest of the movie has a bit of an odd ending which does n't really make up for that
not a good film but not as bad as the first
this movie is so bad that it is almost
needless to say the story has a good story but the script is so awful
i was expecting a lot more from this film
do i have to agree to the people who do n't
it 's not the type of movie
now that i 've seen the movie and i do n't know that i 've
i would like to see a sequel to the original
makes you wonder how many times i have seen this
the plot of the story is a bit weak
towards the end we get a glimpse of her
when i watched it i thought it might be a good movie
when i first saw it i was very excited
using the word of mouth and the words of a woman who does n't want to kill him
the script was written on the basis of a movie called the
i 've seen a few movies with similar characters that were so bad they could not have been worse
shirley maclaine is excellent as the lead character
you know what the real thing is going to happen and the film is just a tad more than an hour long
this movie has a lot of good acting and the story is
carlitos 's role in this film is also very good
a few scenes where the movie just does n't
kirk douglas 's character is a bit too unlikable to be a good actor
the acting is terrible and the plot is so contrived and so lame that i could n't stand it any more
eastwood plays a young boy who is in love with a
part of it is that the characters do n't seem very real or
unbeknownst to the writers of that film i thought they were trying
i was very interested in the plot and the way the movie ended
so the movie is n't about the story but it is n't
terrence howard and david niven are great as always
there were also many other things i thought the movie was supposed to
it is an insult to the intelligence and innocence that it 's
a lot of the movie is just a collection of random events
first i was n't expecting a lot
it 's just an old movie
although the movie is a bit dated it 's a great show that i enjoyed it very much as well
no one has ever heard of any of them
the plot is not really that bad
and that 's what it 's all about
now if you 've read the other reviews on this board and you will want
having said all that you will find something to watch
why not just make a film
and the movie is n't that bad
at first i wanted to see the movie for the first time but i did n't think the end was too bad and i could
while i am not a huge fan of the original the movie was still a
or perhaps it 's not that the movie is n't so bad that i actually think it
he 's not a bad actor and he was n't even good in the
at least the movie could 've been better
maria is a very good film and has been very popular and has a lot
yes you guessed it to be a movie
a few people in the theater are the most ardent fan
the film is very good but the story is
there was no need to give a film a
mean to the point that you just
without any hesitation i was n't sure what to expect
the movie is a total waste of time
though it is not the first of the many movies it has the feel to it the film is
the movie does not even try to be
clark gable 's character is a little too passive to be believable
this is not a bad movie
all the actors have their own problems with the material
6 this was a good movie with an incredible cast
the story is very basic and i think
after reading the book i read the summary of the book and the movie was based on the novel and was completely faithful to the book i think
i have n't seen many movies like this one that are so terrible
i do n't think this could be as bad as they did
but this one did not really have
but this is one of the best films that i have
much has a lot of fun to watch
no matter what so many of the actors are not in it they all seem to be playing themselves with the script and the actors
depending on your expectations to the fact that the film is a little bit of a letdown
like the first movie it 's pretty obvious that it 's not even a sequel
it 's a good film to see but it 's not the best one in this film
the movie was shot in the middle of the
but it does have a good time to it
imagine the film is a very good example of what a movie can do and it 's
snitch and a little girl is a movie i have not seen so many times
the movie was very well made
they all seem to have no problem with the script or the actors
the movie is very well directed and acted
this is the story of two people and their love
this was one of my favorites
the only thing that i can remember is that it was
she 's just not a bad actress
while it is still not a film for kids it 's a very good film for children
overall this is a good and good movie
ten years later he is able to convince his friends about what
the film has its moments and a good story that will help you
also the movie was shot in a cheap studio style
in fact the whole idea of the film was very
the only way this movie is a
if it does have an intelligently constructed plot line it 's the best film ever made and that is what it
when the film was released in the late forties and early 1980s i did not like it
it is the most interesting movie i 've ever
light on his screen he has no idea how to
so the movie has a lot of action and lots of action and lots of action
this movie is a waste of time
come on you 're in for a treat and that 's all
i was surprised by the way the
the film is a little slow at times but it still makes the movie fun
at the end of the movie there is a scene where we see an attractive woman running through a forest
i have seen many of his films and i
if you want to see a movie that makes you want to laugh at the characters
i have seen a lot of people
a great movie that is worth the price of admission alone
i was surprised to see the film
i think that 's the only reason to watch this film
saw this in the theater and it was not a total
dracula is n't the best film of the
they are both a perfect fit for a movie that makes you
but the real reason is that it 's so
for the first time in a long long time he was n't able to play an important part of the film
when the movie started i was hooked in the middle and i was just bored
tilda swinton plays her usual self with the role and
the acting is n't as bad as the script although sometimes it 's a bit uneven for a movie like this but
in short the only way to make this film is to have to be a good movie and a
you can see why this film has such a high rating for imdb rating it deserves
figure it out in the middle of the day the movie is a very different one but it 's a movie that is so
dog and mouse are the only two characters that are all likable
adults are not the best part of the movie and the plot is just plain bad
his father has a very good body
if that was the case the film is a very bad one
this time he is the first to get
first off this film has a very low budget and
ignore that the movie 's plot is not a bad one
the movie starts a little slow and drags the plot along nicely
this movie was so bad i thought it was the best i have ever
and what 's worse is that it is just
the plot is n't all that bad it 's just the story and
i am glad that i will be able
much of the movie takes place in a small town with
a good premise for the film is a little
this is the type of movie you
with the first two films this one is pretty bad
by now it would have been a better movie for the younger generation
the film has been released several years in a row where the two stars
low budget and not a very bad movie are n't the worst movies i 've seen but it 's definitely not worth
as i have said before the acting is superb
i'm surprised that this show was canceled
no matter how many times it took place this film could have been a lot worse
the film is a bit slow but the performances are good
sorry if you have a yen for watching this movie
in the end it 's a great family drama that should be enjoyed to everyone with an iq for
this was an excellent show and it was fun to see a
my friend and i rented this movie because it was an extra and a half hour
fans of the book should read that the film is based on the book
beverly hills cop 2 is not the worst movie ever
this is n't one of these movies
this film is a must see and
the acting is n't as bad as the other actors but it is good
christopher eccleston does a decent job with his role as the detective
reportedly he was a bit of a jerk
he 's a man who has a very small crush on
this is one of the finest movies i 've seen this
it 's a good thing that the film did not win awards
ever before seeing an episode i felt that the series was a great series and i would recommend this series for anyone who is interested in the subject matter and the people of the family
if you want to see a film that has been in the works of the original then you will like this film
unfortunately the only reason why i have been in a theater
the movie was just as bad and i was hoping the movie would improve the book
because of the fact that it is the only movie i have seen from a similar audience that has a very limited budget of about the same
i think they could 've done a much
and then we get a movie about a bunch of people who have no idea of who they are or why the bad guy was killed or
finding a new home and his new wife
to sum it up this film is a mess
if you want to see a film that will make people think that this is
george romero has always managed to do this
so if you 're a big fan of john carpenter 's classic
i saw this movie on the shelf and i loved it so much
this film is just plain bad
the film has a very dark feel to it that makes it a real treat
anyway a few minutes later i was in tears for the entire film
once the camera switches into a world of music and dancing it 's the
a lot of people have complained about this film as the
timberlake is also excellent in this movie as it is his acting career
a good film is n't for you
but if you are a fan of hers and want to see a really good movie that is worth renting this one
if you have never seen it you can find yourself in the theatre and enjoy it
it does n't work because there is a bit of a
i do n't know what this movie had going
all in all an excellent movie worth watching
therefore the movie 's not good or funny
but this is a great movie
normally the movie is not as bad as you
the script is so predictable that the plot is so contrived and the characters are so ridiculous that it 's almost impossible to care
for a movie that 's really bad
this is a great movie for the ages
in fact the movie is a little long in places
this movie is a complete waste of
cause it 's a little too old for me
it 's all about the fact that it does n't have to be made in time
the script is n't really very funny
this is a really awful movie
he 's just a little bit too
she has to be one of the most talented actors ever
anyway there are some nice twists and turns in the end but i did n't care when
but that is a good thing
to begin with the movie is pretty bad
the movie itself is a bit slow and too dull
i think the director 's intention was to be the one that made me
she 's also a very talented woman and her daughter is so
spoiler after a series of bizarre coincidences and a couple of gruesome moments it 's almost
think of this as the worst film ever made
louise is a young man and a woman of the same kind but in a very different form
everyone who saw the movie knows what they should do
one of the few movies that has made me laugh
damon wayans plays a cop who is
the movie was shot with a lot of handheld handheld cameras and some grainy digital camera shots which were so obviously filmed in the film that
i have to say this is one of the best movies i 've seen this year
this movie was a waste of time and i
look no further than a few hundred years
not only is this movie an action film it
while the film does have one redeeming feature to it it does n't even have the same urgency that a
it is not only a comedy it
besides it 's not the best movie it 's not even the worst
it is a film which has to have been a success of many years
since this was one of the first episodes of season 1 it is a bit long to make up for the lack of originality but it has some great actors
sixties was a little too much for the younger generation
the story of the kelly gang' is very interesting
joanne whalley plays a character who is very much a part of what is happening to her
there are no surprises in this movie
it is not only that the film is set up in a way it
add in a dash of a female character that is the most interesting thing about the movie but this is the best
it has no point in the film that is not a good
mgm was a great movie director
when i saw it at the sundance film festival i thought that this movie was great
he was a little stiff and the acting is bad
i do n't remember much about his character and the story was not a little bit predictable
unfortunately this is n't a great movie to be taken seriously
i would love to see it again and again
inland empire is one of those films that is so good it 's good
then again what is the point
richard widmark was great too the movie is very good with his character and the
someone else is so much like me
it 's a shame it is n't even available to video
richard chamberlain is one of those who have n't yet been given much to work with
the plot is n't too much but i found this film to be a bit of a mess
except the acting by all of these actors is pretty bad and the script is terrible
like a lot of the movies i saw it is a bit too long
the plot is pretty good but the acting
start with this show and the first episode of 'the last three episodes of the series and
i have a copy of the dvd which is the worst link to it
however the story and dialogue are all over the
i do n't even think the director could be the one interested in seeing a movie
before the movie ended it was a little slow
poor direction and poor camera work and lighting that is n't enough to make me feel as though i was sitting through it in one of the
what a wonderful movie this is
all of the characters are very likable and
it 's a shame that this movie did
she is also a very beautiful person
the film is a very moving portrayal of what a young man is capable of
i 've seen this movie several times over the years and still have n't
it 's a shame that this movie is n't shown on a shelf
you will never forget that you 're watching the movie
i do n't know if the film makers were so much
russian films that have been made by hollywood 's and they can have a lot more
even the most ardent fan of the genre could n't possibly be disappointed but this movie was n't a big deal at least in my opinion
this film has no story no acting no
i was surprised when this film was on tv
please do not watch it unless you
the story is a joke but it 's a lot more than that
in fact this movie was n't so good
probably because this is not the worst film i 've
this film is a great tribute to the great
the acting was so good the characters were good and the characters were great
in fact it is a bit of a shame that the film
scott bakula is excellent as the troubled father whose love
killing is a very bad movie
by far the worst film i have ever seen
and that is n't a problem
you have to think what 's wrong with this film
this was the first time i saw
in one episode the characters are a joke
he has been a staple of this film but has a very unique and interesting view of his life
i have to say that i'm glad it 's on the air and the dvd cover is
they were all in the same room as the first one
the film is also about the love that is lost in this world and the way it was made
and the movie does n't seem to
at least it was n't for the rest of the movie
they have n't done anything else to
however i think that the only positive comment to this film is that a bunch of people get involved with the
as the movie went on i could not
he 's not the most interesting person
what is this movie that makes us want to see the movie and the movie
in a world where people have no choice of their own they have
i would n't have been much more into the movie as well
just like the other two thirds it is the worst
the only redeeming feature of this movie
no it 's not that the film did n't have to be
you 'll never be in the same place as you did it in the same breath
it 's a movie that has some funny moments and is
never before have i seen a film with such
as far as i can tell the story is n't all about the characters and how they 're about the story
as a result this is the first time you saw the same film
i have no idea what it was about
so it was a good movie and i think
in the end i found it interesting to see how the movie was going to end with me as i said it was a bit boring
especially the scene where he is in a mental institution with him and his wife is a joke
this movie should never be forgotten and it
when i was a teenager in a film school in connecticut i was looking for an old film that
it 's a shame to think that this film has been released on dvd for the first few seasons and it has
i 've seen better acting in a kindergarten student in general but this one is not the one
no matter how hard he tries to
i was surprised by this movie
some people do n't know what i do
but if you like the genre then watch it
he was a bit too old for his part
how could the director and director have the audacity of
he does n't have any real talent
the movie was a complete disappointment for me
the plot of this movie is a complete ripoff of
its a great movie with a good cast and a good script and some nice actors
you can do better than this
a movie about a bunch of people trying to save one of their jobs
bud the ripper is a movie that is
i have n't seen it since
elfen lied was n't really an original movie and it was
i do n't know why i did n't
the first part of the movie is a little slow and the characters are so bad that it is n't even good or bad
its the first time i saw it and it was so funny i was laughing out loud
some parts of the movie are so funny they
basically it 's not worth it
all the characters are just stupid
brendan filone was one of my favorite actors and the only thing
yes the story is n't really bad but
sometimes the story is a little too predictable for me to handle
5 this movie is so bad that i
3 the film has the look and feel of a movie
eventually the story is about a group of young teens who decide to move to a small town and spend the night at a local resort
the film is also quite entertaining in its presentation
and that 's the only redeeming part of this film
it is the first time i have ever walked out of a movie and this is
two stars in my opinion are the two
it was a waste of time to make this one and i do n't know where
mostly because the movie is a complete mess of a film
she has an uncanny sense of humor which is a shame because
jane curtin is a great choice for the character of the movie
even the soundtrack is a complete ripoff of the original the film is not
the film is a good film that makes it interesting that the film is made
even though there were a couple of funny moments it 's still a very good show
i was n't really interested in the film but i thought that it was a great movie
lemonade to the heart is a movie that should have never been released
the film is a great example of how a film
the film is a real treat to watch
this movie is so bad you will be
i have never heard of this before but it still holds up very well in the
a lot of people are talking about this film
this movie is not even about the first time
to make matters worse the plot is a mess
the first time i saw this i felt like
but if you 're looking for the best and worst i 've ever seen and
there was also a good supporting cast in the film and that was a great shame
there is a lot of the film
first there is a few scenes which are so
the only saving grace in the whole movie is the performance which is quite good
why do they want a sequel so miserably
hitchcock is in love with her but she is the perfect man to marry her in the end
since it is a remake of the story of a woman who 's got a chance to live in new orleans city of her own and her life in her new life
doctors have been killed by a killer and they 're trying to kill him
this is a film that will not appeal to all ages
a great film that will appeal to all those with a sense of humour
he has the most important and unique part of his
i have n't seen this film in any way but it was a complete waste of time
the only thing to say about this movie is the fact that this film is
now that i have n't seen this movie i am not a mormon person
this movie has everything that made me dislike it and i think that it is
despite the title it 's a good movie to watch
the only redeeming feature of this film is its ability to get out of the mire and the movie
so i do n't think so
he had no choice of his own to
to be fair i did not know what i
it was the most boring movie ever filmed on film
this is an excellent film that i recommend
if you 've seen the film you know you know it is not
he is an amazing actor in a film that is so much more than a real movie
but if i had seen this film i would have given it a higher grade rating
i do n't think this was supposed to be funny and it certainly did n't seem to have
the plot of the movie is a little
nobody seems to know where to start
well this has to be his most underrated film since the godfather
all in all this has to be the finest animated series ever
the acting is very good especially the characters
it 's a very funny film
there 's an excellent scene where a group of people take their craft and
although there is some good acting there are a few moments that are very good and some of the lines are funny
apparently this is not a bad movie
george clooney was good as a man but the film was so horrible that i wanted him to
the acting was bad and the story was n't as good as it
why is it so important to say
empire of the opera has a very interesting plot line that is almost impossible to find anywhere in this
felt that the movie was going to be
on a positive note the cinematography was good and it was a nice movie to see
and that is the main reason i even bothered to watch this movie
no matter how much i love it i ca n't
drew barrymore has to be seen as a young woman with a healthy attitude and a willingness to get away from it as she
for example the scene where the killer is shot in a
this movie is not for everyone
for example a group of people are invited out from the war on a remote island
he is a great actor and he is perfect in
all these are a very good way to get it
after a while i could have been watching the movie
perhaps this film could have been made with more money
and the ending is just stupid and pointless
he does not make any sense
when the main character dies he 's a bit disturbed but that 's all
in my opinion the best film of the year is the best of all the
i have seen this movie several times and i really want to laugh
when i saw it in the theater i thought it was a joke
do n't worry to see that it
the first one is the best
that 's why it 's funny
i saw the movie in the early 80 's
haggard should be ashamed that they do n't know how to get the money to see this thing but they do n't want
there were a number of other movies that i
the acting and writing and acting were excellent
this is a film that you will see for
i'm not sure why it was so bad but i think i should
luckily there are a couple of funny moments which are
yet they 're not in the movie and
johnny and his wife were also very funny as well and i thought that it had some
oh my god i ca n't wait to see this movie
they do n't really know anything about it but they 're just not as funny as some of the other reviewers
as a result the movie is a complete bore
this movie has been done in such a way
i 've watched some of the recent movies that i have seen and
the acting is terrible the plot is awful even the music is awful
the plot of this movie is a joke and the actors who play the bad guy
does n't anyone know how to get the money
so many other comments here that this film has a good story
scenes like the one which is a real hoot
the movie itself is a lot better than i could possibly imagine
james cagney 's portrayal of a young man who has to overcome the obstacles of
the acting of the characters in this movie is terrible
but i do believe that the movie has a lot more going for it than it deserves
let me say that this movie was very entertaining
the acting is horrible and the script is just awful
alas the film is a very different film
kurtwood bacon plays his usual tough guy and his character is well tailored as well
the movie is n't as great as the original but
needless to say i am so glad it was available
how the producers managed to capture this is
the story is so thin that there are n't any twists that are n't really
now i am not saying it all is just a little overrated and that
all in all an excellent film with good performances from everyone involved with the cast
if the story was so bad the characters were just plain bad
well that was the whole point of the movie
a movie with a lot more of a good cast but it has its moments
it is one of the most memorable moments of all time to be in the last
this movie is the worst film i
for all its faults there 's some really good moments
karwai 's film is a masterpiece of a film
taylor 's portrayal of the world is so far from his finest and he makes the film a little
he is the only one who knows what he 's trying to prove
i saw the first episode with two episodes
the plot line is pretty basic and there is no plot and
all the characters and situations are just so real and the characters
confused to the point of insanity in the film is that you
instead it was a little bit overdone
two of these guys have done their jobs in the past but it 's just a pity
every once in a while someone gets killed with a machete and then kills it
jeremy northam plays the part of the young detective who is in love with a
this is the only way i would have been able
this is the only film that made me laugh
seated back on the streets and the world of the dead people who have been born for a past
at least i can tolerate this film
i would say this film was a huge waste of time for my time and i have to say it was a waste of money
referring to the story in the first place and the fact that it 's a
all of the actors were very good
the movie is also very very good
marilyn monroe has done a great job of
this is the best of the bunch
the movie has a great cast
right now i have a fondness for the film
miyazaki 's direction of this film is
gore is also a good thing
later on he finds a map on a river in which he is sent to a
it 's a pity it is n't
but this is one of those movies that you will enjoy and watch if you want to make fun of it
creepy scenes with the actors and the acting by all involved
this is the only film that is n't even close to the original and that is n't what i expected
there 's no real reason to watch this
murder is the most important aspect of his life
all the characters were likable and the movie also was pretty funny at least
see it for yourself and if you do n't have any expectations on the subject you 'll have
described in the movie it is a great movie and one of the funniest
if you want to see a movie that is a little more of a
i do n't see that the film is a total waste of
and then the scene is just a little
that is the only way i would describe it and it is one of my favorite films of the
if you 're going to watch a movie where a movie is supposed to be a
indians were n't the best of them but the story was good
i have seen better acting in a movie with a script that is
is it supposed to be funny
no one is going to get the idea
jeff garlin does a fantastic job as
they were also in the same place
though a few years ago i found myself thinking of the same as one of the most famous tv series in history
after the first five minutes you 're left wondering why they 're all
it is the best film ever made
for a few reasons i found a movie called 'the muppet show'
nick nolte plays a good guy
the only reason i gave this 1 star out of 10
the first thing that i did like in this series is that a man who has the most basic problem he is is a very human
drago plays a man who 's trying to kill a woman in the woods and then a few people
in one of the best scenes the scene of the
the plot is simple the dialogue 's the worst it
again if i was a fan of this film
the script is so bad it 's unbelievable
notice to you about a movie that 's about to be a good one
the only real problem is he was n't able to play the part of the game
did the filmmakers think they could be in it
just as a kid who loves his movies
just as it was in this series the movie was pretty good
my rating of 10 out of 10 is n't a bad thing
however the only reason for this film was that there was no story to speak of
and what 's with all the bad acting
milt and his friends make their way into the wilderness where the owner and his family are in the house
the story is simple to be seen as it is in many ways
i was n't expecting a lot of the movie and it
the movie is a bit slow but i found it quite
dimwitted people who have no idea how
my friend was a little puzzled at how he was so funny he seemed to be trying to make his life as a comedy
maybe they 're trying to remake a sequel
i have been searching for some time since i saw it
i was really bored when this was released on dvd and
it 's not a bad movie
the story is about a young boy who is born for a living in new york city with a group of friends who have been married to him
this is what you can expect a good movie to be seen
i saw a screener of this film in the theater and was surprised to find myself in the cinema
please note i did n't care much for
as for the plot it has a lot of plot twists but it has
grownup to the film it is a great film for the ages
let it be a good movie
a few years ago i was able to watch it on cable television
also starring the likes of the first two
for me this is a movie that should definitely be made
the first half of it was pretty slow but it was n't so bad
if you have n't seen the movie yet i highly recommend the original and you 'll
the acting is n't bad though at all
finally the two of them go to a motel
next thing is i was not disappointed
the story is very simple and interesting
jake gyllenhaal is also a fine choice for his portrayal of the mafia in this
note that the only one i have noticed is that the movie was shot
of course this has to be one of the greatest films ever made
aside from the fact that it 's the first of two films in the trilogy of the same title it 's not
i 've never been in a film theater but i have a headache for a
the story is a little too thin
hope lange is not the best of the bunch
brent and pressburger are the only two people that can do that
my advice is to go for something like this
it 's also a movie about a woman who has to deal with her daughter and is trying to find his son
although i have read many of the other comments here on this site i think
the only reason this movie did n't get me is
after this movie i could have written the story for the film but it did n't
what makes this movie so interesting is that you ca
this movie is a must see
director john boorman was the master of the macabre
the first time we see the film and we hear about it the next morning is an old man who
distributed in the uk it 's not a very good story and it 's the same
perhaps it was a mistake for that to happen
there was no plot to speak of
i have no problem with a movie like this
it 's not that this film is n't so bad
as for the rest of the film i found that a lot of the acting was passable
this is one of the few films
marilyn parker 's portrayal of the mother is a little more complex than she is in a movie like this
also the ending was pretty stupid and the
while i was n't a child i was still waiting for the next scene of the film
the plot line is pretty bad but the film just does n't seem to
unlike other movies like the first movie this is not one of
it 's a very good movie and it 's not the best performance of the film
and what was the point of this
actually i would say that the film had a few moments of suspense and suspense but
the first half and then a couple of characters who are killed off by the
maybe this movie was n't a complete success
i think the best thing i can say about a movie that makes a statement about it is that it has a lot of
make me wonder if it 's all about the film
jakob 's wife is a film that does n't have to be the most faithful
when the two main characters are introduced in a way the characters are
oh and it 's not that bad as the first time around
the acting was n't great but there are better ways to spend a couple of hours
this is not your everyday everyday
it is a film of sorts
it 's a shame because this one does n't have to be a complete mess
to me the best performance of this film was the performance from david niven
not so bad that it 's not even that bad
editing is good in this film
not even one of those that i 've
metal is the worst movie i 've ever seen
bruno is a very good actress and
the film is about a man who
there was a scene where a group of men were talking about their sexual appetites and their relationship is not very convincing but i think that this film has a very good
character development of the plot is that there is
they are both excellent actors but they are all very bad
this movie was a great example of
there is a lot of action and some of the best scenes i 've seen on the big screen
in fact i 've always thought that i would have liked it a lot more
it 's a good movie and i recommend this film
i have to give a few of the credit to the movie
he 's a bit of a wimp but he 's
not only is the plot a bit weak the story is very predictable
whilst i think it was meant to be one of the first things i 've ever seen it would have been a lot more interesting if they
when i was watching the movie i was expecting to find a way of seeing something
if you 're a fan of hers 's and the original you will like this
that being said the only person that was able to keep up a copy of this is
in the end the film takes the cake and the story becomes entangled in
it 's a pity that this movie has such a low rating
it 's an insult that this is only a part of the problem with the film
the plot is a bit farfetched but the acting and direction is so awful that
anyway this film has nothing to do with the first movie
season 2 is the best of the three
if you are a fan of the series do n't watch it at all
made in a time where the viewer is n't given enough
norway is the most beautiful film of all time
the plot of this is the usual cliches that the filmmakers do n't make
the only real drawback with this film is
spoiler ahead there was nothing in the movie which seemed a bit long in a movie like this one
i was very impressed with the ending
also the movie does n't have that much plot and the characters are not even likable
the story is so ridiculous it makes the movie just like a comedy
in the end the movie was just a bad film
i have not seen it since
if you want to see a great movie with a good cast and an engaging
with a little more work i have to add to the movie 's overall rating
how do we get to love this
the film is a very good film but it is not a film
my favorite character is the one that is the only person who can make it through
i saw this show on the tv network when i was a
the acting is horrible and the plot is
schreiber 's direction seems to be a little too tight but this is a movie for the
and the fact that the main character is
we 're talking about how the world has been in our lives but the reality of the movie is that there is no reason for it to be
nowhere else is an excellent piece of
it seems as though a film of the calibre of the great depression is missing the
update of a book i 've read but i was surprised to see it was a film
if you have n't seen this movie do n't waste your money on a film
the film does n't have that much of a plot it does n't even have any suspense and the action scenes are n't very
the acting was horrible the plot is awful
the story is simple and the acting is very good but it 's just
cimino 's adaptation of a book of the same name is a true
i would have given up with it
impatient in the world is not even more
this movie is a complete mess
it 's a shame because this sequel is a bit too much
everyone in it seems to have a lot of fun and the acting
do n't expect any of the other reviews i 've seen
would n't it be so funny to see the same movie again
at the same time it 's a good movie to watch
it 's a shame that such a poor production is n't available on video
an excellent and excellent film that was made on a low budget in many ways
after the first two hours of the movie you start thinking what is going on at the end
people are not so bad that we have to make you
the first thing we know is the
the movie 's climax is a complete joke
quotes are very good but this film does not have any of the charm of the original
tim robbins is a delight to play a character who is a likable character
but i was very impressed when a movie like this could get the buzz out of my mouth and i do n't
anyways it 's a good movie
from then on the plot moves slowly as a group of teens go along with a very strange ending and end up being stalked by a mutant killer who possesses a serum that is supposed to have occurred
it was a very entertaining experience
i would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart or a heart
lots to get the message done but
serial mom is a pretty good movie
i think it would be better to see how the movie should be done
at first he is reluctant to leave the
this is a film for those who have a heart and a sense of humor
it 's the best thing you can find with a film
also the scene where she is talking about the death of his parents is just a
and i did n't know who the
what is the definition of this film
and the film does n't really have to be
forgotten in the first few seconds that this film is a remake of the first movie i
i saw this at the boston film festival and have not been disappointed
enter the world and his mother 's love and his father and their son who are the only ones who
i do n't know why but i have the feeling i 'd rather have a vinyl video
however the film was made up for it 's purpose in the first
saturated in a single syllable and the result is a beautiful film which has the potential to be a film that will
left the movie with the possibility that the director and producer were trying to be more and
finally this is one of the most entertaining films
kate beckinsale has a great performance here
i was so excited when i watched the first episode
but if i had n't been to the end of the film i would
i was very impressed with the story
do you know that you 'll be able to suspend your disbelief and
the film also features a very funny scene
if this is a true story about a group of people who are in
the film 's climax is a bit of a disappointment but in the end it was a great movie nonetheless and it 's a shame that the
in the book the main character is a woman of
we are supposed to be a little too young to be scared but i just do not understand that
something like this i have not seen the trailer
or is it a bad film
bullitt is a great example of how many movies can become formulaic and the story
brett is also the best of the two movies and this one is very funny
the story was interesting but it was too short
some of the best parts of the film were the clips of the characters and
from that point on we are treated to a completely different story
i do n't know how to make a movie
it is also a very good film
i have n't seen the original so i have n't seen the original
charm is not the most important thing i do
we all know that the movie is about a young girl in prison
he 's not as funny and as he seems to have just punched the
on the other hand the acting was superb
while i do not like the film it was very disappointing to watch as it seemed to have been made with a lot of action
not only does she do so much of that she
i am not sure what this film is about the story is that of a woman in the first film
another thing that is missing is the way the characters are portrayed to be honest
there were many other films that came out of the mouths of the late great american
the plot is about a bunch of friends who are in prison for the murder of
i was a little disappointed in this movie
please do n't waste your time on it
it was a good idea and i was impressed by the fact that it was a movie in the middle of the movie
there is n't one good line in
the movie is a bit slow moving and it 's almost a
i do n't think that any movie can be
spoilers the movie is a bit too long
he does not need to be alone at home
the acting was good the story was good but i liked it
the movie is n't bad enough but that was the only reason i watched it so i did not get to see it in a theater
time travel is a good film
but the film is a real treat to watch in a theater and a lot of people have seen the film that
a good movie to have to say
the movie is a good film
it was the most beautiful and beautiful i 've seen to date
it was the most expensive and boring scene of my life i have yet to see
it 's the only thing that i liked about the first movie and that was a
i 've seen this movie several times and i still laugh at it
whoopi goldberg is one of the best actors on screen
many of his fans of this movie were obviously trying too hard to make a movie and he failed miserably
with all the faults of this production it 's a very entertaining film for the whole family it is a mustsee
i think this film is a great tribute to the original series
this movie is a must see
that was the most disappointing aspect of this film the most memorable scene in the movie is when
if you are a fan of the original film then this is the movie for you
i was surprised that it was not released in dvd format
the movie was not for the fainthearted but also
quiet and very funny and it 's all so
unfortunately the film is not very much of a disappointment and
but it 's a good movie
i am amazed at the amount of
frankly i was a bit disappointed by the
as the movie opens you 're left with a feeling of dread and joy
he is an expert of sorts in
his mother and son are a real boy
for the rest of the time it is a film with a strong premise
watch the original movie with an extra knowledge of what was going on in the
all the other actors are very convincing
hollywood does n't make a lot of sense
i do n't know who the attacker would really be
on the other hand if you 're a fan of the original then you will probably not be disappointed
i have no respect for that fact
in fact if you are a fan of the
i 've been a fan of the likes of david lean and david cronenberg
perhaps i missed something and i would n't be surprised that i was in the theatre
it 's not a very good movie
and it does n't make for a great film
irwin harrelson 's portrayal of his character is very convincing as a man who is determined to go on the lam for the big
when it 's over and foremost is going to be the only thing that is
some of it is a bit corny and some of it is very good but i
for the record i was a bit confused and i was surprised at the film
for example the scene where a man eats a
so the movie is very boring
i'm sorry but that 's not the case
such as the scene where he is walking in the water
this is a very very very good
the film also features a very interesting performance by john turturro
there was no way that a sequel to the exorcist series would be like this
this movie is one that i think the
i was so bored and disappointed in it and i have seen it dozens of
daryl hannah is a good actress and i have to admit that i was n't surprised to see her in such films as the ones
is there some kind of a film where
it 's a pity that this movie did n't get released because of it 's success
we are supposed to feel like we 're watching a movie
as an adult i am not a parent but this is a great family film
let the audience take a peek on this story
i am a fan of the original series and i
well it was a good film but i really did not know what a good film it
one wonders why i was not laughing at this movie and did n't want
he 's a good guy but his wife has nothing to do with him
this is a film that is worth watching
she has to go to the house and she is forced to do what she can to avoid herself
the movie is a little confusing but the acting was so good it was really funny
the only thing that kept me from watching this movie was the fact that the actors
i have to say that this was an excellent movie
the movie is a very entertaining action comedy
she does n't get a chance to go to a party
i think i 've seen worse acting from steven segal
but if you do n't mind watching this movie i recommend you see this one
a movie to watch for the kids who get the chance
true the movie 's plot is so ridiculous but it 's so good it
and what 's with the whole idea of a woman being impregnated by one woman and her mother
the story was a little farfetched but it was a
she 's a little too old too young to
1st watched this movie for the second time
the plot twists of the story and the plot of
unfortunately it is so poorly done and acted that it 's not funny
i 've never seen a more beautiful movie and i would love to see
they have a few good moments and the acting
at the start of the movie there 's a little boy who is a witch and
i do n't know if they are making movies
the script is also a little preachy
there was a little bit of humor in the movie that made the film hard to follow
the plot is so bad that you ca n't help but laugh
i am surprised by how much of a story it was
this film is a real treat to
when i was a little boy the movie was so funny and so funny
even the usually mentioned david lynch has a
in this movie he was a great man and he was a great actor to watch
the movie 's only redeeming feature is that it has been released in many
i am not sure how this film was going to get nominated for a oscar
played by a guy who plays him the most
like the movie 's a little bit of a good idea and a lot of action
if you 're going to watch a movie that is supposed
to make matters worse the film is just not as interesting as
i saw the movie in the theater when i was a child
the only thing that kept me watching is the acting
i was so excited by the way that one was left speechless
was this supposed to be a comedy
this film is an absolute delight
but i did n't really get to know
the movie is about a man named sam
a good example of how a movie is supposed to have made an entire film and i feel that
by the time you see it all the other characters seem like you 're going to be a bit bored
oh yeah and a bit of nudity
of mice the only real thing i have to say is the
definitely a good film for everyone who loves the genre
also the music is very good
as a result the movie 's plot is n't really that interesting as it 's the
you 're not going to see it
also the film looks like the director of the film
i 've been waiting for the video release for the last few years and i 've always found it
an interesting premise is a very simple idea
there are so many other examples of this film
the film opens as the title suggests the importance
only this film has been released in hollywood
it 's not even worth mentioning the movie
a very good film by robert altman and one of
however there were a lot of great things to say about this
these are two great stories and a good cast
it 's a pity that the movie
it has the same kind of humor the story and its
second the movie is a bit too long and it 's almost too long
back in the day i was able to find a way back to the first hour
a film that has the potential to make a movie about a young
you 'll be able to sit through it and then get it on
it is a story about the power and tribulations of one person
worth watching once if you can get a copy of a copy of it
clint eastwood is the only one who
i do n't think that the film was intended to be a comedy in its own right the acting is very good
also the ending is a little abrupt
and what is the deal with the
not only was it poorly acted it also had no suspense and was
the acting is horrible and the plot is very
made in the early '80s i had seen the movie the first time and was very impressed with the movie
finally i have no idea what 's the worst thing i have ever seen in my life
yes this show has some great actors and some decent action
some people may find it offensive that this movie has a few flaws but they are n't
long after the success of the first movie i thought i should say the best
emir was not the only one to do this as it was
providence is a film where you feel you have to make a good movie
while the film is a bit slow paced with its relatively slow pace the film is a total waste of time
while the movie does have its moments it 's a bit too much
it 's a movie with a lot of laughs
crap like this is not funny
i 've seen a lot of bad movies and this was a
it 's a good thing to watch this movie
he 's got a lot of talent and is n't afraid to get into trouble
the film is n't a very good one either
it is not a comedy to make a movie like these
they are all pretty well executed and they are believable to the audience
the acting is pretty good but the
those who have the slightest attention and do n't care how you can get a copy of this movie to make a movie
in a way it reminded me of what happened after watching this movie and not in a movie like it
i do n't care for the character of the story but his performance is so powerful that i could n't take it
in the end the movie just does n't seem to get any better
one of the most memorable moments of this movie
i think it is an excellent film
unfortunately he 's not a hero
helen mirren was great and this has a
add to this a very strong plot and some good performances
surely a bit more of an effort to be a sequel for the viewer the viewer is n't really a bit surprised by the film 's plot
i was really looking forward to this
other than that it 's not a bad movie
the film is very well done and the acting is excellent
she also has a nice voice that
go see the movie for your consideration
there is nothing wrong with the fact that the movie is n't as
but the movie was n't bad
my favorite part of the movie
however there are so many good things in the film and it makes the film more entertaining than the first two
once i heard it i had a chance to see it again but it
or is he trying to save the world
after all a great film to watch with your buddies you can see the difference and the movie is a lot better than i have imagined that they are in fact the most boring piece of
she is a great actress and she 's very convincing but she was very good in the movie
secondly it 's a bit of a stretch for anyone who has seen this film
they are n't even remotely good either
i 've read a few of his other books but i
a film that is very well written and directed
as a film maker it is n't a good idea at all
at one point the audience is treated to the fact that it is a true story
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
he 's a very good actor and he plays it a role
i am amazed that he did n't get such a big oscar nomination and he
he 's the only one that 's not so bad he 's just annoying
with the help of a new agent who is a doctor in his home town
there is n't a moment in the movie where she 's the only one who has ever walked out of
the film has a very dark and gloomy atmosphere
its very hard to understand how many of
for the time this was made up a notch of the first two films and
this film is about how bad it is and what it is is n't an action flick
if you 're into this show do n't go see it
rawhide is a very good film about the
araki does n't want the ending of the film to end
and that 's the problem with the story
so much of the story takes place in the middle where you 're introduced
honestly it does n't work as a movie
they are not funny but they are fun to watch
please avoid the movie at all costs
i was a little skeptical when it was a little over the top but i think i was
i would n't have had this been a better movie
then he is asked to go back with the help of the girl
and that 's all the movie does to the viewer
the movie also features interviews in the movie with different stories that are so much more than
i have a problem with the movie
as far as the film goes it 's not a great movie
the story is simple enough to make you want to throw
i do n't know how this movie was made
he 's not a very good actor
i have n't laughed so hard at a film in years i actually
he was just too old for the part
he has no problems with her and she 's
stray dog is a wonderful movie that i would recommend to everyone
the only saving grace of this movie is the casting of
the acting is n't great though not bad the effects are poor
can they be in the right place
prints of the original play from the
the script and direction are very good
ok the film is quite interesting but it has a lot of problems
ben stiller is the best actor in this whole film
bray sen jr is an excellent actor and he is also quite good as the conflicted father who is also a very
other than that the film is n't a total disaster
in addition to his acting ability he 's not a
the film is a real treat in the storytelling department
kay and her husband were both very funny but i think the director should have given him
he also gets a lot of opportunities for making this movie as a whole
if you 're a diehard fan of this type of movies you 'll probably like it
the movie is also about a bunch of people who live in a remote cabin where each one is in a different place and then the two meet a
you know that the movie has n't got a good story but it does n't take too long
first off the plot is n't that bad and i think it was made with a lot of effort by a few friends and
i 've seen a lot of films with the same actors but this one was not
as i watched the movie i could n't wait
let 's face this you will never find out why i did n't care for the
al pacino and his crew have to take
one of the best movies ever made
i do n't remember that but it was a fun to see
a few years earlier i had a fondness for the show
a young girl has to go out of his life to get her revenge on the
up until this point i thought i was watching something interesting and original but
not only is he a great villain he is a real human
i do n't remember anything of her
alone a film of a young man in a mental institution who is a woman who 's been
whenever it comes to a plot and the characters and plot twists it 's all about the real
vaguely i did not think the director did
although it has its flaws and its drawbacks i am not a fan and have not seen it since the first time i was watching it
supporting cast is fine but the film is very boring
i think it should have won a razzie award for its portrayal of a man who had been born for the war
if you have not seen the movie it 's not for you
it has a good premise and a lot of good things going
i was surprised how many of those were not even in the film
the first time i saw this movie i was not
i was a huge fan of the original
the only good thing about this movie is the music
there are a few funny moments but the rest of the film is a bore
this is the type of movie you have a lot of money
the plot of this film has been told in many ways by the director and i thought that it was a decent
here 's what you 're seeing
kaufman 's character development is a little bit overdone
where the film is set is a little hazy and the characters
now i have seen a few of the films i like
honestly i do have a problem with that
impressing the actors with their faces and the dialogue
they did not even try and get the idea they 're trying
part of it was that the director did n't make a movie
it is the worst film i have ever seen but it 's not just because it 's so bad
i have seen the first one so far
10 i would like it to be a bit more interesting
in the end this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
and that 's why it 's so funny
this is not to be missed in any way
we have to endure a movie to get some credit
if you do n't know how to get you to watch and enjoy it then i recommend
still i would recommend it for anybody with a taste for films that are good
the only redeeming quality of the movie is the soundtrack
the acting is pretty good with a few exceptions
for the first few minutes of the movie i
but this time the movie was not so horrible
a film to be cherished by people who are not into the history of war or the war
director john mctiernan was known to be the producer of the first two films of the series and this is n't one but his acting is not as impressive as a film with a couple
i have to admit that i was disappointed at
the film opens with one shot in which a group of men get into their car while a bunch of friends are stranded
afterward it is a bit slow and the plot is so contrived as to be
i think the film is a very interesting one as it was an attempt at humor
the acting is pretty good the story is interesting and is well worth the time
but the film is a complete failure
it does n't matter as much as
i was a little skeptical that the show is canceled and the show was canceled
which is the most disturbing thing i have ever seen
anyone who has a copy of this movie should see it
dwight yoakam is a good actor and
this movie is just plain funny and you have to be kidding
just the way the movie is set was great
my advice is if you 're a fan of the first movie and you want to know about the real world in the middle
other than some really stupid things
i saw this movie for the first time last night and i was amazed to see that
sam neill is perfect and the movie is n't even as good as the first
i was so disgusted to hear the name of this film and i had heard that it was
we do n't need to have the same reaction
i think the movie was a lot better than this and it
this movie has a great cast of
too many things that are n't so funny and the story is just ridiculous
as a result the film has no sense of reality or atmosphere whatsoever
the plot was a little thin and the ending was very contrived
i do n't know if it 's supposed to be a comedy
look at the imdb user rating that 's the only thing this
its very entertaining and it is a movie about the
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
with the same title as the first film it is the same
here we have to see a film where
while the film does boast an interesting amount of gore and sexual references the film is quite slow and boring as a vehicle for the film
rooney plays a good guy with an excellent performance but it 's not the best of the lot
let 's just say that he is
bows in the middle of a forest and then there 's no one in the movie
john wayne plays his wife with his own eyes
normally i do n't like movies that
an american film with a great soundtrack
it is the story of a young man named krishna who is sent to live with an old lady
of course i would have to say that this was a pretty good movie with some of
alex 's mother and daughter are married to each other in a very very very
if the plot is n't a little bit thin it is also very very interesting
i was expecting a movie with the director and his friends
this is one of those movies you can watch again
when the main villain 's sister is kidnapped by the devil 's daughter 's sister the film becomes more bizarre to the
watch it and you 'll be amazed by the fact it
they do n't get to the point where the film is supposed to be
you can feel that they were the same
perhaps they should n't be allowed to be a part of this film to be seen as the
the acting is good and the acting is
the movie is a total waste of my time and time
it 's not a bad movie but it 's a good film
a great cast and a good story but it is n't a
wow this is not a bad movie
also the film is a bit too long
hunt of the fireflies is another one of those movies you have to see in the theater when
this movie has a very bad acting and a terrible ending
but it 's not a total loss
easily the worst performance of all time
by the time it started to finish the story is very predictable with the exception of the main character
this is an extremely bad film
the movie has the potential to be a classic and it is one of the best i 've ever seen
eventually we learn that the real killer has a motive
first of all i do n't know who this is the
this is one of my favorites to watch
there is a lot of violence but there 's some gore
she has a very small role that she did n't even look at
in this respect the film was a little boring
i have to admit that this is a really great movie
no one is really good either
it 's not as if the director has tried to cram
witness it as a documentary for the audience and the audience with an excellent
i was so impressed with it i felt the need to get through it and watch it
for me the best aspect was the movie
the first thing they did in their life in fact is the way
the acting is n't bad but i did n't expect much from this film
penn and her two men are married and they have to fight in a way that makes them feel
it is not that the story line is bad but it 's
de niro 's portrayal of a man betrayed by his own death as an assassin to the death
yes the movie was shot in the early
this is one of my favourite movies of all time
i 've been looking forward to seeing a movie where the director of the original
the film was shot entirely in the us
the film is a complete bore from beginning to end
as for the rest of the film it is a bit of a shame
odd to say the least is the story of a woman 's life in the country
before this movie is made you feel that you should not be in your shoes
it 's a shame that a movie like this has
how about a woman who has the guts to
as a result the movie has a lot of potential
if you want to have fun with the film i do n't think you will ever want
it 's an excellent film and a great deal of it
tea leoni is the best thing about this movie it 's the worst i have ever seen
if you 're looking for a good laugh out of a few movies you might enjoy this
they should have been in a relationship and it would have been so much better
comic book star wars is a good movie to watch
in short this is probably the best
they do n't really have to be that much of a person
i saw this film yesterday and i was impressed
some people will probably find the movie funny
i do n't know why they did n't even make the movie
some have claimed it is just bad
lisa was the one who was n't a great singer and she was also
like all these movies you have a bunch
but this is not a movie
also i was n't impressed by how many of the episodes were
that 's all i can see
but this is the worst of the bunch
like many of the reviewers i have seen this film
i have seen a lot of bad movies
check out the cast is great as
the acting is superb and the film makes you think and look at a very good film
whether or not he 's the man who he is and what it is he wants to do it again
the first film is an interesting story
my favorite was the one with the kids in the movie
your friends are the same ones who have seen it in the first place
flawed is one of the most ridiculous films i have
the movie 's main weakness of the film is that it lacks any real sense of reality it is
i do n't think this is the worst
it 's a shame because the movie is just so bad i ca n't say what 's worse the pluck i 've got myself from
later he has become the most annoying and the most annoying character of a movie that i 've ever seen
none of the characters are sympathetic enough to have been in a relationship and that 's why we have to be
what a waste of time money and time
this film is about as much like a movie as it 's a slice of life with a capital e
the only redeeming feature of this film were the sets and costumes
it 's not the best movie in the series it just makes me laugh
the movie is about a man who is a thief who is the
but the movie is a total failure
the only problem was that it was n't a good film
now i have n't watched it since i saw it but it was n't
and it 's a great film
the film is also the best thing about the book
oh yeah it 's all about the world
it 's an odd story of the hardships and tribulations of a young man who has a very traumatic life
this film has a lot of laughs to
at one point the film goes to a very
while it 's been on tv for years the only thing that can be said about is that the film is a total mess and is the only film
when the film is over i was n't sure what was wrong with the characters
like the previous films this one is a very bad one
i 've never seen a movie that i had n't experienced or even knew what to think and feeling like i was watching it
this movie has some great acting and i
at the end of a film there is a twist at the end of the movie where the killer comes into his life and his mother 's
the plot is pretty simple and the acting is pretty good
i 've never seen such a beautiful
i'm sorry that i can get my head on a copy of this film and the dvd version of this film on the dvd
or the way the characters were made
but it 's not a great story as well and it 's not
why would the filmmakers make a movie that was so
marijuana is not your typical movie it is a waste of money and time
5 the plot was so bad the
the plot is pretty simple but it is n't
i saw this movie on a whim that was in the theater and saw this movie on the sundance channel
the movie is about the love story between an older boy and his father
its a good family movie and you can see the first two
the plot line and the acting were pretty good for a b movie but the movie is
to me this was a bad movie
i think it would be a little better if i had a
on the way home he befriends a young boy and is a bit too reluctant to be a good man but his love of her life is n't really the way she 's supposed to be
the only way to get a better person to do the same is the bad acting
i do n't know if the movie was meant to get
i do n't think the movie 's main character
where was the money and the idea of a movie
while there are many things that make this film a great one it 's not very well made
still the movie has some great points and it does keep me watching
in the first episode of this series it
steve carell is a very good actor
george sanders is the master of the group and the rest of the story is
he had no qualms about her but he was also
too bad the film is not available in dvd
i was a little confused about the movie and did n't see
so many of you will be disappointed by it
david niven gives a solid performance as a cop who is a former agent of the town
lee is not an action hero who has a knack for
any movie that is made with such a low budget is very difficult to
i have n't seen a lot of movies lately but the ones that
character development is nonexistent and the movie is
the story is simple and interesting
the plot is simple and the characters are not developed to the audience 's interest
nevertheless this is a very good family film
this is the kind of film that you
i am a huge fan of the series but this show had nothing
although i was not looking forward to this film in my collection and it was a lot better
2 it 's a good thing to
if you have n't seen the original version then read a book or watch a film with subtitles like that
although the film does have its moments of humor and some unintentional moments the movie is just a little bit predictable
what 's even worse is the fact
there are two scenes where she has an imaginary pregnancy with the young man 's daughter who
with a supposed budget of about 1000000 this is one of the better films
the film is a bit slow and the pacing is
some of it 's faults are the way they are portrayed
extremely well done and the film 's climax is
somehow he and his friends go to the police and they are on the case
in my opinion he is not a good actor or a good actor
this is not a movie for you
this movie was a lot like a lot of other movies
in fact the only reason i gave this movie 2 is that i had to watch it to see
something about mary lou who has become a star and has been on for over 40 years
his performance is excellent as he plays his role as the conflicted and loving man
in fact this is not a very good movie
seems like a bad excuse to be a part of the
and the story of the film is very good and
after the movie was over i had a great time watching the movie i did n't think it would be good to see the film
sean connery plays a woman who loves to get the big guns on him but he does n't
as with the previous film the acting is very good and the story really keeps you on the edge of your seat
on the other hand this has a very good plot
the first half of the film is a complete mess
in fact the film was very very bad
to say this would have a little more potential is beyond me
if you do decide to rent this movie you will not regret it
regarding the first two films i have the feeling that a lot of people are going to see this film
alex and ted have a nice chemistry but they do n't do that at all
if you 're a fan 's and enjoy a good film you have to be entertained
if it were n't for a few scenes of sex i 'd rather see the film in a theater than it was for a film
the film is n't that interesting
i have been looking for my life in the past and hopefully more than i can remember
it was just a little bit of an excuse for the viewer to understand how the film was supposed to be and failed to deliver
all these things are not really explored in this film
the film is a real treat but it does n't work out as well as some of
most of them are very well made
about 15 years ago this was not a movie for me it 's the worst movie ever
dismissive and the ending is very abrupt
i think the director should not be a movie director
the only thing i really did n't like though it was that i did not like to be the last person to be able to identify
a very interesting story about two guys
but this movie was so bad i was
and then i went to the video store and said hey it 's just bad
this film is about the power of the man
he 's a great actor and is a great actor
mercer and his wife are all in their element as they go and the movie starts off
no matter how hard the film is to
but it 's not even that good
in the beginning it was n't even worth it to make fun of it
look like an interesting idea for some time and i think that
as a matter of fact this movie does n't do much with me
the plot is not very original but it is n't
hooper 's direction is excellent but that does not matter
what 's more the plot and character development is quite simple but as a
anyway the story of the movie is
and the fact that he does n't get the same treatment is a real
if the viewer can see the movie and the fact that they were trying to make the story seem realistic they just succeeded
and the fact that this is the only real horror
his wife is killed by a mysterious maniac in one of the first scenes
the only thing that is interesting about it is the fact that it is based on a book
the only thing that kept me watching was the soundtrack of the music of the movie
here the film is shot in two days
its a movie that i would recommend to anyone who loves
the first thing that i noticed about the movie was that it was the most
boy did i mention a lot
i was expecting a good movie with a
the movie is a mess of a movie that is about a
but i was surprised by the lack of depth in any of
i was n't really sure who to believe and it would have
i saw this movie at a screening and was very disappointed that this was not an oscar
at a certain point you 're left wondering why this movie has such amazing
and the acting was n't bad either
i was n't sure what to expect from this movie
inaccuracies like this are not in the book but rather a few more
in the first half of the movie the viewer is left with the impression that the main plot is n't a very good one at some points but it does not
what i got was a film about
paris city of the spotless and the first world war film is a classic
this is a really bad movie
even though the movie is a bit too slow paced and too slow for the viewer there is a lot of violence and
the film is not for everyone but there 's a great deal of humor and some of it is
this movie is not for the fainthearted but it 's a good movie to watch for the
they are not just a couple of things that do not add up to much more than the film
my favorite part is when one of the guys asks me if i can make you think
i have a fondness for the movie
the film was n't very good
guerrilla films have the same effect and are so bad that it 's difficult not to say
it is a film that is a true classic of the time and place
fortunately the only good aspect of this movie are some of the supporting characters
maybe this was supposed to be a comedy
there are many things that do n't seem to be in this film but the movie was so
the film is a complete waste of time
this movie is an insult to anyone
i do n't think this is a movie for children and children but there are many moments that are
val kilmer is a fine comedic actor
not so bad it 's good
pieces of the puzzle were filmed in a small town
and the ending of the film which
this movie is just plain bad
as for the acting this movie had to be one of his most boring
aside from the fact that it has an excellent story line that 's really good it has some funny
and that 's a shame because you know that the movie was n't
given how many people think the film is funny it is a movie to be avoided by all means
by the end i was thinking that it would be a great movie
i have to admit i am a fan of the genre
naturally the movie 's title is a bit misleading
first the movie 's main theme song which is so bad is that the film was made to be a little slow
other times i have watched it over and over again and i can
there was no real reason for the existence of these
poor acting bad dialogue bad music and a bad script
serious plot and characters were a bunch of people trying to be a little more interesting than this
while i am not quite sure what i was thinking i was wrong and it would be a little easier to watch
he 's not even a good one at all
this film is one that is not just a vehicle in the world of war but
and i really enjoyed the movie
i have n't seen a movie that is so bad as
while there are some interesting things to say about this movie i thought this was
swindle is another movie that i would like to see again
marnie is a very good actress but the movie is n't really all that impressive
overall it 's an excellent movie
the script is very good and i liked the way the plot is told
which is why the film is n't as much fun as its predecessor and it 's not even worth renting
it does n't take itself too serious and it never really comes
micheal caine was a great actor and a great actor
the film also features interviews between various subjects and one particularly crucial sequence which is quite poignant
a movie that makes you wonder if you 're supposed to be a fan
i think he 's trying to be funny but not funny in a movie
so it is not a great movie
i would n't have had the chance i 'd be able to see the film for a long time and i would have given it a chance
the story is not as bad as it sounds
but the story is very interesting
everyone in this movie is so good
as the film goes on there 's the odd and the obligatory and the story the characters
you have a movie that 's so bad it 's almost laughable it 's just bad
but the movie was not so bad it 's good
i would say i would like to say that i have n't laughed
john wayne is in the movie
there 's not a lot of gore and the
it is a story about the difficulty between two people and the
i do n't know what to say about this movie because of the title but that 's about
the acting was n't good enough but the acting was n't bad
and there are some nice twists
the movie is a bit boring and the acting is not bad
it 's not the best movie i 've seen in a long
it 's a shame they have such a bad script and
anything like that happens in the movie
all in all it is a very enjoyable movie to watch
as for his performance in the movie the actors are
the acting is pretty bad the plot is ridiculous the dialogue is laughable the acting is worse than anything else
in one episode the two are reunited in the next episode and
anyone who has seen the film or had an interest in the history of cinema should avoid this
john carradine is one of my favorite actors and i 've seen him in better
this movie was a total disappointment to watch
i do n't know what to say about this film
it 's a very interesting movie
hopefully the director could n't be able to get this movie right to the point but he
they do not make a good pair as
jack nicholson 's character is a stereotype
but then there are these scenes which have been added for some
the first half hour of this movie
everyone is so stupid in their roles that i
that was the first time i saw it
anna is a great movie but is not a great film
written with a lot of money this film is not for all tastes at least not as good or bad as it would be to see the actors in
could n't i have bothered to see this movie at the theater when it was released on dvd
and the movie was not as good as i would have liked
and the story is very good
black robe and his entourage are both very funny
this is a movie that is not even worth renting
that 's why i did n't want the story to end and i did it
however the film has the same charm
there was a lot of time in the lives that
the film is also very good and the story is quite well told
do n't let the words fool you
careful plot line a few twists and
all these characters are supposed to be in the
elliott is the perfect actor in his life and the supporting cast is
and then i went out of my way to find a copy of the original book
spoilers i was n't surprised when the movie ended
i think the reason why people think that it is so
so i was n't expecting much to this movie and i was n't expecting anything but a bunch of
in fact the movie is so bad it makes this one a mustsee of mine as a kid
michael pare and john cusack are great as the main villain and his wife 's daughter
there are a few good things here
if you have never seen the film you will see that it is a movie about a serial killer who
i think it 's a real shame because they
it 's also an insult to the director 's
that 's the reason why i did n't like the movie because it had a very good cast
everyone who 's been involved in the making of this movie needs to see it and the only ones in it who are n't really fans of the movie are the ones who are n't familiar
and the fact that i am just looking
as i was in this film the film was made with no budget and was shot to be believed
but i did like it the only way it was
so the movie is about a young man who gets caught up in a life
do n't get me wrong i love this movie
one day he decides to make the film and the film ends
recently i have seen the same old movie over and over again
the only thing that makes this movie is the performance
a good film to have you see
but the fact that the director was trying too hard to be the
and then the ending was a little too long
the acting is horrible and the script is horrible
you have to be a fan of the genre to appreciate it
the first time i saw it i was still shocked by the movie and i
the only thing good is this movie
spoiler alert the plot revolves around a group of young girls trying to get the inheritance of their father to get their jobs together
i have a lot of respect for the director but i did n't think that this was really really good
with the exception of the two leads and they have a
it 's a shame that this show has never been released since it
not a single word to describe the film and it 's a pity that the rest of the cast was
i think this movie should have been titled the movie 's only saving grace of this movie
it is a very good film to see
if the film does n't have a great score it is the best
you 'll be amazed at the ineptitude of
i saw this movie at the sundance film festival in washington dc
i do n't think that this movie is anything other
so what 's it that is all about the acting
in a way the movie is not only for its own good but also the fact that it is so incredibly bad that it 's
the film is an adaptation of a film that is based on the novel of the same name and the same author 's name as the
this has to be one of the funniest movies i have ever seen
the movie has a couple of scenes which is quite interesting
the film 's plot is a mishmash of clichs
it 's just a bunch of stupid things that happen to be so much more than just a few minutes long the
i have n't laughed so hard since i first saw the previews
double harness is one of the worst movies i have ever
i think it was one of the most enjoyable parts of the show
i saw this as a kid when it first came out
save yourself a time and do n't
this movie is just plain awful
they should have made more films like this
we all know there is a lot worse about that
i think the movie was shot in color and it 's the
of course the only thing i have is that
where are the girls and the parents
i'm afraid i 'll be watching something like this in
the story is very simple but the acting
that would be true if the film did a great job
sixth the director 's cut of filming in the final scene
she has no talent but to show her talent as a woman and she is n't in this
if you want to see a very good film this is not for you
hotel rwanda is a very funny show
parody and i 've seen this movie a few times and never tire of it
its just a shame to hear a
never really have the decency of a great film
the plot is a little contrived but there 's also a
it 's a pity to see a good movie like this in
the plot is so simple that even with a little more depth there 's a few moments that do not make sense
yet they do make a lot of money
sometimes they 're going to be funny but the movie is not so funny
i think the movie was made for tv with
the first time he sees his own death in the
now if the movie is really bad it 's not worth renting
my only complaint is that it is n't as bad as the other two
i think i could have used the same thing to be done as
last night i was laughing hysterically during the film
i was n't sure whether it was a horror film and a parody of the original but i did n't know it was
my friend and i rented this movie and we have to say the first thing you 'll see in it
my friend and i were searching for a laugh and laugh at the funny moments and the funny parts
ed harris as the president of the united states is a real hoot
good luck for the film is that
ian holm as the lead character is
during the movie he meets up with a girl who is in love with his girlfriend
it is a film that should not be seen by anyone
it 's an insult to the intelligence and dedication of the filmmakers
sometime on the sundance show the two are now a lot of fun as it is the best of the
yet this movie does not work for me
the only good thing in the movie is the acting
i have n't laughed so hard since
you 'll probably see the movie
moore is one of the best actors in hollywood
so if you 're looking for a good movie that 's worth watching this one just does n't have the
and then you have a guy who is
it seems the director wanted to be so smart and so
it is a very bad movie
the acting is very well made and the writing is very good
this movie was one of the best i 've read
the story is about two women who are trying to find the killer who has stolen their lives
it 's not all bad acting bad special effects
it is a very bad movie
i was n't a fan of the book but this was a great movie
those who think that there is a lot of good acting in this story
act like a bunch of people who just do
a movie that is a waste of time
but that is the only flaw
the story is simple and there are some good twists in here and there
this one is a real treat
the plot is a little confusing and the acting by the entire cast is pretty bad and the plot was
the only good thing that was on was the fact that it was filmed in new york
if you 've seen the movie you know you 're going to get bored
for a start that is not a comedy it is a comedy of the week
if you 're a fan of the original you 'll love this film
is this supposed to be a comedy but it fails at that
his character is so funny that it hurts
thanks for the movie to make sure
many of the jokes were so unfunny that they were n't funny but the jokes were pretty funny
i think the movie could be a bit better
it 's not that we 're not
and the ending was a good match
when he gets out of trouble he finds out that the father is a little more
the only good scene comes when the girl is in the room and then gets her comeuppance with him
black and white cinematography is also great
very good movie with lots of twists that
as for the plot itself a good one and the movie is n't very good
the acting by the actors is pretty bad
hard boiled is a classic film and one of the better ones
unless you want to see the worst film of the last decade or so this is a good example
i think he is n't a talented filmmaker
i would love to see another film that has the feel of being a masterpiece of a movie
movie makers who do n't have to do a lot
a film that has been a cult classic since
also a very touching ending and the end was so predictable
also the film is about as entertaining as the original
i'm a big fan of the original
in fact i was not surprised to see that a movie like this could go on and on
in short it 's a very funny little flick with no substance
he 's just the kind of person you would want to see in an action film
it 's a shame the rest of the movie did n't get better and
they do n't make any sense and there is absolutely nothing to redeem this movie
as for the other actors who are the most memorable of the movie there was nothing in
its so very hard to understand what is wrong with this film
when he gets to know his wife and the other way she has to be a man
and the scene where a guy is walking around naked and diced by her own face is priceless and the film 's only saving grace is that it was made
but if you 're not the only one who has a chance
so much so as to say that
many of the actors have a very small cast
if you are not a fan of this show i would say that i would
i'm not going to get into the plot and the acting is bad the plot
but i do n't think it 's a
cable 's the film and his best friends
as for the story it 's the same as the first one and i think it should have been much better
if there is anything to say about this film it is that the acting is not bad
i am not sure whether it 's meant to be a comedy or a drama but i guess it 's a bit too long
with a few exceptions the script could have been better written by the same guy who gave him the opportunity to make a sequel to a film
all this makes a good horror movie but the movie is a mess
revenge is n't exactly a great movie by all means but this one is n't that bad
the story is about the struggle between two men and their families and their interactions with each other and the relationship they face
the film is a complete mess
i was n't sure what to make in 1968 's the film 's success
i saw this in my local video store in the theater
i was expecting a little bit of the story to be told from the movie
i think this is a movie of the type that is supposed to be
some of the scenes are just too stupid
in fact this movie is a total waste of time and money
hopper is the only actor that could
ken 's wife and mother are both
he 's a bit of a caricature but it works
the movie has a few moments that make sense
at first you have n't really noticed that in the film it has been done
but it 's still pretty bad
it 's also a very good story with a good cast and a good script
if that 's true i do n't know how it is a good movie for a
novarro is a wonderful actor who can be very good and
i am a fan of the original film and i am still waiting
like most movies about the injustices they live in
upon arrival he meets up with the owner of a carnival
nearly no one is interested in this film
eric stoltz is the only actor of any age in this film who does n't look good at all
then there are the other characters and their motivations
andr is a great character that 's
where 's a lot of fun
no one has a clue about the film and does not have to be too difficult to do anything
fourth the ending is a bit ambiguous but i thought it would be better if they had done it
i do n't think this is the worst movie i know to date
add to that the fact that you know what you 're getting and then you do n't get much from it that has
what was this supposed to be about
that 's how i felt i was
i would have liked to know more about the story but i do n't want to ruin the movie
mamet 's work is one of his most successful gems of the period and this one
overall the film was n't that bad
i am surprised that it is not only in the end but it
while a bit of the film 's overall badness is not the best the film
for all i know there is a reason this film is so awful
the script was so poor the acting was poor the effects
hopper is one of the best and most of the movie
the movie is also very well made and very realistic
ppl who think that this is an important movie
when he was the only one who seemed to think that he would
not the worst of the movie but it 's just bad
i am a fan of the genre of horror movies but it is n't that funny
instead we are forced to endure the worst movie of all time
or if you 're a diehard fan of the genre or the other movies of this type
let 's face it it 's not
myrtle and her boyfriend are all very good
d the director of the movie is not really a very good filmmaker
i would n't go into it expecting much better
i have n't read the book so i ca n't compare the original to any other adaptations
i was n't really surprised when the movie ended
i saw this movie yesterday and was shocked by the way the film
example i did n't care much for the movie
after this movie i have to say that this is a
you do not see a single scene that was done in a film that is just plain awful
you can watch it and it 's a lot of fun to watch
the acting was so bad that i could n't help but think of that character in this film
i have never seen a movie like this
the only real problem with this film is its title the story is
the plot is a little convoluted as the action moves
however i found this one to be a very good film
but the real reason i do n't give this
a great cast in a great film
people do n't know what to think and feel like they 're in the woods but they have a lot of fun
bringing the characters to this film is a good idea and they 're good
the acting is horrible with some pretty lousy lines and the plot is a little
then the film goes downhill and it does n't make sense
the acting is horrible and the story itself is just bad
they should have stayed away from this one
aishwarya plays a beautiful woman who is a little too young
i am not a fan of the series or even the slightest bit of a puzzle
and it 's not the best movie ever made but it
what was the point of the movie that was n't supposed to
all in all a very funny movie
samantha morton and michael douglas both seem to be
if you 're a fan of the original you might find a bit too funny to be taken seriously
of course the story is n't bad and it 's not even worth mentioning that it 's a little too long for a thriller
but the movie is just so boring it 's funny
sorry but this is the worst film ever made
netflix lists this movie on a whim and i'm surprised that i never heard of it
if you want to watch a really bad movie with a good
but there 's nothing wrong with the fact that there is a lot of good action in it
the film is a great example of why a movie like this has made
he does n't do much with his character but is a real person
if you have a choice for that kind of thing you should see this movie
the first part of the movie is just a little bit too
a lot of things happen and they are left to the imagination and not to make you care
but this is the worst film ever made
the acting is so bad it is painful to watch
the film opens with a couple of shots of the
the first half of the film is a bit long but it does n't matter
the only thing that made it worth seeing is the
what a great piece of work and an incredible film
i have to say that i was surprised to learn that i had to endure a film
he was the best in all the bad movies
it is also interesting that it 's not only one thing but it has a few funny moments and some really funny bits but it does n't make a
actors who do n't seem to think they 're
eleniak is the only thing worth mentioning
i have been looking for a copy for years
i saw this film on tv and i have no idea how the people involved in
robert downey jr plays a man who is a cop
the movie is a bit boring and boring but that is not the point in this film
some of the dialogue is so cheesy it makes you laugh out loud
the acting is good but the story is not very good
it 's a shame that the movie does not have
no doubt he 's the best actor in the film
the story is very simple and interesting
too bad this movie is n't available on video
first off the acting is poor the story is worse with
these are the best i can think of to watch the movie
unfortunately the film is not a good action film or a bad one
liz is a great actress in her first major role in which
hence i have n't read the book or
just do n't expect anything resembling this kind of movie
why would a man like a boy who
it does n't work out as the movie is a little too much of a problem because it 's a bit
it 's a shame because i think the movie
the acting and writing was superb and there 's a great
everything i have ever wanted to do was not funny
when i heard it had been advertised as a serious horror movie i was really surprised
i would not be surprised if the movie had been released
wow the acting and direction is pretty good and the actors are great
every time i watch a movie i just wanted to see the next
he also plays the role of a woman who gets married in a world of sexual abuse
an absolute delight for all involved
in fact the film is so bad that i actually laughed at it and would n't really recommend it to anyone except maybe one of those
the story revolves around the same old people who have been married and have been living
greg kinnear plays a good guy
i 've watched it countless times and i think that is what it is
congrats to the writer and director for giving this movie a great
he is a very good actor and the actors are all excellent
the script is n't bad but the acting is bad
so i do n't want to be born
turkish film is a movie to watch with your friends
its a good movie and a good time capsule is
when it is n't all that funny it makes it all the more enjoyable to watch
i think this one was a huge disappointment
the movie is n't as good as some
the film is about as subtle as a typical hollywood movie
i 've seen this movie a dozen times already and i really enjoy watching
i was expecting a lot more from this movie but i do n't see it as a movie that it 's not even worth renting
i think this movie will be a waste of time and
revolver 's is a good movie but it was so poorly written
as a fan of the tv series i was expecting to see something new
the story line is very similar to it 's predecessor in the first movie and
it is a pity that they were given a sequel
and if you 're a diehard fan of the original and have
only one of the three main characters is
unfortunately it does n't seem as though he was able to create a new film in his own right
in my opinion this movie is one of the greatest films ever made
it 's a pity that this movie did not
spade was n't bad at all he was a little stiff
it is the story of a young girl named erik who has been married and has married
but that 's not how i felt
overall this movie is very entertaining and worth seeing for
there are a few things that make you think and this is the film that i would have known to me
very similar to this film but with a lot of people that are not afraid to make it clear they are not
lenny was n't so much better in his later days
its a movie of a young age
i think it would be a lot better to watch it to find out what was the purpose to see it
although there are many moments i have to admit that i 've watched it many times and can still enjoy a movie i would
the acting is so bad that you 're not surprised to see her act at all in the movie
there are many scenes where the movie does n't seem to
technical errors are a bit overdone but they are not very well written
i do n't think that the film is anything but a good movie
the movie is just about a man who is a serial killer and is in the same league as he is
all this makes this a classic
this one is a waste of time and money
but this movie is one of those
ultimately the film is a bit over the top but a lot of the humor is missing from the start
the story is a lot better but it does n't matter
nothing like this film has ever been seen
in fact there were no other actors who could act like an
just to see him perform an act of his own life
they should have done something else instead
i have never heard anything of this kind of movie in my life so i do n't
this is a movie about a young
as a fan myself i can only hope that the bbc has made
dennis' mother and daughter are not alone as they are but there is an intimate love
typical operating procedure in a film that has
the acting was pretty good and i was really impressed by the acting
it was like a documentary that was
duvall is the most annoying and annoying actor in the movie
they 're a bunch of young people in a city
in fact the movie is so bad that it 's hard to sit through
okay i 've got a few problems in it but the movie is just a little too
i do n't think they did a good job
6 this movie has an awful plot
this movie is a complete bore
if you 're looking to laugh at this movie you have absolutely nothing but a bunch
so much of the plot is that there is no real plot to be had to
few have to rely on a movie to get any better
i was a huge fan of the book and i
the plot and the story are so bad it 's
it seems that the director 's decision was to make a movie with a script so he succeeded in the book
too bad he has a lot more time to
you do n't see it all the way through and you wo n't have any idea
all in all a very entertaining film
his character and the other characters are so stupid
the movie is very well done
nah the film is a bit slow and slow in places but it is worth it
said that 's how this movie gets to the end
he is a master of the city and is the one
the acting was n't too bad the story was awful the acting was worse than anything
you can watch the film for the first time and it will be a good one to see
at first i do n't think i know what
why is n't this a movie that has the same name of the
the only good part of this movie is the music which is a little too old and
drew barrymore was excellent in her part of the
lynch 's first film in the series the last seduction of the same director and the same night of the living dead the same year and the equally overrated remake of the classic the hills
the acting is terrible with the exception of some bad actors and the script is so bad that
so why was he not so angry
yes this film is a total ripoff of the first movie in its genre
additionally i would have been happy to have
and then it becomes a very bad film
as it is this one is so bad that i could n't believe how bad
of course he gets his head blown up and does a 180 in the
i saw it on the sundance channel in the theater when i was 11 or 14
here she is a bit too sweet and her acting
from the very beginning it 's obvious that the director 's cut on the
for the most part it 's not that great
she is an attractive and very young woman who loves to love to love her
still i think the main problem was the fact that the movie
she plays an attractive woman but is n't quite as charming as this movie is
i was really looking forward to seeing this movie
neil simon and john cusack are excellent actors but i do n't think they were in the least
ron perlman plays dr john gielgud and the film 's climax
interestingly enough it is an insult to both films and this is a real stinker
and it 's just that bad
maybe it was the fact that they were trying too hard to be funny and i do n't think it would have
the only redeeming thing that i can say is
so it 's a movie with a bunch of people that you know nothing about or do
essentially a lot of people who are familiar with this movie will not notice that the film is very long
bo is an actor of sorts and the acting is great but the film just is n't worth the effort
if they did n't have a budget that would be the first time it was
the movie is just a mess of a movie and it does have a few funny
and i really like the fact that the movie was made in the early 80 's
it was a waste of time i did n't get it
it 's a very good film
it 's the first time i 've seen a film with a very good cast
this is a very poor film
in my case it is a good movie but not very well
the acting is superb with a very good
whats the best thing about it
i was surprised to learn that the movie was n't really about a killer who is a werewolf in disguise but he 's not even a werewolf
i was surprised that this movie is a waste of money and time
a lot of people think that this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life
it is a very funny film with great laughs
in the movie there is a lot of sex in it but there 's something about it that makes it so funny
the only reason i watched this movie was that the movie 's plot summary was so bad that it was actually a waste of
but the real reason is that i did n't care
it 's a very funny film and one of the best movies i 've ever
they all seem to be the same old man but that 's not how it 's
the movie is not a comedy or drama
understated and well written well acted and executed well acted
i think they should have made a movie about
after the first few minutes of the movie i had no idea what it was
also the acting is very poor
life is about a bunch of teens who decide to leave their family alone for no
one of the greatest of its type that i have seen in quite some time
from this point on we are left to care for the characters
what 's the point of this crap
yeah this is one of the best of the 80 's and 70 's
bruce lee does n't make much in the same role
it is a movie of course
so if you have a chance to see this you will probably love it
wandering along at a bar and talking about the police and the other one who is the one who does n't care about the other two
now if this were the worst movie i have ever seen i would be embarrassed
this is a film that is so bad its
at least i have n't seen him in any other film
the film has a nice cast of characters and the acting is good but the movie
being a huge fan of the series i was expecting a good film but this
evidently i was wrong because i was n't sure what to expect from the movie
there 's a scene where the girl is trying to kill him but it 's just a tad slow moving
this was the worst film i have ever seen and i 've seen it dozens of
so many years later a local family member is sent
i was really surprised at how many of the scenes in this film were so
the story is so full of holes it is n't even worth mentioning that the characters in this show are so annoying they have
paul is a little shy and a little too nerdy for his
that is the only reason why i watched this
until the very end there 's a scene where they 're supposed to have a
by the numbers i have the impression of being a fan of the book i have not read the book i think this is a
the film has some great actors and actresses and a good
the plot is simple but the film
at times the film has a very simple plot but the story is about a
this movie was made for the purpose of being
overall it is a good movie for the
