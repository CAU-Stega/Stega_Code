well i guess it 's not a bad movie but it 's not
it 's just a shame that this
or maybe it was a good idea for the movie to be made
overall i 'd say that this film
i was n't expecting much but i was n't expecting much
sometimes the film is a bit of a stretch of

george lucas is the only one who has ever been able to get the money back
brian yuzna was a very good filmmaker and this film is not for me
our heroes are not so bad they 're just bad

the movie is not about the people in the world or the way they are portrayed in the film
highly recommended for those who love the genre

and it was the first time i saw this movie
i have n't seen it since i saw a clip of this film and the only

she was a little too old for her role and i do n't think that
the film is a bit of a mess and a bit of an allout thriller but the
unfortunately the movie is not a good one
and the film 's main flaw was to make the audience feel like a voyeur
renting this movie if you want to see the mst3k version

darr is a film of the highest caliber of the genre
my favorite parts were the ones that did n't make me laugh
how can i not get into the movie
his character is the best character ever to grace
one can only wonder how the director could have
they are not the ones to blame
because it has the potential of a good movie
she 's a very nice woman but she has no talent whatsoever
you 'll have to see it to
could n't they have done a good job
this movie is so bad it 's funny
it 's just so bad that it 's almost impossible to watch
this is a very good movie
a lot of the movie is about a young woman named anna who has to deal

this movie is so bad i ca n't remember anything worse
i do n't think i have ever heard of this movie
other people are n't even aware of the fact that the movie has no redeeming qualities
this movie is a great example of how a film can be
anyway i think it 's a good film
first off i have to admit that this movie
this is a very good show
it 's not a bad movie but it is n't
i was n't expecting a great deal of the movie but i was pleasantly surprised
crystal has a great voice and is the only one who has a voice
there are some great scenes in the movie
gay people are the only ones who do n't like it

such as a few of those movies that are so
aware the film is not a good film
this movie was so awful that it was actually painful
first of all the acting was horrible and the plot was just plain awful
i have n't read the books but this is the best of the series
the film is a bit slow at first but also it 's not as bad as the first
but the movie is not about the war and the
this is a movie that you can watch and enjoy
race is a very bad show
the movie was shot on location at the time
on the other hand i have seen the movie numerous times and it 's not even that
i was so impressed with the story and the characters and the story line was
i do n't think that the director was trying to make it to the
it 's the same old movie that has been made in the past
no matter how many times he is in a film he is a master of his craft
i was expecting a lot more from this movie and i did not think it was good
as for the story the acting is very poor
both of the two men have been married to each other and the
i was n't expecting anything more than this
and i do n't think that the director was able
while i do n't think the movie was intended to be a comedy it 's still pretty funny
however i think it was very well made
i have seen this movie several times and i still love it
spoilers spoilers spoilers ahead i saw this movie when i was a child and i loved it
jesse is the best of the bunch
she is the only reason i have to watch the whole movie and i do n't think i 've seen any other
clichd characters and situations that are so poorly
thank god i have n't seen this
nothing really happens in the film
a very good film and a great film
to say it 's not a bad idea is beyond
the movie is about the struggle between two men in the same way
but the film is so bad that you ca n't help but
we 're supposed to sympathize with a bunch of
looking at the cast and crew of this movie i was very impressed
the acting is good the plot is good and the story is a bit farfetched
it 's a shame that the film has n't received any recognition for the entire cast
all in all this is a very
interesting and exciting but the film has
claudette colbert is a good actor and is the
but the real star of the film is the presence of a young woman
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
but the movie is a bit too slow and
they are all very good and have
for a film about a woman that has been murdered by a man she
for the first time in a while i was a little surprised by the fact that the
she 's not the least bit attractive she has to be
the film is a complete waste of my time and
we are not told that the story is not the same
as for the rest of the cast i
the acting is pretty bad but the script and direction are all very
although this is a good film it 's not as good
this is a movie that you will
do not be fooled by the critics on the dvd cover
there is a lot of action and suspense in it
however the movie has no plot and no real plot
it is not a movie for kids or adults who want to see it but
one of them was a great actor and a great actor
i was n't expecting much from this film
the film is a bit too slow and the acting is not good but the story
it 's not that bad but it is n't that bad and that is why i ca
john goodman was a good choice for his role
all i can say is wow
the story is about a group of friends who go on a mission to find a way out of their inheritance but
she 's a great actress and she is perfect
a few scenes of the movie are just a little too long and it 's too hard to be sure that the director intended a bit of humor in the film to keep you watching and wondering what the
the movie is a complete mess
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
i was so bored that i could not even finish the movie
the movie is a little bit of an exercise in the genre
he was the most popular actor in the film and he was very good in
in the end it 's a great film and i recommend it to anyone who
it is a movie that will appeal to everyone who loves to be entertained by their intelligence
we have to watch this film for a long time and it is a great film that
i think that this film is a must watch for all fans of the genre
the film is a little slow paced and
some people may have been so offended
the acting and the script is very good
it 's not that i think that the actors were too good to be a great
please do n't waste your time on
kathy bates is a wonderful actress
the movie is a bit too long and it 's not a great film but it is very good
all in all i think this film is a must

this is a very funny and funny movie

in the end i was n't sure if the film was intentional or what
confused and boring is a film that is n't worth watching
ok i have to say that i have n't seen a movie that is so bad
scary movie 3 is one of the best movies ever
the film is a very good film and the actors are very good
but it 's just not a good movie
too many times when the movie 's first half hour is
for a movie made in the early 90s i found the
he is a very talented actor
coincidentally the movie has a lot of problems
but this film is a must see
while i was n't expecting a good movie i was n't disappointed
then i saw the movie and i think that it was the funniest of the
i have seen this film several times and still ca n't believe it
cushing is a great actress and i have always been one of the few people who
the film is not about the war of war or the
plus the acting is n't bad either
i was surprised to see this film in the theater and it
beery 's portrayal of the president of the united states is so palpable that i could
along the way we learn that the man who killed the girl in the end is a man
they are all very different and they 're not just a bunch of kids
both of them have a lot of screen time
the film is a little bit of
some of the acting is good but it 's
so the movie has a few moments where the characters are so stupid that i could n't help but laugh
so i was surprised to see this movie
united artists of the time and their ability to create a new
the film is a little slow but i do n't think the movie
how can you have a movie that is so bad that it
the acting is good but the script is so poor that you ca n't even tell what is happening
i have never been a big fan of the genre of the series but it 's still fun to watch and the movie is still very good
recently i saw this movie and i must say i
also the movie is n't as bad as the first
we are not supposed to care about any of this
as for the story the acting and the directing is very good and it is
worthwhile to see a film like this that is not only a good film it is a good
cutting it down and then get the movie
a few years ago i was able to watch a movie that is a bit more interesting than this
all i can say is that i was n't disappointed in seeing this film
maybe it would have been a little more interesting
without the aid of a man of the age it 's a very good film
if you are looking for a good film to see in a theater this is not for you
after a few seconds of watching it i was wondering what was the purpose of it all
then again i have seen it
with the help of a few other people who were involved the movie could n't have
it 's a pity to see such a bad movie
why do n't you think the story is
the film is a bit slow moving and the ending is too predictable but it 's still
but the movie has a lot of fun
i have n't read the novel but i think it would have been
it 's the kind of movie you would like to watch and enjoy
his performance is so bad it 's almost laughable
another thing i did n't like was that the film was so bad that i had no idea
its a very good movie with a lot of action and great performances by everyone involved in this movie
but i have to admit that i am not a fan of the book
look for a good cast of actors
i do n't know why i did n't watch it
rich and beautiful the film is a perfect example of why
stop the movie and save yourself the time to watch it
a few years ago i was a bit skeptical of the movie and i
my advice is that if you 're looking for a movie that is a bit of a comedy
i'm sure it would have been better
they are the only ones that really do n't have the same level
it is a shame that this film was released on
yet the story is not that bad but it is not
ok i have n't seen it yet
this movie is not worth the price of admission
its the kind of movie you would like to see again in your lifetime or maybe it
spoiler ahead the movie starts out with the girl getting shot and the head is in the background
the movie was a bit slow
apparently the movie was made for the sake of the viewer to identify with the characters but i
my only criticism is that the film was shot in a time where it was
ok so i guess i 'll be honest
with the help of the two leads the two of them are in the movie
and that does not mean that it was n't the worst movie i 've seen in a long time
just as the film is a bit too much to ask for a
it is a very good film
taken from the original the story is told in a flashback and the story is about a man who is in love with a woman and
whenever you 're watching this film you will have a good time with it
the film has a very interesting story
after seeing this movie i thought that it was a good movie
i do n't think that a good thing can be said for this movie
i have to say that i was impressed by the fact that
while i do n't know what to say about it i was n't impressed
they have a lot of fun to watch
after a while i thought it was a
the film is about a young woman who is attracted to a young man
this film is not a good film but the
now i am a sucker for the fact that this movie was made by the same director as it did in this movie
oh and the music is very good as well
composition is a very strong one
mike binder was a great choice for his role as the conflicted father and his father
further it was a great show for me
don knotts is a fine actor but the movie is so awful
all in all i think it is one of the best and most underrated movies
it 's the kind of thing that you would like to see in the theater
redcoat is a good actress but it
it is n't the best of the series
either way it is a movie that will appeal to anyone
the film is about a man who is a woman
and i do n't know why
my favorite parts of the movie are when the girl is trying to kill her and the girl who has her mouth ripped out
it 's a pity that the film is n't as bad as the first
this is a very good film
at the end of the movie the audience is left
artie lange is excellent in this role as the young woman
there are many many things that i 've seen about
the film is about the power of the characters
the film is a bit too slow but it does n't really matter
however the film is n't really a comedy
i have never seen a film that has a
in the end it is not a bad movie it 's a good movie to watch
i was so impressed with the story and i could not help but wonder what was going on and what happened
that is what this movie has going for it
these are two of the best movies ever made
when he is in the hospital he is forced to go to the police
once again this film is so bad that the only thing i have to say is that it is not even worth the time to view it
the film has a very interesting and interesting story
not only is the story of an interesting love triangle between the two leads but they are also quite
nowadays it was a good film but it did not
this was a very good movie
at one point i was thinking of the first movie i saw the trailer for this movie
every character was a real jerk
did i mention that it is a film about a young woman who is a little
on the other hand the movie is a complete waste of time and money
janmichael vincent plays the lead role as the evil and vengeful man
imagine this film is a very good film
for the first time in the movie i was a bit confused about this movie and i was surprised at

thank you for allowing me to watch this movie and you will see how many people have seen this
slow motion is a little bit too much for me but i do n't think that

kudos to the director for putting the blame on his face and his own vision of the
still this movie was a good idea to make a great movie and
the movie is about a group of people who go to a small island to spend a weekend together in
and the movie is so bad
it is a movie that you should see
this is a very bad movie
what 's the deal with the story of the man who plays a young man who has no qualms about the past
the acting is horrible the story is bad and it is n't even worth mentioning
i do n't know what to say about the
during the course of the film the viewer has no idea who the culprit is
there is a very funny scene where the guy says
i was n't impressed by the film
i have n't seen this movie in my entire life so i ca n't wait until i see
since i was in the mood for something more interesting to watch i could n't help but wonder how the movie
land of the living dead is a film that will appeal to everyone involved and should definitely not
blatant spoilers ahead of the story
the acting is horrible the story is ridiculous and the acting is horrible
this movie is a must see for anyone who wants to watch
but the movie does not make much sense and the characters do not really care
take it from me and give it
if you are looking for a movie about a young man you should see this movie
the film is very well made and the actors are great
characters are n't developed to be believable
set in the present day globalization of a young woman 's journey is a little too much for her own
it 's a shame because i do n't want to spoil the movie for

some people have commented on this film but i have to agree that this is a
when i saw it i could n't help but laugh at it
it 's just a bad film
it 's a very bad movie that is not even worth renting
i have to say i was very disappointed in
for a movie that has a few redeeming features to be made it is a film
it 's not a bad movie either
the movie was a complete failure
but the film 's biggest problem is its
considering how bad this movie is i have to say that i was a little disappointed
i have to admit that i was a little surprised at the amount of time i spent watching this
definitely not the greatest film i 've seen in a long time
over a year ago i was looking for a good film to watch
when the movie ended you 'd think it was the best
the movie has some of the worst acting i 've ever seen
if you 're not a fan of horror films and are interested in the
will the director please explain that he is a talented director

my favorite parts of the film are the ones where the two are talking about the
let me tell you that i am not a fan of the genre
there is a very funny and funny scene in this film
if the film had a chance to make a good movie about it the
i was n't expecting much of a film
the film is a little bit slow moving but the film is a great piece of work
the movie is a complete waste of time
at first i thought i 'd give it a try but i did n't
she is a very beautiful young woman
the film has some good points but the plot is so weak that it is hard to care
parts of the film were just too much to make me feel like i was watching the movie with a
but it was n't a good movie
with a cast of characters that are supposed to be the main character 's wife 's daughter
and i was n't sure why i was n't in the mood for a movie that was n't funny or interesting enough
a lot of things happen in the movie
unfortunately it 's not a bad movie
she is the only person who is a good
i was so impressed with the story that i was surprised at the end
but i think that the best part of the movie was when it was shown in the first place
although it was n't the worst movie i 've ever seen i was n't sure whether the
someone who has a copy of this movie has no clue what it is
though i was n't expecting anything much from it i did n't expect anything much from the film
even if it was a good movie the
blaine and dunne are the best actors of the film and their performances are superb
nick nolte is a fine actor and is always underrated
no matter how many times it 's been done and you have to see the whole thing you will
what a shame that i did n't get
two men in a different world and the other
there are many scenes where you can see the director 's cut and the camera shots are so bad and the lighting and editing is so amateurish that
leaving the room for a while is
as a result it 's just a bad excuse for a movie
in the meantime it was a little too late and the movie did n't get much better
i was surprised by the way the director and director approached a movie that
the story is simple but it does n't matter
the film was shot at a time in the west and i was n't sure why it did n't get released on
yet the movie has a few faults
it 's just a bad movie and
i do n't think it 's that bad
the movie is a complete bore and it 's not even worth the
i was n't expecting much from it at all
but i think the director should be ashamed of
and i think the movie is n't bad at all
but the film is n't that bad
i do n't think i can ever watch the whole film again
the film is a very good film and the performances are excellent
how could they make it a good film
there was a lot of action and a few scenes of violence but it did n't matter that much
i have seen a lot of movies that have been made in the past
did n't they think the film was going to be a
it was so bad that it was funny
as the story unfolds the film begins to unravel the plot and
i do n't know how many times i have seen this movie but i have to say
i was so impressed by this movie that i was n't even sure
some of the actors in the movie are very good
andy garcia is the most underrated character ever in
and the ending was a bit abrupt and i did n't really understand why the movie had so little
do n't get me wrong i love the movie but i think it was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life
because the film is a little too much for the genre
could have done a better job
for me the most important part of this movie is the music
i do n't think this movie has a
khorda 's character was the first one to
but i was n't sure what it was
for the first half hour i thought it was going to be a good movie
why do they keep making movies like these
but it 's still pretty fun to watch
you can watch it and you wo n't regret it
only one thing that i can say about this is that the film is very good
i was expecting a lot more from the film but it was not as good as the first film and i
i think that the film was made for the sole purpose of being a
rudy vallee was the only one who could have played the part
i was expecting a movie that was a little bit too long for
it 's just not a movie for kids who want to
what a shame that the film is not a total waste of time
they 're just so funny they 're all funny
the film has no real plot and is a complete waste of time
i was n't sure what to expect from this movie
i think the film 's biggest problem with the film is the
her character was so annoying that it was almost unbearable to watch
by now the movie has a good cast
certainly the worst movie i have ever seen
the acting is horrible and the script is a joke
the film is a very good film
it 's not even that funny
jessica alba is a delight to watch
when the film 's main characters were revealed the audience would be left to care for themselves
no one has ever seen this movie
but i do n't know why i have never heard of this show and have n't read the book
so the movie is a bit of an exercise in logic
so the film is not a complete waste of time
here is the story of a girl who 's been kidnapped by the devil
in this case it is the best thing i can say about this film
steiger is a fine actor and he does a good job as a man who gets to know his wife
peter o'toole plays his role perfectly and is a joy to watch
thanks to the cast for the role of a young girl the story is very interesting
marilyn monroe is a very good actress
limbo was a very funny movie and it was a great movie
nothing happens and i do n't want to spoil anything but i 'll say that
i do n't think i 've ever heard of this show before
if you want a movie to make you laugh then go ahead
lost highway was a very good film
one thing is that it 's not even funny
i have never been so compelled to sit through a
gangsters who are n't in the military and do n't
sonatine is a very good film with a great cast
and the ending is very predictable
so if you are a fan of

i have n't seen this film in a long
troy is an old guy with a heart of gold and he 's a good guy
the film is a complete bore
i have n't seen the movie in my entire life
is the story a bit of a mess
this is a great movie for everyone who wants to see a
in this movie the characters are so stupid that you can almost feel sorry for them
of course there is a scene where the two brothers are talking to the camera in the
janet gaynor plays the young woman who is a little bit too young to play
i was n't sure if the film was intentional or not
director robert zemeckis is a master of his work and is a great filmmaker
they were the best and most of the
now i have to say that i was
lauren bacall is a wonderful actress and i really
why is it that the movie does n't have
we have the movie on the whole
plenty of blood and nudity and gore
regarding the movie i found myself wishing that it would have been released
and it 's a shame because it is a great film
the movie was a bit of fun to watch and i really enjoyed that
therefore the story is a bit weak but i think the movie is a bit too long
while this movie has a lot of problems it 's just plain bad
5 a few scenes are just plain
the acting was terrible the story was awful and the acting was bad
martin scorsese is a master of the
instead it was a complete waste of time
i do n't think it 's a good idea to write a script for this movie
in a way the movie was so bad that i could n't even watch it
but i have to say that i was very impressed with how the movie was
on a technical level this movie could have been a lot
obviously the director of the movie has n't seen
john wayne was a good actor but he was not the worst actor in this movie and it was n't
so i have to give credit where i went
then again i was a bit skeptical of the movie but
as the film opens you can see how the director 's vision of the film can be interpreted
the film is about a group of people trying to find their way home
this movie is a great piece of art
what i did like was the acting the
unfortunately the film is so bad that i could n't believe it
i was n't expecting much but the film had some good points but it was not enough
bottom line it 's a great movie
when i saw this movie i was very impressed and i had never seen it in a theater
i have seen this movie several times and i still love it
but i think it 's the worst movie i have ever seen
it 's not even the kind of movie where the hero
he 's a great character actor and he 's a great actor
cheapjack action sequences and the occasional action scenes are not very memorable and the ending was just too predictable
all in all it was a very
the film is a little slow but the ending is a bit unsatisfying
on a technical side note the film has an interesting story
its a good film but it 's not
sherman 's evaluation of the film is not only a
first of all this film is not worth a look
that 's the way it is presented
seriously i think this is the best movie i have ever seen
in fact the whole thing is a mess

the film is a complete waste of time and money
but it 's not a movie
let me say that this was not a great movie
first of all the acting is terrible
moronic movie that was so bad it was funny
death bed was a good movie
watching this film i was reminded of the real life of the characters

although i do n't understand how it was made and i thought that the movie was a bit too slow
i do n't know why the director was able to make this
she was so cute and so cute
she 's a very beautiful woman
the film is a little too talky and too predictable
his wife has a onenight stand with him
more like an extended version of the book
mcclane is a very funny character and he 's very believable
there is a lot more to the story
i was n't expecting much from this movie
i was so bored by the movie i had to
there is a scene where he is a victim of the movie and
instead of a good movie i just saw this movie
the film was a little too long and i did not expect much from the
the film is a complete failure and it is not worth the time
i have to say that it 's a great film
it is a shame that the movie did not receive a wider audience in the us
it was a good idea but it is not a good one
it is not that i think it is a good movie
if you 're a fan of the original and have seen the original you might want to check out some of the other films
i was so impressed with the story and the story
he is not the only one who has the slightest amount of
mick cain is the only actor who is very good as well
the movie is a complete waste of time
instead we are left wondering why this is not a sequel to the original
the film is a complete waste of time
except for the fact that it has a few good points it 's still a pretty good movie
i think it 's the funniest of all the batman movies
the movie is a little slow paced but it 's still a very
snakes and monsters are n't as bad as they are
this is the first time i have
i think it 's the best of the three movies
but the story of the movie is so simple that it makes the story
the film is very well directed and directed by michael winner
the film is not a complete mess
a lot of people have already commented on this film and i have to say
i was surprised to find that the story was not so much more interesting and interesting
the movie was shot in a small town in mexico and it was filmed in the
executive producer john hughes is a director who is
to me this movie is a masterpiece of the art of art
the acting is horrible and the plot is just plain stupid
but it 's not that good
and the film 's ending was so
it was a waste of time
lorenzo lamas was the perfect choice for a movie like that
as for this film it 's not a bad movie
the film has a very good cast including a young man who has
though i do n't know what the movie is supposed to be i just do n't know if it is the same
the film is about a young man named luis who has an accident with
this movie is not a bad movie
i do n't know what to say
i think that the best way is the way the characters are portrayed
i have never seen the original version and
hymer is the only reason why she is so great and the rest of her life is so beautiful that you ca n't help thinking that
upstairs is a very good film
make sure you 're a fan of
i was so disappointed with this film
he is a great actor but he 's not a great actor
the film 's main drawback is that it
i have to say that this is the worst
to be honest the movie was n't bad
the acting was terrible the script was horrible and the acting was bad
overall this film is not a bad
i was n't impressed by this film
too bad the film is n't so long as a film
everybody else is just plain bad
but it 's not a good movie
i have never heard of this film before
the film 's plot is a little confusing and it 's not a good movie
the movie has a few funny moments but it is just not worth
this movie is a must see
so i was expecting something like this to be a good movie
i do think that this movie is a waste of time and money and time
yet it is a film that will be remembered
sit down and watch this one with a smile and laugh
i have never been more impressed with such a bad
the story is a simple one
this is a movie for everyone to watch
mercifully the story is not that good but the actors
sometimes i have to say i was a little disappointed with this film
perhaps this was the first time he was in his prime
where was it that i 'd never seen in a movie
as i said earlier the film has an interesting plot and is n't a comedy or a comedy
this movie was made in a hurry in the early days of the 20th century
both the story and the characters are very well developed and it 's a shame that it has
i was surprised by the ending
much like the film the story of this film is a
the acting is good and there are a few laughs
i have n't seen this movie in years
several of the scenes in the film are very funny
perhaps the film is n't as good as the original but it is n't as bad as
get a lot of people to watch the movie and
zizek has made an interesting movie that is a great example of how the film
but the movie has the same problems with this film
they are both funny but they do
some have commented on the film 's plot and the acting
even the music is n't very bad
at least the film is n't that bad
perfectly acted and directed and produced
it 's a pity because it is
in fact i would have given the show a higher rating but the acting and direction
the acting is pretty good and the story is a bit too contrived for a thriller
when the movie starts it 's not a bad thing to begin with
alan rickman is excellent and his character is very interesting and believable
thinking about the movie and you will see how the director managed
he is a very good actor
denzel washington is a great actor
there is no real reason why the movie is called the
but the story of the movie was just so bad
in the end it 's a very good film
but it is a very good movie and a good one at that
his character is the only character who seems to care about him
rowan atkinson is great as always
where was the gore and the blood
why did n't the director make a film about
here 's a list of things to make a good movie
he 's not a good actor but
but the film is not as good as the first two but it does
the movie is a little bit of an insult to the
even the actors who played the main character were
watch this film for a laugh
the acting is pretty bad and the plot is pretty weak
there is no way to get a copy of the original
this is a great movie for those
this is one of the few films that i would recommend
sawyer is a very nice movie
however the film is a complete mess
there are some good scenes in the film
this movie was so bad that i was actually
as the movie progresses the story develops slowly and slowly becomes increasingly confusing
funny how i can get a copy of this movie
amos is not the only one to die in the end but the rest
the story line is very weak but it 's still pretty good
there are some good scenes in the film but the film
it 's just a shame that it has n't made any difference
the film 's premise is that of a man who has a wife and a son
although i was impressed by the acting and the direction it seemed to drag on and on
his performance was so bad that i had to watch the whole thing
now this is a good example of the genre
not to mention the lack of a decent story
i was expecting a lot from the first movie but this
and the movie has the best of all it has
example the fact that it 's just a bunch of random characters
i was n't really expecting much from this movie and it was n't a good film
only a couple of scenes that are n't even close
fighting of wits and the beast and it 's a great film to
like the other reviewer said i was n't disappointed
i do n't think i 've ever seen a movie that is so bad
i was surprised that this film was n't released theatrically in dvd
tom is a good actor and he plays the part
and i was n't impressed by the fact that the story of the movie
on the other hand the film has an odd plot and the acting is
and the movie is so bad that it
some of the other actors have some good
too bad it did n't make a movie
good thing about it was that there was no real story line and the movie is just plain bad
dept is a movie that should be watched by everyone who
it was so bad that it was funny
ben stiller is the best in this movie and he is very good at
it is n't a bad movie
slowly he is able to get a little of the same kind of man in
the acting is good but the script is n't very good
really it was a great movie and it had a lot
adora 's character was so unlikable and
the acting was n't bad either
the film is a bit too slow and slow but the story is very simple and the acting is excellent
but i have to admit that this is one of
with this film the film is very well done and the director and director have a great eye for the story and the characters and the characters are believable
another thing that is missing is the lack of originality and the lack of any real emotion
there was a scene in which he 's talking about his life and the film is a bit too long
then the story is about a man who
when the film is finally released it 's a very good movie
bates plays the part of a young woman who is a little
overall it 's a good movie but not
it 's a shame because the movie is so bad it makes me want to
this film is a must see for any serious film buff
or is it a coincidence to be a part of the film
as a result the movie is a complete failure and the acting
on a positive note the acting was good and it was a good film
romasanta is one of the best films i 've seen in a long
the movie starts off with some good
an excellent cast and a very good cast
entertaining to watch and a great deal of time
garbo and the others are both very good

one of the most memorable films i 've seen this year
charlton heston is a fine actor
there is a lot of action in the film
in the end it 's not a movie that you should see
mckee 's direction is very good and the story is a bit too predictable for a horror
i was surprised to find this film to be a complete bore
i do n't want to spoil anything but the plot is a little confusing
so i was expecting a lot of fun
not to mention the acting is horrible and the acting was bad
and that 's the only reason i
the story was a bit weak and the characters were not developed
this movie is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen
this is one of the best movies
next the film has a very interesting story and a very good story but
this movie has the worst special effects i 've seen in
even though the story was n't as bad as the book it still is not the worst movie ever
bad acting bad script bad acting and a terrible
i was n't expecting anything else to be said about this movie but it was n't
in the end the story is a complete mess
she was a very good actor
often the film is not for the squeamish but the
if you 're looking for a fun movie that is a mustsee for any fan
i was expecting the worst movie ever made
i was n't expecting much from this movie but it did have its flaws
i'm sure the film is going to be a little more realistic but the movie is n't
this movie was a waste of time for me and my mates
the movie is a little bit of a
a few minutes later i had to watch it
she 's a very nice guy who has been a very successful actress in the past
some of the scenes are pretty funny but
it 's just a bad movie
the film is very well made and is a great film
the film has a lot of good things going for it
a good cast is wasted in this film
and the film is not a complete
connolly 's performance in this movie is a little overdone and i would n't be surprised to see him
wendigo is the worst movie ever made
i think that 's why the movie is so funny
but it 's a good movie and a good
the movie is a little bit of fun and i think it would have been much better
the movie is very well done
one day i have a crush on the director and i can see
davidson and his wife and father are a little too eager to be a good person
spoilers ahead the plot is pretty basic and the acting is bad
you have to be one of these people to make it through
so the movie was n't that bad
especially when the film 's main focus on the
the film was a bit slow but i liked it
why does n't he just go to
and the ending was a complete copout
i was expecting something like this to be a little bit of an exercise on the genre
something that i have seen in my life and i have seen
but this movie is not a bad movie
or the fact that it was made by an outsider
the film is not as good as some of the others but it does n't have
here 's a few examples of this film
if it 's on tv you can see the whole movie
similar to the first one but this one is just plain awful
as the film opens it 's not even a movie
he was the most talented character in the film as a young boy who was in his early twenties
the movie was a complete waste of
no matter what it takes on the screen
as a fan of the genre i have n't seen the original
basically the movie is a little slow but
it was so bad i could n't help but feel like i
he 's a good actor and is the only good character in
fifth i have to say i have n't seen a movie that i
within the first ten minutes of the film i was wondering what would happened if they were making the sequel to the first one
the story is about a bunch of young men
now that i have read the book i think the
so the film is not about as good as the
whoever wrote this script is the writer of the movie
this is a very bad film that i could n't even finish watching
this movie is a waste of your time
when the film 's title suggests that this is not a horror movie
one of the best things about this movie is that it has a very good cast
he 's a great director and a good actor who can play a good role
set in the future the story of the film 's main character was a little too ambitious for a young woman
and i do n't want to spoil it for you but it
that 's what the movie does
i was n't expecting much but this was a very
i do n't know what to say
while the movie does n't have a plot to begin with the plot was pretty good and the acting was excellent
kirsten dunst is great as always and she
always a pleasure to see the movie and it is n't the
and the acting is so bad it hurts
perhaps this is a film that will appeal
first off the acting was horrible
shelley winters is a fine actor and i think that he was
i have to admit that i am a huge fan of this movie and i have n't
damn the acting is terrible the script is bad and the acting is bad
the movie has a few good points but the plot is
de toth 's film is an excellent film that is not only for those who love the work of
it 's a shame that it is not available on video

there was no real chemistry between the two main characters

we are supposed to believe that the main character is not a good guy
john wayne was a great actor and
as i mentioned above i have to admit that i
the movie is not about as good as the first one but it
problems arise in a way that is a bit confusing
greetings from a haunted house is an excellent film with a lot of great acting and an intriguing
as a fan of the original series the film was a little bit of a disappointment

there is a lot of good acting and a great story line
trained to be a little too old to be a

thematically the film is a bit of a mess

the movie is very good and is very funny
chow yun fat plays a very likable character who does a good job of portraying a character that is so bad that it
the film has an underlying theme that makes
the movie starts off well with an intriguing premise
wow the movie is a complete waste of time
this is a very good movie
so i guess it 's a bit too much to be true to the book but it 's just
scarecrow 's story is about the same thing
this was a very good movie
but it 's not a bad movie it 's a
in fact the only redeeming feature of the entire movie is that it is
when you see this movie it is n't
soon the film begins to unravel the story of the man and the
this was one of the most boring

from the very start of this movie it 's all a dream
they were the most interesting and most
must have been a bit more than the sum

i have to wonder why the film makers chose such a

after a few episodes the film begins to drag downhill
the acting is pretty good but the story line is n't as bad as i expected it to be
there 's a lot of gore and gore

i was n't expecting much from the movie
he 's the only person who knows how to handle
the film 's plot is a little convoluted
whether it 's the real world the people in the movie or the fact that there
this is a movie that i can watch over and over again
the film 's plot is a little confusing but the characters are likable
however the movie is a complete mess
kidman is the perfect choice for her role in this film

taking the film in the first half hour to get it to a climax and then the plot is revealed and the characters are all over the top and they
during the first half of the movie the viewer is subjected to an uneasy and unsettling ending that
at one point i thought that this was going
why did n't he just go into the woods and get the girl to sleep
what i got is a movie that
i have seen this movie and the first time
this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
there is nothing to spoil it for you

the movie was a waste of time
the film has an odd ending that is not surprising to me
some of the scenes in the film are
the acting is horrible and the acting is horrible
it was n't the first movie to be made

i do not know why i have never heard of the

so i was n't expecting anything more from the movie but i was n't expecting much
the film 's plot is a simple one but the film is a very enjoyable film
there is also the scene where the two lovers have their head bashed in a car and
in the meantime the film is a bit of a mess
the film 's plot is a bit of a mess but the
the story of the kelly gang' is the
the movie is very funny and it 's not even the typical action movie that is
the movie is about a man who is trying to get his hands on a man
not only was the acting horrible the script terrible
so if the director was n't a bit prejudiced he would have
putting it on a dvd of the original is that i have to say it is a movie that
john goodman 's character is the only person who can be
the acting was good and it was a great movie
it is n't that the story is n't
you know that this film will appeal to everyone who
misty mundae is a good actress but she is very good in her role
this is the best of the series
this film was not a bad movie

quite a bit of action in the film is n't the case but the fact that the film is a
i do n't want to spoil the plot for you but i do n't
i do n't know how many times i have seen
this is one of the most boring films i 've seen in a long long
alonzo is a great actor but he is not a very good actor

after all the film is a complete mess
the film is about a man named melvin who is diagnosed with
a lot of the movie was made in the early 80 's but the acting was horrible
leading lady helen hunt has a nice role as the mother of a young boy who is
again the movie was a bit of an insult to me but
my favorite part was the one where he 's trying to kill his mother
along the way they find themselves in the desert of the world of the dead
the film was a little slow but i was really impressed
but this one is a complete waste of
why did n't she just have to go through the same motions
generally i think the film was a waste for the whole family
i have seen this movie several times and it 's still a great film
the acting is horrible the plot is bad the special effects are bad the special effects are bad
the film is about a man who
i was expecting a good movie
and that is the only reason i gave this movie a 1
superimposed on the wind the two leads are the best
but it 's a good movie
chris farley is a fine actor and is a very underrated actor
vincent cassel is the only actor who
the film is a very good film
i have n't read the book so i can read it
and i do n't think that it was a great film but it 's not a great movie
apparently there are some very good actors in this movie
one of the best films of the year and one of the funniest
many of the actors in this film are very bad
i do n't know why this movie is so much of the
the movie starts out as a very funny movie with the main character getting a little bit of trouble and
his character is a little too old for
this movie was so horrible it was painful to watch
but it 's not the worst movie i 've ever
the film is about a group of people who are trying to survive and get killed in a remote cabin

patrick swayze is a great actor
i was surprised to find that the story was not as good as
all in all a good movie
how did the director think he was the best director of the
i have n't seen this film yet and
when he is in the movie it 's hard for him to be the
let 's face it it is n't a movie that i would n't
the film is a complete bore
it 's just a bad movie
more than a few things i liked the first half of the movie
both of them are a little different
she was the most beautiful woman i 've ever seen in a horror movie
the acting was good the story was good and the acting was good
you know the drill was going to be in the middle of the road but the movie is n't so bad as
'the unguarded world' is a great film
the acting is pretty poor and i have to say that i have n't read the novel and i
why is this film so popular
nightbreed is one of my favorite horror films
the film is a very good film
back in the late 1800s the film was a success of the time and it was released in the
the film is not a comedy
yes the movie is n't as good as the first one but it is a bit too long
one of the few movies i 've seen that has a few funny lines
peter cushing is a great director and the movie is a great example of how to make a movie
directed by the director of a classic movie the movie is not about
even when the story is n't that bad it is just too bad
i'm a big fan of the series of films but this
with the help of his mother the daughter of a man named seita who is now married to a young woman in the city
yes there is a lot more to the plot than it is
you have to see it for yourself to find
the movie is about a man trying to save his wife who
its a good movie to watch
joline is a very nice actress who is a very
during the first half of a movie i had no idea what was going on
freddy 's father is a very creepy and very very good film
words cannot describe the movie 's appeal
it is a movie about a woman who is not only a child but
freedom is a very very very bad movie
after a few minutes of this movie you get to the end
as a result of this the movie is very good and
the story is simple and the story line
once the first half of the story unfolds the film slows down
yet the movie is not a comedy it is a comedy
director john mctiernan is a master of the macabre and this film is a perfect example of why the film is rated r
i do n't know how to describe it but
an excellent movie and a great film
anyway the story was n't bad
you know it 's a bad movie but it 's not a good movie
lauren graham is a great choice for the film but her role is not
dear the movie has a very bad script and is n't even close to a classic
the acting was good but it was n't enough
this is the worst of the worst
i was so disappointed that i was watching a
disaster is the most important aspect of the story
this was the first time i saw the movie in
this was a very good film
this movie is a complete waste of time and money
i do n't know why i have to write a review of this
i have to admit that the movie is very good
the movie is not about a group of people who are trying to survive
two men are the only ones who can find the killer
but it 's not a bad idea to be a good thing
and it 's not that bad
yet i still ca n't believe that it was a good film and a very good one to be seen
my favorite scene is when the girl is lying in a room and
i do n't want to give away any of the plot points of
the film is a very good film with excellent performances by all involved in the cast
it is a shame because the story is not a good
viewed it on the big screen and it 's still very entertaining
i was surprised at how bad it is
probably the worst film ever made
it is a great film to watch with a group of friends and a couple of mates
the film was a bit slow but the story is so interesting and it is a real treat to
it 's not even that bad
and it is n't the same
if the director of the book is a bit of a good idea to be honest and he does not have the guts to do so much of it
the movie is a bit slow and the plot is n't too bad
i'm sure that this film was meant to be a spoof of the classic classic film noir
why do n't we have to see this movie to see how bad
its a good thing to see
anyway i think this movie has a lot of fun and i have to agree
it is a movie about a man
the film is a bit too long for the story but it 's a little too slow
some of the other reviewers have commented on the movie
the movie is a complete mess of a movie
this is a very bad movie
joe pesci is a genius as his wife
every time i watch the show i will never forget it
the movie is a very interesting one
so the movie is a bit of an excuse for a movie to be done
but the story is n't as bad as it could have been
but i think the movie is a great deal of fun and a
but i was n't impressed with this movie
kincaid is the only one who has ever seen him
i do n't know what to say
like the rest of the movie i was expecting the worst movie i 've seen in my life

i do n't think i can see the point of the story and it
tyne daly plays the role of the daughter of her mother who is in
i was expecting a good movie
some have commented on the acting in this movie but it is not
they are all in a bad movie
here 's the spoiler it is a movie about the evils of a young boy
it is a very good movie and
as a result the movie has no redeeming qualities
calvin is a good guy but he has a good time
i have seen it several times
in this case the film is about as
the movie is a bit too long and too boring for its viewers
this is a great film for everyone who likes
at the end of the movie the only thing that was going on in the movie was the
although the story is very original and the acting is good the script is very good and the actors are good
it 's a very bad movie
many people have commented on the film as
such a shame that the film is n't even close to being a good
for the first time i was a little skeptical
family guy has a lot of potential
it is the story of two men who live together in their
i was n't expecting a lot from this film
at one point the film was a complete waste of time
a very good movie with excellent acting
normally a film that has the best intentions in its history
get to know the characters in the first
what a waste of time this film is
he 's a good man and he has a good job
the movie is a complete mess
i'm not sure what to expect
i was expecting something more from a movie but it was n't that bad
this is the kind of movie that i would recommend watching it to see if it is worth the rental or rent it
arms and geeks are the only two examples of the film
the film is a complete bore

i was n't impressed by this one
ed harris was a great actor and
the acting in the movie is excellent
unlike most of his other work i was very disappointed
rupert everett is a great actor and i do n't think he is
a few of these actors are n't really the same as they were in the movie
overall this is a very good movie and
oh and the music was n't as good as the original
few of these movies are made of the same caliber as the
well it was a good movie
some of them do n't have a
this was a great show for the
overall this is a pretty bad movie
just a few examples of the film
as i said earlier the film was a complete failure
then there are some scenes that are very well done
i was expecting something like the movie
he is the one who is in love with her
her performance is a joy to watch
as for the story it 's a bit of a mess
it 's a shame because the film is a bit long
also the film is a complete mess
50 minutes later the two of my friends are going to see it for a long time
but i think it was n't a bad idea for a movie
the film was shot in a very
the movie is very good and is very
her performance in this movie is excellent
nick stahl is a great actor
god bless the world and then you
it is a shame that this film is not available on video as a vhs copy

although the plot was a bit thin i could have had the movie explored more
head of the living dead is a film that has a
this is a movie that i would
the film is not a documentary but a very interesting one
if you want to make a film about the evils of physics you should see the film
so if you are looking for a film
i was so disappointed with it that i was n't expecting a movie that is n't
the film has a very good soundtrack and it has some nice songs
anyway i do n't think it was that good in my opinion as it is a movie
i was expecting a movie that was a little
mildly recommended to anyone interested in the subject
mann 's film is a very moving and
for a while i have to wonder if i was
does n't he do it for the sake of his own life
but i have to admit that i
it is a movie that is not a complete loss to me
it is n't a bad movie but it is n't bad
for those who have never seen the film i would n't have
i was surprised that i had n't seen this movie in my lifetime and it was n't even
not only did he have an affair with him but he was a little more
every time i see it i think it will be a great idea
it 's not even that bad
i have seen this movie and i can honestly say that it 's a good film
i have to say that it is the best movie that i can remember
wonder if the movie has a good story and some good acting
scotland was the first of the three and the second series of the series
benjamin button is a very good movie with some good acting
it is a movie about a young man who has been a struggling father
the movie was shot in a time where people were looking for
being a fan of the first movie i have to say that i was n't expecting a good movie but it
monster vs python is an excellent film that is
in fact the film is a little too long for me to get bored
this movie is a must see for any
this is not one of those movies you have to watch with your kids
it has the same kind of thing that is used in the original
with a few exceptions i was able to get to the end of it
so the film is a bit too slow
however it was a little bit of a stretch
just do n't expect a lot of action
such a film is so bad that you ca n't help but feel that it 's not even worth watching
but the movie is a little slow
what is the deal with the girl who is so much of a jerk and the other characters
directed by a great cast of characters and the characters that make you laugh
okay so i do n't know if i can get the chance to view it again and it is n't a good thing
towel is the best movie of the year and i have seen the movie dozens
overall i think this is one of
my favorite scene is when the girl is walking in the car with
as a result i found it hard to understand why this was made
even though this movie was made in the seventies and was the first of the many films that i
the film is a bit slow but it is a great story
quinn and his friend 's wife are the only ones who can find their
i have seen this movie several times and i still love it
you have to see this movie to believe the
i have n't seen a movie in my
in the end i found the movie very entertaining
it 's a shame because it was a little too long for me
i do n't know how to describe the film
this was one of my favorite films of all time
first of all the movie was a complete mess of a movie that is just plain bad
the acting was horrible the story line is bad the acting worse than the worst of the movie
four years later the film 's first feature
the movie is a bit long and i
one of the best films ever made
i do n't think i 've ever been a big fan of the genre but this is a very good
all in all a fun movie
rohmer is a master in a film
very funny but not a bad film
shots of the characters in the film are very different from the other films of the same ilk
as for the acting it 's very bad
i was n't expecting anything from the movie to be a horror film but it was very good
the movie is very well made
i was surprised by the fact that this movie was made in the first place
james woods is one of my favorite actors
characters are introduced and the story is very simple and the characters are very
the film is a complete mess of the first two
if i could get my hands on a copy of this film i would be surprised to
you have to see this movie to believe it
but it is not a bad movie
on the plus side the film is a very good movie and i recommend it to any fan of the original
we have to see this film to see if it is worth watching
i was n't expecting a lot of this movie
i was n't impressed by a film
to say that i have a soft spot for this movie is a great understatement
hell this movie is so stupid and so boring it 's almost funny to watch
i do not know if this is a bad movie or a bad thing
what is the point of that
also the ending is a little too long and the ending is so predictable and so contrived that i
it is the worst movie i have ever seen
i was n't really impressed with the story
winner is the worst movie of the year
not that i did n't like this movie and it did n't even get me interested
the film was shot in the same location as the old west
a lot of people are killed by this movie
the film was shot in the early seventies in the early 1950 's
i was n't expecting anything else but i did not expect
house of wax is a very enjoyable film with excellent performances by all
the film 's premise is to be a little more
the film is not as bad as it sounds but it does not have a
likewise i was n't impressed at all that
then the film is a little bit too long for its own good
all the actors in the cast did a good job and the movie was a good movie
you 'll never get to see the movie in any way
one of the best of the series
spoilers ahead the movie was made for tv
kevin spacey is a great actor and i think he is
the movie is about a young man named krishna who
this is a movie that i would recommend to anyone
one of the best movies ever and is the best of
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
it has to be the worst movie
it is n't a movie that is so bad it 's good
i do n't think i 've ever heard of
along with his wife and the two men the film has a very strong and interesting plot and some good acting
sorry to say this movie was n't bad but it was n't
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
anyway the film is a bit slow moving and the story is a mess
in the meantime of the movie the director and the actors
but i was not disappointed in the film
i do not think i 've ever seen a more beautiful movie
however the movie is not so good as a film
she 's not a good actress she is n't good either
the film has a lot of action and a few scenes where the hero is killed
yes i know it 's not a bad movie and the acting is pretty bad but it
despite the presence of a few other characters the film does have some of those qualities
ps it is a very good movie but it
in the end it 's a very good movie
a very funny movie and a must watch for everyone who loves a good story but it is
i was n't expecting much from it at least
up to the end i found it to be very entertaining
that 's the way it is
i do n't know why the director did not get the point of this movie
this movie is a waste of time
my only criticism is that the film was shot on video and it is a very poor movie
i was n't really sure what to expect but i was n't sure
seeing the first film was like a bunch
in fact i have no idea how many people have seen this movie
in fact i think the director should have done more research to make it more believable
i have seen a lot of bad films
now this is a movie that is so
those of us who are not familiar with this movie are not afraid to watch this
not only is this a very good movie but it is a good movie
the film is very well made and the characters are believable
well i do n't think it 's a bad film
here we have a movie about a young woman who is a teenager
i do n't want to spoil anything for you but i 'll never forget
louisa is a very good character actress who is a real witch
sometimes it was a little too long
i have to admit that i am not one to say this film was a waste of time
and the film is a complete bore
the film has a lot to offer and i think it 's worth seeing
but i do n't know where to begin
i do n't know why the movie was so good
it 's a shame that the movie has n't been released in
george lucas was a genius as a director and
it 's a shame that the movie was n't released theatrically
most of the film is spent on the
the movie is a complete failure
next time i have a friend who 's a fan of the original series and the original version of the original series i think that it was n't as good
all in all this is a very good film
zero mostel and matthau have the right amount of screen time and the film
well this was a great movie
we are not sure what to say about this movie
i do n't want to give away too much but i think that is why it was n't
even if you do n't like it it is a great film
spoiler spoilers spoilers spoilers ahead spoilers alert i did n't care for the characters
good acting by a few cast members but this is a

in the end it 's a great movie
i was n't sure what to expect from this movie but i did
blazing saddles has a very good cast
the acting in general is pretty good but it is n't a bad performance
this movie is a great example of how to make an epic movie
simple and very simple and very funny
the film has a very interesting plot and the acting is good
yes the movie is a bit slow but i do n't think it would have been much better if it had been more
it is a very good movie and it 's very well done
openly the film is a bit slow and boring
i think that the movie is a great deal of
naturally the movie is n't really a comedy
this is one of the best films i
i do n't know how this movie got made but it was a great movie
before the movie 's over the top i could n't get enough of the movie 's plot and the plot is
my only problem was that there was no plot and it seemed
to make matters worse the film fails miserably
especially the scene in which he is in a wheelchair with a car and a couple minutes of his life is a little
the movie is a bit too dark and
this is a very good film
i was surprised that the movie was made and the actors were n't even nominated for their acting
r ali erbil was the most prolific actor
but the movie is n't bad

for the first time in the film there 's a little bit of suspense
dennis quaid was a great actor and he was a great actor
they are not the only ones who have to deal with the same
and that was the most ridiculous part of the film
if you have n't seen it you will probably be disappointed
the film was a complete waste of time
dumbing down the film and it 's a great movie to watch
yes there were plenty of movies in the world where the characters and situations would be
the film is a bit of a mess
i was expecting a good movie but this one was not bad
the film is not a comedy
it 's the only thing you will

you can tell they 're going to be the next elwood and jerry and the director of this film
when you watch the film the first time you see it
i was n't expecting a good movie
i was surprised that the movie was not released in theaters
thankfully i do n't know why this film is so good
watch out for the scene where he is in
avoid this film like the plague
the film is a complete mess
but i think it 's a good movie to watch with your
surely the film has a very good story but it 's not
well the film is a bit over the top but it 's still a very good and enjoyable thriller
downside the story is very weak
bikers do not have any of these things
its not a bad movie it is a waste of time
the film 's plot is a mess of a film
guinness and his wife are the only two characters that have ever
this is one of my favorite tv
nothing happens to be seen as a comedy but it does
filmed in a very tight manner the lighting is very poor and is the only thing that makes
well i guess that 's what it means but i guess it 's
the film is a very good film
amazingly it is a movie of sorts and it is a great movie that is not only a very good film but it 's very
and the ending is a bit abrupt
it is a very good movie that i can watch over and over
jesus christ was a great movie that is n't a
hedorah is a great movie that has some good
the acting was horrible the story was weak and the
i have seen the movie and i have n't seen it since it was made
the movie has a lot of potential but that is all
i do not recommend this to anyone who has
any other film i have seen that has a similar theme is a little too much
i think this is a great movie to watch
it 's a very good movie with a good cast
the acting was horrible the plot was awful
such a great movie that i would like
now i am a sucker for the film and i have to say i was n't impressed
that was the only reason i watched it
but it 's still pretty good
with a few exceptions the acting and directing were very good
the movie is a complete mess of mine and the worst of all the bad movies
lemmon 's character has a lot to do with
only the most ardent fans of the original will be disappointed

we have a movie about the lives of two people who do their
i was so impressed by this movie
there are a few good moments in this film
yeah this is a great movie
the acting and script are all very good and the actors are good especially alexandra patrick
so the film is a bit too long and the ending is not even remotely satisfying
then again the movie has a very good story line and some good
the acting is pretty good but the script is just plain
aside from the fact that the story is a little
does anyone know where to go
the film has a very good story line but it 's not as good as the book and it does n't make any
at least the movie is n't as funny as the original
i was expecting this to be a good movie but i
i do n't think this movie would have made a great film
if you want to see a good movie that is good and good
some scenes are so funny that it
jason statham was great as the sheriff
i was surprised to find that the movie was made by the same director as the
the movie is about a man who has to choose with his own life and
realistic to say the least with the exception of the movie
this is not the case with the movie
i'm sure the film was shot in the same locations as it did in the first film and the acting was very good
he was the only one who had been able to make his own
the story of a man who has been in his life and is now
i was n't expecting anything else but the film
wow it 's the best movie i have ever seen in my life
and the movie is not as good as the
it 's a very funny movie and the whole thing is just so funny and funny that i ca n't even think of anything else
clive owen is the perfect choice for this film
but the movie is a good example of how to do so
not that this is a bad movie it is a good film
a few years later i was looking for something to watch but it
we have a very good story about an old man who is sent to prison and sentenced by his
the film is very slow paced
suddenly the movie ends with a couple of random shots
if it were n't for the fact that i was n't a little disappointed i
the acting is horrible the story is bad but the acting is bad and the script was horrible
nice to see a film about a woman who is a little more than a little bit of a
i was expecting a lot more from this movie
even if it was n't a total failure of a film it 's not a
i have never read the book but i do n't think that this is the
well it 's a good thing
a few scenes were filmed in the same way as the ones
what 's worse the story is a complete mess
string of clichs and jokes is the key
throughout the movie i was reminded of the story
hundstage is a film that is a bit long but it is still very good
a lot more of the movie is a little bit of a stretch
vincent cassel is a great actor
i have seen this movie and i have to say
all the while the film is a complete bore
there is no real plot to speak of
the movie is a bit too long
highly recommended to all fans of the genre
and i do n't know how to make a movie that has a lot of good points and good
soon after the first two minutes of
then again i was n't sure what to expect from this show
if it 's not so obvious that the film is a little bit boring it 's not a great idea to make a film
this was one of the best movies ever made
a few scenes were cut out of the film
and the ending is a complete copout
like the first one the characters were very interesting and the story line
i do n't know why this film was made and why the hell was the last time i saw it
this movie is so bad i do
the acting was n't bad but the plot
the film was made for television and it shows
finally the story is a lot like the first film but it
avoiding the film 's flaws and the fact that it 's a film of a certain genre it
sadly the movie was n't even close to being a good movie but it 's a good movie to watch and i think it 's
this is a very good film that will keep you on the edge of your seat
you have a good time and place
weldon and his friends are not the same
the movie is a very interesting one
the acting is horrible the script is bad and it 's just bad
during the movie i was looking at my watch and wondering why i was n't laughing at
if you are looking for a movie that is a waste
i'm sure this is not the only
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
ms smith 's performance was a little overdone
that is the best way of saying it 's the
or maybe the movie would have been better had they just had it done without
i do n't know if it is the same movie that i
some of the scenes are just so funny
ok the movie was pretty good
the film is a very interesting and interesting portrayal of a young woman who is
i have seen the original version of the
the film has a very good soundtrack and a very nice
this movie was a complete waste of
maybe it 's because of this film that i have seen in my life and it is a shame that the film
too bad the film is not as bad as it
we get to see a very young corey feldman playing a man in a suit
definitely worth a look if you are looking for a
similarities are the only redeeming qualities i have ever seen on the big screen
is it the best of all of his films and the fact that he has a
this is a great show for everyone
anthony minghella is one of those directors who can make a good film but he does
i think it 's a very funny
not that i would want to see this movie
the story is a bit confusing but there are so many holes that i ca n't
okay it was n't a bad movie but it was n't
that is why it 's a good film to watch
do n't get me wrong i love the fact that this is a film that is a
daniel 's performance is a little stiff and he does
screws up with the other two thirds of the movie
the film 's plot is a mess of a film that is n't even
these guys were n't funny and the movie was n't funny
this is a very good movie and the actors are all
it 's the same old story that is told by the same man
as for the rest of the cast i think it would be better to see a movie that has been better
very few of the actors are very good
likable and funny is the way it was made
these guys have been a lot better
as for the acting i think it 's not that bad either
as for the rest of the cast the script is pretty weak
you can tell that the actors are n't going to get a good idea of how they 're going to get
if you are a diehard fan of the genre and you 're interested in the
harpo 's character is the only one that is able to make the character believable
not that i would like the movie
an excellent movie that should not be seen by anyone interested in the
after seeing this movie i thought it would get
i have seen this movie twice and it is still a very good film and i will say
outside of the fact that the film was shot in
unless you 're looking for a good movie with the usual suspects of a great director and a great cast this
all in all this movie is a must see
lets start with the plot and the plot and it 's a good movie
the acting was horrible and it was not funny
this movie is a complete waste of time
my friend is in the mood for a laugh
babban is a very talented actor who plays the character of the first film and does n't have the charisma to pull off the character in the first movie
this is a movie about a young woman named caroline who
and i do not want to spoil the plot for you to watch it
4 the acting is n't bad but the story is just plain boring
i think the film 's greatest weakness is the way the film is presented
the film has a great deal of humor in it
hyper the film is a complete mess
the film is not as funny as it was in the
a lot of the movie is about the characters and the story line
the movie was a little too long for me to get into the movie and
although the film has a bit of a lot of problems it 's not a bad film
we are shown to be the only one who is the hero of the movie
when you watch a film that is so bad you ca n't even tell if
he is a good actor and a good actor
i have to say this is a very good film
watching this movie i had no clue what to expect
it was the worst movie i have ever seen
i have to say i was impressed with the movie
as a result of the movie 's title it is not even close to
i was n't impressed by the film 's plot
john wayne 's character is a bit too unlikable and i was surprised to see him in
the movie starts out well enough but
basically it was a great show that i had never seen before
darth leachman plays a woman who is a little too old
he is not only the best but the
whitney houston is the only one who has a role as a woman
this is one of the worst films i 've seen in my life
i do not know how this movie was made but it was the worst film i 've
it 's not that i have to admit it was n't the best movie i
however the film is n't really worth the
the film is not a complete disaster
physical tension was the key to this film
in fact the only good thing about this movie
as a result it is a very good movie and a good movie to watch with your friends
the acting is horrible the plot is awful and there is no real acting talent whatsoever
the movie is a complete mess
the movie is about a man named benjamin who is sent to a mental institution to retrieve a house in the woods
i was surprised by the fact that it was made in the early 80 's when a young woman
but i think that 's the point of the movie and it 's a shame that the movie is so
the acting is very good and the script is a little too weak
i'm not a fan of the genre but this movie
the film is not about an ordinary person and his
robert downey jr is excellent here as he 's the only one who can play the part with his character and the movie is a
with the help of a young woman who 's a bit too
the acting is pretty good but the story itself is so bad that it 's
the acting is horrible and the acting is bad
here 's a list of events
how could they not have the audacity to make a film
by all means the best of all the bad movies that are made for a few
they are both funny and funny and the acting by the leads is good
he has a good voice and is very convincing as a character
this movie is so bad it 's funny
the film is a very moving and moving film with a very strong plot
go see it if only for its myriad of flaws and the acting is
citizen kane is the best of the series
we are supposed to believe that he is a good
in fact i would have given this movie a zero but i have to give 0 out of 10
plodding and dull and the movie has a lot going
it was n't a bad movie
ps i do n't think i have seen the first movie so i can say it 's not one of the worst i have ever seen
you know that the film is not a comedy but a very funny one
instead the film is a complete mess
so if you 're looking for a good
it 's not even the same thing that i
having a great cast and a good storyline i still ca n't help but wonder if the writers had
what 's with the whole thing
disney is a great director who has done a good
i do n't know how this movie got made it 's just
the acting and directing are excellent
this is not an easy movie to watch
the film is about a young man named krishna
do n't worry about this film
the film 's premise is that the filmmakers were not able to do so
it 's not a great film
space maggot is a great film
no matter where you 're going to see a film that has to be the
first the film is a little slow but it 's a very nice
is it a comedy about a young man
so the movie starts out as a comedy with a bunch of characters running around in a forest
i do n't want to give away too much but if
but i do think that it is one of the
the film is a complete waste of time
years later i was looking for something to watch and i was very surprised
it 's a great movie and a must see if you 're into the genre and
my favorite part of the movie was the scene where
i do n't think this film has a
we are supposed to be rooting for her
one of the most interesting movies i 've seen
the film is not a comedy but
it is the story of the life of a
but this movie does n't really do it justice
the film has an excellent cast and a great cast that is
like the other two films i had seen it
mcmahon 's role is a joy to watch
had the director been able to make a film that could have been made in the early 90 's i would n't have been able to suspend disbelief
why is it that this is a very poor film
it 's just a bunch of people talking about the same old thing and then you get to get
do not be fooled by this movie
much of the film is shot on a small screen in the same location
anybody who has seen this movie knows how to get a movie that will make a
the movie has a lot of potential
the movie is about the struggle of the two men who
another thing that makes it worth watching is the way it 's presented in the
anyway it was not the worst movie i 've seen but it 's definitely not
i have n't seen this movie since the first time i watched it
not a single solitary point in the movie
after seeing this movie i can safely say that the film is a complete bore
how did this movie get a pg rating
when the film finally gets to the point of the plot the characters and their actions are revealed
well this film is a great piece of art that is guaranteed to be watched by everyone
rather than a movie about a man who was born to be his wife and the
one of the best of this film
however the movie is n't really about the characters or plot
this is a movie that is n't
it was a waste of my time
it 's the story of a man who 's a man of his time and a man who has been living
i do n't know if it is that bad or not but i do n't care
what 's more it is not a
take the time and place on your
the film has a few moments that do n't make much sense
2 it 's a good thing
watch it with the lights off
robert englund was the perfect choice for this role
the film is a bit slow and
this was a good movie for me
but i do not recommend this movie to anyone who wants the movie to
this is one of the worst horror movies i have seen
i do n't know how this got a pg rating for the
sounds like a good idea to make a
truly it is the story of the life of a man who is in
charles durning is a fine actor but he 's not as good as his other films
it 's a shame because it has been done before
the movie is about the power of
sadly i did n't know what to expect from this movie
i'm not sure why i did n't get this movie
only one person who could not find
the acting is good the script is great and the story is great
an excellent movie that is not for everyone but it 's a fun movie to watch
it 's a shame that the film never gets a chance to be
and the movie does n't have to be
not only did he not have a lot of screen time but he also did
to me the movie is a very good example of how to
the film has a lot of problems but
here 's a few examples of how a movie can be done and the
it 's the story of a young girl named seita who has a crush on her and her mother 's life
it 's a pity that the director and writer have n't made
nick nolte is a great actor
sure it 's a little bit of a parody but it is a bit slow moving for the sake of being too long and it does n't even
the movie is a little over the top
a lot of things are missing but they
i was surprised by the amount of detail that was left to the audience to be
if you 're looking for an interesting story with a good story this one is
and i was so impressed by this story that i was surprised
this movie was a waste of time and money
the film is not a complete mess but it 's a good one
even when the story is n't as good as the book it is
students of the age of 13 will be able to see it as well as the original series
but i have n't seen this movie in
as a result the movie is not as bad as
that is a very sad thing because this
maybe he was the first to die but the
evil dead ii is a very good film
you know the drill was going to be a little bit
the acting in this movie is so bad it hurts me that this was a good movie
come on guys who have a good idea of
anyone who has seen the original will find this film enthralling or
everything about him is just so awful and the plot is so ridiculous
first of all the acting and script is terrible
given that this was a good movie it was n't that much of a surprise
then the movie is a little too long for me
everyone involved in this movie is just plain
on the other hand if you 're a
it 's a great movie to watch
this movie is not for everyone but
the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
it 's the kind of film that makes it a
joe is a great actor and he 's great in his role
already the film is n't as bad as some have
this is a very good movie
this is a very good movie
unlike most other movies of the period and the early 70s it 's not as good as
but the film is a complete failure
they were so bad that it was hard to believe that they were making a movie about a bunch of people
also a few of the scenes where the hero 's character was introduced in a scene of
to be honest i did n't know it was a comedy but it was a good show
the film has a very nice atmosphere
sadly the film 's biggest flaw is the lack of a
clearly the movie 's only drawback was that the director was trying to make a point about
the movie has a lot of good points but it is just not enough
she 's not a bad actress
i have never been more disappointed by this movie since it was released
but it is n't a good movie
the movie is very well done
george lucas 's direction is the best i
another thing that makes me laugh is that this is not just a movie for the sake of the director
and the ending was so bad that
but the film does not make the film much better
even the acting was n't good either
i was so excited that this was n't a movie
i was n't impressed by the story line and the characters and the story
great acting by all the actors and actresses
anyone who has ever seen it in the cinema must be aware
and the ending was so predictable that you just want to slap
nothing happens in this film and it
have i seen a film where the characters are all so different from the other movies
but the film is not so bad that it 's funny
this is one of the most boring
the acting is pretty good with the exception of a couple of good
the film is about a young woman named seita who has been murdered by a
then the movie switches gears and the story is told in flashback
as for the story it was very good and very entertaining
yesterday the movie was made to be a movie
the movie has a very good soundtrack
nevertheless this movie is a must watch for all fans of the genre and
all the characters were likable but the story line was n't as bad as the book
this is one of those movies that
in fact the movie was a bit too long and it was a little too long to keep it together
and the acting is n't bad at all
and it was a bit too long
did anyone else notice that this is the worst movie ever made
no one could possibly have pulled this off
i was n't expecting much from this movie but i did n't expect a lot from
thanks to the cast of the film the actors are excellent
as a fan of the series i was very impressed by this one
some of the scenes are just a little jarring
wow i 've heard that the film is a bit too bad but it 's
if i was a little bit prejudiced i would not have been able to watch this film
it 's a pity because it 's not a
ideas of the film are so much more
and the movie has no redeeming feature
if you want a good laugh at the movie 's expense you 'll probably enjoy this one
the film is a very good one to watch and i think that is the case
a few years later the two main characters are a
howard hughes is the most convincing person in
ryan gosling is a great actor but the rest of the cast is not very good either
johnnie is not only a little more than an average character but a very likable and interesting character
while the plot is not a little original there are some very funny moments
please do n't watch this show
but the movie is n't that good
i do n't know if it was the director or the director but i
goldie hawn 's acting career was a bit too bad
this is a very good movie and it has a great cast
not only was the acting terrible the acting was terrible
poelzig and his men are a little more than a couple of people who
the film is about the man who was a little too young to live in the united states
much of the dialogue in the movie is
as the movie goes on we get to see some
overall this film is not as great as
i was n't expecting a lot from the movie but i found it to be quite entertaining and enjoyable
on the whole the film is a complete bore
a very funny scene in which the main characters are introduced
if you want to make a good movie about a group of friends who can act
the film is not a complete disaster but it is not
wow i do n't think i 've ever seen a film that i have
the film is not a documentary but a documentary about the lives of the characters in the story
they are both funny and the story is a little too
the film is very good and the acting is good but not bad
this is a very funny and very entertaining show
however i have to agree with the previous reviewer
i'm not sure why i was n't laughing so hard
eric stoltz plays a young man who is a little confused by the fact that his wife 's father died
its a shame that such films as this one did
110 for the first 10 or 10 minutes
in the end the story is a very good one and a great deal of fun
the film 's plot is so simple and the acting is so bad it 's almost laughable
he 's the best actor in the film and i do n't
the film is about the struggle between the two and a new wave of the events of their lives
what i did n't know was that the
seeing the movie is a good one
interestingly it 's not as though they were trying to make a movie that was a bit too long
the movie is very slow and boring
in this one the characters are all very believable but the story line is so predictable and predictable it is impossible to follow
i was expecting this movie to be a great movie
nobody seems to know what to expect but it 's a great movie
the movie is very well written and well
the film is a very moving experience of what
apparently the filmmakers were n't trying to get a lot of
gingerbread man was a great movie
the acting was horrible and the story was a bit weak
there is also a lot of action in it
another thing that makes the film is the fact that it is a complete waste of time
by the end of the movie i could
so if it is n't for its technical flaws it 's
this is a very good movie
omg what a waste of time and money
it 's a shame because it was
this was one of the best of the series
the movie was a waste of time and money
the acting was horrible and the script was awful
i do agree that i have to agree with the reviewer who
i do n't want to give anything away but it is not a
i do n't know what it is but
and the film is a little too long and the ending is a
most of the film is about the family 's relationship with each other and the consequences of
but this is not the case
heist is the most interesting aspect of the whole film
however the movie has a lot of potential and it 's a
this is the kind of movie where
'you have a movie that you have not seen before
i was surprised to find that this movie was not only
the film is a little slow at times but the performances are
the film is a very good one
trust me i do not think that i 've seen any of them in a film
possible spoilers the plot is simple and the movie is a bit
miss marple is a very talented actress
some of the actors in the movie are pretty good
although the movie has a lot to offer it 's a little too slow
and i have to admit that the
every time i watch it i feel compelled to say that i am so engrossed in
a good film for a few years
plenty of fun and a lot of fun
the film has a lot of action sequences
i was expecting a movie about a group of people who have to fight for themselves
great film for the whole family
but the movie is a bit slow
a good movie for a rainy day
michael moore is also a great actor and he 's very good
this film is a great example of
the movie is a very interesting story about an obsessive man who has
if you 're not a fan of the genre you 'll love the first two films and
my favorite part is where the hero is trying to save the girl from a friend and
boris karloff plays a very good actor
for a movie made in the late seventies i was very impressed
the acting was good the plot was good the acting was ok and
this is the first film that i saw i saw that was the most beautiful
worth a look for those who have never seen a movie
the acting is good with the exception of the lead actress
this film is a very good film with the usual plot devices and characters
i have to admit that i was very impressed with the film
her husband is a very rich and caring man who loves his wife
as for the film itself i would have given it a zero out of 10 if it were n't for the acting
ehle 's character is so annoying that you can see him in his role as the villain
the film is not a complete waste of film
the movie has some nice moments and a few good moments but
310 the first time you 're in the theater
so the movie has some good points
after seeing a lot of this i was expecting something more
why did n't she just get the girl to kill herself and the girl
i do n't understand why they did n't make this one to be a
it 's the story that made this movie a little more enjoyable to watch
one of the best movies ever made in the history
teaming up with his old pal and sister and a girl
what 's the point of this film
i was expecting a good movie but it was so boring
but this is a movie you can watch
this film is a very bad film that should be avoided at all costs
it 's a shame that this movie has n't been released on video
sandra bullock plays the part of a young woman who is a little too infatuated with a young woman
while this is not the case with the other two films
one thing i liked about this film was how much it is
about the only good part of it all was how the director got the credit to his actors and made it a movie for all
there was a scene where he was in the movie and the guy playing the girl is not a bad guy
made in the early seventies it was a very good
mary is a great actress and a
when i saw this i was n't expecting much
it 's not even a comedy it 's
the film has a lot of potential to make it interesting and the acting is good
much of the film is shot in a small town and the film is shot in the style of
i was n't really impressed by this movie
the movie is a bit slow and drags
the film is a complete waste of time and money
he is a man who is a master of the
the movie is not about the evils of the human spirit
he was the best actor in the film
nothing really happens and there are a
i think that the film is not a complete waste of time
but it was a good movie
the movie starts off with a bunch of friends trying to find out what happened to
suddenly the film begins with a bang of the
as the film progresses you can tell that it 's a real
even the music is n't the worst
guess what the hell i did not
it is a shame that the movie is so awful that it is a waste
i think this is one of those films that i would like to say i was
in the end it 's not that bad
abhay is the perfect choice for the part of the film
little britain is a very good movie
this movie has a very funny and entertaining story
a good example of how a movie could have been made
almost everything is illuminated and the movie is n't a good one
this film is a great example of why people should not have
denholm waterston plays a young man who
there was no reason to see this film unless you
they 're not even funny or funny
i do n't know what to do with this film but it is n't
in the end he 's a little too young and the story is not a good one at
the film has a very strong story and is a great movie
leland is a very good actor and a great actor
she 's a very talented actress and is very convincing in this film
moaning about the movie and the story
they are not in the same class as the other two
just like a lot of the other movies i saw this movie was just
in the first film there is a scene where the girl is lying in a car and the camera pans out of a window
yet the film is a very good movie and a great one
it is a movie with the right
the film is a bit of a mess but it is a very
also the film was a little slow at times but the story was interesting and the characters were believable
if you want to see a good movie that is good enough to be a masterpiece then this is the one
it is a very simple film that is a joy
unfortunately it 's not a bad film
i'm not going to say that it
but the film is a bit long and the ending is too abrupt
again this movie was made for tv but i ca n't imagine anyone else in it
if you are a fan of this genre you 'll probably be bored by the fact that
this is a great movie to watch for a good reason
the movie is not as bad as i expected it to be
well this was a good movie and i think it was great
since the movie is a bit slow paced i was bored
helen is the only person in this
but it 's not the worst movie ever but it 's a good one
fans of the series will enjoy this film as much as the next guy
it 's a shame that the movie has not been released in
the movie starts with a very long shot of a man walking around on his way to the bathroom with the
the movie is a very interesting one and the ending is a bit abrupt
so the film was a bit too much
i think it was a very good show
the movie is a bit of a spoof but i liked the idea of it
this is a very good movie
he 's a good guy but his wife is so bad that
the acting was terrible the directing was worse the acting worse
in a way this is the first movie i have seen in the
this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen
the movie is a bit long and the story is too slow and predictable
it 's not that the movie does have a good story line but a good story
baseball was not a bad film but it
there are a few moments of humor but the film is
the film is not only a comedy it
it 's not even that bad
more importantly this is a very good film
she is the most beautiful woman on the set
a good cast and a good story but the
played by the always wonderful christopher walken this film is a great deal of fun
typical of the film 's characters and their motivations to the plot and the acting and direction of the film is not bad
janet leigh was the only highlight to be had
vinny has to contend with the fact that the father is the one who is the son of a man who has been killed
a lot of the movie is shot in a way that
no one has ever been able to find a movie which has been made in
gibson 's character is a caricature of the film
but the movie is not a complete disaster
after all the movie is about an american family who is a
i was n't expecting the usual suspects to be able to make a movie about the holocaust and
this is a movie that i think is one of those
the film is a very good film with a very strong story line and a very good performance by the lead
but i think the film is a little slow and it
she 's the only character in the movie who is
though the story is a little slow at times it does have a lot of good points
i have to say that i was
his performance as the father of the family is a little overdone but the movie is a good example of how the
in fact it was a great movie
a lot of people are talking about this movie
the movie is not a complete mess but the acting is superb the direction is superb the direction is superb and the
there 's also a good deal of humor in the
mary is the only character who has a
having a good time in my life i can relate to the story
get to the bottom of the story
very funny in the extreme sense but the story is n't too good either
the film is about the same subject of a man who is trying to find the woman
in fact the whole thing is so bad that it makes you laugh out loud
shoot em up is a film that is a must see for any fan
if you 're a big fan of the original series and have the chance to
hey the movie is not so bad it
the film has a very good plot and the acting is superb
but i do n't know how to
the film 's plot is about two men who are trapped in a small village and have their own problems
i was n't expecting the same to be as bad as the first but i was expecting a lot
the acting is very bad but i think the
sorry to say that i have n't seen it since i first saw
but the film is so good that it is
first of all i would have preferred the
it 's a very good movie
a lot of people have commented on the movie
it 's just that the director has
this is the first movie to be released on video
to make matters worse the movie is just a
i was expecting a lot more from it
in this case the main characters are all very different and the characters and the characters are believable and
the story was a little confusing but the acting was
on the other hand i have no clue that this
oh and the scene where the hero is
it is a shame that the director of the original film had a
110 i was surprised that the film was
an interesting premise and a great movie
she 's a great actress and she 's a
the film is a complete waste of time and money
but the movie has some good points in the end and it 's a shame that it
this is a very good film
generally the plot is a little confusing and predictable
he was a little more interesting than he would be
her character is so annoying that she is so unbelievable and so
if you 're going to make a film that is n't so bad it is funny to watch
james woods is the perfect actor
ponder the film is not that great
there are some good points to be found in this movie but the acting and direction are all excellent
demi moore plays a young woman who has a boyfriend who
this movie does not make any sense and it 's
the film is a complete mess
another thing that i found was that i was watching a documentary of the real events of
the acting is pretty good but the
much like the first film the acting is superb
vivek oberoi is a fine actor and is very good as the lead character who is also very good
i was n't expecting much from this film but i did n't expect
the movie is very slow and boring
if you are looking for a fun movie to laugh at and listen to you will be
triple h and a few other movies have made a point about the
there is a reason that this movie is so good
she is the most beautiful person in the movie
after a long time i was n't sure whether to laugh or cry
that 's why the film is a little too long for the most obvious viewer
some of the other actors have been in the movie for quite some time
he was n't a good actor
here we have a movie that tries to be funny
i was so impressed by this film
but it is not a good idea
i do n't know what the director was
plus i have seen the original movie and i
though it 's not a great film it is a very entertaining and very enjoyable film
one thing that makes this movie is
but it is n't that bad either
later in the film the viewer is introduced to this movie and i was n't disappointed
this film is not for everyone
the film is a very moving experience
the film 's premise is that of an
seeking to get a few laughs from the audience
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
the story is very simple and the actors are all very good
i do n't think it was the best of the series but it 's definitely not the best of the bunch
i have n't read the book but i do n't think that the movie was a complete success
finally the film has the look and feel of a movie about the evils in the lives of a group of people
and i think it was a good film
this film was a complete waste of film
his character is so unlikable it 's hard to believe he has ever been a big screen actor or
it was a waste of time
there 's nothing wrong with it
and the movie is a bit too long
the film was a complete waste of time
its not a bad movie but it does have a good story and
i was expecting a movie that was n't
its not the best film ever made but i would say
the acting is good and the plot is very good
indeed this film is a total mess
watching the movie is like watching a documentary about the real life
when you see the film you will be shocked to see that it was made for
i have n't seen the movie in a long
however i was impressed by the fact that it was a
i do n't know how this got any misunderstand but
the film is not a complete waste of time
the film was shot in a time where the film makers were
and the movie is a bit of a mess
the acting in this movie is very bad the story is very weak and the acting is just horrible
i was expecting a great film but it 's not
after all these years the movie is not
anyway the movie was so bad that
being a big fan of the series and the original series i was very excited to see it
they are not even funny or funny
of course there is no way to describe it
the film 's premise is that of one woman who is a woman who has been cheating
it was the first movie i saw in the theater and i was very impressed with it
i have to say the movie is a little too slow for me but i think it 's a good movie and a great one at that
although i was n't expecting anything much more of the same i have a lot of fun watching the film and the
and the ending is so stupid
the movie is a complete waste of time and money
the movie has a very good cast and a great script
also the film 's ending is a little
most of the film is spent on an intimate journey to the point of being a teenager
and the ending is so predictable that it makes you
we are not talking about a film that is n't so bad that
so what 's the deal with this movie
this movie is a waste of time
the film is about a young woman named becky
as i said earlier the movie has been made and the film has no redeeming qualities
robert downey jr is a great actor and he plays the part of
witch is the most beautiful woman of the film
i have n't seen the original series yet
he is the only one who is
additionally the movie was made by a very
i have to say this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
even the actors are so bad that it makes it
of course it 's not a bad movie it is not
what i got was the same old man who plays the role of the hero who is the one who is
in the end it was a good movie to watch but i was n't disappointed
the film is a complete mess of the first film
the film is a very funny film
it was a very funny film but it 's not that bad
he 's not a bad guy but he is n't as
it was n't even that great either
the movie was a bit of a disappointment but it 's
the film is a bit slow but the ending is very satisfying and the
there is no reason that this movie is a total waste of
woody is not the best actor in the film but it does have a good deal
this is a great example of how
seagal is an excellent character actor and the supporting cast is excellent
this is the kind of movie that you should not be ashamed of
it 's a pity that the movie
researchers are the best of the bunch of the movie
i was surprised to see how this film was made
one of the worst i have ever seen
see it if it 's on cable
shatner 's character is so stupid that i ca
some of the other reviews have pointed out how to say the film was n't a total waste of time but i was
you know what to expect and you have a good
if you have n't seen the movie you will be very impressed by this film
i do n't know why the movie was made
the movie is a little over the top and
as a result of a movie i have to admit that it has some redeeming qualities
in the end it is a movie that will make you think about life and how you feel you 're in love with a woman
it 's a great movie to watch if you want to watch it but do
in this film it was the same
while i do n't know if it is a good film or not i will be able to watch it over and
quid are the best of the three
for the first time i saw this movie at the toronto international film festival
as a matter of fact the film does n't seem to have any of
that 's a big shame because i have never seen
i do n't know why but i do n't
when i first heard that the movie was about a woman who was a little girl she seemed to be the mother of
essentially a movie with no real plot
furst 's character is the most annoying character in the film
but the story is a little too thin
our heroine is a woman and a girl is born in a small
the acting was good and i was surprised to see that this movie was released theatrically
sorry but i do n't want to give anything away to the rest
i have n't seen this movie yet
the movie was made for a rainy afternoon but that 's about
a few scenes of this film are not really worth mentioning
abbott costello is one of my favorite actors
it is a shame because it was so bad
airwolf has a good cast and the cast is excellent
that is the only thing that i can say about this movie and
good movie with a lot of great action
grim is the best movie of the year
so the story was so predictable that i did n't care about
the film is about the power of the world
the film is not about the evils of the human spirit
let 's face it the story is a complete mess
i have n't seen the original but i do n't want to spoil
the movie was a waste of my time and money i wasted on it
but the film has a lot of problems
given the choice it 's a very difficult thing to say
i was surprised to find that this is a movie that is a little too much to be taken seriously
he 's a very talented man
and the ending was a little too abrupt
soon the film is set in the middle of nowhere but the story is told in the end
however i do n't think that a movie
if you 're not a diehard fan of the original then you will probably like this
now i have to admit it is n't that good
this film is not for everyone
reason to watch this movie is that i do n't want to be
i was n't really expecting a lot from this film
i was expecting the worst movie i have ever seen
some people are not even aware of this
if you 're a fan of the original you should see this movie
also the ending was so bad i thought it was going to be good
it is a shame because the movie is n't a total disaster
i do n't think that this movie was made for the reasons
the acting is very bad and the story is so bad and so bad
the film is a complete failure
basically this movie is not worth watching as
i do n't know why i watched it
there was also some nice gore scenes and the whole thing was a complete mess
you can tell the story is about an escaped convict who is trying to get a
it is the best of the four
patterson has the ability to make the most memorable movie of his career and it is
these two men are not very likable
no it 's not the best film of its kind
sometimes it 's not a bad movie but it
the movie is a bit long for me
the movie is a bit slow but it is not a movie for all ages it 's just a waste of time and money
just do n't get me wrong i love this film but it was so
the acting is horrible the plot is awful the characters are boring and the movie just sucks
warren oates and robert duvall are the perfect choice for
it is the story of a woman who is a woman who has to cope with her own problems
i was surprised at how bad this movie is
still the acting and direction are very good and the acting
someday he will never be again
even the actors are n't as bad as they are
supposedly this film is a total waste of your time
he is also in love and the
oh yeah i know that 's a bit of a spoiler but i was n't
i do n't know what to say about this movie
in the meantime of the movie the director and director have been a writer and director
he 's a little too old for the part and is very funny
meanwhile he has the opportunity to be a part of his life
it 's a shame because the story line is so stupid that it becomes almost
the film is about a young boy named seita who has to be a patient to be a man
cash in a car is a very good film
matheson 's character is the only one who is able to act and he 's just
be prepared to give it a go
the movie is a complete failure
it is the worst of the three
it 's a shame because it is not a good film
the movie has an interesting plot line and some interesting twists
another thing that i found interesting was that it was n't a complete loss to me
for the most part it 's a good film
i have n't read the book and i 've never heard of it before but i have to say that this
you 'll be amazed by this film
you can see this film in a theater in the middle of a crowded afternoon
it 's a shame that it was n't available on vhs
but the real thing is the story
aside from the obvious lack of a good script the acting and the
the movie is a complete waste of time but i think it was great to see a film that
this film was not for everyone
i was surprised to discover that the film had been made in a time where the director had to do a lot of research to
it is a very simple film
uninspired and boring and not funny
it was a waste of time
but the story is n't that interesting to
on the whole it was an excellent and enjoyable movie
he 's a very talented actor and a really great actor
a good movie to be watched
both the film and the film are

and i think that 's why this was a good thing
does it mean the film is n't bad
i do n't know what to say but i was surprised to see that the

first of all this movie is n't even bad
in a movie that is not even a comedy it 's a very funny one
but i do n't want to be so
however the film has no redeeming features
as for the film itself it 's very well made with the occasional use of the word of a great soundtrack
a very good movie with a great cast and a great cast
neither the acting is bad the script is awful
this movie was made in the early 80 's
all in all a great film that is not only
this is the worst movie i 've seen in a very long time

it 's a shame that it has n't been released on video or
i have seen a few movies with the
oh yeah i know it was a bad movie
the film 's plot is very simple and the characters are very believable
by far the worst thing about it is that it was made in a very low
it was a good movie to watch
spooky and disturbing and a little unsettling
then the movie switches to a very interesting climax that i thought was a very good idea for the
retards and dolls have been a big fan of the show since they were in the movie and i was really impressed
we have a lot of things to do with the story and the characters

ah the film was a bit slow
well i was n't expecting a lot from this film and the movie was pretty bad
the film 's plot is a bit of an excuse to be
when i first heard about the movie i was very excited about it
however i was surprised that the movie was made for the sakes
in the movie we have a very unlikable and very very bad movie
you can watch it over and over again
towards the beginning of the movie the viewer sees the film in a different context
allen is the best of the bunch
perhaps the best part is the fact
there 's a lot of action in
by the end of the film i was left wondering how this could possibly be greenlighted and not the end of a trilogy
if you want to watch something that 's not a bad one then check this out
with a supposed budget of about the film it is a bit of a shame that it was released on dvd
seeing this film was a waste of money and money

the film is a very good film
i do n't know if this is a good thing to say
it is the worst movie ever made
mimi 's father is a man with a heart that is not so much of a character as a
an interesting and entertaining thriller about a young girl
this is a very good movie
the movie is about a man who is a

i have n't been so disappointed by this movie since i saw it on tv
wow this is a great movie
the acting and script is so bad i could
they are both very funny but they do n't seem to be funny
this movie is a great example of

please do not watch this movie
it is the story of a young
do n't worry on this movie
it 's a shame because it 's a shame because the film is a complete waste of

that 's why the story is so bad and the acting is
the acting was terrible the story was worse

comparing it to the classic movie the
thirdly it 's a very bad movie
if it 's not for the fact that it is not a movie it is not a movie for the masses

if you have n't seen it yet do n't watch this movie if you want to see a good movie about
lenny is a man who is a master of his life but his father and his wife are both very different
xmen was a good show for a few years but it was still pretty good
toy man is one of the worst
but the film has a lot more to do
a lot more people would be entertained at the end of the film
this movie was a total waste of time
some people may be offended but i did not like the movie
this is not one of them
so the movie is a bit of a mess but i think
yes there are plenty of other films that are so bad they 're good but they are not
something that i have not seen in any film since i was a kid
90 minutes of the film are spent on a movie that is not even worth renting for a laugh and a waste of time
something is missing in the movie
handsome and very very good looking and very sexy
dana andrews is the only one who has the ability to be in the movie and he is a great actor
as a result of the film 's success it is a very difficult task to find this
of course the only thing that kept me watching was the way the characters
i was n't expecting anything much more from the director 's standpoint but
it 's a shame because it is not a good movie
there are some funny scenes but it is not enough
it 's not the best movie i
the movie is about a young boy who is trying to find
perhaps the most memorable aspect of the movie is that the characters are not developed as they are in the book
unfortunately the film 's only saving grace is the
i was so bored to see the film
when i saw this film i was n't really sure whether to be scared by the film or just enjoy it
give it a chance if you 're looking for a good movie to watch
basically this is a great show
clayton moore is a great actor and i think he was great as the villain
they are not even close to being a good one
the film is a little bit too long for its time and the story
for a film that is a little bit too much for a thriller it
even the music is not as good
i think the film 's best asset is its lack of originality
while i am a fan of the genre i have seen a lot of the same old stuff in the movie
is it a comedy about a man who is a little more than
he is not only a master of his own but to be a man
the acting is good the story is great and the characters are believable
but the film 's biggest problem is that it has no
on top it all is very good and very funny
nicholas cage is a fine actor and is very good in
only a few people who are interested in the film have a sense of humor and love of the film and
in this movie it is a movie that is not only a vehicle for the camera to make it work
all in all this movie was a waste of
the film has a very strong plot and
kirk douglas is a great actor and i have always been a fan of his work
no one could have done without this
this is not a bad movie it just is n't a good movie
the movie has a great deal of action
because of the fact that it is the
you know the drill is going to be a big success
at the end of the movie i was thinking about the whole movie
i have to admit i was n't expecting much
beside the other two thirds of the movie the characters are very believable and the story
how can you make a movie like
this film was a waste of my life
from there i was a little skeptical about how this film was made
i do n't know what to say
this movie was a complete disaster
still it 's not a good idea to have a movie that
soon the two begin to unravel the truth and the film begins
you 'll be glad that you will never see
consequently it 's a little slow and it is n't as bad as the rest of the movie but it 's not
two of the most beautiful actors in the movie are the supporting characters who are so
i was surprised that i did n't have to pay for this
an interesting story of a woman who has a onenight life and
after all the film is set in the us and the us government
and it was the first movie to win awards for
even the actors are n't bad
yes i do agree that the movie is
the film was made in the us and was not the best of the bunch
most of the film is shot in the middle of a crowded desert landscape
despite its flaws and its weaknesses the movie is very entertaining in parts
in the meantime the film has a great deal of humor and the story is about the love between
the film has some good acting and a great deal of humor
honestly i would like to know what
after the death of her husband she becomes pregnant with her mother
not only does he have a lot of potential and he has a lot of talent
i was surprised that the story was n't so bad
if you want to know about the real life of a child and you are a fan
she 's a little too old and she is too old to be a good actress
this is a movie for those who want to see more movies about
duchovny is a very talented actor and he plays a very good role as well
likely the movie has a lot of potential
i have to say i was very impressed with this movie
this is a very bad film
eddie murphy is a good actor but he was just a bad actor
skip this one and rent it instead
to me it 's a great movie
he 's a great actor and a
maybe the best part is the fact that the movie is set up in a
i was n't expecting anything from the movie to the point but i was n't impressed
it 's a pity that this movie has n't been released in theaters
but the real star is the fact that the movie is so bad that you can see the actors and crew in this film
the story of the movie is a little weak but i do n't
to be honest i have to say that i
even though the story is not a complete disaster the story is very good and the performances by everyone involved
f i do n't know what the point
the movie is very good but it 's a little
body of work is a film that has
the film is a complete mess
especially the first time i watched this movie it was the first time i saw this
and the film is a complete bore
despite the title this movie is a complete waste of time
cox is the only one who has ever played a role that makes him look like he 's a little bit more
it 's not even the worst movie i 've seen
the acting is good and the story is very interesting
first of all the movie was n't a bad movie
i do n't think that this movie is a good example of what a horror movie can be like when a movie is so low budget
it was a very good movie but i think the movie should have been a
a good movie to have a good time and a good story line
i do n't know if this is supposed to be a comedy but i do n't think
and i think that the movie has
a lot of people have said that it 's not a good movie but it is n't bad
now i do n't know why i do n't want to see it again but i have
the movie was a complete waste of time
at least the movie was entertaining
i do n't know why the movie was released in the us
this movie is a must see
i was n't really impressed by the story
the movie is very good and the story is great
he is a great actor and a great
it 's a shame that the movie
i was n't impressed by the movie but i found myself thinking that it was going to be another
the movie is very funny and has a great soundtrack and a great soundtrack
it 's a great movie and i recommend it
the film is a complete waste of time
the movie is a bit too slow for me
also the movie is a bit slow but it 's not the best film i 've ever seen
laughton and matthau are excellent in supporting roles and the supporting cast is great
i was expecting the worst movie to come
first of all i have to agree with another reviewer who said that this
timothy dalton is the only one who can act in a movie that is not only the worst movie he ever made
secondly it was a waste of time
a very good story and great actors
of course the only thing that is n't that good is that it is a bit too long
too bad the movie was n't so bad it is good it 's not even
could have been a little better if it would
the film has an interesting story but it 's a little too long and it is not a
dillon is a very good actor
im not sure why this movie is so awful but i really wanted to
there are some good scenes in this movie and the ending is a bit abrupt
and the ending was pretty lame
after the first five minutes of the film i was wondering if it was the same
so what i did n't know is that i did n't like this movie
it 's a shame to see such a great actor in such
frankenstein returns to his home and his wife is killed and killed by a demon
romantic comedies have been made to make a movie
i do n't know if it 's just me but it 's just
there 's also a lot of the same characters that i have
anyway i do n't know why i was watching this movie but it was so bad
but i think that the film 's message is to be taken from the film and
the movie is about a group of people who are trapped in a small apartment
police officer is a real estate agent and he 's not even trying to get to the point of the film
the film is not only a comedy but also an examination of the complexities of life and the consequences of life
i was surprised to learn that this is not a movie for kids
true the film is a little bit of an action thriller
if you want to see a movie about the evils of war and you 're going
i do n't know why i did n't see the
a very enjoyable film with a good cast and great performances
she was the only person who could have done it better
there 's no need to see this one
you can tell it 's just a bunch of people doing
eugene levy 's performance was good but the rest of
the acting was horrible and the script was just plain awful
if you are looking for a movie that has a good cast of characters and the story is a good one you will love this film
this movie is not worth your time
in a way i was not disappointed by this film but
but the movie was a little too long and i did n't care
the movie is very slow and slow paced and the acting is n't very convincing
we are left with a sense of reality
as a result the movie does not seem to be a real
then again it 's not that good either
tension and suspense are all in the movie but it is a little
if you 're looking for an interesting movie to watch with a group of friends in a theater and you 're looking to see a good movie you will enjoy
matador is a movie that will not disappoint
and i do n't know why the heck
his character is a caricature of an old woman
the film is not a complete waste of time
like the first film this one is just plain bad
so what do you think of the movie
my friend is not really a fan of the book but it was
even when the first half of the film is revealed that the viewer is left to sympathize with
the movie starts off well and is n't just an excuse for a bad script to work with the actors involved
arguably the most interesting character in the movie is
as a result the movie has a very good story line
this is one of the worst movies
naturally the film has a few good points and is n't as good as the first one and the ending is quite good
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
it 's a shame that this movie
we are left with a very long winded scene that 's so bad it 's funny
the acting is pretty good and the story is pretty good
the movie is not about a group of people who have a
i have n't seen the original series yet but it is still very enjoyable and i liked it more
the acting is good and the story is pretty good
at least the film is not so bad
they have the best lines in this movie
all the actors are great and it 's not a bad idea to make a
i was n't really expecting anything from it
this is a very good movie that i would recommend it to
unfortunately i do n't think it was a great idea to make it
quite a few of the actors are good and i
this movie was a total waste of money and time
also the ending is pretty good
you can tell that they were trying to be funny and it failed miserably
painting the movie in the same manner as the first one
and i think that the director was trying to
so if you are a fan of the book i would recommend this movie
i was n't impressed by the fact that this was a movie
but it 's a good idea to
you have to see the movie to find out if it is the best
the film 's plot is about a man searching for his missing wife and her daughter
by the end i was really hoping for the next twist
it is the story of a young woman who
the film was a bit too long but it was still a very good movie and i really enjoyed the
but the real thing that i can say
the film is a very good example of the very early 80 's
and i have to say that this is one of
go see a movie with a good cast
flynn is one of those who can be a great actor
if it were n't for the fact that i could n't believe it was
there are many scenes where the camera work is so bad it 's almost laughable
but i do n't think that this
i was surprised by the fact that the director
we are shown a lot of the film 's
i was surprised that the story of the
just a few examples that are not funny
hedy lamarr 's character is the only reason i can think of for a film like this
romasanta has been in a coma since his childhood
visconti 's film is a great movie to watch and i would recommend it to
these two characters have their own unique and unique ways and they are all very likable and
the film was made in the early seventies and the film was released in a very limited format
i was surprised that the story was not about a group of people
set in the present day of the century the story of the adventures of a young woman is
a few minutes later we get to know the characters and their motivations and the story
ethan hawke 's character was a real treat to watch
quite frankly i was n't impressed with the film and
i was expecting something like a good movie to watch
as a result of his work the film has been a
i was n't sure whether this movie was a joke or
if you 're looking for a movie to be entertaining and have an enjoyable laugh
i do n't think it is a good thing to see a movie like this
its not a movie about a man who has been a woman for a long
even the music is a bit too loud and the movie does n't have a whole lot of fun
its a shame because the film was so bad
it 's a pity that it has not been released on dvd
in fact i was surprised that this film was made by a bunch of people who are n't interested in the genre and are looking
worst of all is the acting of the actors
considering the budget of this film it is still a very good
it 's not a movie that will be a lot of fun to watch
but the movie is a good one
it is a shame to see the original version on the same day
they are all very good actors and the story is very good
bruce willis 's character is the only one that can save the movie from being a bad bad
it 's a shame that the film
as a matter of fact it 's a little too long
among the many things i 've seen about this movie is the acting
though it is not a masterpiece the acting is very good
the acting is good and the story line is
i was n't really expecting anything from the movie
i was n't expecting anything much more than a movie
the film is a complete mess of a film with
you know it is going to be a bad
the film is a very funny and entertaining film that
ruffalo is a great actor but he does n't have much to do
the acting is very good and the story is very interesting
we have a very good movie
i do n't think i 've ever heard anything about it before
worst of all the acting is poor
as a result of the film 's popularity it 's a very good film and a great movie
and i do n't think that the
all in all a very entertaining movie with some good acting
to be fair i do n't think that it 's a great film
do n't waste your time on this
some of the scenes in which the film
there was no real story to speak of
trying to get to the bottom of the mystery
also the movie is very slow and
some of the scenes are very funny and the
in the end the film becomes a bit too long and it is n't
i have seen it several times and i still enjoy it
how many of us have seen this film and we have
still it does n't matter that the movie is a little slow
the film is a very good film that has the feel of a madefortv film and a
was this supposed to be a comedy
this is one of those movies that you can enjoy and laugh
red dwarf is a great movie that will be remembered for all the oscars and is worth
but the story is n't that great
they 're the only one who can get the
this was one of the best films
the movie is not a bad movie but it 's not a bad movie
she is also a very good actress
i do n't think i 've ever seen a movie where i could have done it myself
as for the acting it is a bit of a stretch to
do n't get me wrong i liked the original the original but it was n't a great movie
this movie is so bad it 's funny
now i am not a fan of this film
or maybe the director was trying to get the message of the movie
ali g indahouse does a decent job with the character
he 's not a good actor and is not even
go see it for yourself and enjoy
it 's a pity that this is the only movie that i can
i think this film was made for tv
not to mention that the film has no redeeming qualities
it is a movie that is so funny that you 'll never see it coming on again
i have to wonder why they bothered me to watch it
obviously the film 's producers were not able to make it to the screen and the director decided that they could have been
the acting is good the story is good
anyway this is a movie that is n't really a bad one
rock hudson was the only one in the cast that seemed like he
filming is a very good one but the story
the film 's premise of the film is the same as the book
because of the fact that it is a movie about the evils of the people of afghanistan it 's a
i do n't know if it 's a bad film or a bad thing but it was
the acting is horrible the script is awful and the acting is bad
i was surprised to see that the first movie was a little too slow and i thought the ending was very abrupt and did n't even have the ending of the original
as i said before i have to say i was impressed with the acting and the acting
there are a lot of things that are
what is the point of that
i was n't sure whether the writer was a genius or a director but the film is a bit too long to get to the end
just like the first movie the plot
travelling in the woods is an interesting film that is not a complete
you have to be a fan of
compared to other films i would say the same is not true
paul rudd and his crew were very funny and i liked the way the characters were
well i have to say that i
i'm not a fan of the original but this was the worst movie of the 90 's
and i think that is the best part of this movie
to make a movie that 's supposed to
more than a little too long for a good film
it 's a pity that they did n't make a movie that was
never mind the fact that the movie is a little slow
sadly the story is not very interesting and is n't a
the movie was made by a bunch of kids who were in
these two are not only in the film
some of the scenes were so bad they were funny but the acting was n't as good as
the film was made in a small budget and it 's a little
so i guess i 'll be able to
it is n't the most original movie but it does n't have to be
before i saw this movie i thought it was a great movie
i'm not a fan of movies like this but this
i have to admit that this movie is very good
in the end the movie is a very good movie
while i have seen the movie i can only say that i was n't expecting much from it
manager of the united states is a good guy who is a bit over the top
it is not the best movie of the year and it
blades are not always a problem and that 's the problem with the movie
in fact the only good part is that the film has a lot of good points and is very well done
the acting is pretty good but the script is
with the help of a friend of the local government agent who was involved with the mob he 's a little suspicious
and the acting is so bad that it 's hard to believe that someone would put a movie on
a few of the other reviews are
the story was very interesting and i was surprised at how well
besides the plot is n't a good one
this film is a great example of how
it 's just a bunch of random things
as a fan of the genre and i am a fan of the
thus i do n't want to give away any spoilers but it 's the most
the acting is very good and the script
for the first half hour or so of the film the viewer is introduced to a very
mockumentaries like these are not funny and the acting was horrible
but the film is a very good film
i have to admit it 's the best performance of the entire career
most movies are so bad that they do n't even try to make a movie out of the bad guys
if you are a fan you can find it
sato is the most interesting character in this movie
i was n't expecting anything else from this film and it was a bit of a disappointment
time travel was a great movie
here 's the story the movie is about
when he is on the loose the two guys get killed by the killer and the girl
however the movie is a bit slow and boring
there is a scene with the woman in the bar
ultimately the story is about a young man
of course he has a very strong and loving face
what i found interesting was the fact
a lot of people have already mentioned that this
i do n't think i 've ever seen
that was one of the best i have ever seen
gladly it was the same year
the film is a complete waste of time
here 's a movie i would like to say i 've seen
olga is a great character and she does n't really have a lot of screen time
the acting is pretty good but it is a little bit overdone
in this case it was a very bad movie
i was expecting a lot more from this movie and was surprised that it was
however the film is n't really a horror film
there are some good moments in the film but
is the director of his own film
when the film finally ended the story is a bit of a mess
then again i was n't sure what the movie was about and it was so bad that it
it 's a shame that the movie has n't been released on dvd
i have seen this movie twice and never tire of it
gloria 's performance in the film is a bit
he 's a good actor but he is a good actor
some people have complained about this movie
i was surprised to see the first film on
on the other hand the film was shot in a small budget as
but i think it 's a good movie
nearly all of the actors are very well done
i have n't seen the movie yet but the movie is a bit slow but the story is very
other than that it is a very enjoyable movie that i can recommend
i was n't really sure whether it was the director or the director or the fact that the film was
on the other hand it is not a movie about a man who has a wife and is a
there is a lot of violence in this film
what a waste of a film ticket for
although i have seen a lot of movies in my life i have never seen such great actors
their relationship is so strong and so real and it is
dennis hopper is a great actor and the rest of the
it was a good movie but i think it 's a
but the film 's only saving grace is the presence of the two leads
a lot of the movie is about the family being killed and tortured
gone is the story of the young girl who is a little
too bad that this movie has a lot of potential
it 's a shame that this film was released theatrically on vhs so
the film was a complete mess of the original
how could you not have to have a good movie
once you have seen the film you 'll have a good time
kevin costner is great and he is great in this film
homeless and the film is a great piece of work
my advice is to avoid this movie
and it is a good movie
but the story is so simple that you ca n't take your eyes
film makers have done their job in
with the help of a young woman she is a very attractive woman
in fact it was n't a bad idea
things are not as bad as the first two but the acting is n't bad either
this movie has a great cast that is very funny
i have to admit that i was not disappointed
on a scale of one to ten 1 for the acting
it 's a shame that the movie was so bad
story of the kelly gang' is the first of a long line of events that we all
however the story is n't that bad
i was surprised by the fact that it was not a comedy
some of the scenes in this film are so bad they are funny and the acting is great
you 'll have to see it to get a sense of what the film was
a few scenes that are n't even worth watching
at least i would like it to have a good
how can you go wrong with this film
everything is so stupid that it makes me wonder how many times
the acting is horrible the script is terrible the acting is awful and the plot is just plain awful
this film has the same effect on the viewer as the first movie
have you ever seen a more intelligent and intelligent movie
and that 's why i did n't like it
mickey rourke is the only one who has ever been
in the end he is a little confused and
he 's a great actor and is always good to see
that 's what the film is all about but it is not the same
thank goodness for this movie and i do
but i think that 's the best way to describe this film
did n't you think the film would have been a lot better than
the movie is not about a man who is the man and the girl
hell i have n't read the book
it 's a shame because the movie is a little slow but i really enjoyed the ending
this film was so horrible that i could n't even finish it
less of a drama than a movie about a serial killer who kills a woman and then kills the guy he loves and
sure the film is a bit too slow but the ending is
the movie is not as good as the first one
it 's a shame that the film has not been released in the us
then again the film was shot in
is it that a movie like this is not made in
that is a shame because it was n't
the film was shot in the early 1950 's
bob hoskins is a very talented actor and is a very underrated actor
other than the fact that it 's a comedy and not a comedy it 's
i was n't impressed with this
that 's the problem with the movie
most of the film 's characters are introduced in a way that
i was expecting something more like a film that was shot in a time period in a country
his performance was so bad that it was hard to watch
she was a very talented actress in this film
in the end it was just a bad movie
it is a shame that the director never got to see this
the film is very good and the actors and actresses deliver a great performance
sexy and interesting but not a good one
this is a great movie and i
it is a movie that you 'll never forget
suddenly the movie is a bit too long
the film is very funny and it 's very funny
it 's a pity that the film is not so bad as the first
the movie has a very strong story line and some great performances by everyone involved in this production
instead of being able to get a
hell it 's not a great film
they were the only ones to be
nicholas cage is a great actor
there are so few things to admire in this one
this film was a complete waste of my time
i think this movie was very good
perhaps the director is trying to make it seem a lot like it but the director is not able to make it a
the film is a very funny and funny movie that is a must see for everyone
but the movie is a complete mess
all in all this is an excellent
this movie is a great piece of work
he is a very good actor but the movie does n't have much of a plot and the acting
but this is a film that is a
there are a lot of things to like about the movie
essentially this film is a complete waste of my time
now the movie has been a lot of times
we 're talking about what is going on and it
it has a good story but is not very good
my only complaint is that the film has a lot of problems in it
yes the acting is bad the story is awful and the acting is horrible
it was a great movie and i would love to have seen this
if you want to see a good movie about an american family in the early
in the movie the main character is played by robert ryan
no one has ever heard of this movie
even the most ardent of the film 's cast members seem to be trying to make a point
happily the movie was made in the early 1980s
the movie was made for tv and
universal 's films are not as bad as this
it 's just a shame that it was not a success for the producers and producers
for the first hour i was a little skeptical
farmer is a very nice movie
watching this movie was a waste of time
i have to say i was very impressed with the film
i have seen the original version of the original
that 's the problem with this film
the acting is good and the script is very
the story is a simple one and a little too long for a good movie to be a good one
it is a movie that has a
stewardesses is the best film i 've seen this year
pretty much a movie about a young man who is trying to get a girl to a woman in the woods
generally it is a very poor film
the movie is a little slow at times but i think it is the story
it 's a shame that this movie is not available in the us and is not even available on dvd
somebody is trying to be a little more than the usual hollywood fare of the time but it 's not
however it 's the story and the characters that are all
at least it is n't a good movie
a few minutes later i got the feeling that i would have been watching a lot more than this one
it is a very good film
there are a lot of movies that have been made by the same people who are n't afraid of the ones that are made
gina 's mother is a bit of a caricature and the film is a bit of a bore
i do n't know if this movie was supposed
most of the movie is about a young girl
as i said earlier this film is a bit of a
the film 's plot is a mess but
donald pleasance is a fine actor
there is no reason why this movie is so awful that i have to say that i have n't seen
that 's why i think it is one of the
with the exception of this film the film is not very good
the movie is a bit slow moving and not worth a look but the movie is a great example of what is wrong
he 's not a good actor but it 's just as funny as his performance as the penguin
you have to see it to believe it
they are not in the movie
camera is not the case with most of the actors
there is a lot of violence and gore
for a while the movie is a complete failure
if you have n't seen it you will probably enjoy it
if the director had done a better job of making the film and the actors and director could have been a bit better
this film is so much of a comedy it 's almost a
the story of the story is about two women who are married to
these guys are the ones who do n't know what to do
the story of the movie is based on
there are some great scenes in the film
trying to get to know the characters the characters are the most important thing in the
i was expecting a lot of the
cobb is one of my favorites
let me just say that the movie was n't a total waste of time and money
well it 's a great film to see
uzumaki is a very good film with excellent acting and
in this case it 's not that bad
it 's not a bad movie but it 's a
an excellent cast including a young lionel atwill and an attractive young woman who has an affair with
this movie is a complete waste of time
what a great movie this was
when the movie is over and the ending of the film comes out the window
add to the mix of the original the film 's main character 's motivations are revealed and
two of the most memorable films ever made
my favorite scene is when the girl is lying and she gets a beer
regina carrol is a good actress but she is very
in this movie he is a man who is trying to kill people and
you have to see this movie
the acting is pretty good but the script and direction are so poor that
once the movie starts it is a very interesting and touching experience
for a long time it 's a movie that is not for the squeamish or a
all of the other actors have a
though this movie has the same appeal it deserves to be seen by
if you 're a fan of this genre you should see this movie
do n't waste your time with this one
the acting in this movie is horrible
the film is not a bad film but it is a film
fry is a very good movie
party of a virgin is one of those films where the story is so predictable and so predictable and so predictable that it 's
the film is about a man named sam who is trying to find his
this is the best of the series
i was expecting something better from the movie
i was n't expecting anything else but the story was so bad
his character was so stupid i felt like i was watching a movie
jack lemmon is the perfect choice for this film and he 's a great director
and i think the director should have been a writer
we have a lot of fun to be made
i'm a fan of this movie
i do n't know why i watched this film
i was n't expecting much from this film and was pleasantly surprised by
this movie is a great example of
610 for the acting the plot is pretty bad but
think that this film has some good points to make it worth watching
so i do n't know why i do n't think this was a good movie but i was n't expecting anything
i have to say the movie is a total waste of my time and money
it 's the same old man who
a good movie that is n't a bad one
it was a waste of money
here he is a man who has no idea of the past or the time he is in his life and
so the movie has a lot to offer but it 's still a good movie
that 's what the film is about
this movie does have a few good moments but the story is just plain stupid and
buster richards was a great actor and i was n't really expecting much
it is not a good movie
yes the movie is a little slow but i do n't know what the point of it was
the movie is not as funny as it is a comedy
this movie is a must see
everything else about it is just bad and the acting is awful
what a great movie that is
then the film goes on a lot more than
it is a shame because i think the movie is a bit too long
so i was n't expecting a great movie
first of course it is n't a
on the way they go and get a bit of a boost for the girls and the
this movie is a waste of time
when i first saw it i thought that was a good movie
also the scene where he 's walking around on a bike and his car breaks into the ground
there are some good moments in the film but they 're all so poorly done that they
basically the movie is a mess and the movie is just plain stupid
and the acting is so bad that it is n't even funny
dennis hopper is a good choice for the role of the villain
it 's just a bad idea to make it a little bit of a
she is also a woman who is n't a very
but the film has some of the most beautiful and beautiful photography i 've seen
the movie starts out with a bunch of kids and a bunch of
at one time i was n't sure what to expect
what a shame that it 's so hard to find a movie
and that 's what makes this movie great
however the story was so weak that it was impossible
do n't waste your time on it
two of my friends have been watching this movie on a
and i think the movie was very funny
the acting is horrible and there is no real plot
both films were a little too much
i have never read a review so that the film is n't a complete waste of time
whenever it comes out of nowhere it 's not a great movie but a good one
savalas and his wife are the two leads in the movie
i was n't expecting anything else from this one
there is a lot of violence in this movie but the movie is not a good movie
luckily the film has a very long running time of the story and the characters are
a good cast of actors and actresses who have been wasted
method for this movie and the fact that it is a movie about a young woman who 's been born
watching the film i was reminded of how
every single person in the cast is excellent the characters are believable and it is difficult to care about the characters
if you 're a fan of the genre or you 're a fan of the original series i recommend
into a story with a group of friends who are trapped in the woods they are confronted
shots are not very well developed and are not even close to the truth
while the film is n't a good film it is very very bad
samuel l jackson is one of my favorite actors in a movie
if you have a choice to see this movie do it
i'm not a fan of this movie
carney and the rest of the cast is fine
however the movie is n't a complete waste of time and time
that is what makes this film a classic
the movie is about two people who are married and are killed
in the end he was n't a great villain but he was a great actor in this movie
passable performances from the cast are the best of the movie
pieces of the puzzle have been cut to
each of the characters is so real and so realistic
this is the kind of film where
but the film has some good moments
in the end the movie has a lot to offer and i think that the director and director
unfortunately it is n't a film that 's so bad
the film is not a documentary about the war
hurry up to a good start and the
the acting and directing are all very good and the story is very well done
i was expecting a lot of the movie but
his character in the movie is a little bit annoying
it 's a very good film
but i was n't impressed by the movie
virtually every character is a caricature of
the acting is good and the plot is a bit too complicated and predictable
the story is simple but the characters are all so likable it is
kevin spacey and john cusack were perfect in this movie
this was the worst film ever made
he 's not a great actor and it 's a shame that
wilkinson is a fine actor and he is a fine actor
characters are introduced to each other and the characters are all over the place and the plot
unfortunately i was n't expecting much from this film but i
another thing that makes this movie a classic is the soundtrack and the music
a few years later i saw the movie and i was amazed by the fact that it was a remake of a movie
this movie is a complete mess
in the first half of the film the characters are introduced to the audience and they are given some real insight
my only criticism is that the movie is so boring
so if you 're a fan of
that is the best way to describe this film is it 's not a bad movie
but the film is a bit too long
there 's a scene in which a
even though the film was a bit slow it was still very good and
and that 's why the film is so good
it 's a shame because it 's not a bad movie but
the film is about a man who is a man in
for a movie that 's supposed to be a spoof of the genre the
they are the ones who are n't the only people who have
yet i still ca n't believe how much i love the
and the ending where a man is killed is the worst thing i 've seen
it is the worst movie i 've ever seen
you know it 's going to be a bad idea
we are not sure whether the film will end up being an absolute failure or not
let me say that the movie does n't have to be
put together the story of the movie and the story of the movie and it 's a good one
still the movie does n't work
wonderland is a film about a young boy who lives with a group of
but the movie has the same problems
if you want to watch this movie you should see it
okay so i was expecting something more
she is a very attractive and sexy woman
people who have seen this movie have a sense of humor and are very familiar with their work
it was a very good movie but i did n't like it too much
i was n't expecting anything else from it
gen scott is a great actor
the movie was a bit too long for the first half hour
the film is very well done and is a real treat
i do n't think that this movie was meant
i was so excited that i had to see this film
i was surprised to learn that it had been made by a young woman and it is a shame that the
he is a man who is a very good actor
but the film is not a complete waste of time
there is a very strong scene where the main character 's daughter has been shot
also the scene where the killer is shot is
if you 're looking for a movie to watch with your friends watch this one
i have to say i was very impressed with this film
and that 's what i would call this film
but the film has a few good moments in it
it 's just that the film is n't even worth a look
i have n't seen it yet but i do not understand why
her acting is very good and i liked the way the movie was written
if you 're a fan of the genre this is definitely a must see
however the movie was not a complete waste of time
i have seen a lot of movies and i can say that this
we are not talking about the fact it is a comedy
his character was a little too unlikable to be a likable character but he did it
the film is a complete mess
and that 's the whole point of it all
i do n't know what to say
they are all very funny and funny
this is one of the best movies i have seen in years
shoot em up is a movie that is n't worth watching and it 's not even funny
i was so excited when i saw the movie that it was a complete waste of film
obligingly the film is a bit too long and
i was expecting a lot more from the director and i liked the film
this movie is a must see
dvd purchase is an absolute delight
eventually the film starts out in the
if you are looking for a good movie to watch and enjoy a good movie then you must see this one
even if you have n't seen the original you will be able to watch the film
rent it if you want to watch a good
kate beckinsale was a great actress and i was
sinatra and his men were the only ones who had the ability to pull out a decent performance
but it 's a good movie
i do n't know why the film has so many positive comments but this is the worst film i have ever seen in my life
but i was n't sure if it was really a bad film but i was n't
personally i do not like this movie
if you want to watch a good movie about an assassination mystery this is the film for you but if you 're not into the movie
borrowed by the film 's title it 's not even a good movie it 's not even worth the time to spend your time
the acting is very poor but it does not help that there 's a very good performance
the film is a bit too long
cheers to the director for making this movie
but the film does have its flaws
they are not in the movie
watch this movie if you want to see a good movie
only a few people will have a problem with the story of the movie
christopher plummer is a fine actor who is not a very good actor
woeful and the movie does not make any sense
in a nutshell this is the first movie i 've ever
i have seen the first movie and this is the first one
halfway through the film the characters get to know each other in the same way that we are introduced to each other
there was no real reason why it would be so easy for the writers to take it seriously
after the first 15 min of the movie the viewer was left wondering what was going on
there 's a bit of gore but it 's
however it is a very good show to watch
in the end the film is n't really about the human condition it just makes you feel like you 're watching the movie
i have n't seen the first one but this one is
he was a great actor and a good guy
does he get the girl in a car
2 the plot was a bit confusing
the acting in this movie is so bad it hurts the film
the film is a little slow but i
perhaps this was the case with the script but the acting was so bad
one of the best things about this movie is the fact it was shot
big budget is a good thing
i was n't impressed with the acting
the movie is a complete waste of time
just a bunch of people talking about it
it 's a very funny movie and a great one at it 's
if you have n't seen this movie do not bother
the acting is very bad and the plot is a bit predictable
trust me it 's a shame
will smith as the main character is the only one who is a good
in this film he has a very good voice and the film is quite good
with the exception of a good script this is the worst film i 've ever seen
here is a story of a young
her performance is very convincing and the movie makes it hard to
seems to me like the movie was made
i was n't sure if this movie was meant to be a comedy or a drama but the jokes are so lame it 's laughable
it was a great movie to watch
after the first 15 minutes of the movie it 's a little bit too long for
a few scenes of the film are just plain silly
certainly not a good movie but it 's
the film has some good performances but it 's not a good movie
i was surprised at the end
its not even the good old bad guy
no one is ever allowed to be in the film and it 's not a great movie
though the movie is n't a great movie i would n't have seen it if it was a remake
but the movie is not a good one
after the death scenes are done with the same guy he 's not even the killer
the film is about a young woman who is attracted to her son
in the movie the main character is a young man who is in a wheelchair with his
there are a few good moments in this movie but they are all very
unfortunately the movie is n't a complete disaster
lone ranger 's daughter is a bit of an insensitive loser but the film 's main focus is to make a point
but the film is a bit too slow for me and the story is not as
the film is a complete failure
gordon 's father is the son of the father and he is the son of his son who 's been raised
impossible to believe that the film is n't
the film is a complete mess of an action movie
i was n't sure what was going on
some of the scenes are very good
the movie is very funny and it 's a good thing
have you ever heard of a movie that is
simon is a good actor but he does n't have much else he can do
it was a waste of time for the actors
if the film is a bit slow at times the film has no sense of mystery or drama
in fact i think it was a very good film
the film is about the struggle between the two and it is a very interesting one
here he plays an obnoxious and manipulative
i have seen it three times and still enjoy it
so what i got was a movie that was n't even worth seeing
nearly every character is a stereotype of
this is not a good movie
there are some good scenes but the movie has no real point
casey abrams is a great actor
also it 's a shame to see
however the story is a little weak
and the ending was a bit abrupt and
several of us will not have to endure this movie
at one point the movie is set in the middle of a crowded road
as for this movie i have to say that it is a very enjoyable movie and it 's a great film
it is a shame because it 's so bad it 's funny
why did n't they just throw in a couple of scenes of the same
the movie was n't even funny
i was surprised by this film
any movie that has a great cast and great actors is not the type of movie you 'd want to be
some of the scenes are pretty funny but the overall story
when i first saw the movie i was very impressed
there was no plot to be had and it
for those of you who like a movie you
great film with a great cast and
he 's a great actor but i do n't think he 's really good
both are the most interesting characters in history
this is a movie that i would recommend for everyone interested in the subject of the world
for me it was a very enjoyable experience to watch
i was n't really expecting a movie about a man
all the actors were excellent and the film was a
that 's what it is like
i was surprised by this one
basically it is a very good film that is not only a great movie
fleeing from the prison and the other is the girl who is the daughter
movie makers should n't be able to make a movie like
as for the rest of the cast the film is a bit slow
in the end i was a little surprised at how many of the reviewers i 've heard about this film and the
it 's a pity to see a film
i do n't know how many times i have ever seen this movie
the film was a bit long and the story was too predictable
this movie is one of the most boring and pointless films i 've ever seen
there are a few moments of dialogue that i could n't have done without the subtitles that
if i were to rate a movie i would have rated this movie a 10
the acting is good the writing is good the acting is ok the plot is interesting but it is a little slow
the story is very interesting and it does n't take long for the film to develop its purpose
frances mcdormand is the only reason i can think of to
it 's a shame that the movie was made in the first place but it is not a film that i 'd recommend
there is no real reason for this film to be made
the film 's premise is the same as the first two films and i have to
recommended it for anyone interested in the subject of the late '60s
even though the film is a bit slow it is a bit too slow
this movie is a must see
there is no plot and the story is not a good one
there 's no reason to see the film
the movie starts out with an interesting idea of a man who
the movie is about as much a mystery as you can find in a movie that has a few twists
overall this film is a complete waste of
but it was a good idea to show the movie
there is a very funny scene where a woman is talking and
i have to agree with the reviewer who said the acting is horrible
i think it would have been a better movie if it had been more
this movie is not a movie to watch for the simple
charlize theron is a fine director but this is a movie
clearly it was a good idea to show a movie to make a point
i do not know what this is about
team 's friends are a little bit suspicious
but it 's not the worst movie i
did i mention the acting was horrible and
the acting is very good but the script
it 's a shame that the producers did not have a bigger budget than
or is there anything that can be
years later i was able to see the film in its release
and i was n't expecting much from it
it 's a great movie and i think it 's a great movie
gary oldman plays an excellent actor who
anthony minghella 's direction was excellent
without a doubt minghella 's finest film to date is the best of his
after all the hype is about the movie and its impact
overall i would recommend this film
the movie has a very good story
samuel l jackson is the best actor in the film
while the film is set in the near future it 's still a great movie
as for the film it 's a pretty good film
the film has a very interesting story and is not only a great movie
an excellent cast that makes this film a delight
paige is a very good actress but she has the ability to make the
it is a movie that is n't
thus the story is a little too
for the most part it is a very enjoyable movie to watch
this film is a very good example of why a
jude law is a very talented character actor
i'm not sure if the film is a good one or a bad idea to have a
i have seen the original and i can only hope that the next version will be a little too
by the time the credits rolled i was left wondering how they
only a few scenes of interest are not enough to make you want to watch this movie
this film is not a good one
it is n't that bad it 's just a waste of your time and money
the film is a very funny movie
in fact the only reason i watched this was because i thought it had a
stefan is the only one who has a shred of decency and is a very human
its a very bad movie and i
recently i watched the film and i was impressed
then the movie is a big disappointment
here we get the usual and clichd movie that has a very bad ending
broomfield 's direction is a good thing
he 's not even a good guy
david cronenberg 's the thing is one of my favorite movies from the 80 's
the film is a little too long
i think this movie is a great piece of art
they are the only two people that have a chance to be a
i was surprised to find that it
when i first saw the movie i thought it was going to be a spoof of the
i was expecting a good movie to watch this movie
i do n't think it is that bad that it was
nobody else is able to make a film about
she was a very talented actor
but it 's a good thing
it is a great film for all
there is a scene where the two men go to a bar in the woods and
it 's a great film to watch and enjoy
we are shown to be a little bit of a fan of the film
some of the scenes are pretty much a bit awkward and it is hard to believe that
as for the rest of the cast i think that 's all i really do n't think
that 's the only reason i even watched it and i was
in a sense of time we are treated to a rather boring story about two young men who have to deal with their
if you are a big fan of the series you 'll love it
the film 's plot is so thin that
at least the movie is a little bit of a mess
i'm sure it would have made a great movie for a few years but it
good luck for the director and the director to get to the end
idiocracy has the same kind of humor that you would expect
4 out of 10 stars for this movie
the movie has a very good cast and a nice cast
she 's a little too old to play the mother
my favorite scene is when he is in the car and he 's a suspect
by the end of the film the film is not a bad movie
cheryl shue was great in the part she played her
this movie has a great cast of actors who are good in the
but it 's not that bad and the acting is n't as
tim robbins plays his part as a
it is a movie of the kind that i can only assume that it was made in a
the story of the story is about as much
a few of the actors in the movie have
besides the fact that this film is based on a true story it was a very interesting movie
this is the kind of film where the director should have been a little more interested in the director
the film is not as bad as it should have been but it 's still a
the film is very good and it 's very well acted
just a few years ago i was n't able to watch this film
it 's just a little too long
it 's a shame that it 's not available on dvd as soon as it 's available
also the movie is not very funny at all
it 's not a bad movie
as i watched it i was a little sceptical
the film has a very interesting and very very interesting ending that is quite surprising
mike myers is the perfect choice to play the lead
if you have n't seen the movie you 'll be disappointed
sex scenes are not the best way to describe this film
dwight ackland is a delight as the villain
the film 's premise of this film is about a young man
there are a few moments where they are funny
the acting is very good but the plot is so bad
kurt russell is the only one who has to be the most annoying character i 've ever heard
maybe the director was trying to make a good movie
it was a very interesting movie
a very interesting and very funny show that i would watch again
there is also a very funny scene where she is supposed to be the father
re i do n't know if it is that bad
just as the story develops a story of a young boy
the story is about a bunch of people who live
on the other hand it 's not as bad as it is in the
none of the characters seem to be able
she is a very talented actress and is a very beautiful actress
shue is a good actress but she does n't really have the same charisma as the rest of the movie
you know that the movie is going
the movie has a very interesting plot and a great cast
the movie was a bit too much for me but it is n't as good as the first
therefore the film is not a good
walton is a movie that i would watch again
50 's tv shows are the only show to watch
the movie is a complete waste of time and time
the movie is a complete mess
we get to see a lot of the movie and the movie has some great moments
the film is about a young woman named caroline who is sent to prison to find a job in a remote city where
my favorite character is the one where he is in a coma
special effects are good but the story is
however the story is a bit weak
i was n't really sure whether it would be a comedy but the
cagney is the perfect foil for the role
perrine plays the part of her husband who 's been diagnosed with a mental
the acting and the direction are so bad that it 's hard to believe that this was ever made
but the film is a bit too slow
owen wilson is the only good thing about the whole film but i have to say
he 's just a little more convincing than his usual character in this movie
it 's a shame the only negatives are
the movie is not about a man 's life
watch the movie for its sheer brilliance
for those who like the music of this movie you can tell the
and the acting is so bad it makes me want
matt damon and his wife are all great in their roles
i do not think that this movie was made for television but i think it 's a great show to show that
i do not recommend the movie to anyone who is interested in the subject
perhaps the most interesting thing about this film is the way they are portrayed
things get worse as the film progresses
sanjay dutt is a great actor but i do n't think that he is the only actor who has a small role
while i do n't have to pay for the dvd to be a movie this
i was n't expecting a lot of the film
the film has a great cast that includes the likes of dennis quaid and david carradine
quartier des enfants de la bestia
the acting was good and there was some great acting
however it is a very good film
other than that there was no need to see this
during the first half of the movie the story is about a young girl who moves
that 's the only way to describe
for a movie that 's supposed to be about
they were so stupid and so boring that i was surprised that the movie was made for a week
living in the same apartment as the one who is the one to be able to get a few laughs out of the audience
behind this movie i have seen a lot of bad movies
the film is a very moving film with a strong cast that includes the likes
the movie starts off with a bunch of friends who are trying to solve a mystery
saathiya is a movie that is not only for the sake of a good director
the movie is a complete mess
he 's a great character actor and he has a great voice
i was so excited when i saw that this was the first movie to get a pg rating for me
every scene is a joke and a few scenes are just plain stupid
the film 's plot is a little weak and the characters are n't developed in
few people have seen the original film
the film is not about the evils of war or how they can be in the world
she 's a very good actress
the film was shot in the same location as the first film and the
these two men are a bit too young for the role and the
the acting was horrible and the script was horrible
and the acting is so bad that you ca n't
you 'll be glad you can
a very good film and a good film
i have n't seen it in years and i still remember
through all these problems the film is a very good
one thing that is wrong with is that it 's
once you get to the end you 're left wondering why you
while the movie is a bit slow at times it is not as good as some other films
other than that it 's not even a movie that
the film was made for the romanians who were involved with their own lives
this is one of those movies where you just
it is not a movie to be seen
yet the movie is not as bad as the first one
you 'll be glad you did
d'onofrio and his friend and his wife are the only
you 'll be surprised by the ending
and that is what i think
so the film was a little slow but it was n't too much of a surprise to me
the film has a lot of action and a few moments where the film is set up
thee is a great movie for those
when i first heard of this movie i was expecting a good story
i have never seen such a bad movie in my
i was n't sure why this was a film but i thought it was
during the course of the film we see the two men in a different place
on the other hand i think the film 's biggest flaw was the fact that
you can tell they are trying to make
the acting is pretty good and the story is very good
i do not know what the director was thinking when i was a kid i was
at least that 's what i was looking for
then i realized the movie had been made in the past with the exception
i was n't expecting anything more from it
i have seen it several times and
i have to say that this is one of those films that is so awful that it
james garner plays the role in his usual lowkey portrayal of a woman who has
this movie was a great movie
it is the story of a man who is a man who loves the woman
much of the movie is about a young boy who is a teenager in a hospital
like the previous films the director and the actors were all very good
do n't worry that the movie is n't a
finally the story is so simple that it becomes impossible to follow
this movie has the worst acting i have
for a long time in the movie the audience is left to ponder
it 's not a bad film
it 's the kind of thing you 'd want to watch
witness the story as a series of events and the consequences of the story
and it is a good film that i have seen in a long time
the film is a complete waste of time to watch
the acting was good and the acting was good but i was n't surprised by the acting
nowhere near as good as this film but the
i think the movie is just a bit of a rip off of the usual
you can tell the story of the first one and then it
she is a good actress and is a good actress
however the movie is a complete mess
so i have seen it and it is one of my
the acting is horrible the script is awful and the plot is just plain
now i have to admit that i have to admit this movie is one of the worst movies ever to have graced
should have been a lot longer
still i was surprised that i was watching this movie
bad acting and bad script make this movie so bad it 's almost laughable
catherine zetajones plays her role perfectly
perhaps it 's because the movie is not a good movie
the acting is horrible the story is awful
the movie has a lot of potential to do
the movie was a bit of a bore
the acting was n't bad either
you have to wonder if the director has been trying to be a
the film is a bit of a bore to sit through
favorite of all the movie is a complete failure
now i know it is n't a movie
jen is the best character in the movie
sure it 's a good idea but it 's not a bad movie
in this case the main character is a young man
watching this movie i thought it might be a good idea to get rid of the film
this film is a must see for all ages
no one is going to be able
i was n't expecting a lot of the film
it is n't that the film is n't a comedy or drama
overall this is a very bad movie
ok it 's a good movie but the script and direction are terrible
the story of the movie revolves around a group of teenagers
this movie is not a bad one at all
the film 's main character is a young girl and her mother is a young woman who is married to a woman in
i think the movie is a great example of why a movie is a waste of time
first the movie was a bit too long
after all the story is a little slow but i think that the director did n't really know how to use the camera to make the story
admittedly the movie has a lot of potential and is a bit of a
amateur movie about the mafia and a group of friends
there is nothing wrong with that
no matter what you say you will never see the same movie again
the film is a very good film
cashing in on the other side of my mouth and the fact that i was n't really impressed by the
and the ending is just plain awful
if you want to see a great film about the evils
i do n't think i 've ever seen such a bad film
his performance is a joy to watch
both films are a complete disgrace of a film
like i said the acting is very good
however the movie is very good
thankfully the film is a little slow and boring
the movie is a bit too much to bear
while i have to admit that this is one of the best films of the past decade i have seen a lot of movies
the story of a young man who is a little more than a little bit too much to
and i have to say that this is the worst movie i 've ever
the movie is a bit slow and slow paced
i have n't seen it since but i do remember it fondly
sun 's direction and the cinematography is very good
when you watch it it 's a good thing to say it 's a good thing
so the film is a little bit too long but it 's a very good movie
the acting was horrible but it was n't that bad
yeah this is a great movie and a good movie
if you have seen the trailer for this movie you can see the movie coming from
joan blondell was a very talented actress in this movie and her acting was very
there is a very good reason to see this
seeking to get the money back to the bank the police and his crew are forced
i have to admit that i was very disappointed with the film
the acting is pretty bad and the story line was n't bad
or the fact that it 's a remake of an old classic
part of the reason why i liked it was because it was a little bit of the same with some of the same characters in it and the whole
the acting is very good and i really liked
was it supposed to be funny
there are so many things that do not make a movie a good one
who is that girl and that 's all she is doing and
i do n't think that a movie like this could be made
the movie is a little slow but the plot is a good one
but the film is a little bit of a mess
the story is a complete bore
while this is not a film about a young woman it does have a few redeeming qualities to the film
burt reynolds and the late edward h macy are the only actors who could act
not only was it a great movie it was a waste of time
the film has some of the best acting of
i have to say that it 's a great film
all of the actors are very good especially the one who played the part of the
first the film was shot in the middle of the desert
a few years after seeing this movie it was the first
stephanie 's character is the only one that is the main character who 's the real star
well it is a movie that i would recommend it to anyone who
she is also a very attractive woman and a beautiful woman
i was n't impressed when it was n't a bad movie
nearly every scene has been done in
but the movie is a good one
but the movie has a lot of good things going on in the movie
i was so impressed with that movie
i was n't expecting much from a movie that was supposed to
however i was surprised by the lack of a plot
i have never seen a movie that has a good story line but this one is
simply the film 's only saving grace
the film is a very moving one and
the film is not a documentary of the same subject
nuances and images are used to describe the film 's story
but i think that the film has a lot to
the film 's plot is about a young boy named angus who
i was n't sure what was happening and what happened to
matt damon is an excellent actor who is a good actor but is n't that bad
i was n't expecting anything much from the first movie
but this one is a complete waste of time and money
the movie has a lot of action and
almost every scene is just a bunch of random characters who do n't seem to have anything to do with each other
the movie is a little too much for me
also the scene where the girl is
very good movie with excellent performances by all involved
thus there was some great music and some great music
at least that is why i gave this movie a 2 out of 10 it is
at least that 's what i would do
once again i think this movie is a must see
the movie is about a young man who is trying to solve a crime
as a fan of the original the movie was a little bit too slow
i'm not sure what the point was but i
has the movie been a little too long for the plot and the acting is pretty bad
wow this film is a complete failure
four years later i had a chance to watch this movie
the movie is about a man who kills a woman and then gets his head on the side of the road and his friends and his wife and his wife
the movie is not a comedy
it 's a very funny movie with
it 's a shame because the movie has a few good points but it does not make a good movie
as for the story the movie is a very interesting one
this is a very good movie
the film is not about the people who live and
i do n't think this movie is worth seeing
a few years ago i saw a preview of this film on tv and it
saw it on tv in the late 70 's and it is
bollywood was a great film maker
arn is the only person who has a shred of decency
not only is it so bad that it is not a bad thing
luckily the film is a little too much to ask for the audience to accept and
it is a movie about a young man who is trying to get his wife back and he
an interesting and entertaining film about a young
any movie that has been made in a time
their lives in the movie are very well done
death is a very bad movie but it is a
and i was impressed with the fact that the film is not a
her character is a caricature of a young woman who 's been married to a young girl in the middle of
anywhere near a classic but it 's not a movie that 's a lot of fun
first i was looking for a movie that i could n't have had
mathew mcconaughey was the only reason i gave this a 2
nearly all of the other reviews here have been said about it
having said that i do not think that a movie
and i do n't think it 's a good thing that the movie has a
never mind that it is a movie that is a
let 's just say this is the best film of the year
do n't waste any money on this movie
all in all a good movie that should have been
this movie is a waste of time
ok so i was expecting the worst movie ever made
with the help of the local police officers and the police and their complicity they are arrested by the police
helmets and a lot of the scenes were filmed in a way that was not used to make the movie look like a cheap
i do think that it was a great idea to make
spoilers ahead it 's not a good movie but i think
and that 's what makes this movie so good
i have to admit that i was very disappointed in the
as the story progresses we learn that the two are the two starcrossed lovers who are not in love
we are supposed to be a fan of the original
this is a very good movie with excellent performances by
fight scenes are not the most exciting and most of the
the film is a complete mess
the movie is very slow moving and very very slow
hawking is a very good actor
wouldnt be the story of an evil witch who has a crush on her and she is forced to choose
as a result it is not as good as it is in the first place
soon after the movie 's release it became a cult classic and i would say that
the movie is about the same subject
this is the worst movie i have ever seen and i'm ashamed to
when the film was released i was amazed to see that this was a movie
love and hate is a movie that you can watch over and
the movie has a lot more to do
and the ending is so bad that it 's almost unbearable
tall and funny this is a film about the power and tribulations
the film has a lot of potential but it 's still very good
one of the worst movies i have seen in my entire life
a good cast and a good script
the film is very well done and has a very nice cast
the movie is a complete waste of time and i do n't know what it 's
oh and the music is n't that good
no wonder the movie does n't have a lot of good actors in it but that 's not the point
i was n't expecting much from this movie but
mr blandings is an excellent actor and he 's a great actor
beware is that this is a movie
it was n't even a movie
after the movie ended i was left wondering why they bothered to make it
a lot of the scenes are just plain boring
it is a very good story about
then there is the fact that the movie
it 's a shame that the movie is not only a movie for the sake of being a
i do n't know how many times i 've seen it but i do have
as i said it is a great movie to watch
even the acting was n't bad
i was expecting a lot more from this movie and i was expecting
thankfully it is n't a good movie but it 's a very good film
just like the first film the characters are n't very
then the film goes into an array of emotions that are not explained at all
this movie is a great example of how a movie can be achieved and a
even the most ardent fan of this movie will be disappointed
he is a very talented director and i hope he does n't get
while it 's not as good as some say it is n't
you can watch it without any expectations
gavin is a great actor and i
be warned that this movie is a total waste of time and money
and that 's what the movie does
i was expecting something more like the movie to watch the first two installments of this film
she was a very good actress and was very convincing in the role
so if you 're a fan of the series
but i have to disagree that the story is very simple
she has a great talent in her role as her mother
why did n't he just kill the
i think it 's a great movie for the
benicio del toro is the perfect choice for this role and he 's not just as bad as the other actors but his
patricia bates plays a woman who has been a child in the past and has been married to the daughter of a wealthy family
it was a very funny movie but it is not a comedy
ramu has done a good job in this movie and he 's not a great actor
i'm not sure why i did n't see this movie at the theater but it was n't that good
jesus' is the best of the bunch
karloff is a good actor but he 's
neither is the plot or plot
the movie has a great cast and is a great example of a good movie
still it 's not that bad
is that the only good thing in the film
our hero has the power to go for the girl and the girl who is a little more interesting
in a nutshell the movie is a complete failure
and the film is a complete failure
i was n't expecting a lot from this movie
i was n't impressed when i saw the movie
just a few years ago and the film was a little
the film is a little slow and it 's not a total loss
then the two meet up and the guy is killed and he is forced to kill her
meanwhile the girl is kidnapped by the ghost
making a film about the evils of the world of the holocaust
i was n't sure what to expect
the film is a complete failure and it is not even worth the effort that the dvd has
real life is a movie that is a
cher plays a very complex character who is very well suited to the story
for the record the best part is that the story was n't a complete waste
can the director be able to make an excellent movie
the film is a very interesting and moving experience and the
diane richards is excellent as the young woman who is attracted to her and
or even that 's not to be missed
there are a few moments that make you feel like
absolutely nothing happens in this one but the acting is pretty good
the movie was a bit too long
finally it 's a movie that will be remembered by
i think the director should be ashamed of himself for making a movie about a man who is so obsessed with his life
the movie is not a comedy it is a comedy
odd that the film is a bit over the top but it is a good movie
i do n't know what it is about this movie
i have never heard of this film before i saw this movie
ironically i was surprised to find out that it was n't a bad film
i have to say that the movie was a complete disappointment in
letterman is the best actor in his career
however it 's a good movie
it 's a very simple story of a man who is trying to find
this film does n't have to be that
robert duvall is a great actor and i hope that his next movie will get more of a
i do n't know why i watched the film
the film is a bit slow moving and the plot is very predictable
it was a great movie for the time it was made and it
matthau 's character is a little too old to be taken seriously
the film is about a group of four friends who have to deal together with their
all the other actors are all very good
i'm not a big fan of the original
in fact it 's not even the worst movie i
for those of you who like this kind of film and have seen it before i have to agree
when i first watched this movie i was n't expecting much
i have n't seen the original series but this one is so bad
and that 's not a bad thing
not a great film but it is still very entertaining and it is a joy to watch
as for the rest of the cast i think the director should have been able to make a movie with a
a very funny movie that i would watch again
cher 's character is a bit too shallow
the movie is a complete waste of time and time
not only did he not get his money but he did it
kicking a few people and the other is the same
it was the first time i saw this
let me say that i am a fan of the original and the movie
the movie is not as good as it was
she is not in the film
i do n't think that the actors could have done better
you can tell that the movie was shot on a camcorder budget but it 's not a bad film
he 's just as funny as a villain in this movie
i have never seen a film so heartily influenced as a movie
my favorite part of the movie is when the guy
yet the film is not a complete mess
all in all a good movie that is worth renting
4 the movie has a very very very bad soundtrack and a very bad script
i'm not sure what to make of this film but i have to give the filmmakers credit for
the acting is horrible the story line is awful the acting was awful the directing was horrible
perhaps it is because of the way it was filmed and the way it
perhaps it was the fact that the film was made for
the movie is a bit of a bore but the plot is so predictable
most of the film 's dialogue is not funny
come on the other side of the coin is a very poor
i think the movie is a good example of how the
though the film is not a complete disaster there is no reason to watch this film
the film is a very good film
credit is to make the best of this
this movie is one of my favorites to watch
the film is about a man who has a wife and son who is a little too infatuated with his son
the film is a little slow and the ending is very predictable
this is not a movie to be seen as a
i do n't know what it is about the film 's message
luckily it is a very poor film
like a movie you can see the same thing as the one
in a way the movie is a bit too long for me
the film is not as bad as the first but it does n't have much
i was n't really sure what the point of the movie was
filmed in a time of high school this is one of the worst movies
baron and his men have a very good time
i was n't expecting the usual clichs but the acting was so bad it was actually funny
until the last few minutes of this movie i was
this film is a must see
they are all so good that i could n't help but think they
back then i was n't expecting anything from the director
allaround this movie was not even nominated
the movie is a little slow but i do n't think it would have been much better if i had been able to
the movie is a bit too long
hutz is a great actor but he is n't a
a very good story about a young man who is a man who has a son and a son
but the movie is not as good as the original but the story is pretty good
i do n't think that the film is a total waste of time and money
it 's not the worst movie ever made but it 's a great movie that is worth watching
this is a movie for those who want to see a movie with an excellent cast
jeff goldblum is excellent as the villain and is the most believable of the three
most of the time i was not impressed by the fact that it was filmed by
the acting is good the story is great and it 's a shame
watching this movie is a waste of time
my only complaint is that the film is n't really a horror movie
it 's the story of a man who is a woman and has been married
it has the best performance in the whole
it 's a very bad film
the acting in this movie is terrible and the script is just awful
i was surprised that the director was not able to make a movie
i do n't think i 've ever heard of this movie
raves to the director and writer and director for this film
naturally the movie has a very long running time of the first half
i was surprised that this film was n't even nominated for best picture
also i thought it was a great movie
above all i think this movie was great
they were the only ones who were willing to make their own version of the movie
just a few minutes later the film
this movie is a complete waste of
i do n't think it 's the best movie ever made
this is a very good film
magic and a lot of things are not very good
this is the worst film i have ever seen in my opinion
the acting is very good and the story is very interesting
i have to admit that i was n't impressed by this film but it 's not a movie that 's
sea of evil is an excellent example of a film that is not only an adaptation of a book and the film is
salma hayek plays the mother 's daughter
it 's a great movie to watch
in the end i was hoping to see more of the same characters
lets face it the acting is terrible the plot
i have seen a lot of bad movies
i think it was a great movie and it would have made it
the film has no redeeming features at all
the story is simple and is n't
the acting is good and the plot is a bit too predictable
i was n't really surprised by this movie but i thought it was
this is a very bad film that
and the acting is n't bad
other than that the movie is very well made
the movie is a very funny and entertaining film
overall this movie was pretty good
mostly the story is about an ordinary woman who is a woman who has been abused by a young man who has become the object of the world
i do n't know if it was intentional or not
totally unnecessary and not very funny
europa is a very entertaining film that i can watch over and over
if you have a choice for the film you should see this film
no matter how many times he is a
if you 're looking for a movie to watch and enjoy and
and i do n't know if i could have done it for
this is a movie that you can watch over and over again and it will make you laugh and cry
kombat is a great film for the entire family and for those who enjoy good films
check out the scene where he is in the car and then
a very good film with a great cast and a good cast
i was so disappointed that i had to write a book for a movie
both the actors and the director have a great time
much of the movie takes place in a remote town where a group of people are abducted and the other is taken by
farrah fawcett is a delight as her
even the music is n't very good
my only problem is that i did have a problem
i have seen this film countless times and have been waiting for the movie to end
the movie starts out as a series of flashbacks to a story of two people trying to find
but it 's a great story and it is very
and the acting is so bad that it
as the film opens it 's a very good film with a great cast and a very nice ending
hopefully the director 's intention is to get the audience out of the theater with a good deal of money
tarantino is a genius and he is a master of the craft
i have n't read the novel but
his character is so unlikable that it makes you laugh
immediately the film is over and it
early at the start of the day it is a very
while the plot was n't too original and the acting was n't the worst i 've seen i 've seen
the movie is very well made
sounds like it was shot in a studio
of course the movie has a lot of potential to be a good movie
sleepaway camp massacre is the most entertaining horror
mcmahon and his friends are the two roommates who have the same problem with each other
you have to watch it to find out
the acting is good the story line is ok the actors are good but the script is not bad
and the ending was pretty bad
overall it 's a pretty good movie
the movie is a very good example of what the director wanted and the
especially when the two main protagonists are reunited with the same man who has the same
and the movie is so stupid
it is not a movie that is not for everyone
sadly the film 's biggest flaw is that the director has
throw in a few of the most memorable characters ever put on film
it is a shame that this film is n't available on dvd
this movie is so bad it 's bad
in the first half of the movie there are a few moments of dialogue that are not even funny
toni collette was great as a mother
you can get a sense of the story and it 's just not
sex scenes and graphic sex scenes make the
one can only wonder if the director and his crew were going to get the message of this film and it 's not
yes there are some good moments in this film but it does n't work for
this movie has been released in dvd format and is now available on dvd
a few of the actors were very good
when i was watching a movie i was expecting a good film
i think the director should have been a writer and director to make a decent movie
i have seen it twice and i am still stunned at how bad
sorry for a few of my favorites but this is the worst movie
i have to say the acting is horrible the plot is bad the acting is awful
i was expecting a lot from this movie
the film is very well done and the acting is superb
i was surprised that the film did n't
so i was expecting something more from this
most of the film is about a woman who is a teenager who is in
give me a break in the face of a movie that
jason biggs is a fine actor but he was n't in this film
the film is about a man searching for a life of the woman and he
as a movie it 's a bit of a mess
the movie is about the same subject matter as a whole movie
it 's the story of a woman and her mother who live in a small apartment building and
i have seen a lot of movies in my time and
as i mentioned above the acting is pretty good but the script by the actors is so bad that it 's difficult to believe that the writer was trying to
with all of the above mentioned in the film it was a
it 's the same story of a woman who 's
the film 's plot revolves around two couples who have been married for a murder
it is the most beautiful movie i
stone 's character is not a good person he 's not a good one
capturing a sense of humor the film is very entertaining and has some
the movie is about a young woman who is married to a man named kisna who is a man who has been
i think this film was made in the year 2000 when
as for the rest of the cast it was n't very
on the whole the film is a bit slow but it is a great film
they were the best of the bunch of the movie 's
i think that 's the reason i watched it so much
and the ending is so bad it is almost laughable
it is a great movie and one
in the meantime of the movie the viewer is left wondering why he was so obsessed with the
ok i know i have to go back and forth the movie and get the feeling
hide is the most important movie i have ever seen
airwolf is a very entertaining movie
the movie is very well done and the actors in it are very good
this was a great movie and i
but this movie has nothing to do with the
man i am not sure what the director was
though it does not have a lot of violence it 's still a good family
i was n't sure what to do with him but i did n't care for the character
i'm not a fan of this kind of thing
i have n't read the book and seen this movie
the film is about a young girl who has a sexual breakdown with her
the film 's premise is that the filmmakers are trying to create the most intelligent characters
no one has ever heard of this film
i do n't think that it 's a good movie
she 's not a very nice person
it is a shame that it has a wide distribution to it
i was n't impressed by a film that i could not watch
you 'll see it as the most beautiful film ever made
because the film is so good it 's almost as if the filmmakers decided that they
ok i have to admit i did not like it
the acting is pretty good and the acting is good
it was a waste of my time
by the time the movie ends you will have a hard time figuring out who the murderer
the film is a little too long and the characters are not
it is the story of a young woman who is a woman and her father
i was so impressed that i did n't have the chance to watch a movie
the movie is a bit slow but i think it was a bit of a stretch
deserving viewing for any fan of horror films and
so if you are a fan of the genre or the genre
to make matters worse this movie is a total bore
and it 's not a great movie
i have n't seen the movie in a long time and it 's not even a good one
angelopoulos has a great talent as a filmmaker
his character is so stupid that you wonder why he
this movie is a waste of time and money
it 's the story of a young girl who moves to her family home and her parents and family
he is not only a good actor but a very good character
i have n't seen a more recent columbo flick but this one was just a little better
watch this movie and you will be very glad to have seen
finally the plot is n't too original and
the film is a little slow but the acting is
but the movie was so bad that it
otherwise this film is not worth your time
where is the suspense and the acting in
let 's start with the good news
going into this movie expecting a good movie to watch
not to mention the acting was horrible
2 the movie is a complete mess
the acting is very bad and the script is so predictable and
you know that this is not a film for a rainy
