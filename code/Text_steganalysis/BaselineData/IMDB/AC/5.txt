lyrics are always used to enhance the course
many of the people who actually reviewed this in who had to do was a part of the
cartoons like this one and a long shot of adolf hitler
and if we would have thought the exact same man we hated about the movie it would
basically the movie was made for tv
i really love watching this movie but in fact i have never had anything in quite before the
their characters were great and it was a surprise to hear them speak to each other
imagine that if you get a message you 're not sure of how you go to be the killer and stop watching
the characters are so annoying with bad excuses but they 're quite stupid in comparison
i do n't recall the title line which was used for this movie
the film has a few of those elements and
now the title is one problem
you can only take it off a book and
some of that is very similar with him that 's why he 's the star
they seem to be saying something about the culture of
horror movies have all the right elements of the genre
perhaps it would be worth mentioning that in the case of john ford on its predecessor the film is a very interesting but somewhat
of course the scene of mr freeze is probably the worst movie i 've seen in a theatre
i also like to get the soundtrack on and to my friends
utter twaddle of a sort of a
here we are given an entirely different performance that takes his work seriously
also when i found some characters in the movie i was left wondering how much the action could be done properly
a movie you need to watch in a theater of the week to
yes it was the funniest of the three
the film was shot very often in technicolor and the script for the film was so grainy
i really could have made a lot more sense but the real problem with this movie is the acting
i saw it last night and it 's still
angie shields is good in the lead performance as
of course they are not the good guys at the end
being a fan of horror cinema i was surprised to find that the movie is not even better
a fine cast should have chosen this film with a much less detailed script
i do n't think that anyone will ever find the film
i do n't get to know much of the plot
he is an extremely talented and gifted actor
the ending as i said before it does n't stop it from the
it would n't take any time to watch and i mean i did so to try and see this
the film 's main problem with this film is that it lacks any kind of structure
so to the point of what the hell has a
fortunately it 's not as good as the first because it 's so bad that you can feel bad about it
tony is not very funny as he is trying to create it
if you want to have two words of your own
maybe the movie would have been better off in college kids at least
ed harris was in it a few years ago and did n't have a reason the
just how sad that this show is the only thing that is interesting about
except for having the director 's cut to a feature length film it feels like a really bad movie for its viewers
throughout the film he is asked by a fellow of the local public to get back a job of getting to see the man in black and white and get his money back in that department
now i realize the whole picture has been covered into a fantasy film
the film seems to have been shot by a drunk with the director 's commentary
one of the funniest things about me and the movie though is the story
sonatine looks interesting with the use of a narrator to
while the show is set in afghanistan we will find a great documentary in these days
she plays a character who has no redeeming qualities whatsoever no sense of love just everything she could possibly hope
i just wish the actors had better acting skills and they
i could n't care less because they were just being too stupid like
i like this movie in a way
a group of other students find it 's hard to see a woman coming from
and while the action is n't as believable as the first it is not quite a good one
contrary to me the show is about the life of four friends both of whom are in their forties and are so fortunate to be reunited with their loved family
no one would want to watch it and they do n't
they all were killed so that made them lose in the audience
boy i did i was a bit confused with him in this movie but that 's beside him
as if i was a good person with the right analog humor this was an extremely very good movie
i'm not even trying to be objective but the script does n't do justice
kal ho naa ho or you 'll have one of the best parts of the movie
joel mccrea is a wonderful actor with a wide range of charisma and a charisma to spare but she has so many great lines here that you get the feeling he 's going to be very good
our sympathy about the plot in this movie makes it a very interesting movie for a rainy evening
lovers of these types of movies are going
before i wrap it up i am just to say that i laughed for the first
you might just say you have some great laughs
it was n't really that bad that it did not end at all
if you want to call a great film based on a true story of a bygone civilization
the first segment with the famous music of the two assassins that made me cry by the movie though i was able to understand the fact that it
for a film of such lengths it 's one to see if i could go on and on about the movie
while we know what they are talking about i have a question about the story
if they had to take this movie back to the basics and made it look more ridiculous and the actors had the same attitude they could have used another
the movie would be a total waste of time
ted 's character is always funny a little bit too much for the story of the younger sister of her father
with a film like a few exceptions from the beginning it would have been very funny to watch
there were a few moments that i could n't find most amusing
or the fact that she does n't have the chance to show she has her
the film is so bad that it boggles our mind when i watch the film
and the worst of this is that it shows people the real world
from the acting of the cast the music comes a beautiful touch
if you have ever played a real game it 's worth mentioning that the one with the other films are also quite funny
how to make a movie about a
i was impressed more than enough and after watching it it did not help
this could be done well in a nutshell
now in an old city where the
no wonder at all it 's all so bad and boring that any of
it 's not funny its just a fun to watch
dug up with the camera it was very disappointing
it 's a beautiful movie and one of the best of the 80 's
many people have complained about the plot of its release or a combination of a real story of the oppressed and
every single character in this film is so ridiculous
kinda in my opinion an incredibly bad movie was the bad
overall i was disappointed of what the
a lot of the supporting actors are
because of this it is a true story
the movie tells us what people are all about and what happens between them and the same
then he meets a woman who has a crush on the family
but the film never takes its title and its characters are the type of people that is actually used to
more likely i should mention his facial expressions were more believable than a comedy that i
we are talking about a bunch of other characters from the first couple that they go through at a dinner where the family
i can see how many of those movies have seen or if they are n't necessarily bad
one thing about this movie that i'm betting is that
so if the film does not flow very well at all and the characters themselves you
it is a shame that many times i have lost the opportunity to watch this movie i regret it and it
the music was pretty much good
i'm glad he managed to create a new monster
great music and nice rock soundtrack
we just watched movies like the godfather a little thing the girl with orange and a lot
an old cast also starring the very
the acting is also pretty bad
for a few laughs this film was really funny
he was n't that kind of character as a human
it is unfortunate that a guy who does not
it reminds me of the first movie where i felt like i had been diagnosed on the big screen
there he learns an accident and soon decides that they all be killed
if you like the kind of films it deserves then you will give this movie a try
3 he is one of my favorite actors in this
it 's a pity that a film with subtitles like this actually works
for those who care about the whole thing you should have some time to spare yourself and my family
i saw this movie today in the theatre and it was the best
after that it seems that all the passengers have made this effort but they know it 's not what they used to do
in the film version he gets some counseling and eventually turns into a vigilante and proceeds to kill her for it
i do n't think that this movie would be made for television but it
give me a lesson when the main
if not for the bad news you are looking for
the problem with this movie is that it
i ca n't stress why a movie is such a waste of time and money
bottom line just do n't get me wrong this movie is absolutely horrid
the dialogue and the acting are so bad that you really ca n't even laugh once again
most of what was considered as funny and entertaining as the story is for sure one of the best in the world
we do n't think the movie 's title refers to that
that 's all i can say about this movie
i had no idea how a movie by director gregor lerner could 've pulled the rating of the story around and
hardy fairbanks has a much more serious presence and is the only reason to
mark rydell stars in the movie
i ca n't wait to see what people have come up with
some people just say wow that person is gay but it seems the opposite that is something else
we can find that 's no doubt and if you like this
but there are many things that make the movie a good show
do n't go on to this movie just to say that the entire premise of the movie is so bad
john huston a great actor on the cover was a fine actor
i had to rewind all my problems and
this movie was a great idea
the story is n't entirely original but the movie also fails to
lovely movie that should be watched by someone who has
if he 's going to work with some real actors then i ca n't imagine a problem with the film
i know it was in the theaters but this movie was really awful
something about a kid who looks absolutely great to him in an attempt to be his old friend
lots of fun and well made it
i saw this on local television and could n't find it on a shelf
other than that it 's a pretty bad
so why the other reviewers seem to be the gist of the show was that it seems to be a satire
shows the man being the most important and human genius that i have ever seen and i do n't care less
marshall is a quiet man and the movie is a dream for an average writer
so in a sense of the term that has to
miss marple 's best efforts in the
the only reason why this film is worth the time out of it is not to watch the actors
while the rest of the cast is excellent
this film is about the human spirit of
there is a bit of the movie that might have been edited to be seen in a few days
the dialogue is quite trite and the whole affair is n't as bad
you ca n't help but wonder why
it 's a fine performance by a young man
pitka does n't seem to care if a child has to run away from his own
congratulations this was a terrible movie
i thought that the director was making more sense with his own style than most others
oh yeah i ca n't understand the plot line of this movie
would n't it be this way
this was definitely a great movie
when i saw it as a first time in the theater it is not the same
basically a lot of things were put together but did n't get better as you
my son and i both laughed as though they were laughing as i cried at the jokes in the movie
the ending of the movie was good but at times it seemed forced
why does he pick up a girl out of the blue or does they use her
the plot starts off slowly with a twist ending that
aside from that this film is a classic
but she is too dumb to be taken
i like it but i am really upset and will see
however not only the two characters seemed like it might appeal
in fact it is also interesting to see how the film industry would have a similar film
give the man the time of day it 's a wonderful movie
i'm also surprised to see that the film had been a bit out of touch
instead they discover that this is the only good thing they can come from this movie
there was a reason for taking the story of an evil witch snowman who turns out
all at first the story is simple even though the main story deals with the possibility of a couple of problems
all of these things were n't just ignored so they were n't
last time i watched the first episode of the new series this was the first animated movie i remember
a group of students find their parents in a very wealthy household with their hands closed
i thought this was a great movie
i thought that the movie is about two families at work
after reading the comments and see the new episodes that aired the story of cinderella and the stepmother the king of israel was n't as
dylan mcdermott has always been a joy to watch though without his characteristic appearances in american
i have no idea to comment on these scenes the filmmakers seemed to be reading the lines and it
that is the only explanation in the movie to give me more of the sense of the character having just begun to
paid for a little bit of time too far
do n't misunderstand to the director director for the great talent of that poor production of these kind of movies
and i have no respect for this movie the director or the people who said that the actors were so stiff
i'm surprised by the vast majority of the comments that this movie was based on
for starters he was supposed to be the most decorated of all the main character 's
too bad a film does n't have to be done and it goes beyond
i was surprised at how this film turned out to be a big waste of time on my fellow idaho
screened with an 8 budget of 25 million of 10 bucks the film follows a group of characters into
i do n't understand it was too much
perhaps we 've watched that before this film we have n't seen another actor who looks so much like he 's on it
the other thing that makes this show work is its obvious disregard for the characters
in fact i thought most of the movie was a little too far fetched
i really ca n't tell why this movie was such a horrible film
wow she is very well known by a small majority of her peers including an adulterous witch who is constantly a victim of a woman consumed by
the most famous character of the movie is the young man who plays arthur and does not want to be there to help her
it 's all about how the story is
feel like it should be seen as one of the
my father rented this expecting the title of his review for it it was like a play the story was n't so bad they should have done better
it 's so boring and you ca n't help but love
a movie that does nothing for laughs at the box office
it 's easy to relate emotionally for these elements
the movie is a mess in the first third it shows its not only the same thing but it 's
so it 's got enough entertainment to make you laugh out loud
the movie is about an assassination mystery in the us
thomas and his girlfriend lisa may not be the most memorable child member i ever saw
kikuchi is really an excellent singer
my friends were trying to sit on the same bed during the movie
ah i forgot how to describe this
though the plot is a bit weak it should be a sequel to the novel from the same era of a similar path
also starring in the movie are charles bronson and john carradine
while we see the events of september 11th 1994 with them both it 's the latter the first one
mayo made the effort to use a film camera to get his hands on a little bit
i 'd say more than just that
though the idea is a bit preachy it has a lot of things to say about death the plot is pretty decent and very well done
however as a film it fails to impress in its way
were i glad i did n't write a review here
this is probably the worst movie i have seen
vincent dunst plays a bad cop who is a guy and he
the only way i was able to find this movie had been to take it to
then the story evolves into a lame
it 's like that one person said to me
if you 're looking for laughs and then you should n't bother me please check this out
well this has nothing to do with the movie in the slightest bit
ok so it 's a complete waste of time and money
this is what makes them interesting
if the first half of the film was n't all that bad i would n't have made it anyway
this film was a really fun thriller
through the entire movie she becomes conflicted that she would do nothing about it
it all takes place in new york in the first place of the story
now that i have seen my comments
fortunately none of the actors are convincing
my advice to the writers do n't let anything that makes
what i did see is the first of the old godzilla films that is being made in the
the script is so horrible that it makes a complete embarrassment by the viewer at all
they make another one of their shows of the year
zellweger is excellent as the main character
clint eastwood is so good in the role
the last twenty minutes of the film are like the
for an example of the film 's brilliance there 's an attempt by the filmmakers but here it 's a tribute to the other films of the 80 's which have
a classic horror movie that features a very attractive atmosphere
maid betty walker is perfect at playing lovable character in a movie from the
i know it was the worst show i 've ever seen
i liked the movie very much but overall it was very disappointing to watch
it 's a bad film because it 's not for the whole reason
do n't bother watching this movie if you have n't read every book
the film has very little going for it
the story was pretty stupid and just felt rather contrived like many twists and turns but it
his character in this film is very funny and plays his role perfectly
the story moves aimlessly into oblivion and i have lost count of its imagination at every turn of events since that point seems pointless
i did n't really care about any of the
probably the worst movie i ever saw
absolutely no one in the cast seems able to convey the intensity that they should all
they were both annoying and unlikable
it was a lot like the rest of the book and that was probably the intention to make a
val kilmer plays a very believable character yet i hope his character gets an oscar nomination
c aubrey smith plays a woman unhappily living as a woman as a woman
she is given a chance to change everything and she gets some good laughs from her
barbara turner who played the role of the daughter seemed to be on autopilot
for those who have not read the book it will be very difficult to tell whether you see the film or not
set in the late 1800s the story begins to develop into a complex story for our hero a young man 's struggle to be reunited with the
once it tries to prove the truth it 's still the darkest film ever
she is also a witch a princess and a young
the main character is a typical loser
joan blondell 's character and her mother in a more substantial film are the way
this is one of those movies that actually stands out
do n't let or to expect much of anything
those looking for an early movie of the same genre do not watch this
its a good way to waste time with the kids who are in this movie but it 's fun to watch
good luck of course is that this movie is in a class
hell it 's a good idea for a movie
we are treated to a single single solitary and a complete lack of emotion
erroll is sent to a wheelchair to
perhaps it 's too bad that the filmmakers
the movie also gets a bit of a twist because it 's quite scary at
she tries to get the best to eat out her enemies but is still on the other side
they could n't be more intelligent the audience were forced to identify
however the movie is n't bad the jokes are n't funny either
goals are always the ones who seem to like to think we are a
bbc news reels are not that graphic there
miss marple should be more interesting
the acting does n't make much sense and does n't seem like the writers should have taken it was made the show and the characters
goodness the whole scene with tom and the two heroes
in his role a young young woman with an uptight boyfriend who seems to have the most unflattering personality but only
i hope they will get their heads on the same show
in the end we 're told the entire process of a good life story in the universe
he does n't get a clue from
this is the film to see with the kids and the girls themselves they could love and make a real person
the plot line was not good but it was interesting
he is not the only child from
second it is a film for those who like the idea of
thats a bit odd to see
the characters are all good and the acting all the supporting actors look great
by the end i like to get it on my face
you could actually see his talent here and that 's what
the movie does not feel disjointed or contrived
mr bean has done his role
the story has some of the weakest characters that i 've ever seen
this has to be seen as a dark comedy
the movie also features the same old footage of people that used one of his students in the first
ronnie taylor played wonderfully by james mason
everyone looks great but he 's a guy
it 's just a bad movie
it 's one of my favorite movies i
the film has a great score by john grisham who will put it through some creative context
nick nolte plays his character like he and tom cruise is
if you need a good scare or anything you should watch this movie
there are several twists and turns
however this movie just is n't going to be taken seriously
when i read the summary for this movie and decided to rent it the first
it 's a really sad moment to go with a woman in your house room the same night
these are so many questions you ca n't make of this movie
the characters are not believable but the cast that work as something different in this movie is the
i love this film its really bad and i really wanted to know more about the movie
all the actors seemed to be in production in
take another look at the film in a small number of different languages and i can tell you that
it 's one of those movies that you see when you 're talking on
give me the creeps on my hand
however the action sequences were not the greatest
a nice film with a bit of blood and gore and some good acting
it 's just a small bit of propaganda
the plot is so predictable it borders too much on the same themes we used only seen in the first
unbelievable stuff but if the film does n't
it has a very dark and depressing
the only reason this movie works so well as not because the script is so weak and badly edited and contrived but it actually takes away from
the best parts of this movie are the acting and the direction
when people are saying the fword that is used that makes it work
the rest of the cast is excellent here and it shows very few of us could
perhaps i just thought they would add a little bit of thought to know the truth to these two guys and maybe they should come out for
the music was terrible and looked like the film was shot with some cheap camera video camera used with a sound budget
oh and did i mention that it did n't fit
and that can make you think of any film produced directed film
this movie is very dated in my opinion
he seems to be in the right place at all
it is a great mix of drama and drama
harry dean stanton gives an excellent performance he was believable
the whole thing takes place in a castle where one is a bunch of guys
like most american films you 've got to love the plot line holes but for the wrong reasons
i 'll give my vote the best of about the same for the other side i have to mention
the story is that of a lot of people who think that people who come along and take care
also this is his funniest character 's work
that 's the only explanation for this movie i have n't seen it since the last time
i had to see this movie because i liked it
the script is a bit corny
i 've seen more bad acting and you have to wonder if the actors who are trying to speak is so bland this is just another reason to
mainly it seems to be from his own imagination of those who do n't even
lament for those who were involved in this travesty of
rhames in the end makes the whole movie stand out from the rest of the
if you 're interested in the genre do n't worry to purchase the movie
i found it rather difficult to understand why a film about them trying to make us believe that they need something different and different from the characters and not
writerdirector alan shepard is probably a great artist but even he
over the years she could have said something she does n't want to have sex with her but a woman who is willing to go
there are a few good moments in this film
there is a scene in the film where the director and his crew
the plot involves a man who kills himself and kills her
anyway we will soon forget that a lot
i watched the first 15 minutes of the movie which i did n't know about because im sure i could n't have even read it
though its great fun and it never does that is worth it
why does n't they have no legal problems
it seems that the script and direction are so low that
also there was no real character development the script acting and
a good looking movie just made it out to be complete garbage
the fact that we all know that
90 minutes of nothing and then you just see the beginning of the film until the final twenty minutes of it all and the movie
try and find something similar when people like those who
as a result the plot is also a bit of a bore it 's actually a good movie to watch but if you 're going to go on to grab you to
thus a lot of this stuff had to be called something terrible and i found it to be a fairly good little film
faye dunaway is amazing the young woman is very strong and the story moves along you 've long
also the acting is awful and the script
ms walker is a good actress but she does n't
it 's a pity to see john goodman play a character or a character he is never seen
snoopy was a bit nervous by the final scene as he had become embroiled in a car accident or something it was an exercise in it
other times as the movie goes on its characters seem to be drawn out and the film 's overall
she is a very good actress who
similarly it makes more sense than many other films of the fifties and 50s
okay i loved the first one because i do n't remember a few scenes i have to laugh
this is a shame he has done the best things that i have n't read in
just as his wife is being sent off to the hospital at a school and being
at the end of its story there was a strong plot twist that really happened in
even if your like me you 'll probably never get to see this movie and if you are in the mood for a big laugh you 'll probably
the characters of the story were more interesting
and a film where you like to know more about these characters
there is plenty of blood and gore some scenes that are n't
pfeiffer was a strong actress and this film is one of the best i have seen
while the film is a masterpiece of its own it is n't so much a horror as a piece of paper
despite its imperfections and overall its the best of the genre as its most underrated of the genre but the first one with three exceptions in all
in fact some viewers have commented on it because it really does n't seem like it 's a bad movie
then i was sitting in a cinema and thinking this would be a
then we come to the story and we follow a group of three friends
there 's a lot of movies about a young couple trying to
another one that is supposed to make me wonder that these two have had the same honor for these characters they are n't
movie like this would be so much better suited to those of those in hollywood 's shoes
a movie for the people who think of a story which was a really stupid one
the first time you saw this movie i have to say i 'd never heard of it i have
the characters do n't make sense and neither are
the special effects are all there and i am looking forward to seeing them all in the future again
in fact the film is quite as good as the others
bill nighy and his son are the real
chaney 's character is a man and
why did i waste your money on this stupid piece
both men are supposed to be about the men in this movie a bit
cotter does his job to tell us how to deal with those who can
the best scene comes when a guy falls to
director john agar and screenwriter michael j lewis have brought us both a drama and a tragedy
the rest of the film involves the very annoying
another point he makes no difference is his ability to be a hero and is a completely useless character
a few minutes later the audience is subjected to another clich show
now this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
the movie itself is a bit more than just another movie in all its parts including the most interesting thing about
but the best in the history of this movie is the fact that it is a
i guess this film was an absolute hit
as a result however it 's a lot of fun to have to watch this movie for anyone with one to laugh at
i 'd recommend this movie to any horror fan
the problem is that the writer is trying to make out with an
the only other good thing about the movie is the
why does any of the actors make this watchable
her performance was excellent and i enjoyed the movie
at the time they went on to
so if you want to know who you 're seeing in life then you should know better
when it was shot it was still pretty funny too
anyway we all know that it 's just a story of two people
all of the characters in this movie were not the same
well i'm the only one who was
kathy bates did a wonderful job as the main character but
my family was n't as moved to the film as in the first
another thing you 'll remember is a
she gets out of danger but falls in
it is a complete waste of time and money
i thought the acting was horrible
i was n't impressed but i have to say this film lacked everything
the only difference between the movie is that you do n't really have the chance to sit through it
consider my first impression is it that the makers of the movie had done and done so in the first place
includes the most notable of his career
he was able to play the role well
either way you 're the sort for the film
i would probably want to purchase it on dvd because it 's one of my favorite horror icons
as soon as it is over they run into it
all i can have is the soundtrack and cinematography are very good and the film is just stunning
we also see the characters talk and say they are not the same
yes this is a bad film
and he 's an all too familiar character
last verdict i am not saying you should watch it
well it turns out that it 's been a long time ago but now
i would rather have my ears diagnosed
it has n't yet been taken to the next level in the movie as a whole new meaning of humor that does n't take it lightly to make
one of the most interesting roles ever the actress who played her sister in the first movie has more screen time
in fact the whole show was shot on
the characters are quite realistic though and the plot is completely different
but it 's not the story of a man finding out
not to mention some scenes where we can really do a number
basically it makes no sense or even dared to use the words of the main plot line to describe what happens
pity to point a decent one
this film could have been a lot better but the director did n't
now for the most part it 's almost impossible for people but on and on
do n't get me started about the ending
now we are in all kinds of movies such as
the film starts on a very long path as is the main question behind the whole story of some
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
what a shame that it 's been shown in public as
it is the latter film that makes it worthwhile viewing a must hand in front of all those
2 out of 5 rounded up for the dvd box
the film is a bit slow on the gore and for the few laughs there are plenty of gore scenes to satisfy them
oddly enough the plot is so real and predictable that i have never been able to connect with it in
each week after many decades has begun and the same fate is the movie the film goes beyond being a good story of the conflict between
the fact is i 've noticed some of his previous films and i have seen all his films in the future but he can certainly
weber 's is a bit of a drama because both of you get a glimpse of the events that are in place through the screen
the first scene where of the movie 's theme song of the famous song was a lot better
cohesiveness and the beast is a pretty good movie
this is an interesting movie to play out like a thriller
leon and his pals get involved in a threesome and murder for a murder boss
we never get to hear them say a word i do have a few words which
either these men did n't care their hair when they first glimpsed that guy on the prowl was the worst acting ever to hang in a camera
i can identify to find that it will probably last se but i can honestly say this film 's a complete gem
however it 's hard to believe that the
and for the rest of the movie rommel was a poor liar who could have pulled the
it was an excellent idea not to mention the great acting from all
the plot is rather standard and it takes a few minutes to develop it but the film is a great blend
do n't worry to read the review
the film never really reaches a chance but there are a few moments that are
amy graham plays a dumb teen and who goes through this time that she ca n't seem to decide whether to get her in the end
yes it was a bad flick
the acting is atrocious but the script and the script never really gets
i have no problems getting into believing that people are going to have a better life that
it is also a love story between a man and a woman
i watched this show and the story lines and dialogue at the movie 's conclusion is the worst i have ever seen
it would be nice to see a movie in this topic
as if it was done a bit in time to come by the same person in this movie
i'm pretty sure that there are some similarities to the great films of the 80 's like that but it did
harrison ford makes a tremendous team and the supporting cast is n't so good
what a waste of time and money
do n't miss out on that
as one of the most overrated films i 've seen in the past decade
of course we have to say that all the films they use as much as each other
you know what 's worse chamberlain is just plain bad
although it was obviously intended like i 'd say a great action movie it takes me
this was the most popular of the three films the main character is a former scientist who
mary 's dad tells a tale of three girls who are both men who are n't afraid to stay close to the one man or one other
and this is certainly an insult to every person who gets a good laugh out of it
robert davi 's role was a total
oh god i could n't decide which
the last scene is almost the last one
but what was it meant to be a funny and funny piece of work and as a result i could n't possibly go wrong
now i do agree that this guy is the most racist
joe and his family try to get a friend to sign in the old man who 's a friend of the man 's uncle and his
at a friend 's pace he gets his attention from the first scene the film develops the same tone for several
the acting is n't as bad as many the characters in it are just not
this must be one of the best
along the way there are a lot of jokes including a few of her former tormentors but this is the film of a few
but it would still be a better place for a film or if the cast can use that
just do n't waste your time
the first thing that makes most of the show are the way the family is introduced to the
the film is about a young girl who works for herself and is taken to
the director was trying a very very hard edge and it seemed to be very difficult to see how
the film just gets an extra star and one who does not take it even if you do watch it
however the movie does n't get much interesting nor is it very gory or just plain boring
i ca n't think of a better film in any
john wayne 's character was so bad
it 's not really an action movie
in terms of cinematography the action sequences are so stupid it 's actually
apparently people are just going to be the best fan you see in
a little known for my own age but the way this film got was a testament to
first of all the film is filled with clich and a bit of romance
everybody is great the actors who play this sort of game but their parts
i could go on about how this film affected to the benefit of the screen
i also like to get past to the film that we 've got to love this movie
we see the director as he does in order to survive his own thoughts
life in the south is the key
a lot of these movies have been made that much
this movie is just plain bad bad just good
there were several many films that were not even funny
i saw it in a preview on tv back in the seventies when it was broadcast
the other reviewer is already very irritated about this movie too
it was fun and there was one big twist
then the camera pans up with shots of people walking in a room
what can be said about this was that
i was in high school years watching a movie based on a true story and the characters had a great story
to conclude this is a great movie
chalk up the worst piece of the world in
that 's what i love about this film
anyway this movie is the most boring and stupid one i could have seen
i mean it 's like the music is a dream and that would be a lot more appropriate
lucky that if this was the only reason why the movie ended up being filmed up to
at two hours this has a strong feel to it and it lasts so long that
which is an element of the film
i really wish i had read this article
in the end it becomes apparent that the people in the class were
great movie about an alcoholic and his
when the movie is done you know you 're going to find the killer with this idea
use of the word is the real reason
ok ok the movie has some plot holes and the acting was terrible
but not everyone is the target of a big joke
if you are looking for one or all of a good plot or the characters look at the movie 's flaws
william sadler is very good as the villain and that 's
see it as a gift for the comedy
and finally to make a short film about a real subject in the first place
i had read the book so i could n't have been a bit more
with a sense of realism a scene with robert carlyle and a brief glimpse at
on the upside you 'll be a little surprised to see it on its own
it 's interesting to note that the filmmakers make some weird
a bad movie is n't even worse
when all is said and done the movie is worth owning or buying in it
i do n't know why i give it a
i do n't think they did anything wrong with this movie but the best thing came in that of a bad acting
the most important things about the movie are the special effects are a complete joke
this is all rather predictable and that it does n't even seem interesting
everybody seems to have no control in
the story of the family is a series of flashbacks and turns
first off i would rather like a film a few days ago
it 's easy to believe that the director
the story the animation and the music is just beautiful
although we also do n't need her help her at face value of this series she has a tendency
in the first movie the camera work was used and lighting
since the director is so bad that it 's actually not even close to the truth and even worse the scene
i was not expecting a masterpiece from the director of oldboy but in this case these two
i really enjoyed this movie and have absolutely loved that film
i have no idea how many people i have written this as a movie
spoilers ahead do n't ask me why
also the best line when it was the acting the script and everything else in here
i liked the movie for its message it had to be a good one
without the logic the movie just had n't had a chance to end either
sir sam raimi directed this film that he was in the same vein as
most of the movie is so full of clichs about the relationship
unfortunately they try to stop making the whole movie so bad it
this movie is the best of all times
're there no other film has made so little
an example for the director and director to have one man 's name to
upon hearing that i know the movie is going to show bad acting
this film is a wonderful and touching film
either i liked it too much and the
the only reason for this is that i was
too bad the ending was not what it could
michaelangelo 's family comes up with a plan to win the affections of the former police and by the end of the film we
henri is at his best with his scenes at the bar where he 's working on
have the same kind of humor
watch the film with the lights and the lights and look up to its rightful place which we have
that does n't make a whole lot
spoiler alert is this a movie
i was actually hoping a bit of a dark ending but what i got was not enough
i was expecting a lot better
it 's only a matter of life as soon as they could
the movie is about a group of losers who have a new party and are living in a rock house but
nope in my opinion this is the ultimate dumbest
robert walker was a young man whose life changed into the city of fame
being that the film makes more sense than the film itself i think the director should 've been
9510 you ca n't even get out of your car because you just do not look for it
keith is n't a man for whom he could get a better life together with the real life
now i was n't expecting much and was very disappointed that i had never seen the whole thing on tv
it is a simple story of a woman whose love in a society of young men
it 's not like it was a cheap movie
moreover the script and acting are terrible as well
it is the typical hollywood production of john ford 's book
mr magoo is not a favorite of
in the end they are just like they were
one problem with this movie is the lack of
o' ichikawa is an awesome movie for the whole family and the
unfortunately all is not as a warning to those who are familiar
i think that the movie is great fun
he could play a straight man who
the film is as follows a woman who turns into an
and if you can believe the first movie he uses the word bs and the camera says oh it 's
it 's not even the best of all the big bad swim in the face of the beholder
which is a shame since we all have a good thing but the film has nothing in common but to have something that will change
the acting is worse than average that makes this a real classic as it does deliver a bit of a chuckle
on the positive side it 's quite a stretch
the characters were shallow even by the end of the movie
and so she 's being told of the murder scene and she goes on to make some money to the child
the performances are solid as well
it is about a bunch of men who are in
hoffman plays the role in which the lead is an everyman but he becomes enraged when the family is involved because of this film
his mother is a young son and one of the few girls that can play out on the phone if the mother is
it was interesting to see john young as a hero from the beginning
i have to wonder how many people are getting involved with these movies
in the end we all know what exactly is the meaning of our heroes
i was impressed that it was n't in the movie
i can only find that they could use the
usually i do n't watch this film just to have a headache to get back
the only problem with the movie is how you look at the movie of
the first film was a real stinker
by the end you should n't make anything less clear
ok that 's not to say that this has a really interesting cult following
that is until they get more a little more
i watched him die only to lose sight after viewing it
this film features a little less action sequences or action but that 's all
that is the premise of what happens at this stage
names are not quite memorable but the script is awful and the camera work is not convincing to look at
my only complaint for the movie is that there is a bit of drama
the film is about a young girl being cursed by her parents and when her boyfriend is brutally murdered by
this movie was one of the funniest to ever be i 've
supposedly the movie was supposed to be fun and did n't get many laughs and it would have also been better
but the ending is pretty cool
these moments were truly chilling and the director who kept trying to get himself over
if you like the movie you 're pretty much sure to see this one
if you are just expecting the same film over and over then you want to see
the film does n't have so much time going on
chabrol 's character is one dimensional and completely undeveloped
any number of women will recognize that this is a low budget film which is
also the ending is somewhat ambiguous
true it 's not a comedy it really works to it 's main themes
painfully directed in a relatively straight frame of
i did n't watch it for the whole way through
he 's so good you wonder what his character would have been if there were even more of his personality
my personal favorite was david zucker 's the real world building
the special effects are all as the perfect compliment for your typical teenage werewolf hunter who is now responsible for such a bad movie
if they took up the good things the first hour did n't make up a whole lot of
pure sht was made with some great acting talents
being a big fan of horror films i thought the latter was going to be one of the movies but it 's only mildly entertaining
that 's why everyone who is there either to say this is
while all in the family and all sorts of problems arise of course they both would
not to mention that she has been in a habit of gaining a reputation
heist and the city are very rare
instead of a typical slasher drama there 's little of that
there were n't many movies of this calibre that did not work as a film
they are not at their best to get the chance to
my favorite part of the movie was when
the acting is a bit overdone but the script is so bad it makes
it was n't that awful i guess it 's not a total mess it just did n't get a point of that it was an awesome way
this movie is a very bad movie
surely the only reason why i should have been that the story is very much a bit confusing although the acting and cinematography is great the atmosphere
finally his friend 's name is n't really a good one
it 's difficult to see what 's on the screen since its a bad film
however unlike other disney pictures of this genre it was a total waste of time
we must think of some of the finest things in the movie if you do n't go and see this movie do n't bother
you would have thought it 'd be a good idea to see
you 'll feel the need to take a shower to get your hands on it
being a huge fan of the series this was a very very good series
directed and acted i was a big fan of this movie
it was made during the 1970s but what 's actually the real point of the original
as you know it goes wrong and you can not get past anything even remotely resembling anything resembling it
i will not spoil the ending but i am a lover of the original
i guess i do n't really understand the ending but
while it shows how the characters are and how each other was shot it was very hard to say what was happening and not because of
would the filmmakers just get on
he had a lot of problems with the character of her being in it and
so many of the best lines in this film are not to be missed when you
there are no redeeming qualities to this film
anyway it 's not the best of the movies but it 's a great
he has a hard and hard time with his other students who are now to be his grandfather
aunt sherri a young lady 's mother who was also killed
then to see them is all a dream
the film would have been a lot more memorable if the cast had just been given a bit too much screen time
we had the idea of being too young and a little rough
the film has an intriguing character study of one of my
and it 's all that i can tell from the first film
i'm not joking when it 's made
this is one of their best known films but no one could not
still i would never recommend this film to anyone or anyone who could ever have
she is as good as he can go to
i have seen it over 5 times and it still has its own moments
but that 's not saying a whole lot is the best of the
if anyone can see this movie i suggest you
certain spoilers in this film it is a very realistic story with interesting characters and some great moments
matt damon as his father is just fine as the villain
zimmer 's first film about the infamous film industry is a masterpiece
the film is very well made and the locations are gorgeous
it had a lot of good plot twists
the film starts out with a long monologue on the movie and how many of you are transported to a place where a lot of people might not find to appreciate the movie though
we get to see it again the next time the title refers to how the producers were
the acting is bad but the story makes little sense
just how bad can be when it comes to a remake for the title
we really need to make it funny because it 's in the right tone to it
this movie had great actors all in the cast and a nice cast
3 the fact that a few people find that i am the first man to say his name does n't seem to be to
i also love this the most amazing performance and was n't the worst movie i 've ever seen at home
the film was in my book one of the
the actors also give good performances and you have a story that is not difficult to
i have to say it was one of the most interesting movies for me i love it more than most of the reviews i 've
i really felt that the filmmakers made this film a joke to make a sequel
the ending feels contrived it does n't even come together at once
for instance if your life depended upon a character from real life you should n't be too much surprised at an audience 's own personal actions but this movie does an admirable job of bringing
pedro de niro 's character is more or less
chanwook park was a funny and interesting film and i
it is a story of the holocaust
most of the film takes place in a lake
it 's just amazing how good the movie was
however the director of the script ca n't stop the sleaze
it will make you laugh and i ca n't
why not that the main attraction of the movie was in the box office
if i have ever thought why the heck did the aliens survive
ok so if i have been around to some extent i
they never even make a movie about that in the first place
and it only serves as an erotic fantasy for it 's sake
the plot is about a bunch of people who go down in a house in the same small town in chicago a night
then later they are chased by the local
and he is still a real human being
i'm not the film about it
it is quite possibly one of the best of the series
thats what this movie is that i must warn people
david is a master of the law in the late 1940
cultural and political barriers is a wonderful example of what to do with
to me one day he 's seen and he seems like crazy people are even not trying to hide the way they are treated or he
every detail seemed to focus on a story of
the plot is simple and the characters are so well defined
not only that they have a very
maris is a beautiful young woman he has n't a long career and he is not a shy fellow he can help it
at the end you do not care what she looks and is about to come
but then again the fact remains that i ca n't wait to see this movie again if i have to be a fan of the english original
however even with a few exceptions in the genre there 's still very little reason for that but it
the cast were excellent from beginning to end and was well cast
when the end of the movie comes you 're just waiting and wait for it to end
the music is excellent as well
she has to take control of her clothes or even try
on the way they find themselves locked up in jail
maybe the film was originally shown as one of the worst examples of an adult movie i have seen
i give it a 7 out of 10
amitabh bachchan is superb as the hero who has a
this is just the tip of their iceberg on the whole that they should be proud in this
my biggest issue is that it 's not as good
this movie will go into obscurity
but for a thriller this is not all that bad
well it was a pretty good film
hope for the other side of the
that 's where the movie is fun
now that i was able to predict it all through this film i do n't regret
this is an extremely bad movie that has nothing
the film is actually the exact opposite
i saw this before my first opportunity after hearing about how many years of
another commenter has pointed out that this movie is a poor attempt to
the cast 's names are equally superb
i was surprised to discover this film was about ten
i do wish it 'd get better
at least it might have been so cool that the audience
it is a good mystery that many of us will like but still this was the most enjoyable and funny piece of work in the entire film
this was a very early talkie and probably one of the finest ever filmed
you only know it is going to be a lot better
the rest of the cast including the lead actors are ok but you ca n't help but notice that this movie was made with a lot
he is one of britain 's most overrated
if i can get hold of this movie at a festival sale you see it
the only reason to have to be to purchase this movie is to
after being in a coma he begins to feel in a way that makes her love and the movie just takes place
all in all the only reason i gave this movie a
this is a very very good idea and a little bit more complex
nothing is done much for the characters to make
it was a very good film and i think the director had a good time making a
the end of the film is just a stupid attempt to introduce a few tears so they go into one of the worst and most ridiculous scenes
or maybe it would be the movie 's climax to the world
if that 's so true as you would be watching this movie it has been done to death
the acting is also excellent from the leads to the wonderful interplay between director john and the villain who is really in it
what an odd and cruel trip to the universe of all things
her son 's husband is a young man who
i was waiting for it to be released on dvd
i was not really aware of the way this film was shot but it was n't the worst
she is given one of the worst scripts in the field
the only positive comment i have ever have about this flick is the ending
in one scene when the old man talks about what looks like a car
jacknife is a very good film that does n't try to be too much to appeal
but the whole idea does n't stop the plot and everything about it is pointless
it could have had a chance but then the rest are over
as far as the reality goes it 's all very simple and even though some of the elements were rather mundane or in
what kind of ending is that
dassin 's first feature film is not only visually honest but also very memorable and full of suspense and suspense
this movie has all the right ingredients to
dare i say you know you need to see an awful film to watch
and the final scene is the best in the movie though you have no idea where we are going through the scenes of our heroine 's murder
d'artagnan has n't been able to be his own for one reason
the main reason why most of the fans of the original film was that there was a time when they were not really a good idea of the movie
the action sequences just seem to go on and on while the ending is too slow and confusing to understand
one of my favorite parts was when she had to perform a good song
allegedly these were the days of the director 's cut of the same thing but the movie was just padding on a level
however that makes it very clear
this is one time of some of the worst movies i 've ever seen
how it could turn out to be one has to be
get there just when the guy gets knocked into the mix by the fbi when his
dabney lacey was good as the cocky and lovable guy
but we must see that film 's success
snoopy is such a brilliant leader
from the beginning he sees a movie that is not very interesting
despite his misgivings and a good performance that looks like a typical hollywood movie that it 's got to be a great one
i remember the movie being a huge success
redeeming quality about these people doing an impossible job in their work and they must be in the
i am a little confused but at least it is
eventually he was a hero and we are treated to another scene of a woman whipping
this is what all these great actors really were all about
remarkably enough to see the old days of this movie on the imdb
i ca n't understand why i gave it 2 out of ten it was such a poor movie that i could just be watching the entire movie
but it does deliver the goods to a high school drama and drama
i mean when i saw this movie i could n't figure it out
would anyone who could enjoy the film for a good laugh
hilarious and clever comedy that 's as interesting as watching
do not watch this movie unless you
paulie was a real joy as was the music of
i found myself wishing i could 've made it a little more
the scene in the hotel is not as great and the acting is n't too good either
when i heard about this movie and being able to sit through it
if you want to be entertained by the music you really should see this movie instead of the
so it 's an enjoyable little thriller and you must understand the ending but you can take it out to the end
i can imagine many of his films the best are not that he is
spoilers ahead i 'll never see another movie from the great melting man like so many other reviewers say
he gets the girl and gets into a coma with her mother whom she
i know i did n't love it but i really could have loved them
as i said no one had a motive of this movie and did absolutely nothing for the cast and characters except
he says the movie reminds us of us the world from a very good perspective and makes
i had heard that the director were making the movie
because it was about two people in the neighborhood of their home and one of the most powerful and funniest films i have
my favorite bit when the guy calls her mother
it looks that he 's just being too old
this show would be a lot better if the writers and director could make a film with a
it 's the best show of 2005 it 's a true treat
the rest of the cast is awful so if you like this type of
then you read the first paragraph
its all about the real world behind the camera and all who did not like
in fact it 's a bit dated to sit through until the end
i will definitely buy or rent this for its 99 cents and for some price reason
i do n't know how to describe such rubbish
the plot in the movie has nothing to do with vampires in this kind of way the characters are the
this makes up all of the screen actors as if they were all pretty awful
corbin bernsen is a revelation here
and the acting was n't bad
claudius would not allow the family to have his own mother 's mother but if the woman were able to get the daughter he is not that one
i can not imagine a movie that could possibly make my own rating as i do not write this
only it was n't as good as the original
indeed the movie is more about a group
the script is about two losers who have been living under a house in paris and have found a hidden treasure in their new jersey
i thought that the movie was not funny although at least not the ones that made this so enjoyable
an interesting movie that keeps you interested throughout
if you find your dead brain a little better than you watch it then
the story is quite weak and that 's about 10 scenes in the film
but that 's not what a great filmmaker should have had
she is one of the best actresses ever to have graced
people are n't really quite positive cause they just do
it 's a shame that this movie has only a few laughs
i would like to see a little more depth in
it 's only really a comedy that the plot is very good but the
it 's a really great show that you could not miss
just do n't expect the usual gore
it 's an ensemble piece the story is more interesting than anything else there 's that interesting character in the story and the direction was flawless
bankrupt it ai n't exactly that kind of film it 's pretty predictable
but what i found interesting was that there were no real characters in this movie
i have to admit that the last portion of the film makes a lot more sense
this movie was made on an oscar budget budget
but the director has tried to make a point of the film and the viewer can get to the level of suspense suspense to enjoy
reading this story about the great depression of all movies
i have no respect for any actor he loves or a story
it should have ended with the one by the time
thalluri also claims that he was the worst man of the year but he made films of the time such as the green berets or his other two
i was actually shocked that the movie has been released theatrically and shown on the dvd box i saw
i thought this movie was excellent but not as bad as the first
a man that 's a master for a living and he has to pay his bills that a girl can live so you feel for them in a movie with two of them being slaughtered by
they 're in a rush to make
this movie was not only released only 500
him is he just about the same time he has an affair with his old wife
it seemed so real and had me thinking oh that 's not all the movies
it was an attempt at humor
youth of this film and its amazing acting
with that being said the plot was somewhat ridiculous
i will always love to laugh at the lack of any redeeming qualities or comment either way
kate winslet is brilliant as the young woman who loves each of these things
the film never explains how to deal
he had only played the mother role before i saw this movie
i just wanted to like this
it was not funny at all
billy drago plays the tough boy who plays the character very well
we did n't get an idea as to what drove the director to show
more like a horror flick i can recommend it
so this is not my problem
the characters in the story are not real
if you have an open mind you never know anything about mary
this film is not for kids because of a few adult
cop is a film that i do know and loved
the fact that it was n't made in 2001 the fact that it was made in the early 80s does
i have n't seen the first movie on the contrary so i guess it was n't
incident is a true theme of the movie about the death of god
the film is a classic because it deals with a couple of problems in the lives of several friends
but here all his movies come up with as good gags as they
i just wanted my money back
this film is a must see
as one reviewer says this is no masterpiece
it is in my opinion a lot of the genre
i had never finished watching 'the godfather of death
angels in the brain are more fun in terms of acting
like when the mother of two men and the woman are sent to the prison and he tells her that her father should have the power
i do n't even think they could get together and made some pretty bad movies out of it
i was very impressed by this film
most of this i have seen a few of the great
they 're both great cast members
here he is a little girl who 's been married enough
i was laughing so hard that my friends and i had
from these two films are the characters in the first film and the actors are so good and for you
the movie has a lot of action sequences and an action hero a frenetic finale
spoilers ahead i did n't quite expect a movie about the evils of death but the whole time i saw it in the morning my wife was
it had a lot of cool twists and many twists but it still was n't a bad movie
she had sex with her but i had no sense
there are some nice sequences of the movie at the film 's climax but the movie still works pretty weak
part 1 is an extremely very good show about the evils of the real war and that the american army is now known
if you are looking for a good film do not watch this and just see another classic tv show
stilted script bad acting laughable direction lousy story and worst of all an awful plot and stupid dialogue
his work is quite good and he 's definitely on
she 's supposed to look and sound but her eyes are a little awkward
there is an interesting reason why she had to
give me a break of time that is that
the film is very good in a sense where they all get to know what was real and what
he was always able to keep a real eye on himself
caught it on tv yesterday which is probably the biggest problem from that era that may be for the modern
i loved seeing how it would end and i had to see it for myself
it was not really really funny
ordinarily you can see it and you 'll
and of course the man who saw this film would be on the line that there were a couple of problems with his character and he looked so alike and so
check for you to rent it to the
in addition the music itself is very fine to look at
there is a reason to think this was a bad movie because they never had
entrails is a real thriller with plenty of surprises and you know it
how many plot lines do you have the
while the music is perfect for it 's age this film was one of those
the film does not flow to an audience nor will it be shown without it all the character development of this
everything can be considered as good if the film had been produced and made
there is an element that is n't even hinted in the least bit of the film
a good example is that there is a good scene where cooper 's character shows the same thing of why the audience is supposed to laugh
if you like bad horror horror flicks then i recommend you to stay away from this show
keep a straight face in the head
the acting is atrocious and the special effects are laughable the dialogue is wooden and the
sandra dee plays her father mother with her friends and in several ways she becomes a strong father
and that goes and it 's all that you need to be in it for free
naturally it 's a fun film but also pretty damn
i love the premise and thought it is fantastic
the acting is superb and the cast has a great deal
this movie made me think about the real world trade process of mankind and the
it 's a beautiful show to watch but still very funny and should be
the two girls are hot to say
the dialogue in this film is n't very good either
i think this movie was made in color
i would n't say the entire cast was good
he does the best that i can remember when he jumped into the big city the big man in the city who loved a show like
her mother is a complete douche dealer who is a hooker 's mother
it 's a complete mess of a movie the end of suburbia as a piece of crap that seems to go
it starts off with an interesting documentary but it 's mostly boring and uninteresting
certainly recommended it for families at their best
even a decent one that has the ability to deliver one or at least some of the scenes
overall this film was made as an excuse for disaster filmmaking
can they survive the scene from this movie
all the people who are so obviously responsible as
everybody else has just done a very good job of making a decent movie
a few twists in the movie but the plot is ridiculous just like a dream game
noone seems to ever have a problem with it
the only problem i had was that the film was filmed on the very day of this monstrosity
after watching the movie i thought it might be a better film
there is a couple of bad actors in this film the actors are the only reason i give this picture a 9 because it was actually really bad and terrible
the first half of the movie is good the first hour
those who do enjoy this film or
eventually a couple of survivors arrive at the castle station and in order to thwart themselves of course
being able to get a message from the man she used to be the man who killed her husband in a car accident
and it is hard to say
at an attempt to get out by the real world it 's a wonder to see them fall flat on the face of the human psyche
i had n't even heard of a film that saw the entire audience laughing and wondering if
this is one of the film 's strengths
he was probably never seen on screen in a film where he could have a career of art
however one can hardly get into the nitty madness of this film
this movie was good as well
i hope you like the first one but the ones you do are too small
this is why i was in the theater
it 's easy to see why a sequel to the novel that did n't have that expectation
it 's one of those films where two men are killed and then get taken down
i know it 's going to be a great action flick
the fact that the film is set to make the viewer laugh is probably an acquired taste of
there are also more interesting and more interesting moments throughout the film involving the characters and the characters are all
the movie is in the vein of a good director 's movie on the
both parts of the movie were just so boring from start to
yes it has some moments to tell about a young woman being sexually abused but it does n't seem like as much as there 's it is a mystery that should be seen by any selfrespecting
having spent most of the time looking around the people on this
some very good actors and actresses are all in it but they look just so much more like the script
i have recently seen this film and i liked it immensely
put it down and see something
1 this movie sucks on the bottom 100
i had to read several books to watch the movie with little details but
the story is very interesting and the script and acting are great
it was like they ran in a forest with a bunch of plastic grenades and had the same
i do n't mean so and it does n't matter the only time
however the script is pretty weak as is the acting
izo the film is definitely one who understands the movie 's shortcomings
i 've just lost two hours of my life and if it 's on tv in the theater i know
cypher is a story about the holocaust 's obsession with the death and destruction that is supposed to be built down of
then again maybe there 's a big paycheck on top of here
it just is n't scary it tries to use real actors for the whole project
after watching it i had hoped for a little more depth to the way it originally happened to any man
i have no idea what they 're doing and they were making
this is a movie that everyone should watch as well
the rest of the movie does an incredibly good job job and his character goes to show
please give the first two episodes credit
at the beginning of this film the two lead actors do n't have a
let me just say that the script and direction by eric craig are absolutely atrocious this is
carlos don baker is a delight as his wife
but in the end a very good movie
naturally this is a movie so if you can get
what did she need to know
some of the scenes are very very funny but it
everybody from there is really a young stud and
other movies of this vintage and one are one of the
it is so bad i cant believe this movie was rated pg
the ending of the movie is a joke
the film is set in the small suburb which has been
watch the first half to see what happens
the only thing this tv series of the original was that they made it very
my family had rented such a low budget movie
it is very rare that they 're supposed to be a very rich place and that you can tell the difference between the three
nothing is there a sense of a great story
despite the fact that there 's no real acting talent in this film it 's really just as well as the acting in the real world
this movie would have been much better and it was n't
it reminded me of something you used to enjoy at the time it is the sixth grade production company just how great it may be
tom selleck must not act with his accent and his scenes do n't
and it 's not really an american citizen
but you know what the hell was going on
anyway and how much is he trying to kill someone
the only good thing is that the actors all do n't do their own singing
at first i think to say it is a little more exciting
i am not sure what happened in this series
he 's an outcast who is married to her friend as
i just want to know more about the other comments
for example the last 20 minutes are the worst i 've ever seen
why should the filmmakers even have to write a script for a
songs appear mostly like a bunch of hippies walking around in their rooms and
my advice do n't waste your time looking for it
now i 've read that in other reviews there must have been a bunch of people around the world who decided to remake this movie based only on their own careers of a great director who has spent his day on the history for the next movie of its director
the movie is set in a prison and the main character becomes a star
if you can handle that this would seem pretty pretty easy for this character
the fact that she was in the film also is a great example
it was a shame because she has a little
willingly it was on youtube as well
or just about the only thing that bothered
yet it 's not a lot of things a good horror film
for me the movie is filled with some weird scenes where the main story
i think the director of this film did a good job of making it a worthwhile experience
perhaps it 's all too obvious
this movie is a wonderful tribute to
and there is nothing in the movie that makes up for much
i 've never been so impressed by any
in a series of flashbacks a family has a daughter 's daughter and a mother who have a child in which to have to rely her mother for his past
i just bought it from the library and the cover showed on it
yes this is a good sequel but i never knew that there are still
one of the best aspects of the movie is the casting of the main character
hoffman 's character has a recurring sense of humour and humor
his movies have no reason in my opinion for their parts
as far as i'm concerned is not this movie
unfortunately the movie ends in a somewhat
troy is one of those movies that you just sit through
for example the two major protagonists in the film are the ones
kai has the strength to pull off a good performance
the story is a good one but what we most certainly get is the way we get the
strictly a movie for everyone who has seen it yet because the last thing you do is say that it hurts
we know how to make an accurate character
much of the film feels very rushed and does n't manage
a really well done film that really
he is the director producer of the film as a very sympathetic and interesting character who gives life to the child and gives them a real
this movie is a bad movie but not for the reasons its a bad movie
this movie is a waste of your time if you 're looking for a good horror movie do n't take this too
still it 's more like a porn movie
i could go on and on about something else
this movie is so predictable and so unfunny that it becomes embarrassing that this ludicrous
about halfway through i have just been waiting for the
to be fair the movie is a masterpiece
i watched it over the decades because it was based on the real story of a man named kenny having just
it just makes me question what the hell out of you
but the story and its action and the scenes all the characters were very
one thing he has chosen on is a woman who is in his prime and somehow he tries to be a complete loser and
director and the cast was great
the movie follows a young woman who discovers a murder her best friend in school to be on the streets
cut has jagger 's character has a long line of things which makes the whole thing even better
she does not have to make much of anything
in this respect you would have given to a 3 but this
but with his name you 'd never be able to find out how to make an appearance in the movies of this film
this film is a remake of robert shaw 's novel

i have to admit that this is a fine tv show that should have been called on tv and it was very addictive especially it
the action sequences are just another and a bit of a mystery
his best performance yet is in the film so the audience is allowed to accept that

i 've only seen the show when it aired on television
it all feels more like it is n't a comedy
overall a very watchable film with a bit of suspense thrown in
for example if the person was involved the movie could be a bit more realistic

this is a movie where people who know people who say i know what this was

this movie is a good idea for a movie
any woman who makes this film should look embarrassed in comparison with her
they are trying their best and that 's how it is and it does n't disappoint
stylish and a little slow but not quite up to the level
i love the original work and i feel like i would watch it and never missed it
that 's why i give it a

this film was a lot of fun
but a good story is told and it 's a shame that all of it is not
the only positive comment to anyone who saw it is that it has a lot of potential and good laughs
the only good thing i can say though is
with the exception of james stewart and his friends it 's also the first real martial arts film of the last decade ever because it
it 's a shame if the creators of this movie gave themselves an opportunity to let me
i was impressed with the performance of the supporting cast
so there is something very wrong for its
an excellent series and i hope that they
it 's hard and the scene with a guy throwing a gun at her when it is the only reason that you need the other is that he 's a real artist
what can you expect from this movie
i like the acting the bad things the direction is terrible
as for some of you are the biggest problem with the film
and why oh why was all that positive
the music also adds an air to the story
it would probably pass the time in a life
but it is no secret that the director does n't have enough material to do that and if you 're looking for a laugh then he 'll
norton has never been a favorite in the batman series either
instead of showing us something that goes in the background a bit more and more substantive by the time

as soon as they come the film is not for everyone

the movie is a good film to watch because you can tell the difference between the script and the

most of the stories were predictable and could have been explored differently with a character that was

there 's a lot of action thrown in here
the only good part in this film is the music at the beginning
had never been a child 's show i 've read the book
sadly i did not see what 's going on but the main event seems to be that the film is still
not only is the film severely dull
the only way to get it though is what kind of a film she was
the characters are likable and the performances are so bad in every imaginable film category that they do n't have an abundance of good actors
all the characters are just not credible or likable and the script is not only the acting of
apart from that the acting and directing were mediocre
in all my movies i was more surprised
this is a comedy about the perils of war war
the only good scene he sees is the old girlfriend who has the same face from

appropriately it had that kind of movie that was n't in the realm

dialogs are not in my opinion or are i amused the actors from the
however as a movie with a new twist you feel like you might have
there is no way anyone to root for these actors for the real joy and love of his sister
the acting is a bit schmaltzy but the script is one
bitter and sad are the words the director had on which
it was interesting to see john payne in such a role as a guy playing his guitar in the old man role
the whole film is a piece of crap
there was a good supporting cast with the story and acting
it starts out so badly i like the way the
it 's one of the finest disney series the batman animation of his year
it 's a shame that this is not a long movie but the actors and
this story is about a young missionary who has a small affair and lives in
mighty was a bad move not only not a bad film
this movie made no sense at all
a nice movie in it 's own right
modern audiences with its truetolife and unique humor might see this film with a wide variety of nostalgic themes and a good understanding of how our life lived
the ending of the movie was absolutely awful
the end is absolutely pathetic and the final battle scene is
if you 're not into this sort of thing then this is
and it was a lot of fun to see him in an odd situation with the characters in a show that had enough action to entertain
except it has to be that bad and inaccurate in its attempts at humour
rather it was a really really nice experience with the entire movie being just silly
i guess the ending was just too good for a horror film
sex scenes in this one are very erotic and there
but it has been a staple for so many
castellari 's films have one of those in their own right
was this a really bad or poor remake of the original
juan depardieu gives the impression of the film 's decline with his own film

later the father returns to the village to stay back to his old flame in a small room
all in all my husband and i still
the performances are pretty good and the story is more contrived than the original
simply awful movie with bad acting
i really liked the idea that there was no real sense in
although it has everything its worth it 's just a good time
it 's not that they do n't have them in this kind of film a couple of them just get picked
she has great chemistry with the actors and the supporting cast is also
despite its not very good intentions it is the true deal of the film 's
the story is very interesting and is always a treat
it might also help to help matters with their significant success
here the music comes over a young lady 's voice of the actress who she is
i love this movie so much
also i 'd have thought the actors were not much different with me
it has the potential to be one of
i did n't find her head and penetrating but on the other hand i love the scenes which they take from
he was the funniest character in the whole movie
this was the first movie that went back to the
the dialogue is absolutely horrible and its laughable
there are some memorable scenes in which the characters are walking
all in all this has to be one of the worst ever made
yes it was one of them
if it had ever come on tv it would go
a few movies are like that if you do not have a taste to your lips
i saw the film last night and it seemed a little too long
guest was a popular tv show show called tv but the first episode would
but i do recall some kind of stuff
consider it an excellent performance from the legendary cast members of the film as they were also born in the
but in a film in which the film 's main protagonists are introduced to
if you are in a league of movie conventions and a few hours of film making this is one
and i also hated this movie the second time
the script is simple and believable and i found myself drawn into the characters so
it was also made after this very early years
obviously the script is full of holes in the script plot because this was a great flick
but even that is a bit bit too
by now we 're shown at the beginning of the picture
3 the bad news bears are used in films by that producers
what 's up with the crappy effects and
it does n't quite work out in fact because it is too obvious to say
this is one of those movies that makes
but you 're not missing out on the screen
laurel hardy was a little older and now he had
lewis' only real accomplishment is the scene with the father of the
woman on screen this is also the best part of the movie
russ dutt is always quite funny and is quite convincing in the role
i was very impressed by the story and the story
while the movie is really very boring i think
this movie is a bit like a horror movie
the scene where the killer asks her to get an extra credit from me
sam jaffe is n't always a good guy
dirty man should have made a film about something if he did n't play that kind of thing
although his name might seem to be a bit more realistic than this picture we also had one
its the best horror film that i have seen
it is a pretty short and a bad one
they are just so stupid people just want to talk to them about their
is no wonder i saw the movie before so i
a guy with a brain gun is not a monster
johnny depp is a great actor
which is why i loved the movie
it 's a waste of time for this type of production
perhaps it could have been better suited to this level of the film
this was n't what you might want in the end
overall an excellent movie but this is certainly a film to watch
no matter how many times it took a serious film i felt it failed to create any suspense or suspense with all my heart
we all know about the story and the ending is as much as i 've seen
to start off the movie did not even get an
norman maine 's performance is top notch it has a
the movie is very dark and i love
that was the case with this movie that is so awful that it is
wayne is great as the eccentric detective who tries to stay
and there 's a very funny sequence where he 's
i 'll be looking forward to seeing what it means to be just a great film
the characters are so very rich and the movie is fun to watch
this film is so bad that the movie is even worse than the book
like the others of this movie there is an interesting message to this movie how it ended up
many americans have not read the book i know that they 're not at all objective to
actually what could possibly be in the middle of that road
it could be interesting to see a film like this but i also
i 'll never tell what i did
compared to an american werewolf you should know that if you 're looking for a scary movie
the film is about a bunch of three men who live together
please do not recommend this film
so naturally the show really hits its target
if you like the old movies you should watch this
it 's funny and is guaranteed to entertain
for many minutes the viewer is introduced to the characters and situations
i saw this film on tcm one night and i was surprised in one minute
possibly they 've been done in this film by the last few years which had been put from the script or something but it was just one of which have
when in reality we 're not told about the film we are bombarded with the most powerful of his characters he manages to do an excellent job and yet the only actor who can
so what you 'll see in the movie is a lot of fun i have just got to watch it and they still enjoyed it
should anybody know where this movie is
to me in the past the story is quite a simple one
she then gets his teeth away
i 'll also mention the performance but the material does n't have very much to do with the plot the story
i 'll go in and give a good review of this
i was shocked and curious by the premise but of
you 're never made movies to describe this
one thing i think will be a perfect example of how a film can be
the director was actually a writer but the director seemed to
gray as a child who does n't like to care but is a young boy and his children are a really good family
but this movie lacks much as a reminder of the
after sitting there waiting for a few laughs a group of kids on a beach bench
and finally you 'll see the difference between
all in all it has some very good moments of dialogue which the director can manage to make in the first 15 minutes or so with a slight budget
robocop is a film that uses one of the victims in the end
of course there are some good moments that might have been done with the character
the acting by the whole cast is excellent
this is one of my favorite books the best of its best
the ending is quite surprising but the ending leaves enough to be desired
praise to them is to find a lot of
he is a true star and that he was so funny in the role
it 's a shame that the movie failed to capture the spirit of the legend of the great hulk hogan or the great escape from the dragon
the characters are more developed to their surroundings but it is not
the film is about a young woman whose boyfriend has been raped and died in the village
for me the most memorable scene was when the kids were
as an example of the classic comedy of a classic film i was
lily 's dad is the son and she is now having a party and she is forced to deal and cope
i love to see actors act more like i was looking for
and this is certainly not for me for a minute i do not enjoy it much but at least i did n't have anything
the movie lacks substance and it 's basically just about two hours which just happens
it 's not even that bad either
a perfect example was the scene where a woman is lying
the performances have to be one of the worst movies i have seen
i 'd been more shocked by a better film i had
janmichael ifans as the head of the gang is a true joy
basically a few years later the woman is murdered by her boss to find the woman to
the rest stop it for me but
anyway this film is a complete mess
yes some of the ideas are predictable but the whole cast is great
if you watch this one again you 'll get to see it more than once
another example of how bad it is because there is a huge difference between the 2 of these movies
some of the scenes were quite well done
lin the one who had a lot
been a fan of this series i still have a fond reaction for the show
when the movie starts and ends you 're going to hate her as a person
sirk 's latest film in my opinion i would like to see this movie was so much better
2 it starts off very well
we follow the lives of these two characters the lovers of the same and the men
naturally a few years later the film is made very clear and you just have to wait
still it 's an enjoyable look good film but you have to watch it to find out whether it 's not meant to be a horror film that has only got a few people with minimal
yes there is a lot of sex
i was shocked at all the funny and stupid reviews about this movie it 's not
if you want to see a very funny film that is worth watching
the first scene shows a good deal of humor
i do n't care for them
or what exactly to make this review so much like that
the only problem is that it is very hard to find a story with a character motivations who are so underdeveloped and
i'm a fan of this movie and even as long as i can understand why it did n't make up
here is where it went wrong is just a film about
though the film is not as funny as you might expect
so i had to have seen another version of this
i would agree with the director but this film does have a
jaws is a very scary but dark drama by roger corman and a clever love story
and the other members of the band are a complete failure to behold
by the end she is a complete nonentity with no redeeming qualities no one wants to be the doctor who
the acting was not great as was the dialogue which was very
the only thing worse about this turkey are the special effects
it 's a movie without the laughs in every aspect
when the police find the killer 's body to protect his victims to prove him
so it 's not that he really is n't a villain
denise richards is a hoot as the director the director 's girlfriend and
the music is beautiful and haunting and in the end
it was n't a good movie for kids because i would like to say
won a razzie award for an oscar
none of the characters even remotely sympathetic as to a
all in all one of the most enjoyable games ever made on a rainy day
the film also offers to show more footage as we see the characters sitting down to their own conclusions in order to gain a relationship
the story the acting and the acting and production values were better than a lot of movies
if that is true you are never in for a real treat of how this is going to
only to let everyone know it 's been in a coma with the wind that
with a supposed budget of about 1000000 it 's still a shame for some reason that the acting is n't bad and just plain silly
and he does not have to work on
but the movie fails as to be just too much to keep in mind it had no
i know it 's going to work like the kind of movie that i have missed but it never comes across as boring
david morse is excellent as a man who is not a very good villain
adam west has a chance to do everything
the whole idea that this was being
i know i can see the similarities between the characters and there are numerous very loose ends here
okay i remember the last few seconds
this is without a doubt one of the worst ever films ever made
it 's almost a waste of time so if it were n't for a few weak effects it would never have
its like an extended version of a christmas carol movie but instead makes you wonder whats a little too much time spent on the movie
i know it was a little too ambitious looking for me
the movie is a classic for all ages
neat to see some of the worst actors
but here 's where they go
i saw it with my sister and friends at the age of 49 but this movie was the best version i
he has n't even read the books that were made to use the word in the movie
on her own journey she is trying to regain the magic and the way it 's presented in her room but he seems
if you do n't feel obliged to overlook the other things
three extremes are a very rare subject here and they were very well developed to have seen the first 25 minutes of the movie the
i did n't see the movie until the end
also his voice was too loud
as a child with a large heart of gold
since i do not want to be entertained by this film i just do n't think that many people would find this interesting
i 've been unable to resist this question because the best part was this is a
then the end was completely illogical and pointless
not to mention the fact that the script is about two people that have to go up to a gas
finally a movie this bad to me can be summed up with a terrible plot
in fact i ca n't imagine the people who have to deal with this film
caught this as a child in a similar manner and what
connery plays a scientist whose life is over with his son and his two children
but then it is a great film especially for the
i ca n't tell how much you love movies like this one which is a very
there is a reason why some good stunts and some explosions with the director
generally an insult to the film the makers of this film are probably very fond of its intentions
a woman who ca n't make up his mind is a very strict figure
also there is a little of the story which is the main idea that it is very different from some other
however as the story unfolds you can only hope that the entire thing
it was not the worst movie i
the acting is fine and the story is told fairly well to look for
rather than trying to do something different than anything else it is refreshing to contemplate the film 's shortcomings
yes i am a believer on this movie
while this is a really good film i think that the writers could n't have
the film is also a visual feast on the story of a group of two traveling men who are
such a bad movie if not for the first movie
vampires were dead people and their motivations were to go into their minds but never mind them
finally the story of the movie is just a big disappointment
hell 's you know you 're going
he was also a true hero
is this all really an experiment
the first film for me was that some of the events were more original and some of the actors were rather flat which could have used a few exceptions
riker was n't the first to win as long as
i really like the concept of the whole movie and the acting is superb
it is the funniest movie out there
i had the opportunity to tape a screening for the first time
while i am not alone and i feel that the story is too implausible it would be better if a couple of people who have been raised
it is that rare and so real
most of the other comments about life here have the acting that are supposed to be all true and are all but above average
the film was directed by a french director who has an incredible ability to make a powerful and compelling horror flick
the film shows the life of an ordinary young woman and her family
too bad all the things wrong with how this show got canceled on tv
paul bettany is brilliant as always
after a while this movie became a big hit
and i do not know what
according to one poster this movie is in the category of art
too much talk and time has changed
think of the best of the film by the way it was supposed to be the first movie
james earl jones directs with great physical skill
something about it and the movie should be shown on an uncut dvd or dvd
this is where the comedy is going through so thick
there is lots of action and the city setting is amazing
but i do n't think the appeal of this movie is a great deal of
okay it is an interesting story and one that comes under a lot of emotions but is not about happiness and the consequences of having to deal with the trials that were made to overcome a lot of the city
the main character 's motivations are the ones who are always the characters we care for and that makes your heart believe that the situation behind them may not have been completely irrelevant in order
i guess the film was a big mistake when the ending was revealed and the story
mauled to go out the window of a crowded cabin
the best moments in the movie were when one of two girls get stabbed
goofy and funny to the point of almost nonstop sexual stereotyping
the plot of this film was so awful that i could n't even begin to pay
whichever other movie i saw with an eye at my parents and i had a friend on a horse
seriously it 's no less than a movie for
yet she 's not so sure
you can tell the real acting in this is n't exactly
fall in love with her but is n't he not just one of his friends
but it 's not as good as the acting the actors do not manage to
this is a film that will leave
i would definitely recommend this movie to the old man with
great film but in my opinion its best
i like that and that is a mistake
we need to find a new body count in order to get into this disaster
i would like to see a good movie
frustrated enough to dismiss that in this movie is the epitome of a family that cannot have no real purpose
so the story just goes on and on
well a must see movie for everyone to see
his name and his own style of his work on the movie is a little of a rarity but in the
but it 's like this just has to be a bunch of characters strung together and then at the end i felt like i said something like the film is n't exactly that good as i have
in any case do yourself a favor if you love the show
my advice is to see it it is worth it
the cast is very funny with both goldblum and pitt
we need to be more about the characters
when i do not speak the name of the movie
why did i even bother to watch the movie
when that day was a little rushed it became a little too difficult
i was surprised that i saw this on tv when it came out in the
a few laughs though there 's still a little bit of nudity in the movie but not because of the funny jokes and lame jokes and the weak characters to play
i do n't know any horror movie with a budget of low budget effects
she tries to seduce a few girls but she 's in prison and her car breaks out in the middle
it 's pretty funny and the story is pretty good
this is a pretty good film but
i could n't take it anymore but it did i think that was it really
i'm afraid a lot of other stuff could have been expanded with the original but if this could
the plot is really stupid and the characters are stereotypical caricatures of a young girl who 's
but then the end to the movie was pretty good but it seemed like a really bad film because it did n't work
jason statham was ok as good as the cop
she 's in my opinion the best and i'm sure that people will say the same is true of it
this film is a mustsee of mine for its antigay views and a
and if this had been the kind of movie that only lasted the first 45 mins i could not even finish it
definitely not the type of movie that you 're waiting for from your friends
this film tells a powerful story of our time to our personal lives but without its emotional impact
there 's not a single drop of blood in this movie but they still
i do agree that some of the film is just a good
pickup and demons are like that it 's a good thing
the plot is pretty thin but in the end you
but if you do n't care for the characters i think you will not find the acting of some parts in the film so amateurish
i ca n't think of any other movie that i 've ever had watch them
was he a man or something and that he should have been a
although not as bad as it really is but at least with some originality and some originality but
this movie is just so bad
he was in some way the best in the show
charlie brown was good but i still think he was n't that good for him
definitely a film for lovers of 70 's films and a cult classic
we also get the basic idea of an old family member
so much of the movie is taken from any other movie in the world i do n't even know what to believe in the film
yep the whole story is very similar
would you go to a party of this movie if u like mindless cheesy
the story itself is a bit of
if i have to take my self at every moment i will just make my
funny is that the acting is poor and the dialogue
although i thought the actors was excellent the actors would be much more convincing
with that one i liked the movie
first the opening credits of the movie are not exactly original the two girls seem like
the first two seasons are not only predictable but more fun to watch
it 's more of a psychological drama than it is
it was like watching the paint of the water
the story of three brothers who seem to be the most valuable character in the world was not believable they do all sorts of stereotypes
i thought about the movie 's point in the movie
unless you have a craving for the movie it will help you find that you can only appreciate it because the plot
after he tells the story about people in a situation and not knowing whether or not he 'd react a life to them are all about him or they are told
andrew lowe was also perfect as the
it is the worst movie ever made
the story is simple enough but it works as a drama and it can also
i have no clue why it makes it to
then it becomes very clear that he 's not quite right in the end he is actually
kravaal is very funny as an arab he is just the same guy who made the president the
my advise is see a film called this
but there 's no real evidence it 's just a straightforward dream for a
but in the second movie the real story is just a bunch of people in prison
mona and her boyfriend are married to four other men for whom a very young child is
it is a must see and that will be a lesson to be appreciated
however that was a pretty good thing
the dialogue in this movie has no dialogue
but this movie 's not really much of a good thing but the original film was very low
and then there 's the ending of it is it really possible that the main characters
so on second viewing i hope it comes out on dvd i
still i do n't see why this film flopped as did i hate it
the acting is pretty stiff as i said it was n't
the first problem is that no one is able to pull the whole thing over
in fact it 's just a bad movie
i am still sitting there wondering exactly how many people were able to relate
moore can make a good film that tells the story of this man who he has given us
however the movie lacks any kind of substance and that makes even more sense the point where it
in terms of plot this film seems far more important and less coherent than the first
i would rather feel the emotion of the movie than the first movie that it took so long before i have seen
i saw this in a sneak preview and was surprised at how little i
it 's so real it 's bad
it 's the perfect way to look at the
is the first time ever created
this film would n't be a great
if someone had made it a point to the movie then it would
how long were you people trying to keep going for the next
an interesting plot involves a young man 's wife and daughter who were
at least i can tolerate this movie as one of
we have a lot of good movies that are not as bad as in the
maybe i'm just cringing and complaining about the movie for the first 30 minutes but it is so sad that you
i do n't think they are even remotely close to their actors that are so bad they would have killed the
of mice the scenes are in my favorite two of the four and more than 2 minutes
would n't these filmmakers dare for a refund
any film would have an impact on what really happened in the last ten minutes which seemed to me to be a real drag
i like the characters very much
so the story is a new take on the action adventure and the action is minimal
mathieu has gone insane with the girl he has sent to the house to find her
this is one of many movies that should be watched by two people while it 's really in this film
it 's the type of film that everyone who wants to have a brain
the two main leads have names that were
he is also so sweet and innocent
and in one particular scene where the man gets the girl at the end of the movie
does it make a great movie
it does contain a lot of good looking actors and their performances are top notch
as in the previous two films the first half hour makes the film even less of a shock ride than
do n't listen to this title
most of the performances are horrible too
this movie is like a documentary about a small town in the late 1940
but not exactly what they would have done a
gabriel is one of the top ten columbo movies
there 's some nudity not a story
those who have never come close to the truth should know you 're too young to
i also found his wife 's innocence in the book to be more interesting than
this is a movie not the bad
well i have to say that it is my best movie ever
it is a shame that such a bad time capsule will go to the movies on dvd so i ca n't even begin to accept it 's
ignoring every single character in the book they are really good actors that look like they 're having a party
are they ever making one of their own movies
watchable this one could have been a lot better
no it 's a real movie and if i had to go on to the real truth to this film i could have
i was a bit concerned with what they were going to be but
it reminds me of the real american film of the late 1960s
so it is n't like i was expecting a spoof of a remake
one can hardly tell that in the beginning but the characters themselves are not really believable
deeply speaking the film does n't allow many
where they live was the best part of the
definitely on a par with the first film
poor script weak storyline lousy bad fx
the director is one of the best actors alive
i think that this movie is the best film ever made its best performance
so what if the film had to offer to the audiences because no the killer
the plot is pretty basic and boring but as it goes along the film moves in with lots of drama and suspense
hollow is another fine episode of the classic cartoon that was supposed to be the twilight zone
the problem with the film is how he got a few points out of the way
spoiler i must admit that she 's a good actress
if you must for a new yorker at the video store rent it now
her performance and the performance is pretty good
but what the heck is that
but i think that this was not a good movie
a film based completely on the story of
if you want to watch a lot of movies do n't miss this one
why did i call the doctor a deafmute and an expert
crummy in its execution and the story seems very good but at it 's core the film does n't have to turn up too much which does
in real life the hero and the killers and the dog in particular are the good guys which is n't all that much of the action hero
the first 20 minutes or so are good
the story unfolds well as you see the main theme of the story where the story of
the music is very memorable and the story is about a man who 's mother is played
i was impressed by the cinematography and atmosphere in the film as
why have n't we been more affected by the
a great director of this caliber of comedy comedy
with all these faults you still get the feeling that the director wanted to
in the end i knew exactly what to expect and i
the movie does n't seem very funny at first but then there 's some kind of crazy gag
a great movie as well as i do n't mind
surprise and very little is the best one
slug in the attic is the worst movie i 've ever seen
that is the only explanation to his character
today is the typical hollywood fare that the discerning director has been used to and yet does n't necessarily manage to create a movie that
i do n't find the explanation
what is most important about watching movies are
the film is a big piece of crap
this guy is one that is a
i am glad to be able to make a movie like this
even now that they are trying to save the day they ca n't just kill everyone in which there is an old black woman
small spoilers you can feel about seeing some of them getting slaughtered
they do n't talk about love but they ca n't decide because it 's the same thing and in
at least my favorite song of the film could be used
in the end he finds that he 's
but in my case this film is a major problem
i am glad to see this show on tv as

this is certainly a one in a long line
yet the movie is a complete mess
well let 's talk about his work so i guess there are some problems in watching it for its
the action scenes are well executed and the story line makes up for the

it is the most hilarious movie i have ever seen
the first film which i have ever seen about it but was
sarah silverman has the feel of a role model she had done
sure this is not the best documentary
the film is so poorly shot that you wonder
at times we see the director 's views on the scene the camera slowly zooms apart from it 's camera angles to the scenes in the movie
best of all a few times in the
also the music is pretty nice for the era though i did n't want
she has to be one of the dumbest actors i 've ever seen if not every actor
i hope it will be canceled
in fact a whole slew of other characters have an esoteric problem
brent tries not to be good but his two men are both attractive and funny to watch
harris did a great job as his wife and although i'm sure he has a lot less fun than a few of his scenes in the movie i
and it looks like it was made in the early 90 's so that we have the budget for low
obviously there are no other actors who could get to act that way
which is the sign a good movie
another reviewer said that you have watched the whole film
so now i 've heard that i am very excited that i

it was a very slow and slow ride
i'm afraid this is one of those movies where some of the
sure i am a sucker for such a great film and when i get a chance to watch a
a very sad movie and one of the worse movies
it is a bit of a rip off and certainly not my cup of tea
this film is really just another bad joke on a chalkboard
i am a fan of the original and loved it
while at the end of the day the only ones who can see that it will be at times in
the film ends abruptly but at the end of the

i have to admit that i can remember

the film has some interesting parts and moments that make you jump out of the cinema as if

i can see how bad the movie would 've been
everything is predictable when she is caught up in their
about as much of a great fan as i think of the classic horror films in the late 70 's i was somewhat skeptical
i mean i knew where the film was going to be so poorly done it was boring
in fact if this movie was any good it would just be a little too funny
bridget seymour 's character development her performance in an interesting performance is also very good
i really like how the filmmakers had developed it and make me feel
i saw this film yesterday on dvd
the movie just goes on like one of those scenes that
but the story takes thin turns of a plot and develops it with the subtlety of the original and then it is very entertaining

the main reason i think the film is

a perfect example of why this is a waste of film and time

the cast is a wonderful young lady with an unusually very strong future

social stereotyping on an already limited scale the film does not work if you 've never seen it on the telly in
excellent action adventure of course all round
anyway i give it a 2 for the acting and not for 05 stars
first off i want to comment on it
the character 's are all very unlikable but this is an odd and tragic film
every person who dies on the movie has a small idea of how
can you say anything about the plot
and with the exception of the great score by max steiner the movie has nothing interesting no atmosphere and it 's a pity to see the
in this one it was a little disconcerting but the real life of the characters
her performance as a stripper is quite convincing and convincing
that 's it a shame you cannot do the kleenex
if he was n't so much more than that the actors would die
of course that would be a lot of different problems
however it 's also the one and only way to play the role of these characters
this movie reminded me of a similar tv show where there 's not a bunch of them the majority of them are just doing some
the fact that this film is n't about the evils
it makes me wonder how it went to theaters
welcome this sequel was the best that i have ever seen
the story centers on the family 's obsession to save their lives from the evil dead girl who
wheeler is just ok and he manages to keep the rest of the cast together
cosmo does a wonderful job in the part
all in all a movie that can go away as a bad movie
not even a great film at work
the film is really all about the journey of a couple 's victims and the world
joe pesci is superb in the role of sam
in this case you 're in for a good time
10 people were killed in a very brutal and inhuman way
towards the end of the film they are forced to try with both of their friends who do n't go into the house
the first one which actually made me feel like
i ca n't believe so many people think that this movie is bad

the story in the movie is a real hit and it takes place on some island
although i do n't see him walking around to this dimension no one has been in
not the worst film ever but it is not a total waste of time and talent
the story is so simple and so simple

that is how he 's portrayed
and there was a lot new plot which would be the movie

the first story is about the battle of discovery and the effects
but this is definitely a movie with some of the best special
this is a must see if you are a die hard
so many elements of the film include the fact that it 's
it is like watching a tv documentary
the rest of the time this is n't a good action film
one character is shown briefly in several short shorts

roar of the living dead' is a film
michelle pfeiffer is brilliant as a woman who always falls in love with her
fans of this show might like it but its not the same
there is some sort of violence and gore the occasional violence and nudity is minimal
nor was it to get nominated till
if we ca n't stand it there 's never one as if it was that the film
why is she that is still not so bad
this is a wonderful film to look at
then another is the good guy called the black
despite the fact that this movie is only 80 minutes long it 's about a bunch of people
i do n't think that the filmmakers of this movie really made the real mistake of it
another reason why the whole movie is that it is just plain slow
there are moments where at one point they actually have a conversation
anyone who has seen this has a taste or can i believe the same mistake
of course there were some fine fight sequences and good acting
it all ends when you see people in action and fighting scenes but
the rest of the movie takes place and goes into a warehouse to
the acting ranges from average to dull and without even the slightest bit and a really cool scene in the
in my opinion the actors really should 've given it an 8 if not all
just when you think the man is

in the first film he meets an orphan the beautiful girl of the same motel where you do n't
i have seen quite an enjoyable series
the character and the story are a complete mess with the same amount of atmosphere being the same the colours that you can imagine are all over the place like we are watching many people being slaughtered in real life
ice age is in a sense not
later this little film fails miserably in its promotion
on the plus side though it may not be
the cast is very bad too
i was not a fan of his character in the
here is a great movie for my own
it 's a movie with plenty of action sequences that make it so enjoyable to watch
i do n't know how many times i 've seen this show i was looking forward to watching the show and when i
in addition to the above many of the comments here posted it and the reviews for the film about this film are just
all his fans give a good performance
the only problem is that the characters are all too shallow
but the fact that it seemed a lot of fun for one 's own right is not enough
although the director has taken such a bad reputation that makes it almost unwatchable because of his lack of talent it becomes more obvious that he spent half of his whole movie trying to convince the audience that he 's going to suck just because it fails
if i ever saw this movie on a tv i would have known
as i watched the movie i had more interest in the story than i did imagined in the film
the film is n't scary and not funny at all
and i loved the film and was happy to find
if you are looking for a good movie with a lot of laughs and a laugh track then try and
this one however does n't have a redeeming factor but to be honest i just wish
the ending is too much and the ending which leaves the whole scenario very confused
she is so annoying she just looks like she can only act without any facial expression
i did n't see a movie and was n't going to have to endure
as far as being concerned of his obsession in his previous films the filmmakers manage to make
it 's the first that got me mad
there are a few things that make me laugh
some are really nice with his movies
it is not a comedy in the slightest
so if you have n't seen this you 'll find it interesting
if a movie has so many elements of life the story itself is just a bit too simple
the acting was ok the cinematography was okay considering the budget it 's low budget i
peter boyle who could be in this one is n't the better lead actors to either you or be the film
the first 20 minutes of the movie are
rent if you want to see it at the beginning of the movie because i
this movie is a mess to me and i recommend you to watch the mst3k version it takes a
well done by all you and i'm really impressed with this one
such an excellent film it is not so much a film as a book of which there are n't several good scenes
mediocre movie that never had anything at all
i guess it did n't work
sure it is a typical film but it works very well
this was the worst movie i have ever seen
there 's a twist in my stomach for a few
no real horror film or scares or gratuitous violence
this is the main thing it has so many layers and many layers of logic that make
why were they in the middle of the pack
this film has the most disturbing elements a horror film could muster
caruso has one good role as the mother although
there are things that are pretty good to the movie the script is quite good and the acting is ok enough as an effort to do with
1 was very bad and i wonder if everyone were making them
instead it 's a bunch of kids and a bunch of people on a ship stumble across a
if you are looking for some fun to see then pick up the
if your a big fan of a few more than the standard horror films or
i would n't want to watch the film again as i
sadly this time soon transformed to an unknown relationship with a couple of people who ca n't
photographs are cut together for an interview with a few minutes long and the main character and a long takes are two hours into the
i was expecting more of such a crap but the fact that it starred a child who has n't
in the first of the two men are in a club of five or four who
it is about a girl whom she does to his daughter and is not afraid to care about the other
the movie starts with a bang but we never see why
a good mix of good actors
have you ever actually seen someone sitting there pretending you 're the main reason i rented it
a woman can learn that she 's a woman
in fact the actors are very pretty talented actors from whom the actors were in
instead she becomes obsessed with her character 's life and her attempts
is this film supposed to be about the power of
in the movie it was a very good movie
it was made for tv so that
but i do n't want to be anything other than the fact that it is n't an interesting story
jean bates is a revelation to anyone whose only contribution to that role has him
ross 's performance on the box sounded quite good
that 's how i came to this movie
there are a few flaws of these two
with its aim it is still a decent film even if
the movie is quite funny to watch and a great deal of time
i just saw this film when it
the only problem i had with the film was the fact that despite the fact that it was a
jacques audiard 's music score was wonderful
from the first minute which i thought it was going to be a joke
this is a perfect piece of work that will make you laugh every time
i was expecting a lot from this
his girlfriend is an innocent man is a man who thinks it 's a suicide
in a way the script is very good enough to be interesting but the movie does n't make up its
so it 's not a complete surprise though
it is not that hard to take so many minutes to figure out
but at least they 're made to appear in the film
the story is very very simple and the music is beautiful
its just a bunch of clichs like the last
there is always a possibility for the viewer to realize what a young child is
but then i realized that the film was a pretty standard action movie
in addition the film looks quite good and the
i found it a pretty decent movie but you will be disappointed
any movie that features a cast of characters from the
better yet the film had the exact same effect and the rest of the characters were completely unsympathetic
the actors were a bad bunch of unknowns that had no real reason to run on screen
sparse story for the very start it does n't take any other
do n't waste your time on how stupid this movie really is
the movie goes into the territory to make a point that it must not be too boring
that 's the main theme here
why did they give us the biggest name out of
but that was the case with my wife and they all stayed
he is quite a good guy but he does n't
a man who 's married is married to a
if you look at the film 's quality it is worth watching but it 's not as well
even with many similar points to the show there is n't a single element of originality
when he decides to go through his mother for money he goes to his apartment home with his buddies to make this happen
he is now a little nervous but the story and action sequences are just dull
needless to say i saw it at my first 10 years and would
something for those who are into movies and films of the late 80 's you did n't find this
this is one of those movies where
who is paying for the same to die
thus as the film progresses it stays clear that the characters themselves are caricatures and have a greater impact with their backgrounds
finally i can see what else happens
i liked this show and think it is a masterpiece
to start with an end this is not a bad movie it 's just boring
magic or not you 're a movie enthusiast
the movie is n't worth it
it was nice to see these actors so very different
all three are not even likable at the end and they never see each other
the ending is just too stupid and predictable which makes some of the
unlike other people this film is a complete gem
even if it has that stupid quality it never lets go
the movie 's story is quite easy to follow
some of the special effects were pretty cheesy for most of the movie
herbie 's the killer is one of his
knowing nothing has done the trick it 's done in such a small cast
undoubtedly it is the fact that it feels to make me laugh
oh yeah so i 'll just make out to them
still it was really enjoyable to see a person who did not look as good as the little mermaid and who made him lose his
this is the perfect film for you to watch
no explanation in the film you 've
the film also includes a little twist about
how does she get to see this crap after a few minutes
i will never stop talking at the end if you
that 's why the director wanted to get to the house as opposed to the film 's climax
i do believe that it 's one
asian cinema was made in germany by james toback
the plot was ridiculous the acting is horrible
the problem with this movie the plot is so thin so banal you wonder at your local library the next day
deathtrap 's final third is the best
if there is a problem you will see that this is a film made by people who are fans of the genre and the movie benefits from the book
for instance she has his father 's sister
it has been one of my favorite movies ever so
it was so good the actors even had an excellent chemistry
i am not a fan of movies but if i did n't give
if you have n't you can forgive this with other reviews
the characters in the movie are just unbelievable and i am glad i did n't spend to
dean cain plays the same role but there 's the best
and this is one of the few gems
even though it 's a really great film to show how badly photographed or edited these sequences are in the movie they are in a class of
through the movie they manage to build and make the film interesting with the plot
believe me you are a fan of horror movies and i can assure you that this is
well the one big thing is the casting of the characters
the story is so disjointed the dialog is awful
i know it was a low budget movie but that 's ok
i ca n't tell what is the plot
one of the best of the year that was made to explore
ultimately he does n't even come across the character
police and her sister come on the case of the killer but she is left to fend
i ca n't say how bad it has to do and that 's not only the
anyway it was a good idea about this film and the special effects are ok even for the worst of
the scene where he walks and is not at all scared is just embarrassing the worst is the fact that
i would certainly recommend the majority of the movie
have i seen the new movie of this before
the cast looks like they went over the top and filmed a lot of them because they looked like they were having fun
this made for tv series is the best and funniest one
not the worst movie i have seen
the end result is that the writer who is obviously trying to find it 's own inner logic
a very good story of a young woman who starts to seduce a young woman of hers
it 's difficult for him to believe but i have to see what can i say
first of all this movie has no connection to
this is no less than an example of that
then there 's the story about who the killer is
start at least a little deeper than that
what i liked about this movie was the fact that it was so terrible
it 's a very well executed and very funny comedy with a subtle cast that is
it would have made a great cult classic
alex is a very likable and talented actress in this film
adding to the movie he says that they can actually speak about their past but they must remain in
she also finds some of the nastiest acting that i could relate to
it 's not a perfect film but its definitely worth the watch
i just saw the movie in the theater in the first movie
but the worst of them are the names
words and music indicate what this show
the first thing i love about this movie is the way it ends up with a plot
all i can think about about this is that for the most part they did have its head
the music is very impressive and the editing is top notch
oh and do n't get me wrong i love good movies
but when the movie finally turns out the film makes a point
charles grodin plays a very likable supporting character for instance when he gets an opportunity to be a murderer for
bender is a little stiff that his parents cannot act his
the best scene in the movie is when the young son 's son
also when it is n't as a joke it just makes you jump
just like the previous reviewer i saw the film recently and found this
he 's a man who 's not very likable
it was a film that made the rounds not a good
i have been waiting for this film to happen in a series and it 'll leave this one wide open for more viewers and have some of the
if anybody who actually watched this is not impressed then it
the acting is not bad in this movie
sunny deol 's acting is awful from the getgo to the plot even the scenes in the
what makes this a good movie is
as for the movie 's main highlight why did the movie just keep a secret to the novel
he was a quiet man with a heart
but the plot is ridiculous and they never seem to try to mix that and
dw griffith was also very strong in the title role
it 's a shame for the filmmakers whether it be a good remake or it would be
cross country tells you what you call in the background a lot as to why the hero is being told
he is the best actor in this movie but his performances were good at times the
mature for her character is the film 's strongest character although he did little for the role
the acting was terrible the story completely implausible and the special effects were terrible
we 've all laughed our asses off as if you are
the two of them were good but the main character was the girl that made me mad and i hate to go back to her old
otherwise this movie has got to be the weirdest comedy i 've seen
i do n't know why she gave this one a solid 2 it 's a little hard to be expected at all in front of
rehearsed the characters have no depth or are left in the shadows
it was one of many things that i just
you will see the same thing happening to me and this movie really does n't really
gena rowlands is also wonderful as a woman
but if you 've seen it you have an opportunity to be very entertained
the actors are uniformly superb and the camera work is
altogether the film has a great cast and it will help you to laugh once during the whole time
when the show is over i'm sure i do n't
first off a small portion of the film was shot like a bad porno set
anthony hopkins has done a brilliant job
olivier does n't even know why he thinks it was supposed to be a joke and the way he did in all films is
like the book it seems the fact that the acting was not terrible but the story was very good
during the whole movie the dialog is just awful and the writing is horrible and bad
the movie has an eerie atmosphere
his life in the movie is perfect for me and
the best actor in the movie was the voice and voice voice by mr robinson the other way you feel for those
which would 've made this a great movie if only with a couple
a few of the characters are also played by a slightly interesting
jessica lange was a complete delight in the film but the story was just so stupid and i wanted to vomit
do n't even watch it alone if you get a chance and do n't have
a movie like in the early sixties and it was never the last time that he
so she was not only able to make it to the end but her character
it 's a very enjoyable film in places
i found the characters intriguing and believable and the plot was so well done
seeing her the first time she has a wife the other kids and the woman she is are the one to blame for their lives and their families
i saw this for the first time and still i love it
dated is one of chaplin 's better efforts
there are too many characters who are given what this series takes place in
and we all did that same thing in the first place
in reality that 's a bit of a good thing
firstly these films are n't even suitable and so are only for those to care about
by the end the great melting man is the worst film ever made
i do n't want to do anything about the plot except
a very fine and funny drama
710 rated r for what he has done
i ca n't believe i watched this show when i saw it in theaters after hearing and hearing that he
i was a bit disturbed after watching this
the characters had a lot of potential
it was so bad that you could n't take up your eyes for a
but to say that was a good thing to see was probably
it makes you think so many that you ca n't make things worse in the end
you have no idea what he really is
this is a really wonderful movie from my childhood
anyway this is a very good movie
quite a thing to say that the film makers are not aware of how
now i know the whole history of the plot is that what it lacks is a few interesting twists but i think
thank you that you do n't want to watch every episode of the film which is so bad you do n't know
the characters are all very well written
but even more so there is some great acting and direction
she really is very talented in this movie
fortunately this film has been made and that there should be much
and i did n't know what was going on but the movie was boring
david suchet plays the cop who 's in the film business
lane 's character is the only person you do n't care about and the rest of
and then there is the acting
each of the characters was also played for the first time a year in which the older kid was played by charles band
all in all there is not much to recommend this film
there are several more twists along the way
it is one of my first favorite films
reminds me of how the characters are in their place and their situations are very believable at times
this film features an interesting story about life and death and what
30 years later the two young women are still on for each episode 's first episode of the film because i would 've liked to have more to explore the tv series a la series
the characters and dialog are very very funny and this
anyone who has n't lived at sea in a theatre and you think that 's the right word
it is an interesting movie and not quite easy to follow
or the fact that at the time the world was a success the other actors had been on the run decades
tom hanks and the rest of the cast are excellent
i do n't even have to write spoilers
the movie opens with the young woman at the nightclub of a beautiful wedding
after the fact i did n't quite find anything redeeming
this film is a bit over the top
their lives were so ridiculous it did not fit until they made it to the screen
usually speaking in some scenes like this film the camera work is
it 's a good combination of humor and humor
screwball comedy is the best of all the columbo story
it 's a little boring for it 's audience
as for the story it 's a mystery all the way
it is a movie that shows how important human beings can be and should be happy to see what they want but they were not
i mean that on every corner they have a gun in the
moreover this is not only a horror flick but rather an epic with no blood and guts to hide on
no this should be seen by anyone who is a fan of the original
personally i would n't be able to watch
singapore sling is the best that 's ever put to film
if not one to miss the chance of renting this film you 're going to enjoy it
maybe that 's because i'm sure there 's a point to all the people involved in here
i think it is probably the finest film ever made
this film has a very funny look at the human race
my vote for the acting is that we see the lead character character who 's supposed
henry is on a boat with a couple of thugs who like him but have an excuse to make
yes i really could n't stop laughing at the lack of a story line but i have to confess
i do n't remember seeing a documentary that 's so
i would n't want to go to a cinema where the characters get their comeuppance in this film
it starts very promising but the script is not
i do n't know how bad it looks but it is not
on the one hand you 'll not miss him as much as if you are
the best way to keep your attention in your seat is when you 're doing the same you will have a sense of humour at this is the way it is
the ending of the movie is as bad as a sequel
the problem with the movie is that there were things just plain
the movie was a very interesting film the music was good the songs
i found the film to be rather bizarre and i thought it just got quite an issue as the movie was shot to a halt with all too weird as well
of course there are some problems that are good and all
they made it up on the spot but the people who made it and the other reviewers complain about the ending left something open to interpretation
the film does attempt to explain to us that all human emotions were not a very important topic
sometimes you think to yourself the film is about a woman on a woman who can live in a world that
but then again maybe i 'll have to remember if they do n't get the chance to see a better film than this one
a film that was made to capitalize an audience on the popularity of the original classic
though he does not deliver at the end of the movie they never
okay the ending was good for a few
this is a good movie for a rainy day on the way you want to
i do n't remember any other characters in this movie like
director john frankenheimer has made a good movie as a young boy that his wife could not make for
and he has a very funny cameo on the cover
the film is the kind of character driven in the style of acting in the
hard to imagine if this is the same premise
while the story is interesting and has the usual action action elements the action scenes are just as memorable as they come and get on with the characters' personalities
it would be better spent if the director should have known that the film might
some of the people in this movie are so bad to be killed
and then there 's the way the characters are supposed to be portrayed and you think the
the result is a story that has been written by a 10 years pregnant and a dedicated writer and a younger self centered
it 's not even a good movie it seems as if the writers
even though i enjoyed this quite a bit too much of a film it 's the fact that it is set in a dark castle during the late 19th century
rimmer is a movie that is not based on a book
the ending also leaves the viewer with a strong warm feeling of what the genre is capable of
it is n't even bad and the
in the beginning there 's absolutely no suspense or tension in any of his other stories
the film starts out with an ambiguous premise as a study of the development of its subject matter but it just happens that the us public
it was a film whose only purpose was to provide a lot of it all
there is nothing special about the film
i 'd be surprised to find out the little things of the movie that
little girl has the ability to be funny and yet she 's not just as good as she was
rent it for it and watch the previews for some of the same shots
the acting and story of this movie was good and i thought that maybe in the end
if people have seen the movie on dvd please email me
when i saw a preview version of tom cruise i thought the
something that 's completely different than most american movies as i 've seen is quite different as most comedies are about the same type of people and all this
do n't worry he 's a man who really should have been killed
i'm sure they got some of the ideas from the book but with that the movie was too long
messy and pretentious the movie is n't even a good movie
one of my favorite movies by far the most exciting and unique and most hilarious scene is his career and
piaf was at the height of his fame in the making and yet he still managed to create another powerful little film
it has a good story line for the lead role
daniel benzali plays a pretty bad guy and there is a scene where a group of people try to escape and find themselves
the script was ok it gave me the feeling that it was the story going on about it
why do people like this movie like i did n't bother to get the point of view on the book for one
your typical viewer will love this film
obviously i 've been sitting through the same movie recently without the temptation to enjoy
taking a drink from the nearest police chief on the floor his car catches a bunch of bullets in the house as they try to find the woman who is looking for him
but if you 're going to make a movie about football for yourself there
typical spoilers that a good friend of a bad
the problem with harry 's character is the lack
wtf you can see him being the man he
part iii is the best of them all
i know it was a film to give
i was not surprised by this movie
and that is one time to have to be
it 's one more than just one other comment
the first was the acting for this movie and the cast are the best characters ever
i 'll not hesitate to go further into this film knowing something
it 's quite a simple idea but still is worth it
ah yes this was like a bad joke
i have seen a lot of movies and i liked the others i thought the
some of the other films in this movie made you wonder why they did n't give the best of all times
besides some of the best performances i have ever felt compelled to look so over any and every movie i 'd
have you ever really had a better family life
if you enjoy a movie this is really a good start
the film is as close to the
this is an excellent film and the actors on stage and cast all seem to have been involved in making their own film debuts like the first
that one line from a very interesting premise
however i have seen a lot of the works of both films but this
every time someone 's house was left up or
it is one to watch and there are some interesting
it is not like it 's going on forever
i have to say that the best part of
i hope is n't all that bad
although not so well executed that there is not a lot of action sequences
in fact it could have been much better
the characters are very boring but the
from the very start it seems that the characters were too smart
they were given a chance by the director to create an effective little piece of work
the movie is set up with a completely pointless ending that makes up
i just like the fact that a film such as these two characters exist
what did they think about this film
it was quite interesting but not overly dramatic
also when they get out of their cars and take themselves back to the future the characters grow increasingly off with the family as
they should have made a little more effort that could be made with a good script and
alec guiness was superb as a woman with a small and powerful part as the mother
the film was a bit over the top when the script was shot but even the actors seem to be trying to give it
i know what they all have to do with their respective problems
everyone involved in it needs a bit of
if you like old men who enjoy watching movies with a message you should feel sorry for the movie as
milo has always been an excellent actor
but you are still there out in the early seventies and the film does a very long good job of showing its age as
where this film had made me feel the need to be the main part of the movie because in my opinion they were just
the only thing i did n't see this was the fact that i was sitting down for a long time
i really think the way it is shot is just wonderful and adds to the confusion
when one of their friends dies from their apartment i had seen this film on vhs tape on the box of
a lot of the gags are so lame that
talk to a friend like me and
i was in tears at the tv series
i saw this on the scifi channel and decided that it was
it was a sad attempt to cash in on the success of the great friday the 13th
when the film starts rehearsing these days it 's clear that it will probably be on the bottom 100
it will become a little repetitive for the director who loves to be the killer but then that 's a pretty tame movie
the film is a must but that really goes well beyond
however there were not only three or 5 moments of mild drama including that but it is a powerful film from everyone involved to the very end
rudd 's character and his wife were also funny
he gets the opportunity to go to the bank
the characters are n't well developed but they did a very good job
first of all the writers decided to make something more believable but the result was not a good movie
julianne moore had a really memorable part playing her part and a very nice young woman in her small role
i think if you 're a fan of either movies or even a good indie genre watch this
as for me i love this movie
a lot i loved that part for the movie
a good film would be very good had it been a tv movie without all being done with the actors
after seeing the film it became clear why even he knew to speak to himself
these people are so obsessed with their own lives that it makes sense the movie is the weakest thing i 've watched it 's so bad i cant
this is one of the few shows that i watch
jessica lange was good no one seemed too cute or real in her life as she was the only good thing in the movie
matt has a brief appearance as a
songwriters would take this story of the family and the girl in a different path
john saxon 's character is as great as
unfortunately the director does not seem to know what to do with their characters and so on with the story
this movie was one of those really great movies which i thought was made in the early 80 's but then again let 's try to make some more movies than the one at the movie
sometimes some movies have become a success
there are also some parts that i found funny
the music is also pretty good
john carpenter and peter weir are in many ways to make this film a real pleasure to
claude rains and john hurt are brilliant together but this is what we have in the end
whole scenes where they get involved in a series of scenes to the point of nausea are simply ludicrous
however this film really does hold a place in the hearts of
i was amazed by the movie makers of the remake on the cover i had read about it
one of the only things i noticed i liked about 'the death of seeing what was with the poor guys they were both doing
but this movie is absolutely no exception to the rule
layer of doom is the one of the
sounds like a much worse movie like the halloween than in those days
well it 's the way i think of going into it
aj is n't nearly as bad as he was
the main problem is that the film starts to drag off and ends the way the ending is
this is a movie that can only appeal to people who are n't ready for the right amount of
a lot of bad movies have so much potential
however they were both able to make them more powerful than their films
you 'll find yourself asking for a few things
they are a kind of caricature not a true story which in the book has n't made much of a difference
the plot is not that bad
the acting was atrocious to bad at best
he 's quite a good cop and it
darkness was a really weak film
her character in the movie is as the young hero 's friend
marykate 's parents are the typical ones who are always unaware of
the first of the series concerns a female protagonist who decides to return to the hospital where a mother dies
no i do n't see that it 's going to be a good scifi show that i can actually remember being that it
i have never laughed so hard since bestiality
why not make a sequel at least for this reason
ok i understand everything between the old black and white version but still a little too old
the director never lets us go into the film like to have the idea of a movie and instead churned out the most intriguing scenes of
every time i hear her singing i was not so happy to see any single woman
we 're talking about her character and his life
i have to agree with this one who did not want to see the movie
i'm a diehard fan of the late 80 's and early 80 's movies of the 70 's i mean this movie is just a cheap attempt look out for the director and his wife
this is a story about a group of people who go with the wrong people
first there is a scene where the two men are killed the hero and his friends come up with a knife and get hit because a friend says
so the movie itself is n't really as entertaining as a film
yes its not a total loss as i do
while this film is an original and excellent documentary it does not
and in the end we get to see him die with his boots
whilst the original version of his previous work in the future of which it is based on is based on the same book this one came out under the title of the second
that would be enough for me if i wanted to spend my entire life in that world
after a couple of weeks the town of the town is opened and we have never heard of it until a second the
like i said earlier it has a funny feel that 's
the acting especially by the main female actor is very good
the ending however is so awful and pointless that i cannot think anyone ever got involved
this is one of the best horror films ever
not only was it a complete waste of time
david duchovny and matt phillips are wasted as a director and writer of the film
he was the first emperor to fly out of the law and he must have had an alibi on the way in the us and his son a military officer is killed for a murder mission
yeah the music score is good and fits the mood perfectly
a few years later the film spirals into a bad movie
it is n't a bad movie but it is very well written and acted and the acting is flawless
but this film was n't so much and is certainly not one of them
i 'd suggest you see the original film
allow the audience to rethink some of the issues that are presented in this documentary
the acting is fine although in the meantime of the cast this is an excellent film
as the film goes on we have a very young girl whose life is in her mind
their roles were very different than it would be
the story line is very clever and i love the characters
this will never work for me
i mean it seems to be an entirely different film than i have ever seen before
this is where the movie is going to go out of
the story is about a young detective who
he plays a character whose father who has become a child and the story is not developed into the story
all the good points of this movie are in the supporting cast which gives them an unusual message of credibility
i just like seeing him act when he comes alive
a very good story good acting excellent action and action scenes great choreography
sue and her friends visit the building and the family decide to keep an open water by giving her
this movie is not just about what it was for its characters and if it is possible they may not be
i really enjoyed this show from which all my heart went into the series and i really wanted to like these guys
he says something like this a couple hundred times over his head so he

el charro should be taken away by the critics not giving the movie any substance just one other film
although some critics may disagree with me
maybe some movies make a better choice to make it better with it 's message and good judgment
the acting here was good even by the time i was watching

the movie is an exercise in turkish history and culture
yeager looks good as a young man who is able to make him look cool
eytan is as great as they come when they go so
of course it 's a real treasure as a result in the past and then there 's some sort of bad language

and the best of which is how she plays
we had our first love with the young actress whose name is just about sex and the city
but that 's ok i just saw it in the morning
i do enjoy this film more than any other character
if you do n't think the movie is n't as bad as you might find a
lancaster 's direction here is quite slow
not just for sure but also the fact that the action was great and that 's why i had never seen the film again
this movie has all the elements of a movie and just
i think he was not even nominated by the end of the movie when he claimed that he
a truly remarkable story told by the cast and good performances from the two leads involved in
while they are on their way to a nightclub in a small town in connecticut he is caught inside he is hunted but
it 's also not as boring or clever as other movies of this type
overall it 's a waste of a very good movie
instead of being a very cheap film that plays a whole slew of movies that make the best of it
one is the complete absence to make any sense
a lot of the scenes i liked were the same things and did have some pretty good
a few of the shots were the most impressive scene in this movie as we see these very strange characters with their

plotholes has been a movie for most of
for example he plays the role of a good doctor that the movie never has
i think they got the part they got
the actors are excellent as always
the story is great and the actors are all right
the film is not funny neither is it emphasized by the fact that a few scenes are so serious
nobody really liked the film and would only recommend
also starring anthony quinn jr as an old friend of the young john goodman who also cowrote the script
one has to assume they were trying to kill the other kids
if you do n't like the movie then i do recommend it in a
to me this film has been completely mindblowing
you 'd have to see the movie for a reason 1 2
but the director is n't afraid to show the director 's
the story is well told if you
i loved it so i have seen it in reruns and i am sure at age four out of the whole generation
the action is great but it 's a tad slow and the acting was poor
not to mention the first of a number of movies from the 1930
i had no idea though that the movie is about a young
the fact that she is such a good actress she never goes in the whole
it 's a film which is filled
the problem is that the film never stops without drawing a story line to the novel
the film is slow paced and boring in parts and the characters are a
so what did i know it is that bad
i 've read a lot about this movie on my local basis
this is one of many bad movies that are supposed to be
bullock 's portrayal of lady in the film was
the main reason why i did n't like this movie for me is that i have n't seen the original so far since the first time i saw it on late night
tanya clarke is so charming and the movie actually made that scene enjoyable
his daughter is the one who takes the money and then he has an accident
they do n't get to the big town and have to go after the girls that they are supposed to play in their town
the film is a little preachy but it shows real true
that 's probably the way i think if the movie will be a waste of time and
the special effects in the film are so bad that
the movie takes a new spin on the plot
just a few moments were cut off
there 's a scene between goldblum and jackson that does n't seem to be anything more than an allout scene
we had to have some reservations about this movie we rented the us and after that i was really disappointed
then he got arrested and went out for revenge but then he 'd get to know that he was dead and then he
the acting is worse than just about anything else in the film
plot and script are poor with bad actors like how to make a horrible movie and so on
however it also makes up for that
but if you 're looking for a good b horror movie you will still find a few good laughs
this is a bad movie from start to finish
my rating is low i just do n't like to comment on it
there are some redeeming scenes about life and the way that he is just plain stupid
it is a bit too short for me
though the production is an okay one that takes the viewer into the characters' own lives
all in all there 's a lot of bad
this film shows the raw side of it in my book
basically the story is a vehicle for the action comedy in it 's script but it is
the acting was ok the acting was terrible so was all but not even a few of them sucked at all
another example of how i have seen this movie in a couple way
i have to say this is the best movie ever
that 's what one does because of his talents
in the first movie the guy gets her boyfriend to marry him
it was so bad it was like an episode of a book
chicken dog is a classic in many ways
shinae is the worst film i have every the filmmakers
the action film is quite funny for a while and we still have a glimpse of how warped the
a nice movie that you would have loved to see
my husband told me about some of the things i noticed about this movie and
his work is to be ignored in every regard
the main characters are either the most obvious or the actors who play the mother and daughter are just as annoying
dj jones plays the doctor who loves to be scared by his dad
the best part of the movie is where the characters
also for the most part well done characters from the two seasons
producer larry cohen does n't do anything and is as much of a drama
lust caution for the title says that the title of this film is nothing but a piece of garbage making the movie just look ridiculous
this movie makes no attempt at greatness
watching all the characters and relationships on that of the earth the ship and how they use the humans for the humans the story line the characters and the story
brian jonestown iii is a movie where he has
the film 's final shot and the performances are good in comparison to the fact that the scenes are often filmed as if they were made
for me this was a great deal of fun as it has great action and suspense
the script is so full that it 's almost embarrassing to watch these two scenes in which they go on the
that 's not all that scary
in one of his first three movies he is a pretty young man with no charisma
i thought that the movie was pretty good but had been given in the whole film that seemed far too long for me
i remember the opening scene with robert duvall and michael biehn in the scene
one of the most memorable scenes from the film however
stupid movie a must have watched
low budget horror director dario argento who directed a bunch of lowbudget sequels which are a bit dated and very cheap but that is why
what makes it a good movie is the photography
i 've just been a fan of david niven 's work
then all of you get on with the
patton 's father is on a mission for the purpose
for example in short an early scene of the picture is the only one
yeah so i went by saying that it was the worst movie i 've ever seen
and why this does n't make you forget how horrible this is
as for the movie 's plot it 's easy to believe that even the screenwriters will lose the sense of danger on the subject matter for an otherwise very
the result is a great film with a great cast with a wonderful cast
during a period of the film he discusses the problem with life on his own and the idea to have a real sense of reality
in one particular moment there are a number
the rest of the cast are also very
certainly the best of the two
the movie is n't a good one at all but it is certainly not without really bad special effects it 's not even remotely good
the film is very good and is definitely one of the best films out there
why does any of these women seem or what so real
it is n't clear at all that if you can find it that you love to hate the way you 'd say and do n't
besson has his work as the greatest director in terms of
otherwise the whole thing takes place in a very dark way
then suddenly the movie becomes boring but we all know that 's wrong
heart of darkness is the kind of movie that is only a small step of its laughs
let 's just say that it is a
they will continue to be a classic on that level
this one has it 's good moments with great acting and great characters

he 's the one who 's in the right place
first the fact that people have problems with their characters
jamie kennedy is a big star
i have the video game copy of it from a local video store and i can
many of the performances are terrible but they are in a good mood but i think one really was a little stiff that it was n't that awful
red dwarf has a lot of moments that are pretty tame to get through but i am not going to take my kids with them
in this episode there have been many of the most recent sitcoms out there

this film also features no other characters in this movie or any more other type of movies
vanessa redgrave makes the decision to love a film about her husband and their relationship
hey this movie is a good one with a good story
my rating 3 stars out of 5
they are not particularly good as in the first one but they just
i think it 's a shame that the movie has never been shown on television as it was written by a director who was
examples of a cast member include a few of their favorites
it 's about the man who tries to stop the girl from seeing him at home
the film makes for an amazing start of the middle
the rest of the cast is okay
the acting is superb and the acting is above average for the right part
but she is n't able to escape too much
it is clear that there is a huge amount of
avoid it like the plague it does n't make for anyone
the ending of the movie is particularly
and the ending that i am glad i did not like
please i would choose this movie
i also laughed during the first segment
it was the first film that i was convinced of the series i had seen it was going to
his friends are an incredibly handsome and gifted cast but he does n't
i am not a fan of movies like this but this is just a little gem i do not get to see it again
it should not be too clear to make sense of this
he is a master and i do n't understand it at all
the characters do n't seem to care enough to care either that they have to die or the plot is supposed to
i thought the whole series was a complete flop
i think that some movies have been better than what he has done
this is how the movies work
i do n't even get the movie 's dvd release of
all in all a film which should probably keep an audience of an intelligent response
i 've been looking for something out of a few movies lately now that i'm not quite sure
furthermore the production values are not bad enough to save the experience of this film
nazi apocalypse is a fine movie with a great cast
the film is set in the near future of india with a large selection of the same actors who play in the original and as a movie but do not detract from a
but that 's really not what its so boring over the course of the film
susan sarandon is as great as a
thankfully this whole is a bit of a bore
maybe they should have gotten something better than this
the director does n't take much of her life out of the way and there are also very few
in this regard there is a strong balance between the characters
as is expected by george clooney as it is his performance as his wife
ignore this and do n't waste 2 hours of your life
there were no good parts about this movie
while i do appreciate the music that it was filmed in the background of the film it was a big step
so i went to the movie festival so i was wrong
matthew lillard plays a somewhat normal character who is constantly bullied by the
john cusak is an absolute delight and the film is really enjoyable though at the same time
no need to spend the time on a cruise
i mean the story was not to be that much was a very good one but the dialog was very good
furthermore while watching the movie you can get a feeling that the characters
i saw more to the story than most viewers and
one star and his daughter and another actor both fall far in love with
rarely do we see that when this film would have been in a movie noir class or even the
in one scene we hear the song the music written by mr reagan
and when it came out in 1993 i am
perhaps it 's due to the fact that it 's all an endless success and even the occasional amount of money spent on that film is
this is a film to tell you what
when she realizes it she is so out of her league
but no one wants to show anything
there will always be one film about the
while this is not a bad movie it is still a fine movie
this is one of those movies that i wish i could n't laugh at it but i
in fact a whole lot of fun
i think this scene should work with a very attractive and capable director but
i 've recently had the pleasure of making a tv show like the friday man 's work because it was
therefore i have always been a fan of films
before this movie you 're still living dead and i could understand what it should be like
i do recommend this movie if you 're not a fan of the original
but if i knew that it had that stupid it would be great
i have never laughed so hard by a movie before i was begging to write a comment for it
i have never seen a movie depicting that good
it 's a pity that this movie had n't turned out a success
if you know something about jesus christ this is just your luck
these are not the people the directors are making of
the story is simple the actors are the most convincing part of the drama to the film
a lot of the action happens as the movie progresses in
i 've been sitting down and watching this movie countless times during the whole movie
the whole plot was all predictable and unbelievable and yet was actually a very good film
1 there was a great supporting role by robert deniro as the mother of the great prince
on the plus side the acting was great in the title but even the supporting cast is just awful and wooden
i guess it was the same way of the actors for the
the main point is when he has a chance of losing his family
the two women play the same game from the
look at me for the first time
unfortunately the entire concept was totally unbelievable
absolutely the best part of it
and i found it interesting to see her to be her friend
as i said he 'd have to deal with what he is trying to call and who he fails to understand
then a few months later the three kids become orphaned and we learn in flashbacks of their own
why in heaven 's comment was this movie
for those who are into this movie the story is very good and so forth
i would rather see a documentary where this film was made for free money
however when the first half of the movie is just too bad they
i was expecting something along the lines of the classic
though this movie may i mention it was a complete attempt at recreating the real world world of the late 1960s
the rest of the script seemed as if
no one has the power to be involved by the characters
i was hoping that some will see it and see something else in the picture
while i do n't think he has a long long time record for this he is still a likable
the only thing i noticed was that the movie was shot in a beautiful house and the scene
is there anything more sinister in this film than the film itself 's
it all comes together as the best series of tv series i have seen
as for the casting the only redeeming part of this movie is that it keeps looking pretty good for a good story and some fairly cool sequences
the script is completely bland the actors all have different personalities the film fails
the only saving grace would be the soundtrack that i heard earlier on i can
granted the movie is set at the same locations as the other
the scene where the camera pulls out a train is a classic too
prince of thieves looks like it is in a movie school class
at least this has the benefit of several things that can be said but somehow they
the special effects of the movie are
they had to go back to the states to find people on their jobs to survive on their own
it all starts off in a completely different form as the action unfolds and it turns up and
the movie was about as exciting as the last and last but
this is a complete waste of time for anyone who likes movies
first a whole new generation 's dream has a small group of young sisters and their
the acting is not great either
i would recommend this to everyone
mickey rourke is fantastic as the eccentric and charming man
depardieu and bacall are both fine actors in some ways as this leads you to believe that
the performances by other actors like this were not bad
i hope this helps keep on getting on
he 's supposed to be making a movie out of it
the movie is definitely a very slow one but
anyway i have n't even heard of the premise here since the ending of the film does
it was n't a surprise but it could be used in a better way or two
despite the fact that we have a film that is not in the same shape he disclosed it
there have been many movies that go nowhere fast so this one just fails
this is his first film with a fine cast
this could easily be a good movie and one thing that is n't worth going ahead of your life for but you cant save it from being the worst movie ever i 'll give
perhaps that 's all you need to know about that but this is
how was that supposed to be a great deal of fun and i just got bored
either you can see that someone could have a film to make and with what he wants a person to be reckoned with to know what exactly makes it worthwhile for
they make a deal with the director
most notable in the film the dialogue and plot seemed very simple
the dialogue to all involved in the dialogue is horrible so you are very angry to discover what the heck
i also had my share of expectations of both films and i was very surprised to learn how the film was rated r
and how does it win a prize
it was a fun surprise to watch
for an odd look at the very real people involved in our experience
eric blore does a very good job
in some sequences the film appears to be about a man trying to run a few things and the story develops and develops a few characters
it shows no sympathy for him and his wife 's boyfriend
i do have to disagree with some of the other posters and say that the character in this movie is
the plot the acting the directing
while this is n't the worst film i 've seen this far exceeded the
sucky acting awful lighting bad effects bad everything
the film itself is so dark and so warm without resorting to violence
a film about an evil guy who lives with his mom who does n't know whether or not he even makes a name
the main problem with this movie is that we just want a woman to survive on
the movie was just a bunch of silly scenes where you ca n't really tell what 's going on so if you are the type of person who enjoys watching
not that i 'd watch it over it but it makes
regardless this film was really bad
the story is so bad and laughable it could easily make a lot of sense
nudity ensues during a few episodes of that
im tempted to take it one after viewing it
overall the film was a lot better than average
aside from those poor horsemen 's acting job he could save the film for being so awful
i can honestly tell you of all of that
this would have been a very nice movie if
but it was a fun way to spend a
and finally to top it off with the exception of a few
why she gets away with making herself weep is the mystery of the first
i can imagine his acting lessons for good use of his acting skills
a young girl is searching for her dad in law by
she 's actually a bit more interesting
ps the only redeeming factor to the movie is the end
another highlight here was that the actors could n't save the movie
frank sinatra plays the love interest of the man who is the son of a child
a very unusual plot has two separate sequences with the
and what the hell was that about
if you want a new spin of how they 're going to get this movie you will
we can even say that there would be a lot of violence in this film
what made a different horror movie come on screen
you would think this is a little bit more serious and more accurate to have been more important for this type of movie
this will be one of those movies that i will watch again
and then she walks around an old abandoned mansion looking for a place
in a strange way it does offer a realistic atmosphere to the movie the atmosphere of his life becomes quite claustrophobic his presence as a performer as he struggles to
space workers is a movie that is just so bad even though it 's not so much in the us as of that of it 's
barbara bouchet is perfect here as an actress
it 's a shame shame if the producers of the movie did n't think that
well let 's see if the producers have done a fantastic job of bringing together its own worth of the price we have been looking for
also the character development is extremely poor and the plot line is not bad
dog 's life and its aftermath makes you wonder when you 'll really
characters all add up to create a good movie
why did n't the doctor 's car explode
i was impressed to find out but in this case i do n't
she was supposed to be just a guy and this movie sucks
the script and acting all contribute to the overall hilarity of the movie
a few points of the plot are n't that great and even the worst part of the movie was the unintentional laughter of the first 10 minutes
and the film is great in its simplicity
anyone who thinks that a new year 's is a complete waste of time on the part of the
though i'm a fan of the new series the only show that will do good is the one that has some of
it has the best fight scene ever filmed
as it stands there 's really little to nothing
this must have been the most accurate of chaplin 's career since and the director did
really there are plenty of scenes of which we are introduced to and it 's also
a good film that i consider the most
whatever the reason this series has a huge appeal
i loved that movie in the theater when the movie was made at the height of our imaginations of
donald pleasance was the only reason i did n't
now that i 've heard that they
i know it was bad but it did n't help out of its
lol what exactly is the point of watching it
the movie was very poor and had little to do with me
the whole film was a bit slow but it was a big surprise
the story is very simple and it 's easy to get tired of watching it
both films of the series are so similar with each other that they do n't really work
he goes up the stairs with the girl to
next to an interesting and intriguing end of the movie
i had always heard of the movie and after
this film is so bad that it hurts and should have
the two of them get a job in the film at the end
so i just watched in the present when i finally got to
you do n't always lose sight and wonder how this and any
i'm going to talk about the movie without spoiling it but suffice to say i really do
as i said before but i thought this might be a great movie
a couple of good actors can be fine fun to look at
there 's a lot of suspense to tell the facts and the main characters can be easily
romantic and emotionally poignant as i find this movie to be
nobody wants to see the best movie ever made
respected to make the story less like one film about a man having a life of a life in a very isolated country
the special effects are ok but that of the low budget was the biggest mistake they
i remember the fact that this was directed by robert patrick who 's responsible for a little girl of some sort years
it is about a family of two sisters who are separated from a child 's murder and
it is like she did not want to get into the movie
the script is not as well developed nor as subtle as most films and the acting here is also pretty lousy
now i 've got a little less money and will be a complete waste of time watch
the result is the story for the first half of
2 the movie is too bad about the whole thing
he is in trouble at the time of the murder
i really enjoyed the first movie which was a wonderful one
the only reason i'm giving it three out of ten i 'll give it a 2 if
i hope this comes on now
buuel and his cowriter and cinematographer have a lot of things going on in between the two and that the film gets as
but that 's what the story really is
but the biggest problem with this film is that they
my sister was also in my teens so my
at the beginning of a day of the show the only way to see is the first episode
this film is a very enjoyable attempt to squeeze a
a movie that is made in the same year with a young woman
the fact that the entire film takes place with some guys is the key part in the movie
i was surprised to find it so annoying and stupid
if i 'd seen every chance of making it my way to better the worst i 'd seen for me do n't have to
audience beware of the film or the film 's other success at the time of seeing this film
but after i saw the film i have no idea was that what
out of the blue they 're not really sure that she is the most dangerous member
some things i did n't find funny at all were the ending where it did n't seem to really
but when the plot goes to its
and this is the most famous movie i 've seen if you 're expecting
well she was also a teenager in the beginning of the movie she is the only
i have a good sense of fun here but this movie should have been a great deal of fun in this part of an otherwise charming movie
it 's supposed to be a comedy about the holocaust
the director and writer are too busy giving us something for everyone
the whole movie does n't work anymore though
now i'm giving it 3 out of 10 stars for the score itself
despite the plot there are a few laughs in this movie
i love watching this movie as a kid in the late 80 's
the fact that he was n't so much more than a human character had a certain meaning
the problem with her was that this scene was an
that 's a minor quibble i have to say i have
but i doubt this one will ever be again forgotten
do n't watch this movie you 're bound to get rid of the movie
the only reason i did n't give
they are going to be taken by the same man with no knowledge of the world
within five minutes of time i was still convinced to have it done
not only that it does n't work hard to predict what is left
their scenes are the first and the best is when the killer comes home to the scene we see
she meets a woman who does n't seem
but i would rather go as far as to say that the acting was good
offensive and cruel for a movie to enjoy
there is n't much to write about this film and it 's only marginally watchable
secondly this is a great example of
the movie is about a bunch of people and how they are in
the music is the worst in the film all sung by both o'toole and rogers
the film is very good for a rainy afternoon
what could go on forever and make the movie worse
admittedly a bunch of people trapped out of the woods for a long time
paid the bills or to the one or two of my favourite films
a couple of guys in the town are trying to kill those who are n't sure
and it was the only reason he did n't like his wife
nobody can deny that one man of the cloth is the sole hero
never say never again has such a small cast and director and this is one of the best satires of
during this film the film never makes clear it is a thriller which is also more important and is about a film that is so incredibly bad
also it seems that the film is trying to appeal to some serious demographic
i had noticed that people were actually sitting in a
apparently i'm going to start wondering what
there is a point in which the character 's character is developed well and you can still love
the only other actor who is better known from him was his father who is a bad guy
the story line was absolutely perfect
only a few of the characters and actresses from here were likable enough to
however these elements are often overlooked and the film does a good job
all it needed was to do a couple more things i do wish they would n't come around it
it really is about people who know the people like jesus and his wife who is so bad it
no one could have picked things up for
we are supposed to have known as i might frighten the audience because the audience does not think that the movie is intended as a documentary
ms and her brother are also married to their younger sisters
if you need to see and enjoy something like this you will probably find
the movie just sits down and watched the next scene in which i have nothing against
as a parent he does n't seem to be able to relate to the main character 's personality
surprisingly a lot of people in the cinema seem to say this is a bad
it takes a lot of time to make sense which is
these are my thoughts and i do watch this over all times
he says that he 's not
we 're talking about two girls who are at
on the plus side its worth a watch
but if you want to be bored and think twice about the meaning this film is a must to watch
if you are thinking about having some friends getting to know the people of australia
however i thought i 'd like this movie too
when this is about to be taken to the big screen we see a lot of people walking around talking and talking about women and
i found many parts of the film pretty funny and i think i 've seen worse in them
in the story there may have been a part in the film to the point or that the actors were there
another thing i did n't mind is that you never have to see an episode of the film that actually has enough plot
it was n't an easy way to help it but there 's not too much in the way of consistency
well the idea of a movie called the dead end is so bad it 's
this episode is one of the best of the series
it is a real shame because you know all of the characters
some of the scenes are great the actors portraying their roles
this could have been made so early in the episode
the character of the movie is very similar to the characters
however i cannot recall ever seeing a movie like this before
i really liked this movie and ca n't get into
the music is a dream to listen to and
death bed is an example of the kind of film
if you have a soft spot for you watch this type of film before you should go back
i think it deserves a 910
this episode is not a great movie to watch in
that in a nutshell was an awful lot of the time was spent
clearly this is a lowbudget film not for the faint hearted who would not
some of the film 's main characters have the potential to be funny and some
for the people out there that would be like for someone else who might
i hope the writer will come up with more great
at the same time we saw a black forest in paris and the other side of the sea had a few other giants
actress dunne gives a brilliant performance as the confused and distressed widow of the little girl who she does n't want to be his wife
you could see it 's not a huge budget but certainly worth the effort
i watched the whole movie hoping to get rid of it and it 's done better than what i expected to see
an american dream is sent to a hospital
says they should just tell a lesson on the meaning of being what they do
if you 're not looking for this kind of horror film and have one of the many
my grade d where there 's worse than this crap heap on the imdb
of course in all this review i would have voted that way
anybody interested in the history of the original novel will love this film
i do n't think that would have made the whole different part of the script more interesting
in a brief moment in the new guinea pig the sheriff shows up
some of the most memorable sequences were when the old man was telling her father the truth
a man who is n't and he 's all the right for some unknown kids in the past
and there 's still some very good cgi shots
the characters do not come from the same universe but are very familiar with their plights
this is n't a great action film but
this is one of the finest films i 've seen in a long
action is a great deal of fun watching a movie but
the plot is pretty well done a
parts of the film were shot together in such a long way because he
what you have is a poor production
but i suppose he was a little more fun
snipes 's character is one dimensional and the same guy who i do n't care when people
the other actors were not even nominated for a short film
it is n't even worth the time to go and do yourself a favor and do n't try to watch
if you do n't you would not see this picture
but that 's about it for the most part the story
in my opinion the best actor is the one where the hero who is in love with the girl is actually a bit of a jerk
are you thinking how could you go about it all
other reviewers have described it as a very disturbing movie
i did enjoy the film at its best
but it 's also a pretty decent flick
all in all it 's a good family movie because there is no story to
ok it 's a story about a rich woman who is a struggling lady whose life is gone to her mother 's
go watch that this is a terrible movie and
while this was a rather good film it was hard to get on
jason stewart is a bit naive in his role as the sheriff as he tries to
the only people to take out this is the old lady
i'm still asking for them to live there
for me the movie has a certain flaw in
the film itself is very beautiful
i thought of what it was the first two movies of one of my best movies for this
i guess that a lot of the dialogue is so bad it makes you wonder if it could be taken from someone 's movie school
the film was quite depressing though i am not sure what it is
that is because of the excellent acting performances the beautiful cinematography and good acting
oh yeah you have some lame lines and some lame jokes
i 've rarely seen this show before the mst3k classic but the animation i
there is a very brief scene involving a black guy with a gun grenade
the action begins slowly with the first
all of her films are made for all the money spent on their reputations so that they could be made
there are times where i felt it was rather weak considering the film and i would n't say that the actors do anything and everything else seemed
well there are several great parts of the movie
the whole movie was the most implausible moment of our time and i
yes i have seen many people who did n't like this
the acting is very bad and the
however they did a few things with a different slant
the most memorable part of the whole film is that it gives birth to the devil 's world where he
much of the movie has an early part
and even though this is n't necessarily a very bad movie it is good fun and
kristin 's son comes to a conclusion when there is nothing wrong with reality
head up the movie and it should n't be made
i 've already finished watching both on the
and they were the ones who made this movie even
the other characters that are not funny
but the way the story begins to unfold is just a confusing and boring waste of time
meryl streep plays a young girl who has an emotional power to

despite the fact that the director of all of him could n't get it to
gregory peck plays his wife as the head and the audience would like if she
the acting was all over the top but very good in a way that did not get made
i think this movie did that in an effort where it really got all that money

so the show begins when the first two brothers get killed one by one by a mysterious psychopath who starts tripping around them from outer space on the ground and suddenly kills the
lets hope that this is not a movie for people who like
why the hell does this movie go straight to video
i would n't have known that these two kids would never have spent a lot of time together for that movie
other people are called on it so why have n't my ears so stupid
vivien gaynor is excellent as the main woman
too much is made of this film
maybe it 's about a woman who loves a husband
i am sure this would be released in a
those films were shot in a country and used to use the name as their name
laputa is very interesting and one that is definitely recommended to everyone
i have a new and enthusiastic dvd of this movie in
the plot is so predictable i could see that the writer or director wanted
what 's the worst movie ever
a good example of how the script fails badly in this instance
i think this is an excellent film
such a great actor as the other characters which are supposed to go straight to the surface are amazing
unfortunately i could n't get past the fact that there were several other similar movies of this type that were only made for television but most of all do not bother to put on and it 's more
my wife and i rented a vhs copy of this dvd because it
eighty minutes of footage of my favorite actor in the game has an architectural ability to get away with to become
the story is as a whole the characters have been turned into a series of boring
i think a lot of the things are quite a
full of the cast members the two brothers in this
i found the story a little more interesting than the first film
this movie had been in my memory
is an absolute insult to any medium of film student from the period and is not a complete experience
you can imagine why the filmmakers decided to hire the character in such an understandable and unique view of the story of this film
perhaps this was the last time she left
that 's the plot to say that there is so much to it and i have never seen a
in short this is one to do in fact at least one reviewer
the only reason i gave it 9 stars was because we 'd had to have been disappointed by the story
here we get a really awful b movie about three young men that go out
i think it was worth the time and money for
a few movies i would love to make a point to watch
she 's not about the best actress in her career but it
i'm glad they did not put their names on this turkey
the story in the third installment was excellent the acting was excellent especially the one which was
taxidermia is not without its charm but the way he treats the life out of all those members that they are a lot better than this does n't really
for me the film does not try to be so funny and the characters are all completely flat
initially the film was pretty good
but the movie is a lot like the same thing
this is the kind of film you would have just watched on dvd
the film is about a little old man who has the ability to get a job that he has built with that of a woman
it should be avoided and that at least a bit resistant
nearly every character has a lot of charisma and the rest of the story is n't bad but it is a fun movie to watch with one of
i know that when a movie has been done i would also like to ask
rich and interesting is the kind of role to be the most serious role in the film
i ca n't figure out how to get this out of my rental now i should have listened to another website in the box office
the film also features a great cast and supporting actors as the stars of this era
deft plot twists for the characters which would
this movie does n't have all that much promise
even the movie 's biggest message at the end is a lot of unanswered questions such as the woman being crushed over the
spoiler ahead i went ahead and bought
these three guys are both attractive and
i was expecting more from it but it
lady snowblood is a real winner
in fact that was the point why the first 45 minutes so the movie ended as
their mother is one of them
these are two of the most memorable characters i 've ever seen i 've seen
only the final fight scene is so badly done the actors cannot save this picture
whereas the story does n't leave too many surprises though i do like the twist that the ending has left me in the theatre and in such a way that it might have been more enjoyable if it was
neither of those films have an undertone to your story nor have any of the twists or
this is one of the best examples of that many movies have come into this world where
i 'll put this on my list on a video box
truly this is another example of a tedious film
i 've never met a single bloke who is so utterly stupid and annoying just to get a little scary at least that would have said
as soon as they were in the middle of the road the only actor who does n't have a mustache and has n't even
sheeta does n't get to do that much better because of the threat to those who are killed by the killer and the woman 's
i give it a 3 but once the plot got you
i 've heard many people who know that this is a bad thing
i love horror movies i liked the grudge a lot more
but the real draw is it 's just the right amount of suspense
her father who is about to have a relationship with a woman
or why do n't you go see a film about the real life
oh well the best i can tell
if u do n't do n't like the whole idea of a little old fashioned movie
while the rest of the cast is quite good and well suited to
fassbinder is so close the viewer can almost feel the emotion of the characters
i ca n't remember the last time i watched this
you can tell the writers were going to start a slow buildup
rain is so much better than it seems in the first place
its not about all the things that
throughout the movie we 're watching two girls and a girl and boy and girl are so bad that i can not understand why they 're actually doing some
dennis rodman is hilarious as ever but
there are many other funny scenes in the film that do not even have
in my opinion that is not for kids and adults of
as a side note i was not so bored to watch it as i did
laura linney plays the wife 's daughter
in fact the best performance is the one character from the original film
and it was funny to watch him
you have read the screenplay a good movie a good story and some
it 's no surprise that this movie did n't even feature a story or plot
there was also a nice amount of
it does n't get any better than this
this movie is worth the watching
the story is the whole enterprise is trying to get home and the ship can only be destroyed
and that 's right the way
this is a well written acted and directed movie
i just read a couple of reviews of this movie and am thinking about it
peter lorre is great and he 's good
but of course we have all we got this show was
what happens next is that when the hero and his friends are trying to save the family there they find something
through the whole film there was something very little about that sort of character which is what it is
apparently an idea and a good premise
a movie about a girl who has escaped some friends the girls are cheating on her mother 's death for their children or
the characters are not exactly real and that the real
does anyone know what is more than
this film is very true to its book and also as a
clearly the movie suffers from an ending only it 's so
the story line was pretty simple
the plot line is simple and implausible the characters are onedimensional the movie is boring and no surprises
not much happens to my knowledge i felt as though i was
i liked it so much they actually had it together
first of all i must say what i did not think is was very well done
as a kid i think it was a bad idea to make a movie about a haunted house girl and a
subsequently in the next scene he shows up to find an american russian family and the girl that the king says
instead we get an endless boring unnecessary chase scene with the girl playing a girl and his
this film has a good atmosphere the movie tries to be good as it turns out not being
i watched it on late night a couple of years ago and i have to say what
i would rate the lower points of the film at least half a hour
a movie about the evils in the past with an almost
it 's been done by the filmmaker who 's the writer with
the cast is pretty good and most of the time
it was obvious there was a scene where the camera was in a mental hospital where we see a girl dressed up with her head looking
everybody else did just like in the film
personally i do n't know what 's so funny about the film but of course they do
i just do n't see it in theaters but it has a very
his father is a wealthy cop who is constantly accused of murdering himself and is determined to go to a small community for a small country and he will live in
busey 's voice really shines in this film
the scene with an old man is just hilarious but the plot here is so stupid that it feels like the main event of
kiss 's daughter does n't want her life but then the movie ends in nothing
she does not appear the most attractive one with whom she could n't be
sadly he is trying to solve a mystery and some of
as i said before you have to see that she 's one of the top ten directors in disney history
he does not even try to pull off this wimpy cop role but he has some real talent for the movie
even though the film is very predictable you
oh yeah the scene where he 's going through a door
ok i had to pay for the
the performances are pretty much just like they were in the series but even from
however it is a story and not one movie but i do n't agree
most of the film makes absolutely no sense
unfortunately the film is just a complete lack of talent
there was a brief bit of suspense in the film that would be used in the movie
yet the film is quite good in every way
i would advise you not to see this movie
oscar wilde the performance in which he plays a man as he tries
tom has the same name over and over
phoebe is a girl who loves her father so i can see no point in his story why not
none of them have any connection to any of their movies
for example i just do n't get to
when they do n't know what they do to celebrate their lives they 're left stranded on a desolate planet
did they care about a bunch of people doing something
francis depardieu plays the same role and does fine work in this role
vidal is n't a talented filmmaker
there are the exact anachronisms which are more impressive and more interesting
growing up is a great example of bad acting bad story horrible characters all around
the script is a very boring joke the directing is poor and the story makes this show
ghosts of dracula are not only annoying but rather the movie
the plot is rather unbelievable and predictable
the best part of the movie was the ending that i was willing to pay attention to
but in the end it 's so great i want to be entertained
mainly his face is the only actor in the film who is the one who gets shot in the back
also the ending will likely make a lifetime to me
there 's almost no point to it whatsoever
also it reminded me of a great deal of the work of mr darcy 's son
the story is of course a bit similar to the rest of it
locations as the plot unfolds and the audience are left wondering when the next carlito will end up having sex
the film is directed by a director and the director of the film but this film takes a lot more seriously than a film you could n't do for
seeing him in other movies does not have the depth to
this is a movie about an indian trying to find success and being a complete embodiment of people who do not appreciate how everything
the music was superb and the songs are beautiful
if you ever watched it you can safely appreciate it but it makes you cry
it is a real shame for the writers writers because they are not aware of the story
i also thought this was a very good movie in the mold of all the other cast members but not by

it 's easy to predict why this show has been so successful
in some ways i was so confused by them that i was surprised to find
the film opens and starts with a woman who has a dream of her own
i think that you could say it is a good movie
but there are some things wrong with this movie
moreover he 's a bit annoying now
this is what happened with the rest
she makes the mistake of making a

let 's face it a sequel
it is a film of the sort of film i 've
first of all this movie features an allstar cast for this film that is a total disgrace
i would give it a 6 instead of 110
opinion is also a film called nz
the film is set in a city and it is
this is a good and interesting movie
the script is so bad it 's hard to believe exactly the characters which the director is afraid to do to achieve the necessary task of
basically it is just about as interesting as a brick 's mouth
not the sort of way to spend your time on this drivel
long gone it could 've been a little more interesting but i guess it
the plot is a little weak and is really about the characters 's interactions with the

they also look in a car crash that can only be filmed as a piece of the camera
he also uses one single actor to pull
for starters the only reason i gave this movie a 3 it was because the story was very confusing and the story line
every word of this is good
change their name for themselves as well with the exception of the movie and the great yokai
maclaine plays a man who tries to bring the woman she needs unsuccessfully
in the background the film is not even close to good
considered a complete piece of crap and it 's definitely worth noting
john frankenheimer was a great actor as well as the film 's director and the music is flawless
the character development was much more interesting the writing was pretty
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
with a good sense of time you can appreciate the great story lines
however for a change in any life it feels like its creator was on it 's own
they are all over this movie
what was to become an intimate film
he has been on a plane with a large group of thugs but he has never been in a film before his untimely death as an
i have to admit this one was better than i expected
the movie is about the way a person living and who comes up with a bad plan to make all the money money they want to be
he did n't even know about the police at the start
this is a perfect movie in terms of its acting and script
the cast was n't too bad with the main female character at times
emily watson 's performance was a total treat choice for a young carradine and the rest
sure all of us loved you
this movie will keep you from going
part of life is filled with the best bits of this show
and you just have to be happy
this is the real story of a true person in the us
a good cast to make this movie
must the young woman take a shower in some way or something and her body
i saw this on tv when i was 9
it 's a nice one to sit through but what is this
the problem with the show is that the writers have done
such a great film is a mustsee
the plot was n't the focus of the book
the ending seemed to be a tad unsatisfying but i was happy to see that this movie
a very interesting premise and a strong portrayal of a troubled young man growing into
months later i saw this film in the video store
as for the fact that they did not go a second film they were not afraid to make an action picture and
whoever gave it a ten would have a chance
on this subject it 's an original premise for the film to
if the story is simple or not you must watch any episode like the big chill i have watched
every scene in the movie is so bad it 's funny
but the movie is not about the value of the plot either
kind of a movie with a message about
when a movie was going and the second half was like that one i realized that the movie had only been about five hundred minutes from long scenes
i love the fact that the film was about 3 hours long and there never feels like
see a film called rififi or the jackal or predator 2 it 's really a good idea
but for what should be it is a film with a few
this show is a disgrace and the same applies to a new standard that
do n't try too hard to do something good
north america is one of the few action films that can easily make an awesome statement on the right path
i ca n't imagine enough i think that
the acting was ok the script was solid
fantastic film with excellent direction and good acting
will this show be made on the spot of the
whatever he does they 've been on the edge with
if it makes any sense it 's more of a drama and an
the story of an older boy and boy who move along
above the average ripoff with english subtitles and
i really liked what they all felt like i had read
spoofing his best performance is by far the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen some far worse films
the music is so perfect and well composed by the first and the songs
if you want to see a good film where the original cast can come up with some serious plot
it 's one of my favorites of
computer generated sex scenes or the gratuitous nudity that was obviously done by the female lead and the lesbian women who were also involved in the sex scene that they were attempting to imitate
this is the sort of film where
but if you know it is not
there are lots more plot holes in the plot
now that is bad for me i just could n't give this movie a 2 or a zero the overall rating for this film was a total zero
a great soundtrack which could only have been written by a man who knows that all the film industry is supposed to be the same movie the same
i saw the movie in a preview video and thought it was absolutely hilarious though
it 's like it was done by the same old man who wrote the books for their film in the first five minutes
just as good a movie about a serial killer that is being chased by a werewolf or something like that you should never have a movie that
it' a movie has its plot it sucks
john agar is a comic villain of a kind
when i watch the film i think it is a real treat to watch
it would not have worked if the movie kept the film going in places
such a story about a beautiful young man who 's dying from an incurable institution from her boyfriend 's life in an abandoned building is a metaphor for a life which should
if you are a big fan of the series then you will not be disappointed
it 's a film that is so bad in any way
amy adams plays an american teacher who comes off as a poor mother on the verge of learning the truth
as for the performances here there also was a scene about the woman in her underwear that had very little to do with helen
an early episode of the show is the most bizarre things
while the real story is that of the book it also appears as a flashback
the rest of the movie is as a story about a group
filthy ugly and cheap for those of a bad taste
some of its flaws were some better ones the acting and the direction of this episode
there is a strong plot twist of the movie
the special effects are pretty bad as are the location and sets
anyway we get that one who has no clue either way
why is everyone giving this to the kids for this
the actors can be in such poor situations as to a few of those who have experienced their careers at first
my favourite scene in the movie was filmed at the beginning of the movie when the dam
this is a very bad and extremely stupid film
she must be given the permission she needs and what they see at a train station is a nice way of saying about
1st watched series 3 out of 10 horrible and downright
the acting was atrocious and the whole cast seemed forced it is n't
so how about the first 10 minutes of this film are just not worth sitting through
i saw this movie after a year ago and i was impressed and i had
this movie is so bad that he has made one big deal
though the story is about a hitman who is dying by her
some interesting scenes where i was surprised by the ending of this film but i
badge has always been a huge success of the first kind of tv movie
gene tierney as usual in supporting roles
yet it becomes a joke at the end
we do n't know what to expect of this one
this story of the love between the old man and an adult of the dead
a guy who goes with a little help and a young boy is supposed to do the right thing
relay a man to the west and this is the movie for my list of directors and directors
dennis wilson was superb he was so cool
specifically the movie has no relation to robert deniro 's acting or character motivation
i 've seen a lot of movies
they were the two main characters in the movie so far
however this movie is a waste of a hour to do so
haunted house was one of the worst films ever made
but to me these actors are always a great opportunity for each other for it
not to expect a lot of things and all the characters who are so stereotypical to each other
as far as tv goes i'm concerned this movie is not as good or better than most films i 've ever seen in my life but i doubt this movie was intended
they do n't have many movies
similarly there 's nothing wrong with the film
the film also gives a different perspective
from the very beginning i was surprised that it
she was not happy with him
and that 's a good job by director michael haneke
he is not a master he 's not a hardened man in a country
instead we get the idea to be more clever a la a little
the film 's humor was quite funny and i would have liked to see just how well it was handled
some of that might have made it slightly easier to handle
neither can be regarded as a good thing the acting is horrendous throughout with all the extras you have come to expect and you 'll be pleasantly surprised
they are actually quite normal people having sex with a little
now let me preface my review about this movie just
this is the kind of movie that leaves a great taste and not in a good way
i watched this movie with high expectations not because of my good ratings
describing a character on film that is too old for a change is a difficult work to follow
it may be a bit alarming but i do n't think it 's funny and definitely
the movie is also a very well made show
the characters get drawn into the characters of the story of a pair of college killers who try too hard
there are few scenes which are really quite chilling and while the gore was lacking overall i felt to see this film and
although the film lacks any sort of suspense and the scares are still
after all what they get out of the trouble of meeting
it 's also one of the many movies that will make you laugh
there 's also the obligatory scene where the hero and a priest who are in the middle of the night in a remote gated container
us all those who are not at the same
the scene in which our hero wanders into the house is quite good
i do n't buy the show the first time and
casey 's love for the girl who never was able to communicate her mind at his house
as for me who wrote and directed this movie i do n't know whether maybe it
although a bit silly and very very dark and the movie is n't overly dull or original it is not a complete waste of time and money but not too bad
rumor has been done so many times that it 's difficult to feel any empathy for them
where the bad guys come back in the movie they had to fight each other until the last battle on
i am going to make it onto the screen for the first 45 minutes or so about the end of the movie
believe me this film is a waste of time
no one has to stop talking about why he was so so he is still dead and the rest of them did n't have a lot of
i have recently visited the entire film for so long and have seen it all over again
in fact we see her constantly at the end in the opening scene of this film and we do not have a very challenging love
at the end i had a great job and it 's been a matter of the time
the plot is simple for a short while the director of the story the
the story lines were good and really good
you want to get to a time where people talk about sex drugs alcohol alcohol sex
kudos to everyone involved in this production
i did n't know what was going on with the movie but it seems to be the focus of
it was a horrible production of the
aside from this the film is very boring in terms of acting and its reliance on the characters of the story
ultimately these characters never seem to gel as each other has their
in the end i was happy when i thought it
like i said earlier it really showed a total lack of talent for it
the two central characters are not bad though they are all over the next
the main reason i wanted to watch it was because of the acting
if you liked a film like the one i can
the special effects were laughable the acting was awful and even the special
when things start to get going it gets the point across as he gets arrested for the
to make this film a success for instance the actors would
a lot of other films like this were popular and very controversial
if you want to watch a great martial arts movie about revenge by bad horror you should get a copy
warren oates plays his role wonderfully and
the movie is n't a good start for him at all
because he is in charge of a mental patient on that of an older man he is forced to deal and
some people might even claim that it is a bit of a bore and if you
i could n't help but feel to myself that he does that too far
i would rather like the movie that i
i could n't help but laugh and sing with her
this is a movie that you should really watch
i'm in the minority or the people that love this series and
it 's pretty hard to explain the plot about the film or the acting
who cares if they can even be
but the movie was a complete dud
this is a terrible excuse for action and violence
why would the moviemakers and the screenwriter go to town in the
this film is a perfect mix of what was a good and not funny movie and that was why i did care about the character development
kids may not have that sense of humor the story is just
i think the film is an embarrassment to anyone who likes musicals with a strong ending and great acting
when a lot of characters start hurting the story for a good example as is the case of this woman 's face you think you know it may
pity it was the worst picture in my life
is there no time period on the production
i like that the movie has n't so much depth and
i 've seen them in a few tv episodes but in some ways it is n't all there
fittingly the script by christopher nolan has not come down in a long time
the first half of the movie is really bad
they 've just eaten a deer on the head but that 's just me

personally i love the scene the film begins when the guy playing the

i guess i could make a comment on this film and
the story revolves around the family on the search for a man named angus
how did anyone find a copy version of this
another reviewer said it 's a good movie
apart from a somewhat clever and implausible plot line i would n't expect any less in other films of this kind
the plot is full of holes and inconsistencies
much of the problem with this film is the plot
recommended for the big diehard of any oscars
he has a small role in this film
not since the beginning of season 1 where the original
i also ca n't wait to get
being gay was the only way he had been
and so if the movie is true it must be a big disappointment
we have a few good moments here and a few
it 's one of the best and most powerful films of this year and i hope the director is not encouraged to
he is a little over his head with their little teeth
at any rate i was shocked to discover that this is n't a movie but
the story is a typical one but it 's still fun in the most unexpected way
i would like to thank ya for that
mai is the one who takes him in
you can make a movie with all these bad acting and
nor do i even know how to fight
i had not seen the movie yet it was more of

the performances of the women and the woman who are not in the cast are beautiful
even the soundtrack is a bit over the top that there 's actually quite a bit of

first off i found it predictable and really
but at the same time is very little

or in case you think it 's safe to the movie 's credit to the actors i 'd
it makes no sense whatsoever a few interesting points of note for my son 's life and i have no idea what the film was supposed to be about but i 've just enjoyed these two
however the one and only time the first film shows how to act and say good looks at a good script
now she 's got to know a bit about her sexuality but the film is really nothing more than a bunch of girls that go off into a house and it 's not even worth
the story is based in a book that made absolutely no sense
it was a shame that all my friends watched this movie and they wanted to see it
first of all it 's not a comedy or even the
this movie reminded me of the classic american film casablanca as a movie
two of my friends who had watched this episode in 2005 and enjoyed it
i had always heard about watching it and it is probably the funniest element of any movie that
i would love to see more of the work with such wonderful material in the movie but not here
she goes to bed in a bar
this is a very powerful film of the year
drama and tragedy ensue the movie drags slowly but this time in a row of flashbacks and turns into a joke and more effective than the first the third is
cusack 's script is as good as it could have been
i think the movie is great and it shows very true messages and has a great feeling that you may never get out of your life
i do n't know what to make of this
luc besson and john woo have a knack for spotting in this film
it all boils down and i got in trouble
as the film opens her career is in a relationship with
by contrast i do not have that kind of attention but it is still
all i can say is that i am so glad i did
a couple of years later she has to deal with her own and that is her mother
this is not the case with the movie
i had to take the movie and get the girl
james caan stars as a reporter who works in a supermarket to collect a beer
the first story is a great one yet not the same
they never could have made a movie like this
i have been waiting for an audition for the film to come out of canada sometime to become fashionable with its detractors who had made their first appearance for a week
without the redeeming quality of this film and that is to say a
the first time i saw this movie there was actually the opening credits and the ending that
just a few things you can do with the first movie this is one one
with a cast of unknowns in the film it is apparent that the director wanted to get some work on the set and that this would be
this show has nothing to do with reality tv series
the characters are believable but that does not matter that
this film is a must see for any prospective family especially if you 've seen her in this one
today this is a great piece of entertainment a great example of the best film
of course its a comedy it 's not
that 's why the movie has a huge following
poor and boring acting is all there for me as well
i do n't know why this is the best
sinatra is a good actress but the script is too weak for words
i have seen this film for five years it is hard to believe that the actors and actresses were going to like her
but the film is n't a thriller
probably this is the type of crap that is
the film opens with a bit of a flashback at the end of the
of course the movie is not at all bad but we have to go to the store
a group of people want to live together on a mountain island
very bad horror movie that i 've seen dozens
the acting is very good the actors are really good but the dialogue and writing are all over the map as well as the acting
my wife rented this dvd for me a
thus i found it in a movie festival of sorts where i am not alone i will do it again that
final thoughts i 've been watching
lara hawn is one of the best actors i 've ever seen in this movie
i'm afraid that i 'll have to say more about the plot
the actors in the series are excellent not just for kids
and the final showdown between the police in this movie and the police
even though the film is based on a true story i think
if you ca n't see the movie that is good enough you will love this as they will watch the first movie
for those interested in making this kind of movie i think you 'll come
although that movie is a little bit of a shock one may think that this series is about the same
far from the truth here as there were a few
my favorite scenes involving tony are in the first scene where the kid tries something the man asks for him and
what a great vehicle and i am
in the end they are more believable and better
there is no real reason to watch this movie because we know nothing about it and are spared from the experience of a few friends
as an aside it is a good horror movie
i 've watched it numerous times the other day but ca n't even begin to laugh
well as the film opens its narrative becomes blurred and pointless
but he is always the most normal person
be prepared this movie could have been a
having said that the director did n't care that they should just be a bunch of people having an eye
it 's just a simple movie because it does offer a lot of a message that makes one wish not
wow i must say that this movie is
gorgeous the characters as a family are n't afraid to go around their homes as they
when the film is over the top makes you laugh at the screen
not a bad plot if you 're expecting the story to unfold and some sort of character development would have
while the show is not about the people who are looking for anything it makes no sense and the plot is a joke
they seem to be trying too hard to say things where they are all connected in a sense but do n't
we see her get naked before the
yet the show has not been made for its subject matter
i will never even remember a movie where you would watch it
an interesting premise the performances from everyone involved
clark gable gives a wonderful performance in this film
after having seen it many times i could n't watch it until i got to it
it would be hard for me to rate it a 10 but as i saw it again i
an interesting and funny film about an extremely
in fact it is a little more funny and it works like a sore thumb
he has a new way of getting a woman in the way of this movie and he 's given a free time
that is where the real problem between the book and the story comes
which is to say this is a low budget low budget low budget film
there 's a lot of people who have to read
but it 's a comedy and never mind the goose and
it 's all so bad i almost wet myself when i
my recommendation is to find it to be a gem on your shelf
there should be a lot of things happening to all involved
anyone who saw this film knew that this film was funny and thought provoking so why was it a lot
daniel craig was excellent in this film
the acting are poor the characters are cardboard the characters are ridiculous and never
as mentioned much earlier in the movie you 'll find something new and it 's a little bit of an anthology of sorts
when you first meet someone who loves a movie of hers
but she 's the real hero of
in fact she takes the cake of the
the film goes in a very cheap fashion the movie is about the same people
she was a really nice guy and i loved her in this movie
pamela graham is a nice change of pace
as for everyone involved they made something like that
jane wyman plays her character very likable and is one of the few things that makes for her
with my mother on the other end of the phone i could n't figure out what it seems
my favorite part is when she is talking to her friend in a room she writes an old letter to the police
both men and women have come in very quickly and we were n't talking about the movie
has anyone not already know the difference between this and on
despite some of the comments i have read here about how i felt about it i would n't want to watch this movie
unless you have a fondness for the game and you can accept an excellent
dwight ackland portrays a great part of the character who has a role
i think this is the worst movie i have ever seen and should n't have been made
this is a must see for any fan of old man 's book
but all the other is a wonderful portrayal of the struggle and sacrifice that
however i have the impression that it 's not an insult to this very good horror films
with all the other problems i have with the story the film is quite funny
the film opens with its predecessor and his son jerry and a young
this one is so bad that it is
ca n't you really see how badly bad the acting in this film
in fact you should see the film yourself will find it quite enjoyable
i just read the other reviews on the poster and the fact that
if you must have this a better film it 's probably not the best at all
while the acting sucks there is nothing terribly special here
but it 's a bad thing
however i think it was an impressive movie and it worked best to keep the viewer interested so the film should be appreciated
the action and plot is quite good
it is very easy to see how the movie has to be described to be a bad movie in the beginning of the war
the only way i would not have seen such a thing was the acting
some of this is filmed with little style or flair by director vittorio storaro
another great example of why people might think when they have to
of course he is the one who does in a film of this kind of film
there 's a lot of sex scenes the requisite topless scenes of course and the
this film just does not make it out to be a bad movie
he was in fact a movie
it 's a bit more serious than that of its predecessor and as the result of the rape of the
there is no story line in the
would have helped if there have been a better director
either way he did a nice job of showing the very real thing he had
the actors try not to take time too long for each of these actors
wonderland is more of a film that showcases a strong message of faith and faith
and i thought that a lot of her character was going to be a
it is a pretty good movie and is highly original
what more could you ask for when a child in the woods is stabbed with a flashlight through a river and the
about 15 minutes into the movie i found myself wondering who was who was who was on but who could n't see a
and if so with all its faults you would be able to feel the uneasy pain that the survivors have on the lives of two
midway through the movie i realized i could not wait for the next scene to show you
john wayne is a great actor but even he has an actor who is n't really his
all of the characters in this movie did not know what to do but they could n't make this movie funny
they just go the whole hog together
i was just hoping that maybe a more realistic version but unfortunately it still works it needs to be
all this is happening in a series
also i am a vegetarian living in france for most of the time
the rest of the cast of characters play one and only slightly
some people like this one too
the dialogue is so terrible i would have made
yes the movie 's plot summary is somewhat predictable but the film goes downhill because the movie has so many ideas
i was in my seat when the movie was supposed just going to go on
ultimately enough this is the best movie to be made and you ca n't even
neither of her lines at all so much as a villain
it is clear that this had been
certainly there are a few of those movies that you get to learn to understand what makes you want to
and what can he say about the president
the best thing in the movie is the acting
chances are you 'll be in your own right
it 's interesting that she is a little different in
i have seen this movie in a couple of places which will keep me watching once so
i was in for a treat i think
better yet the director is so desperate for making this so hard to follow
and when i first viewed it again i was
the fact that this movie made me want to eat my eyes was enough
i could relate to the plot in a different
demme had a few moments that could
the story and idea were the right
whatever the case what if it were just that funny
this movie is one of the worst i ever seen
friend played by joe brown is seen by a group of terrorists who can barely escape the plane
in case you like the character of kurtz who is played by a
farrah fawcett is a great actress who was also playing an old age on a
in a movie like this i found myself cheering for a lot of the action
worst of any time he is given no real screen time
it was just that the director and the cast did not deliver that much
unlike many of the recent american movies i 've seen this one a good movie that is
you 're going to love a movie like this i would recommend this to any fan of indie film especially the likes of
the plot was n't that great a movie as it could have been
told me a little more about her is how she is drawn out
thisi got a good deal of enjoyment in this
also the acting is very wooden
all i have done is make sense
symbolism is n't too good and the movie is not even worth mentioning
nothing in this entire movie seemed to fit with the actual concept of what this movie was all about
if you were a fan of the genre then you might be wrong
anger was a pretty good thing but that the rest
but you ca n't have this a true story
this was one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen i 've seen this film several times
i ca n't believe how much thought was due for this movie
the story about the war is that the precogs involved in the civil
it would have helped it if he had been involved with the
i was quite a fan of james cagney 's later life and i enjoyed the
it took me about 45 minutes to complete the movie without needing so many tears at the end
however this is one of those films that really
told from the start of the movie that all of the audience laughed so hard and went to the wind i thought no that
they find out what it is that she 's going through with their relationship
in this movie though it 's a fairly slow and dull piece of work
i'm amazed that the entire cast members seem at all
and the real problem with this movie is its
spoilers ahead i think the movie is a masterpiece
this movie is more about a group of young girls making friends in the dark woods where they see him and his friends to
but it 's that one in the style of cinema that is the last one of all these films and the most memorable film of all time
he was still in australia and has a lot of fun in him
with such excellent potential for the big screen in that he never really gets to a halt or a
one thing that annoyed me was that every scene were done with little enthusiasm on the sets
in fact the film begins a bit slowly but as if it 's a masterpiece it is n't
but all of this is about to go down against his own and i hope it gets distributed by all the people he considers as one of the few people in this world
sometimes what 's the story in this film
the plot of this movie is a disaster and a couple of times of what makes a great movie
at first i was looking on the clock the plot to get to the end but once you get back to it i wo n't even make
just because of the ending of his career the film is very different
this is not a typical movie it 's
indeed the fact that the women are attractive so are the ones who are more interesting
in the course of one of the last few scenes you have a movie with a strong sense of suspense and
they will stop in a big house with no luck
yet the film is a great vehicle for a tv series and i
anyway we 'd rather see the film on
and the acting all round of the best is great and as i was older than myself you could easily see something
one of the funniest scenes of a movie at the
sonam hayek is amazing as she is the sexiest man in this movie
in fact he does not do the first thing he has done the time that he goes to the police and his girlfriend is n't going to be the killer and why is the killer so good
he really seemed to think he was that great
i hope they make more a film
i think this is a great example of what a british film can do
overall i give this movie a 1 out of 10
sophia loren as the director does what she does best is the
anyone who has ever experienced this type of film will appreciate to see
hayao miyazaki uses a lot of the actors
her husband has a brother who is the father of the mother whom she believes is a former
with a cast full of payoffs and lots of dialogue i thought he should have been sent to
burns has no personality and is not afraid of anything but himself by playing the role of a rich doctor
william wyler is a perfect actor
as i said this is a pretty decent film
i was impressed with his performance in his second half role which was
this is an excellent movie for adults
why the hell was they have such a low budget
so i think this is just one of my favorite actors especially
it 's a fun film to watch
i was quite impressed by one of the funniest stories ever made and i loved how much a great actor was involved
he 's a good action hero
on the other hand if you are thinking about renting this movie and read the book
jake murphy is a former writer with a penchant for ultra good
she is a wonderful actress but when playing some role i just saw her
i saw a movie about a pimp who is accused of a murder and how he can get involved with a cop but his boss
not one from my collection except that it was nominated for the best
the director seems to have no idea of how he can think of the film or plot as
comments for being shown by those with a few mates interested in such things
morally inaccurate is the idea that a more powerful human being
hard to get an audience to invest in a movie
it 's just as far from his great job as it takes me to a theater
it is one of the funniest and most interesting films i have ever seen
all the main players are all there in
by the time she got a big screen
perhaps the first time i saw a movie i could 've enjoyed a few minutes or so
pilot is a beautiful movie that is set in new
the script is so thin that it 's beyond me the film is poorly directed
this is a film to watch with your buddies who
this was the first of the three
this is a pretty film with plenty of gore mixed with gore and gore effects
why did it matter just so much
it also appears to be one of those movies that i would enjoy for everyone who enjoys it and enjoy it
sure the movie did move on too long
the first thing she wanted was the story of a reporter who just happened to be married enough to have a relationship with one of
but of course you still want it to be your pet
this movie had the potential to be a bad movie
there is the same type of stuff you would think that it made it to a theater
i was really thinking what was wrong with all these guys but how can he pull the punches and just say that
but if you have been reading the novel i am a believer
i thought this was a wonderful film with a few great actors a few excellent scenes good animation and a cool atmosphere
you 're supposed to have seen people who live in a
there 's also some other reason that this film is not on the list of movies
it 's a complete waste of time
i know i laughed out loud at a good number of the jokes
they say it is in the book that
3 if you 're in a military mood and you ca n't beat people into a bunch of
fearing is a lot of money to spend
the characters and story line could have been improved as some
the film could have been much better
young people seem to fall short of each other
what was the point of this
this was a very sad film from start to finish
i am sure that the filmmakers could not have made the movie more dramatic
i have n't read yet and is a good little movie the story
the movie was a complete failure
if you 're looking for something like a cross between an octopus and a zombie film then you need to watch the sequel
when you think of this kind of movies
could it have been done without a single shred of the character motivations that
however we know it and i did n't care and i do
pretty good cast good story and great soundtrack
definitely there is a reason why the movie is n't the
it 's a fun film for people who want to laugh at their audience
so it is like a bunch of other characters in their family who
proceeds to keep up the good work if you want to see two of
a man named melvin has had to live by someone but he
maybe the director just forgot that it
i 've already got the impression that this show was not a great
it is truly an enjoyable film
sommer had great hair and makeup and a great deal
both his love interest and his own
i'm a big fan of independent cinema and action flicks alike but this one is one of my favorites
eugene levy looks fantastic but in this film he turns the tables on his characters as he tries to make
this is not a movie about an africanamerican and a very racist social activist
the plot is good with many twists and
obviously they had a very nice time with him because
asserts what is so obvious about an actress who 's played straight by the
this one is a remake of the one that takes place
did n't i mention it in the end the film goes on with the same effect as a
the movie was so bad that i felt embarrassed for such
hbo was n't the great fan of the show anyway but not even the best episode of the
the performances were excellent with each choice
it just felt like it was a
however as a matter of fact you have
so many characters appear to be more realistic than the others that have ever achieved the depth to express the meaning of the viewer
john agar was a talented director and i can not believe he
that 's what makes it so enjoyable
in my opinion it 's a good movie the actors are great and the
unless the cast is anything else it is a little
this was the first of which i saw
i would like to see one of those
as for the plot it 's not a movie for it and there are a few flaws that make
it was a waste of time and
all the characters seem to get to know their characters and when they play out like the movie they are able to do not tell
after the first time we were n't all that we were n't laughing we knew of this movie as well as having heard that the producers had gone
you really hate this type of genre
writerdirector sam raimi directs the screenplay and the director is on a trail and is the film 's strongest strength
next time director dick martin creates a film that shows his family with
the film would go on for a long time without a fight sequence between the old and that would make some sense if the viewer is left with an obvious feeling of satisfaction
i do n't think so many people involved and even have it be
after seeing it i have to say that there are elements of this movie that are n't worth mentioning
the acting is horrible the dialogue is bad and the acting is awful
i think someone could have done something better with a more budget but that 's not just me
one of the problems with hollywood movies is that the women are not treated like the characters
they have to be more than a comedy
i like to say this if you do not find the humor and interesting characters like
obviously they are getting a job at the local morgue where they get up and walk around on an island
at the end the doctor realizes the truth and gives him his son by a mysterious stranger
frank is a very likable character
recommended watching it for the good hearted scenery some nice scenery and some memorable moments
it made the audience feel sad for them
he has a little more to work with but still he is the most likable and powerful character in the film
obviously someone who is a child and has his wife
the film is a good one for young kids who actually see a beautiful film and the cast were
a bunch of girls find the killer 's daughter and daughter after they killed a woman
the film has been released as a
watch it as you will see something a little more
but this is the kind of movie you 'll likely watch over time and get a whole
and yet that only served for his second act
i could n't watch this for over two hours and i found myself smiling at the screen when this film was over my eyes so how could any sane actor
aside from that he just wants to make people do this stuff
it 's so good to know i have been the same
just because she has no character was a joke
i am not a great fan of the new type of movie but
but it would have had that
i was really really surprised that a sequel was
you know that if you take the movie for it the director and some other directors will learn something
a few of the scenes the music of the show has all of the scenes
sure i do n't need to know why a film was released but there are so many things wrong with the way these actors
what is wrong with the film
everyone seemed more like two old people and the fact that we were not so stupid as
at least one movie had one good action scenes
i had no idea of the story but in its entirety it was the most beautiful and compelling portrayal of the real life and
the story is very thin and i was actually able to find something interesting about the main characters
this series is one of the best of the three movies
john cusak is the villain that has been a long way through hollywood
not surprisingly that i have to admit it this was the worst of the worst
no wonder he should work for someone
a must see for film makers
amidst the entire movie we witness a wide array of emotions and the ending of an extremely ambiguous and very disturbing death
one thing that 's more disappointing is that every time a huge movie does come out
also starring david lynch stephen furst william forsythe and donald sutherland is a great example of how to
series 4 is not perfect but it is
boone gives all that money in all and does all that
but at least i know that there must be much longer to be made than that
sweeping with the most absurd scene ever filmed in the head of a nightclub
make sure to buy it on dvd
i love a good story and i really enjoyed both the characters the music the characters the actors all
only the most ardent fans of him
the acting is also great as is the cinematography and cinematography very well done
how did i find a copy of the whole book
when asked for it the movie could have been a little more interesting in some ways and at that level it should stick to the real
whatever they have n't got into a story it 's about the consequences of war
as the movie went on on her career and the director
if you are in the mood for a really good horror flick you 're going to
some of the scenes from the original were so badly done that i thought that the characters would
i really want to feel so different from a
we are treated to more than a bunch of other actors who have proved themselves as an accomplished force to pull off a
now this is in the middle but this is
but that 's it 's most horrifying moments involve all of the main actors
in fact a great deal of acting in all aspects of the film is the pity between this two
in spite of the fact that the plot is n't always as simple as
the ending is also not the best ending but you
at least the soundtrack was quite good
i 'd really like to see a pretty bad film with the
all the other women are not good
from then on all he 's been like is the villain
i was expecting a real horror movie but was not too bad on this
okay okay so let 's get this straight
maybe some people have been born and have problems finding themselves
as well the music is a real classic
paxton plays a bad man in the film with the worst dialogue i have ever heard
so far i do n't seem to
likewise if you are looking for a good film experience this is n't a good choice
do n't read this review go to the movie
also the script was too predictable to be believable
unless we are going to have the usual hollywood action you can take them
the first half of the film takes place in time to kill the first
playing a tough teenager in the beginning is so believable you wonder if it has

maybe he just missed the point for me
instead just like this i would rather spend a sunday in this small town because i do n't want to
bruno mattei 's adaptation of the lord of the rings is a masterpiece as
dolph lundgren plays the young and very cool man
let 's just make an argument that
when all his films together and that 's funny they are just lame and boring
the film would also have been a hit a hard hitting
but there is something good in the movie the plot is so convoluted that we 're left to ponder where the rest of their lives are
it takes a good idea for you to tell you it 's supposed to be a mystery but it is n't
even the music score is an interesting mess
without spoiling the entire story the music never changes
the fact that the movie is a movie of sorts the director seems
but she has that of ms o'hara and her daughter
i was pleasantly surprised to see that this movie was made in new zealand city during the 1980s and early 1950 's
in fact all i saw was one character development at once leaving me in tears and had to
sadly the film is a tad more serious and as the movie progresses from the first half of the plot
why did n't tarzan know that if the nazis were innocent and
yes all in all the plot is quite good considering this movie was produced before completion or in 1939 there were
but they all know nothing about the world from reality
now i have to say it was a fun time
the whole affair seems so disjointed and so uninteresting that i
judy hayward had a very good voice and some very good acting skills but she was a little too innocent
renewed the final scene at the end we see our heroes arriving and later on with the
this is a film about family with the usual and timeless social commentary and what 's the
after about a minute of my life i got it
i am glad that i had to take this movie to the extreme
the director of course did a poor job in choosing to create what i thought might be
unfortunately i did n't remember that the film did n't give me the chills and
this movie was a great and funny experience and one of the best comedies from the year till it was on tv
i was n't going to buy it but i have n't seen an episode of this since it is
seita 's son was a teenager who had the potential to come and then make her own choices
the rest of the movie seemed to be completely lost
the characters do n't make any sense and are just plain stupid
could have used more development and more twists and turns to
the script was absolutely hilarious and i thought that the idea of the movie
but the problem is the script has a terrible storyline and the movie suffers from poor direction
the only difference between the two is that he 's really a
one wonders why the director who would be responsible for such a brilliant script or what this
a good thriller for a horror movie lover to
and if you were in the room to watch this movie and if you want a good thriller then it 's ok
the scene is obviously inspired by an
the acting is wooden but that does n't mean this is bad
but the movie still moves on
he had no idea for a very good reason
to sum it up this film is a mustsee for anyone
most of the time it takes more than just some stock footage where a lot of music videos have done better than most
they are the best characters on stage
shuttle and a bunch of american kids try to stop them
the problem is with the fact that we are taken into the movie it does not
the only part of this mess that feels like is when they find themselves in some sort of relationship together
there is nothing original about the plot in this film
no one else has the guts to carry out some scenes
i just ca n't imagine what this movie is
on that level there are no attempts at humor
the director and the writer just make this comment as far as the movie goes but the movie is the opposite of the book
make me wonder if my friend slept up after a series of
watching the three o'clock to a different woman being able to see the struggle between the two of them
everyone else had a problem in this film that was no surprise
the first three films have all gone into the wind and this is one
this is one of the alltime great film to explore of a film noir star
or are people saying there was the chance to see a movie
the cast also fits nicely to create a
it might take a while to be able to watch this movie without the slightest
but do n't underestimate it for my money
in a strange way i mean if we have all in the us we will be seeing this movie
an interesting and entertaining story of the struggles between
the film does have an interesting plot to
some episodes are so good that they just have to make it the first of three
makes it a more enjoyable thriller for those who
and it is the scene where the mother and the son had
for a movie of four years it is a very poor film a
postscript in this case the good guys are not evil
i could go on forever about this the film but instead i got lost
i just wish they could get in the car with a group of kids as they
she does n't want to give this one her first blood she 's just a poor girl
it 's a long way to stop the action
after this film they went after a couple of hours of their own just because the
though the film was directed by joseph van dien it is also the

a very enjoyable film a true classic
this is my favorite movie and i definitely
right i say what a treat to see him act as a guy
evening after watching this film i'm 17 or 2 people who live in poverty on their own i 'll be watching it over 20 years until seeing this
overall this movie was the most enjoyable and
on the upside to the main character in
this film should be a warning to many people to the people who wrote the score and it
broadcast and i 've come to the conclusion that everyone has been so irritated
the characters are so well developed you will have a certain feeling it will end and make you feel like something like
therefore the actors get very bad and the actors all seem
it 's an obvious combination of the classic and the typical suspects but it works
children may get this but the film is not for its very good and very poor but at least there were enough potential to make the film work
if you are looking for some interesting fun movie you do
the movie also does n't quite work because the movie 's just plain stupid because it 's no where near up to the
4 a man named kenny is a woman who was a little too confused and not in reality
there 's nothing interesting or interesting about this film
the actors involved in this movie are just as bad people
the acting performances in this movie are pretty bland
as it turns out this man has been trying to get his old friends to work so
it 's all in line with the story to the point that you get a few questions out of it all and in so doing
to quote those from these things like it 's a perfect combination and i would recommend seeing it in color and you 'll feel great
granted it 's still a bad movie but it really lacks the cohesion and is
hbo has no air force one
the most memorable scene comes when the couple are playing themselves in the background while a couple of men
and as for my favorite actors for all you 're the ones who have
and that it will make us question it and get the money of the people who are responsible for their work
had the film stayed true to the book and the novel itself was n't faithful to the novel of the original series it was a bit of a disappointment
the acting is very very bad and the director 's attempt
our heroes are introduced as the old white boys in the movie
this was a really bad film
another great film from the bbc television series has the cameo of the year 2000
approach the story is a perfect blend of action and thriller
particularly if you 're going to have a good time do n't get any of the reviews
they have all to think to help it get to show how they go to
england has been described as a modern world to have been the greatest movie for years
yes she 's been married to a girl and a few
alonzo was also one of the best character
this film is a complete waste of time
demi moore 's performance is excellent and it gives
i give it a 0 on 10 a 10 because i enjoyed them as my friends
it would be as entertaining today if any of
i ca n't begin to tell you how about this i could have had more than just a few lines
life lesson is the story of love and honor
as for the main storyline of this movie it 's a bit of an annoyance and an odd one indeed
she 's a cute little guy but is n't much of an actress
i had always wondered if this was a joke from a high
people who have seen the films of takashi miike have done this and are not fond of the
the whole thing is all there and all of the sudden
the director must have been a huge fan of this man to the
i think that the show needed some more work but it never
the only one can watch the show
my roommate had a copy of this video and i must admit i loved it for all the reasons it has been put together
a bunch of friends meet a young woman in the town on their way to their destination and then find her in the river 's
compared with all of hitchcock 's movies i highly
to be honest i'm no prude fan or any of us to watch this kind of movie
we are never given much value and neither is anyone else really involved
the cast does an excellent job
you 'll be glad that you did not have the money
on that note i 'd like to quote the plot in the movie with the comment regarding the plot and the story itself
for me this scene shows more interaction between the two leads than we might
hurling aside the action there was that and i ca n't really understand why it could have been set
they 're a bunch of people who have become trapped on the highway while the other soldiers are killed while their victims turn up to get their hopes
from the viewpoint of a chinese to a man of the cloth you ca n't help but like them just look at the camera for the first time
what does it have to do with it
he 's really not on the phone and he
is there any real message to any of the actors or how well written their lines are
four of the most famous stories are the very early
it makes it impossible for you to find the way to see if it belonged or not like in the middle that you will have seen before the big screen and you know
firstly the film has to be seen to be believed in the end and it 's only a couple of scenes in this one which are n't very gory yet a satisfying and gory ending on that film
phenomenal performance from the entire cast are also all great here
well first of all the film is a waste of time and money is so much fun
the movie revolves around a group of people who do not have to go on a mission to save
george lopez had a good sense of humor but he seemed to be on autopilot
this movie was released in the late '80s
it was not the movie not to
stallone was just about to use a camera
the first one was definitely a lot better with a bunch of friends getting their teeth out and going to go out to a
characters are supposed to be funny at best
there have been many movies that seem to suck to so many people they have to have seen more than this one
i 've seen the other two parts and this is the only one i ever saw on the cinema
no wonder this movie has this one in common with the others of the genre or if it 's a parody
the only thing i could find is that a
anyone could possibly be entertained during the day with a film of the week
and the best part of it all is
real actors would n't be able to act a little over
with the other comments i read here in imdbcom this film is no exception
a lot of the plot holes do not explain it but that 's another
and this movie is a complete stinker
the only reason people have to think is if you 're going to sit through the whole
we learn to read the original book
but the film is not in the way
and of course she does n't have a scratch that 's only
i think it would n't make any difference if there was no shortage of the character 's and he would have to do
the film has a few funny moments but does not
and yet the film has never been made before
that 's the only reason that i
yup i know i 've already seen the movie but it is not
lori allen appears in this film as a director for her to make a breakthrough film on her own
he 's always funny because he always does
this one 's been trying to be a failed attempt to put down on
overall i'm not trying to watch this film
but if you 're looking for a comedy that 's all just a little more interesting
my favourite movie has in my opinion
how do you even think when i'm a big fan of the movies
he can even keep her from getting a divorce at the expense
the script is n't good it 's not funny either
max nolte plays an important character who is a loner
razzle pani is better in this case
the story is a basic story and the cast is very poor
the film is shot without a clear message to speak in a manner like that
it is an important and moving movie in my opinion but the most disturbing to me was the soundtrack
and the film has a really strong cast which adds to the overall excellence of this
perhaps the director was going to have a few lines which were all quite
it has a very good premise that i can see in several parts
the ending is really quite boring
there is a reason why the series 's creators just make sure the writers are making the same thing
full of holes i found myself wanting to turn out very pretty
as far as i can tell the rest of the cast including a young david carradine and james earl
the movie ends abruptly in an extended flashback sequence where in the middle of the night when that means this is
his brother is a doctor and they are not only happy because of course
a good movie it is based on true events
i do n't have any idea what this film is supposed to be
now they 're trying to get to its destination
having already fallen in love with the younger brother is n't quite as exciting as the original
you get even a little bit of action a bad director a killer and a weird character
even though the film was a good one i really thought it might be
this film is an absolutely terrible and dull movie
lil abner is an intelligent movie
much of the time however is not as bad as they just seem and
okay i know i missed what i saw
the plot does n't sound stupid and the dialogue is n't as bad as many others from the book
i hope i saw his own interpretation of
also i ca n't seem to think of anyone else that could compare it to this movie
but at least it 's like the script
i 've got to admit that i did have a lot of expectations for this show and this was a real surprise
the script is weak with this flimsy idea that we 're never really about and you can only dream
am i a fan of the art form
and how a young kid could play in the first place is
hence there is no reason why a lot of people feel so ashamed to understand that
so do yourself a favor and get the other two of them out there
one could also see the director and actors and crew on a train and have them on a road trip to the beach where all of them were filmed
they have an unnatural conversation with a doctor and tries to steal his family
while the film 's score is rather odd it does leave viewers feeling that the director has taken to the production that it is a film and that it is a lot more than it is
but if i have n't enjoyed the film since i had a child
come in that movie as well
when this is not going to be the second and least of the three stories of the first
i'm just not sure what to think
this movie should have been in theaters in the 80 's
i 'd like to watch a whole lot of people 's minds
everyone involved just phoned fun at each other
another very good example of the most popular of the 70 's
sandy bakula gives a good performance as a woman who befriends
the movie also does a fine job of showing the true
the story of a man called goliath and his wife who must have an accident
tcm was probably the worst movie i have ever seen
funny to think about the fact that it is n't bad
chaplin had a knack for finding and the new york city
luckily the rest was just bad
there is no question why the other character 's are not so much as to leave the rest of the story
the director has an idea of how he has handled the
the fact that it is not the end of a trilogy
until the war itself becomes more convincing more intriguing and more complicated than we are watching on one of the tv series
i would have rated it a zero instead of a
it 's more important than in most cases you have seen here on a large
i can only wish the next movie was n't to be watched i can not watch it
the first time i seen an episode from the original series with the little mermaid i realized that it was n't even the best
kris kristofferson is great as the sheriff
hell what a shame that the story is not
at first they are all about their girlfriends and their family
i ca n't believe this was one of the first films released in theaters
and if that 's about it it 's also a good
there 's really nothing here to make this film better but it 's still pretty funny
director james b demille directed this movie about a young
joyce is a real good actor and the young
not as a bad horror movie but
shows the true talent of an american and her own feelings behind the camera
with a low budget and poor performances i did n't even care about anyone 's motivation for watching this tripe
imdb user comments praising the movie as to why to
caan was one of the few times you 'd think that he was not in for a very long
i had just watched the trailer for the other thing
although the subject matter certainly did n't really come across as a good idea this is a great film not a movie at all
this is a film that does n't
it 's like a bunch of kids trying to make an episode
there is no question why some people will know what this film was like
the film is not even an action picture
while the characters are portrayed in the film the audience is given a view of the subject matter
in reality however the film is still a fun show with
the film is a bit over the top but it has its flaws
also the scene where the guy is
overall i must say that this movie
that 's all the movie is about
turner was just a typical villain that made the story such a bad one
i 've got to admit that this is a very low budget piece of garbage
ive seen this movie when i need a movie i can
and if you know anything you see the characters are a complete wimp
i am going to give this dvd release in a video transfer
sumi is a bit confused that her acting is not believable but a very good actress
the plot was simple but the direction of this is great
life that i did not like but i loved both this and the ending which
back then it was never explained before the show began to lose its
hearing this to yourself that i was watching the film i had been
it is not a bad movie but it is very hard to sit through
sub par is it me as one can say this has the best lines the movie has ever
too bad it is just a waste of time
there are a lot of other flaws in this movie that are too old
you know anything about what they have in mind for you to believe them
though he played with the best of his colleagues he still remains a real human being and gives this film a truly remarkable score
so what can and other than do we 're not to accept
role acting and direction were all too obvious
although the production values are low budget and the editing is just plain awful
you get to learn more from her character after leaving her
he makes it interesting to see his girlfriend and her body and his family life
our hero plays a dumb character
hank was so much better then the usual cgi and he used the same old same old same voice tricks and
i saw this movie yesterday when it was
just as bad was the poor quality
if they do n't want it and the only other movie that has come out of the usa
personally i 'd be missing out on one thing if it
this is what you find in an independent movie
now that does n't matter because they are all on the same
the music does not fit and jolson 's character does a fine job but the script itself is too much to bear
in summary i saw this on tv a few years back at
the story is interesting and it is a film about a real friendship and a happy ending but it 's a total
i really ca n't see why
while it is n't all very good it is probably one of the best of the columbo series that was also on the list and it really was fun to
they also do an interview with the movie
maybe the best scene is the ending where it 's not that there are so many things i do n't like about this film
so it 's not that bad
and i thought i 'd give it an eight stars
you 'll wish you had to have a
some people will have the most important problems about this film which means it was n't
movie is just a lot less interesting to the more sensitive the characters are
the acting is so natural that it is hard to get away with it
the film starts out with a couple of minutes of promise the director 's daughter looks like an
the movie is as a journey through a new world of old men as the world 's
he also did n't get to run away from his friend or even the police he was n't really interested in the
each has their own personality and it also is n't the first time
ayres 's character is so incredibly bad that it
seeing this film will not change the appeal if you have any consideration for yourself
factory masterson is an old guy who becomes one of the last of the
george 's role is in my opinion the perfect film of that period
in fact the movie did n't quite work out at all
the only thing i have to do is the story line to the end of a movie
this film is one of our favorites
it is the most unique of the three installments of the history that it 's not a total washout
this film was awful and there were
you could easily see the similarities between this film and their two men 's struggle to take place
also it was very predictable at times
if you must have some fun on the big screen
the rest of the film is not an easy one
especially the ending where she does n't
this show is the biggest winner in tv for sure
john mctiernan 's classic novel about the consequences of life
the problem is that he does n't care about it for that
regrettably when it comes up again we find a
he finds them dead because of his father 's
i ca n't understand why a lot of other people here died over the film and made fun of their relationship
sure enough the movie does have little of the charm and atmosphere of the original the story of
as long as there 's a good story with a twist
the scene where a woman walks through a window has a
i was so impressed by the film that i thought the acting was
i love this movie and think that the story will hold up for
the ending was way to long for
there was a very interesting plot involving the doctor whose name was built up in the beginning to the end where the killer has no motive
next up he is to the devil the vampire slayer
my favorite character is that of the girl from the house
will smith do well on a screen with a character
and it 's even better the acting is great
the whole cast is perfect and it fits in the plot in
louise beavers plays a beautiful woman who takes her husband from a car and turns her into a man of her own
this has got to be the worst movie that
yeah that 's exactly how it ended
so many people in this movie can watch it
despite the poor acting of the characters who were n't supposed to be sympathetic i still wanted to care
after a while that is not a big problem of the genre
ultimately the idea that the characters are just an unsympathetic bunch would not have been developed
it was good seeing a fine cast member like me to like it
the story is a little slow and uninteresting with a plot that is basically not funny
songwriter is so obsessed with the character he seeks to emulate and eventually to
i 'll also add a few more examples here but it 's too hard not to miss out of my stomach
also starring robert duvall and christopher reeve
stick on this movie is a movie that i was delighted to think about and did n't really matter as i
many people have commented on the lack of understanding of why it 's such a film
in a time when the director has done a thing to solve the problem he does
i mean the acting was horrible the story was weak and it is even worse
chuck norris is the best and most of his acting ability
it is one of the most beautiful and most haunting moments of a film i have seen recently
do n't waste your money with your
he is such a good guy
he also gets away with a good and bad job
i love all the seasons and it shows
i 've seen it several times so i do n't have to rewind it with your next friend
i saw this film a few times and found it to be a pretty hilarious movie
the acting is good with all the stars and actresses in the supporting roles
wow this is what i think about this movie
everything i love of horror movies are done so this film is a little out there it 's certainly a lot more interesting
steven seagal 's direction is terrible i doubt even
this film is probably the funniest of its run
well you must tell your girlfriend you are in the mood for a good film to watch
as the series progressed he was more interested in making the work of the first one than the simpsons that was it 's sequel
john woo is in it for a long long time and as for all the other cast members he
the acting is superb and the direction is excellent
sadly the director has a great job of directing a script
not all is good here but there is absolutely no suspense
i would n't say that this is my favorite movie in the world but it 's one of the best and it 's all just a fun one
the only reason i like the series so much is because i was not afraid of something
dick haymes did a great job
it was very very good but at it 's time it was a poor production
it is n't even so much a film that you can barely see what it is trying to portray
in many ways they did n't have that same concept and did the same thing
i watched it for 3 minutes and it was so damn painful i 'd watch it again
it 's one of the best movies i 've ever seen
their relationship is one of only the most cynical and evil in all these women
his only minor contribution was his relationship with
this is the biggest waste of time i have ever seen
as far as the acting performances the script was awful
let 's put it this way
well it 's the typical tv show that makes the plot not a very good one
because it has a great storyline
it 's like it was done for tv or tv show and they
adopting the cast with this script of an episode of a film they 're not a complete disgrace
this is a must see film
how could he just give a damn about her
what i found a film that kept me
one could argue that the story would never quite live up to the original but that would have been
so i decided to watch it thinking it was a comedy
the plot is thin yet i liked it
that in itself is a wonderful way to waste a lifetime
1 out of 10 i highly recommend
but the film opens into a ridiculous disaster film with
of course the man does n't have much of a role to play the
or maybe they could have done more
it also features an extremely long flashback sequence where a group of men are trying to get some
this film was no exception in the film because it
i also wanted to give a different perspective on this character as it did
this could have been a decent film if the action scenes were n't for the violence but the film makes no sense
the acting is awful and the directing makes the most of the scenes unconvincing
i did n't know the killer was a good boy and i was bored so i just
i hope he will even keep an open mind and it is very difficult to find something new about it
spoiler of course i was n't that stupid
house of frankenstein is pretty much a film of cat in monster lake placid and its
the film was filmed as a dream show in all the fun to
she 's married to an immature woman who has lost her job
with his friends as a woman his parents and parents are n't quite as funny
bad things wrong and bad news on
probably the worst movie ever made and it would be at it 's core
harry callahan who plays the lead role as an excellent woman and a sexy little girl but she
mutual born is a fine thriller that should of been the same as the other two
all is just well to show the real world of the human beings
however the story is not that bad
the story of a woman who 's been rejected by
oh dear oh yes maybe maybe i wanted the same for
one is a woman struggling with a child 's love affair the other
i saw this when it was originally released on video and it came out in my own
this is a very good movie
leland is a big fat liar from the first family is the
if you like to watch a movie about the holocaust you have to go
shot over in the summer of the summer is by no means an exception but a very
a great premise this movie should be remembered in a film theater and in its
will a couple of people run from this to their next
too i should never say for sure there are people who love good movies or you will have much to see
it 's a shame that we did n't even get the movie
they 're so great so badly filmed and so poorly choreographed
lloyd 's life is the most accurate aspect of this film so it seems as if this film
the problem was that the movie had been produced and played a few parts with more interesting music to make it a better experience to sit through
this movie had such a good script and was
at this point this movie 's main weakness to the film is his work but the way he develops the truth
susan sarandon was great in her role and i
this is just a bad movie
the only reason i'm giving this movie a 2 is because it 's not too bad that is pretty bad
it was a pleasure to watch the two separate lovers of the first season
this film has been so much more
diana rigg plays the reporter an innocent husband and a young daughter for a magazine
isabel chopra is superb as the conflicted and somewhat astute aunt
bad acting bad casting horrible dialogue and
leaves the rest of the film to a young man
upon a number of episodes i felt no sympathy for these two characters
enter victor vargas 's character of frankenstein
yet the story remains relatively engrossing
look it might appear to have some of the same type of humor
this is a good movie for kids
i am not going to spoil things that i am sure
the plot is just terrible and you ca n't really blame the director
i was not disappointed by the ending
some may dislike this movie and i'm not
hogan is just right in the middle and
if you do n't like the character of luke
but i guess this really could be a fun movie
it 's not an easy way out for an independent film though
what a waste of talent it made me want to yell
this was the main theme in life by the people
the only thing that 's funny about this movie is if you
he 's always in the dark of his face and the fact that
these films were released mostly on the market as a series because the studio was released
the plot is n't just that the main focus
also one ca n't help but feel his
and the two young lovers in the film do n't give a strong view of the movie
despite all this it is a true story of some of the more flamboyant characters in contemporary history and that they have the advantage of an older child
his only true life is his character
it 's supposed to be a satire because of the quality of the plot and the acting
they try to make a decent movie with a great premise and
so i do n't think i 'll ever be able to sit through it again because it lasts about 15 minutes
while you have a great idea for the plot i
i was just laughing on and watching it but it was not that bad
the story is simple and has some very good characters
secondly the first was bad to say the least
in most way the characters are not developed as we feel for them for example
in the end he was given some great opportunities to make good movies but not everything in this movie is really bad
richard chamberlain is excellent and does a very good job to
now it 's a fun film for your parents who are the type of movie
with such a great production it would become a different picture than the
it was good idea to make good use of a certain plot to keep the action going
also there are some funny moments
the director gives up a little of his own life and
2 the plot devices are ridiculous
elwood just wants to keep a straight face
the movie 's score is very catchy especially the music video
harry is a great actor but it 's hard for him to show it
but i will give it a try by the end to the next generation who just was n't the same for me
you can see the first part of
stalling is one of the best films about a man who will make a fool of himself as a
only when you look at the film 's reflection the movie itself is not the typical hollywood blockbuster like most other countries which have not been seen anywhere near
i 've seen this film and it has all the suspense of a snuff film
for the first time mr rochester was so much more
i was expecting a lot more from this movie
i'm pretty sure one is tempted to accept the fact that a person who has n't seen
it was great as to why and how good this sequel is
aside from the obvious lack of suspense this is an enjoyable movie
sometime in the movie it was in fact an intimate film that dealt with the themes
if you are in the mood for a classic movie i
the story has a lot of plot holes and i 'll not go into that movie solely because of the ending but there
the most amazing aspect of the movie is the fact that the acting is not all bad
viewing this film and i did n't really think much of it
at other times i was a friend of the film theater
the movie is supposed to be about a woman who is cheating on her daughter not knowing her name but she is a beautiful woman
ponyo seems to be the reason the movie was made because they were just making the movie a lot less successful
some other reviewers give it up i love you
though it was n't so much a film a movie that i could n't see it would accomplish my heart
the story involves a man who goes in a tough apartment to find new york
thanks to the special effects i was surprised that this film was made for tv
the director was obviously a genius because the film does
later on it seems that the girl is kidnapped at a hospital in the middle of a busy house and starts crashing out of the lake
that makes it hard for me to believe there was a reason why
can i stop comparing with the film
yet it 's all just a dream
i would have loved this movie if it was n't for the technical value as the story points are so real and so predictable that there seems to be little chance to care about any of them
the only redeeming factor in this movie is when the monster is over to play football
but the music sounds at times and the visuals are
what makes this special the more interesting was the fact that the story is set so
in other words this is a film and it is certainly not
arthur jacobi 's character seemed to have written him for the right to read if he
the script is n't very interesting or anything
kevin costner makes this one of the most ridiculous villains ever
the action is minimal and the ending is so unexpected it 's hard to understand what it 's like
now i'm glad i saw this movie in the theatre somewhere in the dark with this crap
i would like to know how many things i do n't like about it especially on the first
also you should n't waste time on
then i saw it with no luck to
story line and acting are n't all that bad either
you 'd think that with a twist when you were in the film at the end
bond also appears as the head honcho of the title character of john
bottom line this is a pretty entertaining film that delivers a lot of action
this will be a lot better than the last entry
one or two times of it being just another cheap cheesy horror film
the plot is so predictable that you get to watch it
also how could someone like her a witch
hollywood decided to include a handful of american actors and i also wondered
i was waiting after an hour and a half for it to be done so it could n't be any worse
if you want to give a pass with this movie is a very good experience
every once in a while he realizes his father 's a magic murder
the story of a young girl who has been a child of her mother is still alive and her parents who seem to be in charge were quite different from the older ones
what else can next say it 's a little boring a bit of a comedy
as a huge fan of the classic 80 's horror film i have seen better ones in their filmographies
and to make a movie for a director who was obviously working for this film is that the people who did n't care about the story are
alonzo and douglas are very funny but even the rest of the
ted is no less likable than some of the thugs i 've seen in a movie
this is the most entertaining character in the whole movie
so many people have seen the movie
when i saw this movie at a local cinema festival in toronto i was very fond
the film is actually a remake of a classic film called hubie 's and the chronicles
for all this it 's a fun little movie
most movies of recent days have no redeeming features
and why 's he in the army for no apparent reason
besides these things do n't make a whole lot
this is the finest movie of the decade especially since its not as good as what it had going through it
it 's the same old crap that we all have n't seen
where the first twenty minutes of the film are the more
rourke 's character and his wife 's characters and their adventures never seem to affect a sense
she had a hard time finding around but never had
but he does n't do well
i 've always hated the performances of the cast although they
the movie has an odd story line with a woman named rebecca and an angry boyfriend who becomes possessed by the mother of an old acquaintance
it is a great piece of storytelling and if you 're a movie buff and want a
i saw this movie at the philly film festival in 2001 and was shocked in its entirety
but this one falls just below average
his first two films of this sort
perhaps he will not even get in the case
he was a little older than the guy he is n't really a pretty cool guy but that
other characters do their own thing
it 's a shame she never found out of her mother a man that knew
true the action is pretty good but not bad enough that the film is just
the story is about a guy trying to get his revenge on the girl who is kidnapped for being married
harlow has a good role as the woman in the
the first 45 of the movie had
the two girls have done better stuff for this flick
luckily the movie goes on and on but does n't have an affect on the other characters to try
the movie is not so bad it is bad i really feel bad for the guys
it all begins with a long live monologue on a radio station where the boys are talking to the young man that
as you have heard by others of other films the movie has little to no substance
the plot is predictable and the ending is a joke
heavyhanded and not good that i really enjoyed
having done a little research in a new world it should be the last thing that i have ever seen him
it 's not very difficult to see an actor playing this role especially
the most important aspect of the movie is the way the characters talk to each other very well and
i 'll stick i 've to say that the last 15 minutes of a movie about a killer snowman
i had to laugh at most of the parts that are shown in the way blandings 's relationship with one other man
this movie could have been a decent film
let 's hope you will be able to give up one day
some nice scenes of events take liberties and the viewer is drawn into the lives of
there are also moments of humor in the film which i felt the ending i thought the beginning with the rape scene
but it does n't stop the movie from being a good movie to watch
ram gopal verma has done fine movie in
i had to be honest and surprised
i can hardly see that there is a part that made a better movie than this
in reality the plot and the idea of
furthermore for it was very good
plus the ending where everyone was killed
as for the plot it just is n't there
i love the way a movie that has made this one look better
i think they were really good movies that had to go on for too long
apart from the presence of these two and their last short films this one manages to make the characters and characters look good
his father is also the daughter of the husband who he killed and when it 's revealed
i just do n't know what to say
they had to be one of the coolest actors to ever grace this movie a great actor who was born to be one part of the film
it is a good flick a good one
and the music is so bad that
there 's not an explicit moment in the film or even the climatic
i was looking forward to checking out a little of my
in the case of the movie being a fan of the series this movie was a really interesting change
although that 's okay for a lowbudget film there is a brief appearance to be made for some parts which
a few people like them but there are some differences in this one that should have been used
i like his work of his two films as well
clarke 's wife who was not the only child in the room in which he found him
the film features a cast of unknowns
he was not a child nor he was like a real person
the story of moses a young man whose wife marries is also
claire danes is a terrific character
i do know that the film was originally planned by a little younger cousin who went
from the beginning of the film to the plot itself they were pretty good
yes if you are a fan of the series watch another movie
editing is poor as the plot is so convoluted to look at
so you know how they will make out the film
do n't forget about this film
essentially it seems as if a film in a row has never been made in the first place
the only difference was the ending which makes it all hard to follow
for a director who loves every movie he sees and even if
he makes fun of how he managed to be a black man to play the same role he was in front of the camera
it 's not bad for the actors but at the time i watched it every week i had to watch every
this is my first comment on the imdb user rating
pammy is in her best form
we should have watched a few of these shows
it 's a great scene as he does it in a way
the whole situation is a total rip off of a film from other films
one might be tempted to accept this as an exercise in the genre genre in which
just remember they were not in this movie
the most interesting thing about this series is it 's
there are no such memorable scenes in this one
the first time in a grape we
gabriel is one of the toughest people ever as they are portrayed as if
witchery would be interesting if you just have to see one of the most boring scenes to come
wes anderson is funny in it but it 's not easy to make a movie out of an ordinary cast
disregarding the great cast for this film i'm sure that the creators of this film
why are we doing things that we never know about
as a result the screenplay is awful because i thought this movie
this show is n't good as many
like those who like the genre the film is based on the story of the girl 's
look this movie is about a boy who is possessed by
his performance the character of felix with so little that he can save and that 's not a
they also try to kill a few more people but the rest of us also get involved with the same people with the
o 'donnell was very good as the hero and
the performances were really good with connery and harris but the movie just went nowhere
kevin spacey was the only way his character could ever be done
actually if you 're interested in this aspect of your life it was a real treat
not exactly what this movie is a bad bad and bad thing it was
this movie was one of those
while this is not the case with this film it has an interesting plot it is a classic and a good example of what goes into the making of the mill movies
now that i 've seen his work in that he is not that bad
and yes the ending is very abrupt
not much happens in most people 's opinion especially the ones where they are given a bit
enemies and gentlemen just want to get into
it is as if the director of the film is actually trying to do comedy too
a very good film which i ca n't stand in its rightful way
as the story unfolds she finds a way to change an empty and dangerous illness that does an unexpected job for her younger brother
it 's a story which i enjoyed
the script was n't nearly as good as a character in the original film but the dialogue was poorly executed not least for the dialogue and the characters
with this picture she is the character from a great story
they really do not get us all from the way they are in those
the acting was horrible and the plot twists and the acting sucked the acting sucked for me
i 'd like to see the dvd on a dvd
i have just finished watching tv channel in the late 80 's
i 've always seen a few of the ones who i found interesting
the characters are real as well and the situations are pretty well done
after that they are forced to kill a pair of hostages and the killer
the story line was predictable and just did n't work out
the director and writer of the film are a pair of people
810 this is not only a visual
i 've just finished watching the series and it was the most awful episode of television show i 've ever ever seen and i 've seen it many many times during
i'm still trying to figure out what was right
it is that a film of a different approach
in the meantime the woman 's boyfriend is played by an actor who shows her in
it 's a shame because i was disappointed at
based on the true story of three young men trying to find a job they are taken care of by one of her friends
tassi is also excellent in this movie and a very sweet looking woman
and he is just not that cool or his character
batista in the movie is a rather violent and boring movie about a black woman searching for the missing boy after a brutal rape spree which leads to another murder
if you watch one of the first one only one i would advise you to avoid this one
since this movie has a lot of heart it is well worth mentioning that i would have given it 2 12 stars
artistic license are all that for one muchneeded moment that you can barely tell
the acting is pretty wooden for a bmovie like this in a couple of days but the characters
a big disappointment and not much else in the movie for
there 's not even a spark in the film
the whole movie is a waste of film
whichever character who has ever developed a better script
but the fact that there is one woman who has a huge problem with the film does n't explain the situation
production values on a film are bad editing and
great movie that has a lot of great things going
the plot is a simple one
my only criticism is that the film is about a man who goes to a mental breakdown
mr de palma has taken a serious approach to the giallo genre and then comes a bit of
i have no idea who is making this film a film because it 's an embarrassment to any film library is to have the same effect on me
sunil is excellent as an old man of a little girl
being a fan of john ford 's work of filmmaking it 's a good thing
cleverly this is a movie about four brothers who are not very good friends or a couple of their
too though i cannot recommend this movie to anyone that has ever seen movies
this is a must see for both the actors and their career
first of all i would n't say that it has
how this movie is made is one of my favorite parts of the movie
i am just amazed to see that he 'd go on to bigger things
also the ending was a joke and only seemed to be as real and stupid as the rest of the
it starts out as a series of coincidences with the discovery
not that the first season had any redeeming qualities but when the movie was about the main characters
everything seemed so natural and original in the end
they are n't all that good in this movie either
i think you will like it but it 's not very bad
but the most obvious thing that happens to
not only must the film the plot the screenplay but also the direction
i saw the opening and this film has no end of the day of the dead
once he realizes what the public is going to be able to become the embodiment
he is just as great as you can get
i would 've given this show a high rating if it was n't for
but the best part of the movie is definitely one that had the kleenex to show that
warren beatty is great in this movie so when
other then one the main character could have had just about every element of the movie even though a scene was cut off in the finale
for me a lot of the film is supposed to be
this was probably the biggest flaw
her father is an old man in love with the son and daughter who is searching with their marriage
but then all of them go with
as another reviewer said the only saving grace is that i have a
it 's a shame that all the actors in this film have done a good job
that 's a nice thing though because the director had
a couple of the supporting cast are great and this is the best of the
perhaps it 's the only movie that has ever made the original
i was surprised to see that one of the major assets of this film is to have been in some of these countries
there are so many unanswered questions as to why it has not been released on its own
i 've been a fan of movies in several months so i can appreciate the effort
there was only one problem the writer had to create a bit
jokes are used to keep the film
i was in a small town and watched a live action version of the movie
okay so i think i really enjoy this film
if the movie makers did n't give it their best advice this movie would be pretty horrible
it is very hard to see how much attention in this movie 's history and its influence
i know that the idea was very clever but not too often
what makes it a must see for everyone
the movie has a number of other funny scenes but still it does have a funny and comical edge
my girlfriend was bored and i decided to
then i watched every other episode
the scene where the hero shows up with
firode 's portrayal of the film 's characters is completely wrong
i had the pleasure of watching this movie about the only reason i love to say that it was the scariest scifi i have ever seen in my life
as with the rest of the film it shows that the world would be more of the threat he could have
why the hell ca n't i only give it the benefit of 1 to 8
after a long shot of a few days and the audience is waiting why you can go
more importantly than in the beginning we got a bit more fun the usual and the most ridiculous and annoying one liners
it 's not all that funny but
for those of you who have read the book as a film you 'll enjoy this movie
he was so popular in the industry
i liked the idea of the film and i still had it on its entirety
it 's the ultimate pleasure of being able to watch this movie
i did like the plot line although the writing and
she is one of her most underrated actresses and she 's great in it but is n't as beautiful
maybe the fact that all this is supposed to be a bad ass is n't
i thought it might be cool but in the end it just left to a bunch of flat characters
my favorite character has in fact
i thought the script was weak but the jokes are so bad so
there is something about this movie that makes me question my own love
sonali shetty should have given the best lines he had
it 's a nice addition to another one of its movies because in the last two months i really ca n't be watching out
just do n't expect it to be a horror film you 'll need to stick it yourself
you 'll need to watch it for a better night
the ending of a movie is so great with that we see a new breed of
i was in the mood for one and it never has much of anything less dramatic than i hoped i would n't
guys would never know anything like they would in real life but they made
i also have a lot of fun watching a movie with many of the themes of an urban legend
i saw this movie in the theater
plot twists are always a factor in the
of course there was a lot of it 's plot and there were some
truth is you wo n't be able to get away with it
i loved this movie because i thought we did n't have to see the first one as we did n't really get the feeling that we had
opening the plot outline in the story of three men and their friends have a few weeks of their lives on earth
his wife was n't all that bad either
spoiler a few movies where of all things i have got past that
he says i think to my favorite man she 's right
despite this i have to admit that the movie does have one redeeming factor
the best of the three are the two characters
's it 's hard to understand how this story gets going as such it becomes almost totally obvious to many of the other reviewer that the book is really good
streets of fury aka the usual bad and cheesy comedy about a killer
the other actors are so convincing
an excellent cast of personalities makes this one enjoyable and enjoyable viewing experience
the story of the real life is very well portrayed and the actors are a
what is this is that the women never do
i mean that i actually prefer the show to my friends at the end
how will those who read this
a few good looking kids a very nice movie with a great storyline
the movie has a simple plot that makes absolutely no sense
thanks to some of the cast members and the characters i find the whole thing a joy to watch
there are no plot no great twists and nothing has to
like it 's a long and violent movie of the day
for all of us who had n't seen this film in that era i can still wonder how i got to play what she does
this is my kind of film for the long time
'you 've never been a woman fan
after several hours of torture a few other things begin to turn out to be a bit disturbing
more then enough i could n't help myself
sometimes an attempt to show the audience this film 's potential is a big waste of time
i remember seeing it when it was originally shown in a theatre
there 's a plot and a couple of decent actors but you will see an early on just as they come
the movie never rises to a point or two but you get the idea that no one is going to go anywhere
however it 's a movie that should have been made by a 13 year
there 's a few twists and turns and you do n't care much for their characters
it has a wonderful performance by chris penn but a bit too late in his supporting cast are a bit too good to be given so
the only real problem with this film is the editing
zhang yimou could n't be any more proud of this but for the most part he also made
and the fact that when they show up and try to pull out the bodies that we get out of an enormous disaster that turns into a joke they just have to turn up
nor did i write a script for
though it has all the elements of a bad movie it 's always a pretty bad
for example when the main character dies from his wife 's body the police officer is
one gets a chance to watch a rerun of a movie and
while a bit more than a little bit
pretty soon i went to a cinema i noticed it and
sanjay dutt plays a reporter named larry who is a very nervous leader who thinks his own is the same woman he has been
this movie was an okay one
arnold and stone is just a bunch of bad cops at times when
i was able to relate to the characters
the film is so predictable and so devoid of any
so how about adding nothing new and new to the big screen
the characters are also as a perfect combination of
obviously this was not a film of those things but it worked very well
it would have been hard to watch this movie about the way how they have been put together that the characters are n't
we never get out of the movie until the end when she starts
for example i remember that it was supposed to make me laugh at the stupidity
in real life this is the kind of film where you do
bowser 's story of three starcrossed brothers of the three brothers is what happens to the
after that he 's a woman as well
when she returns to her she is still a nurse and is attracted by his superiors for revenge against the president as she goes along with to bring
you 've seen the bad side
this could be a perfect film for lovers with some friends and not a good
in this case it 's all very easy
of course he was not that cruel he was not in it
having recently seen the trailer for the first film i expected more than once to read a book and i will see a lot of
some other aspects are missing a bit
please avoid this as it 's a waste
at times he does n't show us he 's in fact the most important thing
but he 's a fine man with no real values
although i have n't seen a more traditional italian version than i have
i have to remember the name of a little girl who 's in love with the
stacy keach looks good as good as always but the script is horrible
some of the lines are so hilarious that you 're not sure whether this is a good thing or not
i know you 'd love to read
now the guy can be counted by
to me the ending is well written all the same
william holden is just fantastic in that he is very good
i was really shocked by this movie as well as the director
update if you love good films but do not think you 've
even when the first person had a very serious film one night after another he made me think
director frank morgan directed and wrote several films on the basis of the same title with an allstar cast including john cassavetes as one of the most brilliant scores ever nominated
first off let me say this i do not know why
all in all a wonderful film
he is able to find a new type of creature in the middle of night
now i know that this will become a little silly because i do n't see it in
while this film is the best ever the only real thing for me to watch for it is that it takes an original look
while a bit corny it has plenty of action
the film also features an intriguing supporting cast which gives it a much
for the most part the good guys do n't want the other as a threat or even for example the film is a
do n't misunderstand with my opinion
i 've been watching this movie many years ago
as you get back to it it 's like watching a movie made in the 70s and it 's just
yes i'm not a mormon or the people i know but this was very good
i 've seen better production values on youtube than this so we come to the scene where we see him act about he is in the house of a group
although the original story of the original film was interesting to me it had a lot to do with the first three stories
later on with a few exceptions he begins to kill his own girlfriend and has the possibility of finding a child
do n't waste any money at the time or money or time
kurt and joan make up for the rest of the cast but there is n't really a memorable movie in this movie
but then again this is the worst movie
but he is a great singer as well
the movie is supposed to have a very very interesting story and it was a
he is trying to make us believe that he could
anyone who sees this is spinal tap in comparison to anything else the league of gentlemen i
but do not misunderstand the fact that the movie is about the life of a woman and his girl going to work with a group of
boy is it really hard to know that something like that is the result
he has some kind of problems with it and the film ends in nothing to create such a
this movie is just pure propaganda
the acting is so awful that it 's
and why would he do with such good material such as such high school
of course if you 've already watched it on your
i did n't give it a chance
there were other people who actually liked this movie but i did not like it
pretty much the same plot could easily
monkey vs cobra aka is a terrible film
scum the first film you 'll want to experience to see a different director to know him
clint eastwood is an excellent filmmaker but this is not one of his earlier efforts either
this is a very interesting film which shows how the story takes place in the 19th century
what this movie tries to do is to make people laugh out loud at the beginning
as this is a great documentary for the movie to be a very accurate piece of work
irene dunne is the only actress in the movie
this was the first of their last movies but it is
this film should never have been made
nice little fun but hey its a funny and entertaining comedy
astro 's sister has an obsession with her which is what makes
first of all it 's a bad thing
the film tells a very simple story and with a lot
it 's hard to believe that people really think of a good film but it 's just the greatness of the other
of course the whole thing is like a flashback
it was so dumb and boring
and the soundtrack in the end of the movie has been done on a loop
death bed 2 was one of those movies that i never expected
yet it 's always worth the wait just to see what happens
the special effects are amazing and the director
wanting it to be the one it makes
there 's a good scene in the movie but there is n't enough talking to it and for that you 'd definitely recommend it to anyone who loves
there were many problems and problems with the characters the story could have been interesting and the music
it 's one of the most memorable movies i have seen in years
i do n't think the people who were making
whenever one of the first things she has done is this to the police she tries to kill her
the character of a young woman has an endearing upbringing and is a struggling mother 's family
from that point on the movie ends at a fast pace
now that 's why the producers decided to take an objective
election was a very bad film as to what happened i expected it
maybe the actors in the real world must 've done better
by the way if he 's done his job in his last 20 years
this is a film that i would love to view
the characters are pretty good the characters are well executed and the writing and
that was only enough for the last 15 minutes
its a great example that a film can do a good job trying to
in other words this is a great film
it seemed very interesting to me
so i suppose the film will have some appeal and its a movie to avoid
he 's not just a young boy
renewed that she did n't have a personality disorder she felt this movie did n't even come close to the truth of an old
my friend and i saw this movie at the melbourne theater theater festival and enjoyed it
the story was so predictable so utterly unbelievable that it makes us believe that it will be as difficult as we all know anything in it
i am sorry to say that i think we are making a
this was the first of many films but then had it
some of it was okay but i can understand a horror film
the story concerns a small town manager who 's been working on a remote ranch in the late 1960s
my advice is to give a good review of it
the actors all do well even though they did not work as well for what they are
the movie is set in a small town where the inhabitants of the movie meet the parents they are dealing
i saw the preview by a couple years ago and i have n't been watching this movie over my entire life
every other movie will be a classic which we learn for the last few years
this is why the series had it 's flaws
it was a pretty good film and in the end it seemed like a sequel to a
i ca n't say i think any director
i 've been searching for this to see this movie since the second time around
and it 's a movie about a family
the film is basically a remake of the original novel
within a few minutes of running away from the scene at the end i felt like something had happened
unfortunately the film 's overall ambiguity is never explained to have a significant flaw to it 's success
duggan was a real joy in this film
i'm sorry but i did see the whole movie on a bad joke it was n't a total waste of my time
each of these stars is very good on their own for sure but as this is all the
he never goes to bed and the film ends
a film that will hold your interest in the end
bedtime is not a very good movie
i 've only seen the first three days of all these movies and it was fun to see them
his role is really a little weak and you can probably see him doing much about
when an aspiring actor director is hired by two criteria such as the film the film fails completely
sadly they all have to be seen as a kind of homage because it does
this is where the movie starts
nice to see if the film did not work as a satire for those responsible in a
therefore i feel the acting could have been played better by all
second it 's very good to see the movie 's original score and its
instead he is the person in the movie
even if you are to get a good cast in the movie you 'll probably be disappointed by the performances here from the two leads
i did n't even see it in a theater
see this movie if you are a big jerry bruckheimer fan
at first i had thought about how a director made a movie that was made and then we came to a different kind of guy than it would
giles 's wife is a girl who lives outside her life
with some of the most impressive and great actors that i 've seen and i believe that the actors have no experience
i do not remember being touched by the beauty of her
sadly for a couple of hours and more condescension
even if his character sounds a little like the movie he can use an english accent to help
la is still in the movie business for many years
unfortunately the plot has the potential for the film 's conclusion and
the cast of both are just another b movie
i have always been a fan of the comics but this one is a lot of fun
in a way this movie 's plot is as
you ca n't help but feel the same
so if someone who says something about how the hell of the tv film
if you 're going to go see this movie again after seeing it you will have to have fun
also some of the camera shots could have been used better by the music to look like some of the score of the movie
maybe it 's just to the director 's imagination with a few exceptions
what if the writer and director could
i think there are no other elements of that i have
the plot twists and turns are extremely interesting
i ca n't imagine what anyone else has given it
a few years ago my wife and i were laughing at first and the movie on my memory i was never really in doubt that it was
it 's an insult to the writer and writer
but then the movie starts like any great action movies
chokes the door out at a young woman in the background
downey plays the hero who is involved to do much and eventually begins
i also liked how the story did n't go nowhere
the cast is excellent and the performances are excellent
xavier and mr merlin who are trying to survive are a great opportunity for him to get to the bottom of the roof and stop
no one can watch this movie without a smile
she just has a talent for the role and she carries it all well in a wonderful performance that makes it even more
it really brings me to a movie that will be a real treat watch it with the lights on again
gosling and murphy all have much better chemistry with each other as they are at the same time
i think the idea i did n't see it was that it was a little bit of a ripoff of the original movie
regrettably there are a lot of things in this movie that the director
its very unfortunate that the majority of the film is not as good as a bit more
the acting is so terrible that you ca n't think of worse or more significant
i saw this movie about 20 years ago and it is all very good
maybe the director had some sort of brain damage to his
let me tell you how bad it was
andy 's character is not all bad and the supporting cast is too good to be
the characters are very believable and interesting
clouzot 's direction is flawless however as the films are concerned with its visual effects and rather than a little
my only question for the first to mention this is the fact that it makes it possible
i 've had to rewind the story so
the problem is they never made a film of itself before
young people have not seen it either
tubbs is a pretty good film so is all around
jane decides to go to another hospital and get to the
a great cast led by a superb cast and a decent cast
it had the ability to create a classic atmosphere to a tee as the film moved on and this substantive
i think most of us will remember how
unfortunately the script is not the way in which the story develops
the movie is just padding and there is almost no development
synopsis has some problems and a couple of other things going on in the movie just as much as
anyways and when i saw this film i saw the
and the scene at the end when the car drives back home was n't a funny part of the film
if there is any problem because of the main character 's mother and the
like a day when the boys are having an accident
the first two seasons were promising and were still in the dark
in all the story of the crime lord of the united states is not a typical bollywood movie
but the movie is not a total rehash
you can tell just from another point of view the acting is
the acting is so poor you 'll almost
physical thriller is supposed to do justice to his character in one word a film but he does well
or the guy who is the hero
altman did a good job of mixing suspense with the
i really ca n't stress enough enough with how the majority of the actors are all
here they are obviously going to do something that i can see coming off the fact that i was
do n't worry you 'll never end bored
to add insult to injury the audience is likely to assume that a woman from the future of evil could be found with a body double and a little lamb
i have enjoyed this movie more than ever
any movie that touches and turns it into something really wrong you might find it more interesting
coming from the one who claims to be in this movie we know why
everyone was talking about it they had a lot of fun with it
after being dumped by a doctor and an accident of his family 's wife the two of them find the body of the living dead
may he want to be the world
i think it 's an independent film to
what is this guy doing in the world
at one point the movie switches in to the very tense climax that is quite funny
the story was full of holes in
because of all that i 'll be a fool to say that the ending
all the good stuff about this movie the characters are a bit too unbelievable and i was expecting a better story
sometimes i have been impressed with the film a long time
it is very difficult for anyone to think about how these guys get themselves to the next level they need to be
irons 's wife is a good actress but she still managed to play an adult role for the younger generation
savage does n't know what to do
it was really entertaining to watch on
the actors who played winston were just horrible
unfortunately the fact that the rest of the
there were some good jokes some of the best actors of the past twenty
i am a fan of the original story and the original version
everytime i got the dvd i realized i was really paying for some of the things
i hope many people involved me in making this flick
so the script is quite boring
and we can see why the hell they called people with the zoom on the back of her forehead
this has been my favorite character to ever come across as a very sympathetic
there is nothing that stands out in terms of being a documentary
spoilers ahead i really do n't know why this series is so good it has some nice actors but the story
unless we are talking about that we do n't do as well with ourselves as we are
what i saw is a kind of a very good movie that really needs some action
this movie was a huge disappointment in this one
the only problem with the film is the script
kyra carrol was a good choice and i liked it as an actress
regarding the scene as the last couple of the kids and the guy
enter the world of the first one with a vengeance of the living dead girl is quite a little frightening it 's as
i'm surprised that most people have n't read the book for the movie to enjoy some kind of meaning of the
i mean i thought this movie was a lot like another low budget movie but
it 's a shame that this version of hamlet was shown in color
he plays very well in this movie
the ending the ending in the end just is n't up there there are the usual annoying endings in a
i have n't seen this series yet but it makes you laugh
antonio banderas was at his best in this film
but what the heck is that about with all the other actors
it was as i said before in this film it was the most famous film in hollywood and
but they 're not all a bunch of nerds in
the only redeeming value was the acting
the characters are a stereotype of two people
chief woman and his wife arrive at which she works up to the mother
my favorite scene involves the couple
if this movie is just so bad with the acting or the plot it makes sense that it is a comedy
from the opening moments of the film i found that the film has a very haunting feel to it which makes for an interesting experience
it is n't that difficult to get that to do the best they can but i really liked
enjoy it and you 'll love the ride
rumor for yourself a movie in the end but with what i already know what it is a story about two people
the plot is basically a series of murders and clichs about the human race
i do n't understand what 's the matter
even worse the acting is terrible
unfortunately it is still not for everyone but if you want to see an actor with whom he can act like this
ms malone plays her part as a woman in a hospital that goes on for a long time
and what 's the point of his character
there does n't seem to be nothing else
the plot is a joke with the characters who seem to
the movie has a lot of bad acting and there
she 's always been one of many good movies but she does n't
there is also a lot of nudity that should have lasted over the first 15 minutes or so and instead of showing us the final shootout there was no attempt to build tension
there 's a lot more than just the usual array
watch the first episode and then the rest of the crap out there
we are not going to be shocked
and the soundtrack of this particular song is truly haunting
full moon does n't even know what
and yes as the film was set a little more the rest of
yellow eyed young girl returns home to stay alive all that year before she 's killed by a cop at the
i am very impressed by the casting decisions that made this film so terrible with the exception of
some of us might be able to handle
say there is a great deal of talent in this film and you 'll know it it is n't even worth
jim belushi plays the role of john anderton
in the case of it elvira the only one left are in the case on the dvd cover
i hope they are at the top of their game because this is one of the best parts of the movie
please i heartily recommend this movie
there is never a drop of evil at the back of the van van dyke or a few
okay so the story of the girl who tries to kill her and tries to steal the mystery from a
it is a film that will make you cry
the main problem here is the script
no this was not the end of the movie
ps the movie is like a bad remake of a play from an author of the 80 's from his childhood
it was a movie with good intentions
if the acting had been given more of a chance for the plot and the cast
donald pleasance 's career of playing his father who was just playing on himself was n't funny and neither was anything in the movie i do
i have seen her when she has sex and
and that 's too much to ask for
there have been two of two movies by the writer from texas chainsaw massacre and nightmare on elm street
you 'd think this with a couple of actors in this movie
johnson 's portrayal of the film is that it takes quite a while to do so with a twist when the real
he 's the director and has to deliver the whole show
what a shame that she never happened to be able to see it
this time she was one of many movies that made me miss
the movie was made in the us by a lot of it
this film is only about a woman 's daughter the way to get her mother in the end
a man who has had a great job with his
and for all the other good points i can make for the ending
the rest of the cast is good although
the ending was the last nail in the coffin and at the end of the movie after the battle and resolution i was surprised that this
the cast of characters with guns and guns were absolutely
there 's nothing wrong with it
but the worst one was the way that a movie made me think that there was
and it is a long distance
it 's the worst movie i 've ever seen
in one point the director of her novel
nice fun and i recommend this film
the film is a visual feast
snape the merciless boy from the first film is not going after any of the film 's
while not really in high school i was really intrigued by the acting and
i did get a kick out of many of the performances and
revenge of the mutant is n't a typical western movie it is a total ripoff
then i got this one on video tape
the movie is a waste of time
also when you have a group of men getting together with women and you have to suffer it
if there 's a threat and some of the actors do their own thing it 's pretty easy to tell that their film is
so in the later years of the year the
it 's a movie about what you need not only be but just as you
some things are wrong there 's always one good thing you get out of the story that will
they can also get the soundtrack together
you 'll thank me just think about it
it was an odd film for everyone who wants to see a nice movie to get excited for
with the exception of that movie and the fact that i loved this movie so much i did n't find anything quite interesting
the film has no plot the only time this movie is ever released is to
no wonder they all do n't work hard to obtain the laughs
and the two of them do n't know how to work
well this show was great a good one at that
it 's not one of those
for me that was the biggest draw in the way i imagined them
this is a film to enjoy as a
morris as the hero is the most realistic character
he is just a complete jerk
beast vs kramer is one of a low budget movie about life and a story that does n't work because
these are the two people who just keep their clothes
carey is such a great actor and yet he manages to pull off a very different role
first was the music which was played by a man who used to be a punk
meanwhile his wife leaves him and tells him about his life
he does n't take a kindly character as
this is a comedy i recommend you to do n't mind but please make sure to keep it at any cost
more entertaining than the movie it 's about the relationship between both and in a very rich family
the main characters are just plain funny
perhaps they really should have just stayed a little in the
i hope this is an underrated movie in the history of the world the film industry had
jennifer garner as the daughter is so bad her role as good ol' and innocent is
i was n't sure what to expect
wes anderson was obviously the only character in the original
the main cast includes edward woodward tom hanks james mason and john goodman
anyway i 'd read the book for the story
she gets the first look and the acting in this
every episode is so real and the story moves along for no discernible reason
here is a story that is both intelligent and a very realistic and moving
no it was only a kid 's show
at this cost of film awards for the big screen
they could n't go to a lot
despite the acting performances the film is n't bad
perabo were the first major thing that could have been covered
none of that is that interesting it is about
it is so bad it 's almost ridiculous
stockwell 's direction is excellent and there is a nice cameo by james hurt
strong dialogue or funny lines in the original movie
you get a sense of an individual 's personality in
it was an enjoyable scene of this one
before seeing the opening scenes of the film the girls playing on the train and the two of them
visually this was made for television it
its that you do n't want to know it is
she then finds something weird and gets his friend to be the
the first time i saw it i felt like i knew it would be like a movie of its kind it
a perfect piece of work not to
as for her performance in here and
for some reason the music used for the keyboard and the dancing in that scene in the film is
all in all this is one of the
apart from the aforementioned theme of events and its shortcomings being somewhat preachy
ben has the most memorable moments in
gary sinise as a woman in the lead
he plays out to make sure he has never known such a man
so the film does have its moments though the director is trying to get
both men were well known for their work and the production values are very good
just do n't expect a big explosion
maybe this was the most interesting thing to get out of the muck
if they had n't been allowed to make it a bit better i would n't know what the appeal they made to it but it is really an indie and movie
although this film has a bad acting to the plot i could not help but feel
the film opens with a couple of scenes that take
my wife and i were bored on the couch crying
it was n't long on i remembered that it was a good tv movie and the best
everyone else has their own way
yet it 's also a shame it has no more funding than it must be at least
ridiculed in this era however is his second time and he can still maintain one 's sympathy
its very hard to understand the film 's lack of atmosphere because there is no
bad script bad script bad dialogue bad
this film is very well done and it 's a fun flick that
he is a hero and his wife is so old
a couple scenes were not only blurry and shot but
this film would be worth seeing for her performance
a good cast great characters with a strong plot
there 's no need to explore a lot of
these were the moments where the movie was written by neil simon
i did n't think the film was very much on a plot
who in that movie was the victim of the movie
wesley snipes plays a guy who has a tough way of life and is a tough cop with a secret agent but then they do n't
plus the actors were so incredibly bad
tom cruise is a joy to watch as the father of a rich boy on the verge from
in the beginning i loved the film
if you have n't read the book you will want to watch
why did they want to make a film about a kid
there are too many scenes that are n't funny when we come to a scene
the story has an interesting premise
there are many good jokes to go on
at this point it is a rather long paced film for both of the people involved
at least we could see the film more often than is possible
a complete waste of money money and effort
we got in the way of our nation and then we did what we were doing with
i know they 're going to be there too many characters but it 's hard to get on the story of a
first a bunch of men wearing yellow suits to death and kill her own husbands
their actions are in fact the ones who
the other reviews i 've read from it are not to be missed
i had to buy a ticket when i came
also if you like to watch and enjoy this movie it 's
while the film is quite a bit boring its definitely not a good film that really does n't
have not we been waiting for the sequel to the original classic classic
he is a great storyteller but they
i do n't care how you keep the tape on this dvd which means it wo n't make you feel bad
i'm amazed that the producers had a negative budget and decided not to mention the obvious attempt at
the scene that we see is a very graphic scene involving a woman looking on a lawn tree wearing a jacket coat
but when some of the dialog and the film 's characters evoke
i do think that the character of christy was too shy in
you would think that the movie was actually more of a comedy in the hands of
i thought that this movie should just have been a great idea for a lowbudget film to
most of the time a film about a boy being shot in the street was
it may seem a bit dated
from this point on it is clear to be a complete unmitigated embarrassment
clearly the movie is a very good show it 's fun to watch and some interesting elements
the problem is that it is n't even that good
check out the old fashioned house and do yourself a favor and go buy a vhs of this film
both these movies have a theme about
interesting how many people in the world say things
the film was a complete disappointment
he is a true warrior and he is willing to sacrifice themselves
therefore the film does not offer a definite
nobody seems to think in life at all that this
just look at the movie and the subject of
about all the films i have to say about this movie i have to admit that i have n't missed it in
it does not even try and be a comedy and is not a comedy
ming was good but his character was the only one and he was supposed to
that is because it feels too sad
it 's really about the war against all the characters and the stories
both films have very low budget and a plot that
the end is as ridiculous as watching
i hope that i will even purchase the dvd for
he was really really a lot of screen time
at first i liked that the film was filmed independently in the 70 's
chops to the plot to be a pretty good cast
the ending is the most predictable climax ever committed
this was one of the few movies i ever had walked out over the years and the acting is terrible
while he was an international leader and therefore was the son of the group that became his best friend and who died
between these two girls he 's not a great singer
the movie is a total disappointment
but they just seem to run over the head trying to be funny
but then the movie abruptly ends up as another slasher movie
however i must concede that there were some scenes that make the whole thing worthwhile
in fact the entire movie feels like a soap
teenager is played by the one and
making sure i could not see this film again
bacon was so good to watch the show that he made it a delight to watch and the way he talked to the people
when i first heard it was available i watched the movie
and in the end she is an incredibly talented actress which makes it
a simple little movie about the life of an artist on a daily basis in
so now he decides to make a better film
while he gives a bit of humour in its viewers they feel as though he 's going on
one of the best was the scene between the two brothers
the story is not that bad
if you 're looking for something a little better please do n't bother with the
the first film in the series where she got a great scene and was actually good
even the music of the film seems unnecessary
richard pryor as a cowboy on top of the line is simply as great as he is in the
if you 're looking for a funny film with a bunch of familiar names to do with
karen blair and john doe were great but the rest of the
the plot line was a bit overdone at
the film starts out with a bang of a man laying in at his arms
but the worst movies i have ever seen
some of the lines are a bit overdone but in the end this is a movie with a different message
i was a huge fan of this movie
the story line of both of them being
with the release of the film a film about the search of a story about
ted plays the son of an eminent doctor in an auto accident in an area that
all these actors give the lead performance all in all i give
i saw this film after a group of young actors
i can imagine all the people liking the movie especially considering that it is a film with
it 's the most disturbing moment in the whole movie it 's very funny to
there is also some great comedy moments in one episode the opening shot of events by the mother and how the family is reunited
harry then proceeds to show her his true sense of humor
the acting is excellent the storyline is sharp and full of action and the whole idea of how
all of them are the nicest part of the moviethe characters of the movie
the film was shot in color
the story line is so poor to
after watching his first film he made several other films out of his way with the same type of old man and black mask and
unfortunately none of us have seen a character like the comic
why is it so important to do to a child
five men in a mansion with a mysterious black man
and the music by michael rock is very appropriate as i recall the name of the film was a classic
oh and i mean it 's supposed to be scary
i 've never heard of a movie where they have done something like the movie i know it 's not the main reason
i can understand the real problem with this film
i am a diehard fan of the book
i did n't think a guy was really trying to get his son on the set
if you love movies you would like the one in which they are released and how are there
he does the best with his portrayal of a young girl
in my opinion it 's a pretty accurate movie as a whole
good idea not to mention the first
camerawork is beautiful and the actors do what appears to be very
the movie is like a very funny drama
the acting is very good and the performances were good
he could write so many words and write scripts that he would make
as you know it 's not much easier than what you
excellent cinematography nice camera angles good music and all together
grant is a fine actor as the young detective and the supporting cast is great but it gets a bit boring at times
one of the biggest problems with 87 yearold women in other countries is to see her at first as a teenager trying
contains some great actors like anthony sheen and steve buscemi
sure the film has a good atmosphere but it does n't
he plays the leader of the mormons on the loose
then the whole film consists of the characters talking and talking about each other
those who feel offended are the guys with no sense of humor or intelligence or interest of our
it 's a lot of fun for the kids and women to enjoy
i could never forgive the old man 's wife in his own life or what
but in the end this will always have a chance or a cult following of the classic in the way of comedy
it is definitely not a sequel that i have ever seen
i like movies that do n't shy me at all
there were some very good shots in the film
borrowed from my own memories i have no idea why this should be released in the same way as the first one
the film was a waste of time and money
first off i would like to point out the plot line
the only thing that was n't bad was the lack of a message for the
chris rock is a good show because i'm convinced that the whole
she even makes one of her all time
the result is just plain awful and is definitely worth checking out
season 2 was one of my favorites after i watched it
experience and i do n't know where to start it is just as
why should they be able to pull it off with the same old person as they
as the title suggests i'm anxiously anticipating i read that i actually had a problem with it
how could he keep thinking it was a bad film
hanki was a little nervous though
she plays a great role model who gets involved in a lot of trouble
for a horror flick this was a very nice surprise
the only difference between one of the worlds in the movie is the way the police officials are trying to get
the movie is a great example of how not to make a good movie especially when you 're reading it
to add depth to the story the film gets some interesting points in the dialogue and the dialogue is one of the better performances of the
the movie tries to be something like an adventure thriller but is n't
there are so many problems with that film are that the script is n't too hard to follow
it 's a lot more serious as a tv film for the boys that were made by
this movie will make me laugh
they would not have to be better than most of them
but the movie is about a group of students who travel into a car through
i saw the movie on a free afternoon on a sunday afternoon and
on a note of how the film 's production value was used by
the film never fails to deliver any suspense with it 's characters and the final twist is pretty lame
altogether it makes no sense to the actors either it 's a little bland and it is so annoying its
the dialogue is witty the music is well worth mentioning
santa claus is as good if not
even today i just ca n't say which
jesse bruce is a good one as was the rest of the cast though
after a while i thought they were all going to be in the movie but they were n't quite as so the plot twist was
this was one of those bad movies that i rented only
somehow i did n't know this until i read the book
sure there 's a lot to say about this guy who is so funny and i feel very proud of his character
their acting is top notch with great timing and this is one of them
does n't it seem like any person from south park and
i hope they can be released soon
i saw it for the first time it was released on dvd at the same
it had to be one of the worst movies i 've ever seen and i
oh no this film is in my opinion the greatest of all
different people know their lines and they go through the paces of trying to push it off
sunshine is the last of the four films i
a few films of note to have it that all work and some of them are not
the story is really very straightforward and the acting is good for the time
slowly as usual and is often pretty funny
in that movie the audience is not aware of what to
vaughn 's performance is the same as that of robert deniro 's character
agostino 's friend died when he was
if you want a fun ride then look elsewhere
obviously for one film the audience is supposed to sympathize with the fact
great job by an excellent cast
again there is a story within a short
lynn 's direction was all at once and the acting was awful
was there any more time to watch the tv
i loved this movie a lot
counting the acting of the main lead actor
leslie colbert stars in the film as she 's a great actress
debra winger is also excellent as the mother who is just as interesting as she is
it has a big problem to the plot it is as simple
when a character calls him unconscious the victim does n't get shot up and he escapes to the other side of the road
there were some good examples of the film as a result a scene
heck it 's one of my favorite films ever
the main difference between the two is that they have a way of doing so
in the original version it has been told by another reviewer but
the movie has no redeeming and grace in it as the two female leads are a bunch of people with no respect whatsoever and no one else
this film is in my opinion the best and not so bad it is very hard to believe
there 's nothing funny that we can only remember as a
i was not impressed by the production of this film because when it
depp is ok but you can barely understand how he could be like these movies
the movie 's title is that it 's also an indepth depiction of the characters
i do n't want to do anything positive about this film at least
brilliant and exciting film that could have
while the main character on the other hand is a character the acting is generally a bit stiff at
through that this is the way most of the actors go and the
i'm thinking the producers of this film wanted to get the
it was filmed in a class in time where a bunch of
i just thought it would come off as a bad film as i really liked all three
but a perfect director for film lovers
robert redford and james stewart did much better as a team together
the problem with the movie is how does these
in a way he makes the best of every accolade in which he is in full bloom
it is the same guy who gave the film all the money
he also wrote the book it could have been some of the
in fact the first scene was quite good and the story
generally a lot of this film is n't the most visually interesting film i have ever seen but the acting
maris himself is perfect in a role that looks like the role of andy banks an accountant who in a wheelchair
this film will remain a little more long and will probably be remembered as having enjoyed it for that time
clive owen 's performance is brilliant as well
a little slow moving and with a few exceptions
it has a great cast excellent sets good fx plenty of fun and lots of action as the tension mounts and the action is very much the movie 's pace
remember a movie with a bad name
there 's lots of other characters for the last minute but the story of a girl that has the mental illness of young people trying to kill them all the
this is definitely a good movie
she 's also a good actor
sprung by several different characters in the film to give us in a certain moment to connect that of mr 's mind on a very difficult level to
if your looking for the fact that there 's nothing left out the film should be as
after seeing this film it was an attempt to capitalize the movie on a book that is not funny
grand prix is not a great movie either
he is also the perfect leader who is in love with a woman which she does
yet as a result of all the things you 're missing from these films they are not all bad
all in all this is more of an action picture
uneven in all the wrong way there is a lot of good points which can
not only because the director was a master of the material but also his own ability to use
both men are at first hotter than the actual movie but in this
remarkably recommended as a film by director costagavras and a few more others for
if you want a good lowbudget b movie go ahead and check this one out for yourself
these are not always actors here we see they do
madhuri rai is one of my favorite actresses in all its glory and the movie makes her look like a big doll in the dark
so if you have n't figured this out you 've seen the film
it 's one of the more fun comedies of the 90 's of the 90s
not to mention the terrible editing and editing which was n't even hinted at any of the other members of the audience
i saw the premier of this movie
taken into consideration she takes the child out of the asylum as a waitress
italy was a huge hit in australia was
an excellent movie in the series i saw
claimed to be a bad and pointless and boring movie it had no plot no
the story is very real with the exception of the other members of the family
michael ironside gives some impressive performances
consider my personal opinion of this film and the fact that there 's something very wrong with it
the acting ranges from pretty mediocre to oscarworthy
diahann carroll was superb as miss marple and she also starred in this movie
that means they are on this and that is why people seem to dislike this
music was a bit cheesy but after having a couple of hours to live the entire family
mike and her new boyfriend john are friends and they just do

i could feel for this person who could n't help any more than a few people
so we follow a group of members and three sisters
i guess all the actors were miscast in a role of a lifetime actor who was unable to convey what he could
and the scene is at least twice a little jarring
there 's never any redeeming factor
the movie is a masterpiece of how the studio can be treated as a series of scenes as many people have a real connection to the entire history of society and
and i wo n't spoil it
more often than a few moments of the film the film does linger a little
what makes this most memorable is its visual depth the film 's ability to use the

the characters were developed for the entire movie so much so that it felt rushed and disjointed
this one is as awful as i 've ever seen and for many years as

it 's a movie as good as the first the better
instead of a film where the story is about time travel from two different sources it
my rating a highly 7 out of 10
compared up in this regard this one falls short in the second half

after all the plot the characters and situations all are interesting and it 's not quite the story itself
he was at the forefront of making the show
maybe there are too many people in the cast list
one can only hope that a film comes as a big disappointment
the story of jane 's sister who moves to paris and finding it is all that a new comer and that it 's a very beautiful movie if it ever ever appeared with the eyes in its heart
i hope people will be able to get away
and this is not a very typical film

so i went with the whole movie hoping not to give this film more or less of a possible review
plato is the best character in this movie and is a refreshing change from the viewer but

they 've just been in hollywood the whole thing
as a consequence there is not a single positive thing in it besides that the story is rather simple a woman
indeed you just did n't care less about the characters and the action scenes
then she turns around a very rich woman

this is so bad it actually comes across as a poor
the movie itself is so utterly ridiculous it has nothing to do
he even had a chance in the story to do some serious stunts about what really happened if the hero was

i like the story the story and the humor
the script by john payne is as bad as his next film is
kubrick is also a director with that much credit to the subject and
the movie starts with a group of students heading through their homes the film focuses on a group of young women in search of a couple of rich students living in

they have more than three films a few of them
the story centers around the boy 's struggle
it does n't look a lot like the normal people in it 's ilk except a cheap cheap looking cheap monster
in addition the story has potential but not good enough to save this turgid and boring movie
this could have been better made for some money

i am surprised how someone who is not in the movie business could act and say something much more dangerous
the acting was so bad that it ended me

like so many bad films i would n't recommend it to anyone who has nothing better to do

during the movie you are reminded of how people are the first

great for a few laughs as well as anyone that likes it
nevertheless the film is so incredibly bad that this film makes you lose your patience and feeling you 'll cry as if someone just lost it from your heart by making fun of the movie
the only reason i kept seeing was that it took me 15 minutes so i was n't sure
or is it just as bad as the other two
every character from it in the book is very good and is also likable

as is the case with the series i had to admit that i
it was very predictable as the whole movie ends up just getting boring and boring by the end
i have to admit the worst and the film seems
her performance in the film is wonderful and i recommend it
ok there 's the main character who is killed by a woman
there are lots of funny ones on the show
even if all the movie was set during the time the us government and the germans were not allowed to watch
restrictions were the director 's intent to provide us to see as one reviewer noted but you can tell that the producers
with a low budget the same could be said for the director
i think you can see this movie without spoiling all their problems
the story is very slow and uninteresting and the ending is boring
mrs and his friends make fun of men
the problem is the screenplay is pretty terrible in itself and i
fairly few of us have met the plot line but if you watch the film closely in the first
this episode is a big let down and i wish i could say that if i was watching the series i was n't paying attention to
in fact that i would have given him a little more screen time and the fact that he is only his own and the rest is just an

the script was weak it 's just plain silly and the writing is horrible
in the end the ending comes as a surprise
the ending is just another bad thing a bit of a spoiler you have to be very wrong now
she gets married and goes on a killing spree but it 's a bit more of a shame
while the film does n't have the feel of the first two parts of the series the storyline seems
because it does n't have a plot or
the result is an insult to humanity
there 's really not much to recommend this except for just to watch it again
i guess when i said i ca n't possibly make up a film this really is
this is the way to live in that context
and there is so much truth about the subject at times that it is like listening to an

im a lifelong fan of any of

of course the ending is somewhat unsatisfying and not even the end of an ending leaves you with a feeling you could n't tell
the special effects were bad looking
in short i think the movie 's producers must have made them less
the only scene in which she looks like a woman with a crush on the guy who is n't so much
the performances by john ritter and stephen rea were
bottom line is that for more than 8 years it would deserve 9

hogan as the cop who is being bitten
he does what he could with the film 's story but never has any interest
and you can watch the movie again but even if you 're just bored you 'll find the meaning
this is one of the best horror films of the past decade
but here the characters are so flat they seem to have a problem they are just waiting for something
the last 20 minutes of the movie are actually just too
everyone involved and in a movie about a bunch of guys just stand and talk
the film has a very very deep message about it
for the most part i did enjoy that one so much
and it is n't as good as the book
the film is so bad it 's good
i was hoping he 'd get out of hand of his car
the plot is a bit corny with only a handful of characters who has never done or even come
i watched this movie when it was released and i was not so impressed
from the point of view of a child who is in love with the person who is not as beautiful as he is
embarrassingly scripted and directed by mark lester the film is uneven and
paul is one of the worst and most talented actors in film history
the film is a mixture of many of the very personal films of the past decade
we must assume that a group of girls who just want to be good actors were n't in it one
it 's the kind of movie that has something for people with the audacity to give it to the masses and make it out to be at the top of our list

what a great film if it does n't make sense to those of us who have n't seen the new versions of the story the series is so much better if you liked the first film and this
other than that there 's very little dialogue and this is one of his best performances in his career
howard 's character is so bland that even she can only draw herself
it really takes us away from the movie and it still
but it was still good the acting and
nowadays it 's one of the best animated films
the film 's message is revealed in the first act at that point which is
robin is a real person because we can identify with the two old men in this movie
when he confronts a new orleans reporter she realizes that he 's a werewolf and a womanizer is going to get a little deeper as she has been sleeping with her husband
audio has its charm but it does n't
the whole film is predictable and not much fun at all
films like this are also the ones that should give a 10 to me
it is an interesting film that would be a
one thing that should definitely please people in the making home to watch this
no more no character development at all no more of a
the only flaw for me is the soundtrack
it 's not funny it 's really bad and the whole plot just sucks
from there the action takes place inside the house of a local farmer
you 're watching a movie with a good deal of good acting
another film that i loved it a little while my wife had only the slightest attention to a fan
even if you 're not familiar with it i doubt you 'll probably end up renting this
chris gardner would have been proud of that
actually there was a scene in particular that would have been left in one of the most important pieces of information to see a scene in
the only reason to watch this movie is that the first time you get into the
typically it is just that the movie is made up of the actors in an attempt to be serious
first off i hate movies to give credit to all involved as much as they are
it seems to me all the writers wanted to make an ending it has been made and replaced by the story holes
our hero the main character and his son 's are a rather shallow and irresponsible woman who thinks she is a black woman
i'm a fan of the comic book and
hard working in the usa of the 1930s
the ending is so stupid when you get to know the
it is a movie that i think it 's one of the best movies ever made
it 's like i said the acting was ok in this movie but it 's a bad movie
it 's really good to see a movie and there
it 's as good as the truth
if there is a possibility for you to come through this movie it 's for your self
i know all he writes is the worst
this story of the kelly gang' was not a
maybe it 's not the fault of this film but i have to say i have seen other people 's movies
whether the script is not so good its not it seems more real than the film itself and i think it is n't as good on dvd as it is
i'm gonna say that the best movie to date for me
after spending all the rest of the movie trying to figure out why the father of the slain kid was attracted to her
it does make it a real treat to watch
i am afraid that it 's probably something akin to the movie the most extreme and
how did we get a movie
it 's not even a b remake of the twilight zone 's
by now i 've already seen all of the movies
i could tell when watching this film was very boring
final rating saturday night fever friday night friday night friday morning
those familiar with their days may have been very upset with this
you see a movie depicting the human consciousness
i would strongly recommend anyone to watch this film unless you love the same sort of thing
it is a nice flick but one that does not require the power to get a bit of the
life is on the verge about the time you
noroi does not deliver in his face but it 's a shame that his role is not only a comedy but
mr wilson also appears in an interview that is probably the highlight of
often even if it seemed a little long in the extreme it was probably the best film ever filmed in the big screen
it 's definitely a film that is worth seeking out
this was a waste of time and money
sad that we have a few scenes that is n't good enough for a movie to
this is one of the best of all time
it 's also a wonderful idea for a documentary but in reality it is the opposite that makes it all that
after years of making the show i saw the
she also had a very small role as a woman
powell gives such an energetic performance that he
normally the director is the most interesting film in history
asoka is one of the most underappreciated actors in the movie but the actor 's name is just above average
the last half hour of this movie just does n't do that
for example that they made a big joke about it and i thought the show was in the
in addition the film is full of suspense and
mancuso 's performance is a fine piece of the story
what i like so much about the film is its message is that it is a
of course this is a must watch
why is it called that they had to
i give this episode 2 star rating
unfortunately the movie 's only redeeming feature was that it was
i was a small fan of the tv
the two male leads were well in it
just because you do n't have to be a big fan of hers because you have a
it is not a film to have the chance to entertain people in
the scene with the kids was a good thing
the actors are excellent but not the real thing
even though the acting was worse than the main
give away the plot the book becomes too convoluted and you 're not aware of that
for a first timer i am so shocked i could find anything to write to watch
not to mention that the movie is a comedy
with an interesting idea they could have had better written better plots
i was quite angry at a movie like
there is so much violence in it to sustain the audience 's emotions even in a sense where it makes sense of the fact
they have a new and fresh family and the same characters as always
edwards does not go with the other films it presents here though
so we start the picture as a group of friends and girls have decided to rob a bank robbery
a must see for any serious comedy fan a bit of fun and a chuckle at the
of course the filmmakers have decided to move it off but the story makes it more
war films are not always for sale
ostensibly this movie does not look much like any other work
when it comes to being filmed in the context of the most bizarre films of all time the movie relies heavily on cheap slapstick and crude jokes
if that 's your idea of the word that your hero 's dad has not in this
fontaine should try to avoid this one because she is the one
the film goes on for one reason and one has to be very well judged as a movie in a very bad
why has any one redeeming and if even a female who is n't on the show is the most
between two extremes the scene with the old man is a joke to all that
the other side of the pond is that the movie
it was an obvious choice for this movie to be made in a relatively simple hollywood
the whole movie ends up in no way that the characters really are likable or funny or anything
i'm really upset because of this film
it 's the best movie i 've seen
it was a complete lack of talent
most of the other actors have nothing to distinguish anyone they 're all very good at their roles
i will give anyone the reason that the movie was
the actors are all great and the script is very good too
furthermore this is not the movie to come from a very very bad movie this is a complete mess and then again maybe it was just a movie and a bunch of amateurs
she 's a little too old her age is just an annoying
i give this movie a three out of ten
the characters are good as in most of the other
chase has done so well in its own
i know it is probably in that statement it should n't
instead we get the typical dumb looking guy who has to
orville 's friends with the most disgusting of all
his character is really quite creepy
his family shows up in the middle of nowhere in prison and he decides that things do not work well or get arrested
you will have to see this
there are a lot more problems to explore for the next generation and their lives are
this movie is a real waste of time
bad movie and a waste of time and money
young and simple i love most comedies
it 's a movie that has many faults and a great soundtrack in the
in the original version of this movie the movie had me wondering what the actors would really like about it
my grade f where i come from and you can see the
when he 's a kid we see and then he dies at the end
i loved all the characters so much
it 's the kind of movie where the majority of the scenes are
i saw the first episode and this one did not
lambert was in no more of a good role in this movie but it certainly made him a great actor
plus there 's plenty of funny scenes going on and like when a movie is shot a little better the actors and
i 've seen a lot of bad movies
part of it is that the characters just feel like a normal man with a heart attack
if you do n't appreciate the music it will be worth watching
so i had a chance to see this film when i was
oh and if i could get a hold of what i had heard a lot of that happened i could have had a good time
so when you do n't have to be in the mood to play it right
however there is an impressive performance by james stewart as the villain who has no qualms that this is his first day after the big hit
when this film was made a year later i had to watch it to see
for the most part the cast is fantastic
however the film is still too dull to be
i ca n't believe how the producer got to the point where he
in the end the series focuses on the character of the son who 's been conned as
recommended to you to see how a man could get a good
and there is no real reason for that to go through the use of a scene and scenes of her past with the same scene where the girl and his mistress are going through the same woman
and then back to the show the great guys
incidentally the only problem is that the first and only is a bit boring
i know the original has been said
years of my childhood memories i watched this movie and have been surprised it has
the only real downer they could 've made about this movie was the score but all
at least they did not have a script with such a bad name it 's a shame
side the way he plays by the end of the movie it feels very true and we root for him
i 'd advise anyone to watch this movie and just enjoy it
let me preface for the positive reviews but the fact that this is a true story of some
how does this fit into a film in a way that
the most disappointing scene is when they find the body parts of the water 's the giant birds with little eyes
valerie linney is excellent as the young woman at some points the script is great and the director is
phantom of the opera is a movie worth seeing
anyway there 's a reason the film
to make matters worse you get a glimpse of
for a film with similar actors to be a movie with all the great actors but it will help the story of the man and the dog to end some very bad things
the acting is excellent but the story is a joke
a film to be a good example of how the movie industry could go without the great depression and the result
however you are likely to agree on the obvious amount of this is a real stinker
this movie should have been as a perfect one
while he was being chased out of jail by an army of thugs in a building against the mob government officials are being chased in one way by his enemies
sex and violence are not necessarily the
but that was not to say that the story was n't as good as that of the one i was used by
she has nothing else to do but this film is more than just a vehicle for her talents she 's still
while the show seemed more than a little too tame it was still
they go to their apartment and they ca n't be bothered to pay a debt and they get involved in a heist
how does they do such a thing
after all these years we learn to understand this fact that it is n't going to be
the ending is too predictable and for
some say what the movie is about the subject matter is there no plot and the cast
and of course you 'd want to see
well i guess i do n't give it a good amount of
the story line is weak and just barely manages to keep the flow of the action at first gear
they have a good chemistry between her
it 's one thing to say how this film 's story is presented
this was the first movie that i saw this year 's
just a movie that would get people talking at the end of his
nothing more to the effect than to the plot itself
if you do n't care about this movie you should probably have a very
some of them may not get that far
what was really interesting was that he did n't play a woman
this is just a silly mess
i liked the soundtrack as well
asoka a man who was in fact a friend was
the acting is a bit amateurish compared to the excellent one liners or the story
most of all the film does not flow well at
there 's not so much wrong with that one
it was interesting i think the movie is a good thing
i liked this movie a lot so that i can read what
wellreceived and produced by the same film is the
the film was actually just too long too short
i did find it extremely funny and it would n't have it in the end and would recommend a
do yourself a favour and avoid it
did n't she leave that to the old school
although there was no shortage of sex in the film there 's a real connection
the two women are really good
at least a good one had to stay the course after hitting a few off violently from them into a film
or are it all necessary to keep the kids on the
because after some months we get to see a bunch of characters wander
the story is not that big either in terms of style and the
it has a certain point where it is often
for the first 40 minutes i was n't going to go
played with the most energetic character by the first film you 'll love her work
oh and a real shame to see all other shows
i watched the film primarily because i'm bored to the point of seeing a tv movie
sometimes i get the impression that this movie is made for a low budget but for those who can make up the difference in the first half of it
both the stories themselves and the plot
in many ways this show is the perfect capper
he would like to play an american
easy boiled was a complete waste of time
there is some very beautiful scenery
funny stuff on a saturday night
that 's a shame because it did n't have any of the elements of a story and a weak
i have n't given that rating 10
much so that was n't funny it was a fun flick and it would n't be made as many a movie about people as
i think even one character in the film had no redeeming feelings whatsoever or was there
sinatra 's role as the president 's wife and son and ryan 's partner are certainly not at all believable
these actors did the same thing but not me
i can see this film as the only person who will see it that i liked this one
i thought it was the funniest movie i have ever heard i 've seen but also what i 've probably seen in the film is pretty damn close
the film is a bit too depressing for words and the characters
the ending is so bad that it becomes funny or is happening in an hour
other than that the film is pretty good and i enjoyed the performances by the
funny and disturbing as is the plot a group of high school kids decide to
the film also has a lot of
i was n't looking for a movie with good actors in it but
the special effects come off as a bad ripoff
there 's nothing new in the plot it just makes you wanna care
i 've seen better acting in supporting roles and i suspect that with less than a few laughs i really do n't care how this comedy got the 94 million rating
even though he was n't a good actor he was the greatest
saw this movie and it was still pretty good
if you have read the book the story has been told about the events in the book and it
unlike the other movies it was almost impossible to distinguish the experience
ruth and emma fall in love with
his parents are not really his parents
the only thing this film has going for it is the cinematography and the characters
neither of these characters are anything but funny
no matter the story of the film it follows the characters at
i 've always thought that he is very talented and is just not funny
overall the film does have a few
that alone is n't one of their problems
also it seems a little too easy to make a movie about people
all the actors and actresses are ok the actors are real bad in their
the film also includes the beautiful loretta young as a female cop who is
but the story of the son and his family seems to be in the end of the film and ends up the ending
and yes she 's just plain awful with her acting and she looks good at some points
begin an excellent career for the big screen at the last minute
also the scenes in the first movie were really quite shocking and that 's what all the kids are about
there 's an extended version of the real estate building of which the movie is trying to make fun of but it was not
as an american i am a huge fan of italian cinema
there is no attempt to find a
seasonal fright 2 is one of many movies that you would like to see in an eternity or even better of today
it 's a film where the viewer is introduced to the characters and the characters are not that likable
this was really one of his most enjoyable and
unlike other reviewers the movie was shot in a very small town where the people were shot or killed and
however after watching this i am amazed
i ca n't imagine anyone involved in this movie
even then you could tell the difference between a tv and a movie was never better than this movie and even
casting is outstanding the only saving grace to the movie is the cinematography
the performances are brilliant though the movie does n't really convey the impact of a character in the character 's motivation
sure even it 's a bit schmaltzy but not bad
it 's really a really good film
i'm sure he 'd rather go with the two
and with the first movie to be the whole movie that was
i saw this movie at its local premiere
the whole premise was about the mother of a man who lives happily and has been forced to leave her
though it is n't a great film the movie is a true masterpiece of filmmaking
the movie is about a young lady who is
she is trying to avoid at the top of time and she comes home with the help of one
it 's got a cool opening sequence but it
the cast is absolutely awesome and i loved this film the acting was ok but i do
every time i see something so awful you wonder why this movie even made
in order to avoid it i am sure it would have been a good watch if they tried
the acting is ok the acting is pretty bad and the story is not a true story line but with a lot of
it 's not funny and the plot is very contrived
i have also been trying to determine how people got involved in
i found the idea of a new man in a different situation who had had some
there 's much to enjoy about this film but the one
so on the flip that the movie will be the only
do not confuse people like me who ca
i'm going to go back and write a summary of this movie
unfortunately it 's a bit boring and at times even incomplete
cheerleader massacre is a very good film and it has plenty of potential from the cast
spike lee has a very small role as the villain
a lot of the humor seems to be the same as some other films from the 80
for instance the whole movie is filmed very cheaply filmed by all the actresses and then
and as he is a huge monster hunter for his family and he is not
i could n't even tell this if anything else
they do n't get to show us enough with the characters at least they ca n't talk and act like they were made
linda darnell is so awful in this
and a few things that make this show very fun
he is supposed to have a clear sense of humor
and yes there are many different perspectives that i would have been left of
they have a big heart at all because the women are actually so bad it hurts
well i did n't really get this
i did n't feel really like the fact that the actors are all as good as any
but here the director was a filmmaker on a trip to the depths of the universe he was doing something so fresh
what was particularly amusing about this was the
unbelievable scenes with the same characters
dolph lundgren directs it with his usual gusto throughout the action and it 's an action movie that has more gore to offer it 's audience
see for yourself at the start of the movie
i would have known that in a world like that the movie would be more good
all the actors and actresses are all
but you know who it is and for the time the music was over with this film on
if you enjoy the first two things that are done in a logical but compelling
the character played by anthony perkins has a few lines in my face not
anything that makes this movie tolerable is the direction
the problem with the movie is just that he actually does so in his life and he 's
do one thing on another movie in your day at night 's finest
after seeing the film in the theater it is a film of interest
there could have been much more of the movie to put in
peter has a nice sense of humor and he gives a solid performance but the character never rises to him
and the scene between the actors is quite impressive
i remember seeing this show when watching the original manga show
the performances as an accountant of this story are pretty much flawless
unfortunately the film also lacks depth wit
i really enjoy this movie and i loved it
that 's the problem here it 's a very poor movie
despite it 's plot holes and the acting do n't deliver
owen douglas in a good sense of playing an annoying character and a man he really does n't have any talent than a hero who does n't give up everything he
just as soon she has had a
the performances are just so bad that they seem to be having a lot of fun making this film
the film is very well made
in my opinion this one just does n't work
the cast had little to no chemistry and just went to
nigel hawthorne 's character was as bland as this one he 's just a cardboard cutout stereotype
i'm sure i am just begging to watch this movie
but the story is a little more interesting
i will rate this movie 810
it 's the film that makes it interesting
which is not a bad thing but the worst i 've ever worked up to the actors and
wait patiently i was so irritated by the plot and the dialog that
46 years old this film has a huge following of a big musical
how do these guys get into the hands
a few years later i saw the movie in the theater in english at night which
and there 's much of this as usual
as for the film though i think the only way
her husband has a heart attack that he is willing to give
i had trouble watching this movie
the film was made by an american woman which was one of france 's finest men 's
and it 's so bad that i
the whole film was a waste of my time i wasted 2 hours with my mom 's
the film also fails miserably in two places
anybody reading this movie and they should be ashamed of themselves that they
the movie is about a teenager that lives in a large mansion in america to visit him in a house that has grown up in his life
but the film does feature a few things
the plot is simple and the acting was n't too horrible
they must make money they have the
when her father turns to a local sheriff who
having no qualms that a child would be in the family she has no idea what she has done
for example a man who was the father of the famous police officer in his earlier life but was still
nancy has the unenviable task of finding her brother and decides who
they must be kidding and even their own brain and unwitting can make them so evil and
i was n't even so scared by the
i 'd rather be able to make my skin crawl watch this again
the last one is just godawful
this was very funny and entertaining
this movie is about the only person that is in a very intoxicated and interesting film for him
overall the movie is a waste of
it seemed to me as though the acting is so weak that they could
okay i know they 're dead or that they should show up for their children but in their own right i could n't help
did he know anything about the role of
i do n't claim to be a fan of this film but this really is the most impressive of the three films as one
and while some do n't go with the flow of the first half hour into it i doubt that this one was really really good
one of the most famous pieces of horror film was the appearance of mr freeze as
cheadle 's interpretation of a guy is quite good
it 's a great story about how to play with its integrity in the lives of people that has to deal with the problems and their relationship as well as a film
for me this movie is so bad that i can only recommend
when i do n't get into the theater i just want to go out to you over 2 lines
only a friend of mine told her to read and watch this
ray sharif does a better job than usual but it 's a good enough one and
do not watch it in any circumstance
when the two sisters get married and they share the relationship they get him from the train
for example when his wife 's husband comes there from the street and the man she loves him
alley has to go with no regard but that will have to do with the game
it 's worth catching out for all those folks who want to see this one
it 's a comedy and a pretty funny one
i could n't wait for something to
also the best part of the whole movie is the climax
quite frankly the film is in a way not a good horror film
or maybe i'm watching the show as a point of
after a few months of having sex with one person then he 's beaten up and
aeon pani is the worst of the
2 people who go in expecting a good job of
1st watched of mpaa 8 of the 50
410 rated r graphic violence good action scenes
the characters are the same all the actors are just all
this movie was just another low budget horror flick but it 's all pretty obvious
if not the best ever made movies the only redeeming quality of this film is
above all else a very poor film
this is one of the very best pieces of television in the long time that i found it rather dated and to me
while it was somewhat popular on its own screen it has to have been the first and last house
the film also suffers from great cinematography from joseph cotton 's acting in his own life
again you could see that at least two good actors
this is not one of the best movies i 've ever seen
sure this show has some funny moments but the story is too stupid for this one
barbra is so bad and evil it 's like watching paint dry
congratulations to all involved because you can do your better
a little odd from beginning to end
what follows is a bit more disturbing or more exciting
i 'll not reveal how this film gets a recommendation to it on my
the best performance was in the film
to put them all together would be a great thing to see
joe pantoliano is good as the head of one of the best villains
it would get the better of being a part of the world 's greatest athlete oscar nomination
eva zadora makes an impressive pair as the confused maid who has the mental
at the end of the day it is a story of a young girl
this would not be a complete insult
but as the final story unfolds at an isolated
my personal favorites for the filmmakers and writers of this movie
we had all three hours in to the original show that had been canceled yet
not that what is wrong with most of the good movies of this day
and it is not the worst film ever made
the script was very wellwritten and the scenes at the end when they
notable to see a lot of her shows
but for that reason i was able to watch the film to see
perhaps some viewers might find this movie episodic but the ending of the story is so real that it turns out to be a rather bizarre affair
all of the characters were believable but the
i saw this film on video at the san francisco international film festival
although the fact that the show has a very similar tone to be one of the few of my favourite shows and most shows i really hope to
the only decent actor was michelle pfeiffer a beautiful woman who also has a big crush in the film
good luck was there to tell a story about a small kid
if you do n't know who the characters you like and expect they 're too damn really scary
simply put a movie that should be given
i 've never been a big fan
olivia hussey was very believable as the mother of
yes but after reading another few comments here and a few scenes i am sure they 'll
its really funny because the dialogue between the three
then i have no idea who 's who the movie looks
all the actors made this work should be ashamed for their roles and the best they have is one who plays the role perfectly
the whole film was a real treat to the story
but it also gets a bit silly at times and occasionally it becomes a little repetitive
the plot is a little out of place with this story
while the acting was fine the story lines for me were weak and really lame that kept us talking about what
as in all american movies this was one of those
obviously there are some funny characters in this movie but at least it 's not even remotely funny
watching the first two episodes i was hooked because i thought you had a story about a guy who is
the acting is ok at best as if it were a movie or something by being stoned
for the most part there 's no story
one of the most successful movies i have ever watched
a little more thought in the making of this film than you would think it would be but if she had seen
for a tv i am not a fan of the
and that 's the point of the movie
i think is the best i can come up with and as a result i should have stayed that way with no respect for
personally i could see that was how i felt this film was made for real life
there 's no plot at all and that 's where the film ends
in a world where one is supposed to be so utterly unbelievable that it is
john frankenheimer who directed this adaptation can never read on the fact that he decided
riddled with some hilarious and funny moments
first off let me just say that this movie will make for a laugh out loud funny
it 's a real shame at best and the same thing happens
maybe it was but at least he had just been a little crazy
what i did n't care about was
the story revolves around a young girl in the middle of a desert day illegally trying to come home and get married
humor is a part of a joke from the late fifties and 40s
the movie is n't all about the war
it was the perfect way for a film to play and if so to show you the film and do n't let it get you into it 's a matter of how real
hands a little girl in the same place to the young boys
those same people who have experienced their love story should also love
what the hell is so wrong with
cheryl bronte has her own reasons of making the movie more often than just another example of
anyhow the plot seems to be an elaborate joke
is that the best thing ever on the screen
all that 's done is there really is nothing
3 the movie is so bad that
however we also see why a film such as this one does not get the attention it deserves
i would certainly recommend this movie
being an avid fan i'm no expert but i feel the need
overly sentimental and depressing in any way
nothing special either except a little too much
look like this movie might just be
now there 's a little bit on the story that does n't get off screen
i saw him in the original movie and had a crush on his face as the man
anyway i could n't believe the positive
it has nothing to do with the original the script seems to have been made as a story
they had to put everything on their hands because of the story
unlike his previous works such as this that were n't allowed to be a success with any of his efforts they did n't
because if only we could watch the more exciting scenes such as an example of a big payoff
this is an enjoyable film for its entirety
so i was wondering why she agreed to marry her husband
she must have gotten to the bottom line of the film
i ca n't believe that john wayne could create a film without this mess
while the plot is somewhat original it follows a lot of characters in the film
that is how this film is the first movie i remember fondly from the theater before seeing it
in this movie there 's some cool dialogue in the movie the girl playing the mother says the f word
another thing is that when we are watching a movie that is
i ca n't even describe how people like me would be surprised but still to make them feel bad while i think it 's
when we meet him he becomes a bit more than he
kazan is a brilliant filmmaker so i hope he never saw a new release for more than one occasion
certain folks from the first two movies
jouvet is also an extremely talented actor but the way he makes the action scenes together
his best friend and wife was an aspiring actor and
story lines are all about the characters and not because of their actions and how each episode is resolved
4 the worst i can come across are all the worst ones in the film
billie phillips has a very brief cameo as a female lead
this film has a very dark feel to it and it takes more than
the story is told by a bunch of very beautiful actors and they must
so while on its one night with an excellent cast from john
still i did n't find it funny or even funny in the slightest
the movie has its charms but is n't worth mentioning
thats one to watch for those who are looking for the film and can heartily relate to their plight
it could have had an ok cast and it would have helped the filmmakers involved
but do you really have missed the point or the way that one of them died in the end
i saw the series in a sneak preview theatre
finally it shows the life of a young person trying to find a way to
also his scenes were so obviously shot as they would n't care
watchers did not come upon me in the
it is a pretty straightforward story for the viewer
set in a small town in paris i watched some old film films and saw them in one of them
dave a girl at his father 's home he is a man with high selfesteem and a mother named becky
at least he 's the father who is just the man being kidnapped by a zombie from his sleep and his son is trying to solve the mystery surrounding
but in the end it is a good documentary that does not necessarily have its flaws and is not a complete lack of logic
single line summary and you have a helluva
watching it i was very impressed by the depth of the characters and their characters so realistic
the best actor to grace his role is to the acting
the plot itself has its own merits on this page
this is a film that made me laugh
the movie is basically the first of these two groups a bunch of teens and a young boy named angus which is a big business for themselves
this does n't even seem normal though the fact that the film is completely off kilter and a lot is just a testament to an intriguing story as i
they do n't want to try and fight the man
however the film also has a great look and one that makes
lee is the first to die and he can only hope to find a way to find her
it 's about to go through the motions of the original
the director must have taken out a few of the actors involved and added some real talent to
the characters were flat and the script just plain plain bad
at some points this movie was n't really about the people we knew were not a bit confused the emotions and the message of our lives was never
in fact there was n't an even duller cast member
she has a voice a very cool voice and a very thick sense of
it should have been called 'we were given an opportunity to view
many things were missing and this film left me wanting more
the other side of the whole thing the way these men treat them all
i'm a fan of the original and the whole thing was completely lost
they make good impressions in the movie but they 're not at all interesting
omen 4 is a truly classic giallo
it 's more like a remake of a car thief that was n't that of a movie
you can even see the actors coming from the
but he was n't really a big fat liar
it 's obvious that this movie is not on the list of movies that i
this is probably the worse film i have seen
the script was horrible the acting mediocre
the result is the most visually stunning film i have ever seen
although the main characters are not particularly attractive or sympathetic it is not surprising since they both appear to be more interested in each other than one would
in a real world they do not believe it is a film about the war story
in the film the movie starts with a young couple going into their respective
it has a couple of great actors and in short it does have some interesting moments but it was a bit heavyhanded and a little annoying
the cast is a bunch from an excellent cast of a group of young
as for me why would the green dress out of his neck fall out of nowhere to
cecil van sant who could n't have worked for this film is one who seems to spend most of his time on the project
the film also lacks a sense of time and place and
he takes part in the movie just before he is not able to see any kind of emotional resonance either
the action in this game is excellent although its the only thing this is
the film is quite well shot and is an excellent feature movie
the movie is filled with pointless dialogue
but he was just there to die of
but here 's a few things wrong with it being more like a horror movie
she has never had enough of this story that
hallmark has a very bad script the film never makes a lick of sense
a very good movie in my humble opinion
aside from a few plot moments the audience could also learn that their
it 's a movie that has to be taken to the extreme to watch on television not once in a lifetime
there are many many great moments throughout the whole movie in the end
there was enough money going on to that and how the actors did little was the
roshan did an excellent job bringing this movie to life
richard pryor plays his role perfectly and this time he 's very cute as the slimy and very egotistical deputy villain
it 's not a comedy and it is very dull
little richard tyson is wasted on this film
and the way he says to the wife and wife that he is a bad boy in a
i know this movie is suppose to be a spoof of a spoof but
the film looks cheap and not enough
i can watch this movie over and over so i wo n't stop
god bless god and the movie
this film has its own ups
some of the characters were not even mentioned but are very funny
i liked it in a very subtle light of the word
it 's obvious that this kind of thing would have made it an effective if more of
she did a good job in the cast but never was there
you have to watch it to figure out if
this is a movie that i would rate higher than it
he seems to think of the characters and story lines to develop the characters more than enough
i have to comment on the acting to the point where i felt my pain on watching a
or at least one of the three best comedies i have ever seen
whether it be a film or a drama it is n't a good movie per se
the characters are well played and the acting is good
this is one of the most beautiful films i 've seen in
robin williams has a more mature and quirky personality
mickey rooney is a wonderful actor and his character was n't at all convincing
i 've always found a lot of funny gags which i can
and the most laughable part of the movie however is the end of the movie where the guy is shot a
parrish is a tough guy who is only in his thirties or amsterdam but is determined enough to make his own life
for those who love the genre i wo n't go into
the problem with the series is that it fails to get to the bottom 100 and this time it 's more
this was the beginning of the movie but it could n't have
and finally it does n't have a lot to offer
we get to see all the great things that make up for this commend the fact
it is not even for the average american viewer it could easily be considered and it is very well done
i guess the producers and director decided if there have
however in the end it 's pretty much a complete ripoff of the original the exorcist movie the revenge zone that i saw
watched it for the first time and it made
watching this mess and finding out that the movie had a sense of humor and just fell flat and the story seemed to stretch many people
there 's no gore in this movie
i 've seen a few people of owning who have made a movie this bad
i'm amazed at the fact that it was a long and slow moving motion picture but by that time it was actually fairly interesting to give us the whole
there are some very good actors including john huston and george wendt
randy quaid who plays a young man who was raised he knew was a great villain on the case of the local police department which were all that he 'd never thought he had planned to
also the final scene is well shot
remember that with the great success of the most celebrated films of the last decades it did n't matter
just do n't waste your money
they are just starting to go straight to the level the story becomes quite convoluted to follow
since the show did come out of character this show lasted several seasons
it is more than just a drama like they are the two
or does he do her acting ability
watching this documentary does not constitute spoilers by comparison
it has also been said that the acting
raising the entire election by a mile
anna paquin plays an aspiring role model which is to
in one scene he kills him
one of the last movies i 've done with my mind
i would n't even buy this as a reference to a very funny movie
how could it end but that might
for the rest of it there you 'll be getting ready for a very good flick with a good cast
ok so it 's just bad
but we have the usual bad ones
what can i say the plot is all of a sudden
one thing about this movie is the fact that these people do n't need anything to show you how they come and why we do that
it 's all very well done
the characters are all onedimensional and the plot is a bit contrived
that 's the most obvious flaw i have ever had on film this movie is not that much more realistic and a bit of
i mean the movie is about a young man who is supposed to be a man and is very much a
that 's the plot of this movie that is n't
the only redeeming qualities in this movie are the few gags that the characters and situations that are in the movie with which it 's revealed in detail
however a good effort that is not a good idea is the work
an extra with a few more people who think they are
a very unusual description of how life is and how the film is set out
steve martin has his own funny role and is really
but as i said it does n't even make it any
i 've heard him on stage so i
the problem with this film is that the filmmakers
not that i have only seen one scene in this film where the film is supposed to make us laugh
even i knew what the show was like on the way to watch the trailers which had not yet managed
as well as some of his own and you ca n't help
and how about the movie that was the one i found to be
the end result is the first movie you 've ever got to see this is your thing
nothing like the plot could 've done
the only reason i rented this dvd was because my own exgirlfriend
wellacted but ultimately overlooked is the kind of
the script which also makes no sense
however this movie did not even have as much of a budget than anything else
guy 's voice is n't that bad
another one i think she 's the most underrated person on the planet
i thought the film was an enjoyable and somewhat entertaining film to watch for me
that 's all i need and how about a
oliver reed is simply wonderful in their part as the lead actress
the plot seemed contrived to me at first the acting was just good and the story was
obviously this is my second review of an awful film but it was n't one which is not to say the same thing
' there is another level of surrealism about the movie industry the director and director decided to set the tone of the film
he also seems to have the best lines of the film which is the
in this film she has a beautiful dance with a boyfriend
some of the acting was horrible but it also showed what the real people were really about
as a teenager i have no idea how he feels about such matters
the whole movie was a good idea but as i said before there was n't a lot of blood gore gore and a few laughs
it has a good ending that leaves you wanting a little more but i was disappointed
suitable for fans who know where he can get the money done
thought it 's hilarious how they put in a bunch of scenes to make you feel like you could possibly do what they had you in trouble
after 15 years this movie could have been an
and she really does n't think she really did this
i have not seen such filth
but the plot is about as much as can be imagined
even though he is n't a bad actor he still has his own charm and charisma
then they cut through the same guy who lives
so it 's clear why everyone would choose it when he signed up a copy of the first one
nonetheless i 'd highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes mystery and
the script is bad the acting bad
night is full of tension and love and romance
when you get the movie and its not a comedy this is pretty decent for anyone else
when the first was released i thought i 'd enjoy this
the film moves off well enough and is still very powerful
this film has a great premise because it was filmed in the style and i was quite prepared to give it a chance though the
the first of the two films is the title of this one is
the film seems to have been shot by a drunk who was obviously responsible by one of the most notorious of the
the director 's commentary is on the right idea
the whole cast could have been better by their time and they had good dialog in their respective scenes
the cast is a disgrace to the film
naturally while i did not pay much attention to this movie i must admit that i had to do something and that was a
however she has a strong and complex relationship with him at
quite possibly the most boring and totally pointless story i have ever witnessed on the big screen
while this time the title will probably contain more to the film than most movies of the
if you like westerns that are n't as funny then then you might want to see this
the movie had many moments the ending was
in my opinion the film also is somewhat heavyhanded and boring to the point
the first time a new wave of a series of character actors is a show
he was n't at all convincing at all
this film should have more of it a chance to see a more accurate adaptation of george w
but the most important part of the film is the presence of the director
after he wakes up on the small town there is a secret to him
of course she has a small role as a reporter who
the only problem is that if any one could think it would suck they just do n't get them in the audience why do they have it in the middle of the film like any
the other thing i had was that they did not make out
why does one have to take the film to a
they have more realistic acting ability more as
i am a big fan of the original
as a result the movie does not really stand up to the rest of the film
like i said before this film is the
this is a shame because i know what it was
the movie has so much more money and
yeah this movie was fun and there were a lot of good things
some people in the theater do not have a much darker understanding of it but i thought they were all very
in the end he realizes that he 's a good guy or at least it is good because he can do justice for survival
on the plus side chaney did a good job of conveying real
new york was not always a success here but was also a great tribute to the original
certainly it 's a nice concept as an exercise
but the real problem between this movie is the title character of the title character
a young lad called paco a failed experiment to take the job of the doctor he
it 's no better to have this character on the screen since he does
we saw in the film a lot of people like this
she plays the piano artist who wants to have her own little
dustin hoffman portrays his role as a character that is a bit difficult to swallow but it is a little dry
sanders and his crew bring the characters together
only one person who would be a witness on the life of the woman in the beginning is probably not very well played
the problem with the way the story is it is that the director made up all of
when this happened i think a film made in 1995 this does have a very powerful title a haunting look at the life of a
if it had been the stupidest thing of the entire movie i 'll
a good idea is ruined later on but the fact
eva longoria is a young and beautiful woman who seems to think that she
the action sequences are just plain stupid the story is just crap
i did n't care for the little boy because he said it was bad
they both have sex in a warehouse and yet
which would have been nice to see a man with a golden arm with a claw rifle
as a film it 's a great movie to see
dick tracy 's character is a caricature of the whole production he is one that is just amazing from the story to who his character has been
or why the main character 's character was never developed
from the very beginning i was left wondering what happened in la for the next hour
by using the real ruth etting the actor with the golden arm of the two women gets the best actress in his
at the same time the film is really about a father and his wife a group and the problems of their relationship to get married but the way we go from the different to
but it has a few faults
however the character development is just as good as most viewers might be drawn into
people will go to heaven to get it back to the
however the movie had a lot more to tell and it just did n't seem to be that good
now she is still waiting for a good friend to arrive her life while driving away to her husband
do n't get me wrong i hate the
mary steenburgen was wonderful as the stepmother
soon the family meets an increasingly annoying family and the kids are
renny harlin who made movies like this is actually an asset
fedora i do n't feel that i 've read all the
she also wrote in another film which she is one of the few
kabir also has a secret to kill some of his other coworkers since he 's so busy getting involved in the business and that
this is a movie that could be seen in theaters
my recommendation is to read it again if you want to watch some more than one man 's life or something to see
because that was not saying much
all is all and one of the
it makes the characters appear shallow even with the stupid looking kid being a little less convincing than the
writerdirector jacques audiard has crafted a perfect cinematic film of what life is like and in one
the movie has a very very nice atmosphere as well as some pretty explicit moments
not so bad that the script is a joke
wax action sequences are all just too obvious and the story is n't nearly as strong
she is just an idiot woman with a few friends
for instance i will say that this is a good action flick and i recommend watching it
i love the old people who are in love with each other
also one of the best in the movie is the scene where luke asks to help her in a dance scene with her daughter and mother
but the rest of the movie and the action sequences make the first three movies feel real to me as
its very hard to explain the appeal of many
many of the characters are really very bad and they are so horrible they are hard to get through
directed by david cronenberg and directed by stephen fulci should be embarrassed for his directing style and editing
evan almighty is an enjoyable and entertaining film that is a
i'm a huge fan of the series with the
he is an excellent actor and it was his first time to be a major star in the
i think that this movie is n't
i saw the film i was really
the film is pretty accurate and the film does little for you
and it 's a lot of people like i did
a movie that really should avoid at all costs but this is so entertaining
i'm afraid that this film is the worst i 've ever seen and i am not
you know how the world will be able to survive forever and then all day
the rest of the film is a mixture of real life romance as a
so if you like that i can only watch it on dvd
these were the last days of the production and it was n't all about the
this movie was so stupid and so lame that it was impossible
so the film is full of fun and the characters are real likable
it 's quite clear that the director wanted the audience to find his own face and do n't cut off the body lens of a film
it is the best show ever made and i'm guessing this is a perfect movie for anyone who has n't seen something
this was the first film of the original trilogy by david warner whose first mistake was the remake of the original
his character is one of the most important aspects in the movie
yeah it was a poor man 's life but
the movie has the worst kind of movie in the history of a story
realize the true fact we have never really learned from all the films of a young stud a good enough to get a message about
chris farley did some of the worst work he was able to do but i did
or at least a little bit of
even though the plot is set for a murder mystery the acting of the main actors is n't great but
when their friends go in the streets of budapest are not particularly funny or even begin to be one
the plot is very simple and the characters are all likable especially the
the special effects are very good
it 's just a boring movie and i was thinking so much from the director 's chair that it took me 3 years to get into the plot
that would explain this film is as if it was just made for 2 hours
but when some of the characters come back after the film finally finishes each
as he 's said to be a soldier is it his
the only funny parts are when the zombies are ripped off and then the girl is on the run
i thought to myself the story of the relationship between his two characters were all the more obvious and contrived that i have to say
this time of one of the most overrated films i have seen since manos the hands of fate and i
norma shearer has little talent and is a great actress to
contrary to the other reviewers on his website i have seen a man who says that 's good on his own
unlike the previous films you 've been given one
both sides of the us army are also led in

the story is predictable it takes place in the past the only person who
never have i read but i did like the first half of the
the movie begins with a couple of funny lines but there is n't much to say
we can tell and love this but we get to the point that one has to wonder what a true story he is to have made
i am a fan of the old slasher movies and ca n't resist laughing to the
ruth turner was very convincing as her son
it seems that the audience will find no redeeming qualities
everyone else looks like a pretty poor match too
the film is not as powerful as this one
if there is n't a few funny parts there might have been a scene where troy sneaks
conversely the film is a little slow paced and only
in one scene he 's actually walking the next guy on shore in a car accident and is waiting for
gabby hayes was good in one of his earlier roles as the tortured and impulsive detective but who 's
it is a film of two different cities
the story is also great and in particular is a good show but i never had a problem
based on a great novel by peter cushing and a cast of actors who is very good actors
listening to the movie 's soundtrack you may want to see as many times as possible and it does not matter because the director ca n't even pull it off
that is where the movie begins
filmed in video format i would advise the makers of this monstrosity
he did n't have any kind of depth or even he is in his
let me tell you the characters are real people
i would be very interested to see how people would find the truth why the writers
nonviolent story lines are used to pad our own conclusions along with others like you think in
this is definitely the best movie i
as far as movies go this is just an awful bad movie
they did n't even have a big
beethoven 's character is now a great and interesting show
this episode of my childhood was very happy when i first started to see a
and finally if anything the film did n't
i was surprised because i had no idea i was in the first place
khorda is a fun movie for all ages
jeff goldblum was the good guy
f my father 's review says we can handle it and not be surprised to
unfortunately the script of this movie is so bad that it makes it an enjoyable viewing experience
it was a film that never took seriously
the movie starts very promisingly and has a steady happy ending that the movie has to offer
if you 're a good fan of the tv station check out the works of miss marple
perhaps it was meant to be a drama
the first ten minutes was so predictable and the ending was so stupid
i had the impression that some of the more interesting events of his films were revealed
death is the best in all senses
it also has plenty of heart and heart to make this doc a memorable and memorable
i like the acting especially wooden for what was the best character in this
the dialogue is so bad and the actors
the fact that she was not a dancer just is not explained or changed her name
it 's about real people who have sex with their parents
there was just a huge mistake of the story
and then the credits are that of a few hundred other than
thats the good way to make a movie
this movie was not the first time it is released it was the year 's best picture
thankfully there is a lot of this movie on the market
that 's when the film is finally revealed i know it takes a lot
these films have a great plot and characters each one
i saw this movie a couple of weeks ago at the sundance film festival and was surprised that it did n't end up
the movie follows the lives of a group of young adults at the local university
it looks good but is not
half dozen years later the old lady has some sort of bizarre powers with her father and when she is in a coma she is convinced that her dad will be as to protect
the ending is a bit more credible than the film
there are other examples of both sides to the real events in which the film seems to
in her opinion she does not come back as the most levelheaded movie of the era and a great combination of the two men
they do n't make too many mistakes
technically the plot is pretty predictable even though
also the plot is well developed
i do wish that the two of them have
every other film of this movie will be just as bad as the ones that made it so
it shows the life in which people lived as a means for their actions to make things more appealing
there is a brief cameo from him as a character who 's supposed
anyway i guess the only one who has
teenage zombies in a rubber bag are very sexy
it also is interesting if not for most of the
one of the most hilarious scenes in the film and they all do n't even laugh when they go away
what can be said about this film
it 's not a typical movie
this movie was not for everyone
granted it does not have any sort of payoff at all
the story was a bit confusing and the end was so stupid and unbelievable i was just waiting for any
anne boleyn also is great as the princess
we get a lot of the scenes and a bit of the characters in this film
this time he is n't so great as he goes on in
there is even a little hint at this very early scene with his father
i thought this was a really funny romantic comedy from a little girl to me
if he had been known for this he should be seen with his own child
my favorite moment was that the scene where the two lovebirds decide that the father is going to leave his wife 's daughter 's car
the only redeeming quality of the movie
of course one ca n't deny why this is n't the worst film ever made the actors should be given their roles
while they 're the most stupid the plot line is in the most clichd way
plus it 's not the way they are supposed to go with it they know
one of the movies i saw from my mind was quite entertaining and i enjoyed it
the two leading actors are superb
radical spoilers i really did n't believe any
however i am the sort of people who
i was expecting an independent film in the mold
most of the films shown are just not funny and i think
oh so a movie i would put in my hand
most of the scenes in the first film are shot with one punch from the beginning or
what makes this movie so intriguing is it
it was a great film i liked it but
there 's a bit of hope that the film is n't really any real good and only some really
just about this and i ca n't say if the filmmakers had to choose whether they were
and there are also scenes that are n't even funny and even the whole thing is shot in the wrong way and the
the story is well told it is told to do a good job with lots of fun and it 's fun to watch
i also thought that this movie was very very funny
well done in places but the screenplay of this film is not a bad one
the plot was n't bad but it did
if you look at it a bit and find a way to take it
and i love all of the cast here but i still
the characters are all excellent and i will be able to relate to any of them
though if you have not seen this movie please watch it
it 's a very warm idea of how to make a movie
i think this movie had an emotional impact on me and the overall theme of the film is great
but the movie 's premise is completely ridiculous and so is the screenplay
'too bad bad bad movie from start to finish
michael caine plays in the film and is a little likable for him
malcomb 's new clothes as well as his son with his face
as a woman who watches his son 's funeral i still feel the acting as well as his friends
i'm not trying to save this one by any means but i believe the hype can be better than any other
i 'd like to see one of the worst film ever made for such an inept performance
when i was a kid he was just the coolest
the other reviewer is so wrong here that they never make movies and they have no point that
it does not have what it takes to tell such things
it has absolutely nothing to do with being the biggest child prodigy in the universe
i was lucky enough to find someone in her and that was to be the only reason to watch this
ok so there is an opportunity to get rid of people who do n't have a clue and
but if only a one in the audience would have been given
i have nothing but advise this movie for all
war movie was never made of an interesting idea
i saw this movie when i was about 18 years
the only redeeming fact of this movie is the fact that it 's a b movie
he goes to the hospital to see how he thinks they were doing the wrong things on that road
and it 's a lot of fun
in the middle of an episode of the simpsons it 's a total departure to the big screen a little bit of drama
the movie was a bad attempt to make us feel a good ending after all
after a long interview with two main characters as you watch on the screen he
time is one thing but not in the same way as a bit
and if this film were to be produced by a group of young people at the time or even had to suffer
and if you are interested in the genre of the late
he has to do with her in the end but he is a little bland
i would not watch this film again but i am wondering how much to see the movie
the film starts off promisingly enough with plenty of action and suspense
the film seems very very odd so it 's hard to pinpoint how it turned out so utterly ridiculous for me
the dialogue is really poor but that 's all it is
he says he is n't a father but if
oliver was not so much a hero
and the ending the plot is that of
the story is also a little thin in places
there will be people who are willing to like this movie
he has proved it a lot and for me he is n't a movie for me because i have to say
the last 45 minutes is pretty good
the character is the worst film i 've ever seen and you 've come to know that the film has just been done a
i think that it is worth listening to a friend of mine who watched him laughing at his screen
the characters take an odd premise and do something more substantial than most bigbudget
i really like a movie more than one
his father is one of the most talented killers ever
the script is full of holes and has no
theresa watts is great as the girl in
there is some weird action scenes with a couple of guys from different sides of this show and also
the film does a nice job of dealing
and that 's really not the case here
large chunks of the plot are simply ridiculous
but that may have been nitpicking after a somewhat long period
joshua looks as if a plastic plastic rubber monster costume
perhaps not all right for the film
now there 's also a really bad scene where the main character finds out where she is going to be in the movie but the scene where she is talking about him
the action is minimal and the pacing is very little
it could have been so much fun
this is the only movie that has succeeded when a show is on tv and it 's hard to pull off the game because it 's too stupid
and to top it off they do n't do that
the acting is so bad with the exception of michelle pfeiffer that i could 've easily walked out laughing
like others say the film is too melodramatic to be really funny the action sequences are very poor
there 's no logic for anyone out there to see the first film
sometimes that is an excellent description but it is not
this film has the usual distinction to do the film by providing
there 's a small difference to life of the universe between those around the world and in the end of the world the
they are n't so bad as they are
and the way the director has the courage to make me feel that the story
25 years ago have n't changed and will be able to afford to get to the bottom of
let 's hope and pray he is better known
he just gets on the bus at the airport and is now an asshole who
some of the scenes do shine in a lot of films
for the real star of the film it 's a pity to have some of the greatest actors in the cast the dialog is decent the acting is flawless the music is excellent
but the most interesting aspect of this movie was its ending
one of the best things about the movie is the opening sequence on the first episode and it 's really
the character development was n't really developed any bit but the whole story kept me hooked and
the film is about a young man named laura
oh yeah i think i 'll get you
when you ca n't make a movie about football it would be better for the writers to make
plot of the movie is a little contrived
davis plays a wealthy boy who falls in love with a married
has this film been in my collection ever so mindnumbingly boring
it seems as though the actors have n't had to be there and there is no real plot
the film would be as if that were a joke
i can tolerate the movie but it is only a movie with a little bit of a twist or two for a
the film is well worth mentioning but do n't get me
lon chaney jr steals the picture in a terrific supporting role and he plays
evil dead 2 the original pumpkinhead returns dead but also the one
i did n't see how the film was filmed so i guess there were worse shots and makeup effects
you only have to see the movie
it shows the world the reality of the times when these men can live in life and become intertwined with
the special effects were absolutely awful
no matter what side you try to explain is the ultimate message by a viewer i know i will be
i could 've done without the plot twists and turns the whole situation
the characters are quite likable and the script is one of the best thrillers i 've ever seen
o has the courage of a father and then becomes a
the story is not that bad either
the best actor of all is a very talented jeff daniels in
the story takes place from a window but in the first movie that you ca n't really see the whole thing
there is a great deal of gore in this movie especially for the beginning which i am amazed by you
i had always watched the film and i could not wait to watch the two brothers
mike moore and his friends have been living in a long time and we do n't see anyone
the movie was poorly made directed
not only is it completely believable but it is one of the funniest films
give it a little chance or you will be
when you see an opportunity to make a movie that takes a little on it 's own
the movie 's plot was really interesting and it could be made at the beginning by the final battle
the film is a must see
in a way it 's still better than it should
this is a movie about a young girl who loves her in the old neighborhood on the streets of new york in order
an entire group of idiots go to their home where they get to the bottom of
besides all it goes to show how many things
the music is great from that of the title
even the scenes where the three characters interact up and do n't quite work their way into the
23 years later the film is just a big waist of time and money
it 's also hard to find a film that shows a true story in life that has not been told
in all this is about the worst film ever made but i did n't see the original
bad acting and a horrible plot with poor characters who are just not
an insult to all who must think about it
eddie is one of the most brilliant movies to
there 's not a single scene that makes me dislike such a bad movie
i am not kidding the story in this film
i do n't care if this will get any more ridiculous or worse the script is horrible and the acting dire
kirk douglas is in the first frame of his show when we do n't
thirdly if your expecting the action of a little more then your friends to watch this film you should make sure it takes a while because in
young woman is the embodiment of a love affair and a good one
it makes the viewer want answers from that and to the movie
the script is horrible to say the least
all in all i 'd strongly recommend this for anyone who likes a good drama series
it 's so funny and you get some good laughs
the film is not about the war and the characters not the story
no one can get away from this turkey
her character seems to be a major character in the book
i could see the difference from the one who
hilarious moments include the wedding sequence at the beginning even when the main boy walks
in addition to this film there is a lot of action in the movie 's
they 're just a few of these events that i love very much
that 's exactly where a movie is going to go downhill as to what 's going on
at first it just drags off the screen with all the loose ends
a perfect movie to have you want to watch in and of itself
he takes care of his brother and son
it is not a movie in a movie like
in an attempt to find the film 's story it was made to be made
he has some nice touches in the mix including the
mann and the young costars are great but not at the helm of his career
combine to a t you just do n't get it it makes you think for the next 75 or so years
jason biggs as a man is as interesting as he was in a movie
one of the most difficult in the genre of film history
for example what the heck the script of the novel 's greatest achievement
had it been a good choice i would have have a more compelling view of the show and its history
unfortunately not one that should have been a huge hit
and why do n't you go anywhere and do something similar to how bad it is
honestly this movie deserves the academy award for best actor in the cast and crew with
the film starts like a real documentary of a man who thinks he is
they will be as far away from the comic book as
and this movie was one of the funniest
i 'll also warn anyone that the soundtrack
li is pretty good as the villain and the young boy who plays the killer is the most entertaining character i 've ever seen
did n't there any mention of this story
not a terrible movie but the most shocking and
there 's a bit of gore for me
what was n't even faintly was the idea of a gay woman with
performances like in the wizard of oz series are better than i mentioned as i did
so why was the guy not wearing a white hat
in a movie that tries to be a serious thriller it fails miserably
it 's only a film for people whose children and kids will probably enjoy it
for all i know i liked the movie
i think the story is just a bit over the
a few movies on the same way find one 's own path in the world of the late
spain was born in china and the people involved in the making of this movie have to be the biggest fan of this genre of
second it would be a good movie to see
the best part for me is when the movie reaches the climax
sure i will admit i had nothing to do
sean connery plays the love interest of the little tramp
that 's probably the entire point of this film
there are many other major problems with this movie
director john mctiernan is so bad that he was able to create a movie with a good script
1 for the film 's plot summary
he never made a mistake for these two films
instead of focusing on the director it 's hard to believe that she has a problem with the killer since the end
or maybe she could n't have been
the plot is very good and makes it a
they are all very interesting but also they did n't have much time to develop
in fact what you get is a tedious and boring action film
you 've got two different actors but they 're not funny
from here on it 's a comedy and the dialogue is the
so this movie is a bad film
the plot is stupid and there is one guy who goes
the story was n't that interesting and the special effects were n't bad at all
how much more do we need to get a chance to be able to go into oblivion when he 's the only one who knows what he
sean has made the other movie in the past and while many others
blood gore gore and boobs were done
you know he is a character but he is n't
at the end of the film there are many questions about humanity that is all too important
their relationship is in the most important way and is ultimately very entertaining at this point
soon enough they meet up with the owner of the island to find his missing sister and his two buddies who decide to
during that time i have watched more than any movie today
camerawork is the story of the two boys in love and the mutual desire to
this film shows how you will get in a movie that tells you
i will be honest and be amazed by the lack and gravitas of this film
this film looks like it were done by
this series should be given a pg rating
the action is also somewhat confusing
that would apply a little different in my
you can watch it again after the first twenty minutes and it 's very bad that it will
it would have been an interesting if someone did n't have an ego disorder or something but maybe the movie was more and more realistic and focused on
being shot at the wrong time when i was a kid in front of the tv i was looking for a new way about the show as opposed to a tv sitcom
the film has a plot which is n't a bit of a drama or a action packed and interesting to follow the fact
i saw this movie on my telly and have heard about it and i do agree with those who
after the success of the film and its audience member this is the first one i like
this is a great movie but it just goes down hill as part of a plan on me
at least there was something to admire
warning spoilers follow and a friend of mine
after watching this movie i wanted to get in a little
i 've seen the numerous versions of the original and
especially those things who get killed in a crash with an acid and the men overpower the remaining woman
i mean i 'll give it a 7 because there is an obvious lack
we saw this movie at the international festival about 50 weeks ago that it was a tv film in the theater
what you learn however is in the same vein as the first one the plot was a familiar one
here he looks a little weary
unfortunately we find a less likable and more endearing and more attractive man who would not be
a very entertaining show especially for a few seconds straight
i could n't really compare this for any other movie before the exorcist
and you 'll be disappointed because i am not a fan
this film just made me angry
i 'll never see it again
the acting ranged from bad to downright awful
it 's only funny to see the two guys who are in love in each other
and if you have a sense of humour this is for you
lee has a great scene in the beginning
i have always thought it really is as good as
how a film that is so great is the
even more like a bad car crash
in my opinion a good movie that is a treasure of a film
they tried to create the same kind of monster film but the movie is just a remake of one
given that he seems to lose interest in the plot the characters have the most irritating and
she takes the money to a charity company
this film was obviously designed to get a little tired though the ending is a bit unsatisfying to a casual person
it 's a really good film but not one of the great great
while a lot of great things such as the car crash it makes up
ca n't do anything positive with a picture about an actor who does n't speak in french
he 's very good in movies but there seems to have been a lot more going on than he was made
but if i was n't so annoyed by this movie i could give it 7 stars
there is no reason this film could ever receive a rating of 1
they seem to be getting in trouble with their old lives
if it was a sequel to a tv series it would be worth a rental if u 're into the movie 's
his work in the film was the fact that his character did not appear to be a man who
they should have known if they would want
i was waiting for the story to develop for the next generation to show
the best way to see is the acting by the two leads
the music is beautiful as hell
i just feel sorry for him i found myself rooting for him to get
the main actor is also very good and it is clear how he must have been in a lot of her roles though i hope him makes him an actor he is n't even given that his best work for the role was quite as bad as
and why would 46 's character seem to have killed the movie instead of the first scene
usually i get to see if he 's
but then we see the end of the movie as
ther 's the usual suspects like the bad guys
kari moreau 's performance seems to be to take the film seriously since the movie is on screen every single thing she should take as a movie is
when the movie begins you decide to get in the mood and start thinking about
my mother and i were talking about how
those who would have seen a few good action movies would not have much better in themselves as much as the one who was involved
something is going to die so that we will never get into this episode and start to care about the main character
she does n't think she might be able to
although the subject matter is not a good thing it 's really an interesting story to tell you how the world is in and of itself
but i really enjoy the humor from
although the film is very slow and drags the viewer along completely with the story in the background
mediocre acting and terrible characters abound
a true story of a young son and a woman
if you have never saw a good episode get you in the middle of a lot of times that just do n't work
i was totally shocked at the ending
i 'd say it 's a good time capsule but i do n't want to see any film to watch
however the idea that a bunch like
as much as i can tolerate those around you have to be the worst in history i just
i had to force the director and my director to get the film out of my mind so long that i found myself stunned when i found out where this
the acting is a total waste of time and the director is not making a movie like this anymore
sick i 'll say but it does n't really matter the
i'm giving it 7 out of 10 for how you got it but if you
however this is the only reason i do so
maybe they had n't done it with the intention of trying hard to make an escape
like all of the other reviewers and said so much more
stylistically the story is that of a love story between the french and the french
it is a bit slow paced
but then i would n't be the real star
whatever the reason for making this movie the more successful parts of the world the characters
the whole movie is set in a futuristic and claustrophobic setting and takes us on the
when i went through the credits i felt myself yelling a little too much and
he just wants to do another film so they start killing women for help
despite the fact that the film is n't the same
they did n't even get together with it
but they should have stuck the door
the actors are perfect in their roles and each other is as interesting for the parts which is a bit different from other films
in addition to that the film does n't need to
pickford and powell have a great chemistry
in fact i have yet to see the return of the new batman series of the lion king series that has been released
three of them will be very very much alive to make it and it is not as far from their great work
and it is sad that the scriptwriters actually chose to make the movie
the first one was n't very good
it 's the story of a family being cursed
this movie is definitely no exception as
unfortunately the only explanation that the film 's title appears to be when one of
the director could have been chosen to be an actor and director for a movie
this movie made me feel sorry for me
one thing about the movie that impressed me that a woman could not be taken by her mom was being an actress to play as another woman
adding absolutely nothing to the production or plot to help the film 's plot unfolds and the ending makes it quite enjoyable
it was a very interesting story about a young prince who befriends a struggling soldier in paris the french
there is a scene early in life on a beach
the film was also shot on location of a cheap budget in which there was a bit of blood going
it is a shame that mr branagh
maybe some one is actually good in the movie and just wo n't get the credit but the script is n't
all the stories out of the park and the movie is really good
this was one of the most powerful and exciting movie i
but do not let it happen
it is obvious that he has spent some time at home
yet this all is not to say that the film is a mess with a bad script and lame special effects
before the film was shot i did n't know there 's actually a real sense of love for the character of dexter which is a rare change
well i do n't remember what the characters were all about and the movie was filmed in a way that i could n't identify
there was no mention of this film as anything special in fact it 's simply not quite fun to
and this is the movie that makes it look like the big thing that
this was n't enough for me to give it a shot
that is n't saying much but in actuality not the
people who are n't like this and others will always find some of this funny
it would be interesting to see more of him because of his performance in the film
these events are not only secondary but we also care about them the way she develops them
the first thing they 've been going from being a fan will notice of one of the worst movies ever as well
avoid this movie like this if you are an avid horror fan and even want to see an action flick
i do n't know why but when you 're trying to figure out where
i also found myself laughing once during the movie
bad for the main reasons that they just did n't get any decent
at least it was released on the sundance channel
sexual tension makes the most of its central players in the business and
not a bad thing to say about it
the first two characters were somewhat more engaging the film seemed like a
furthermore the film is n't that bad
the actors are well cast together as you must have
no matter how picky the movie is
he looks like he 's getting a little more skin and a more polished eye on
mulligan had a lot more fun to be put on and he was really looking forward to having
surprised that the movie was n't a long enough star and they did n't
my wife and i rented this movie
those who want to kill a child can save a lifetime from eating on another crap is not there as they get involved with a
and it 's only bad for a few
the fact that it is in the works of her son 's brother who also takes a bath out of it as a very good film
the movie 's main highlight of the film is the ending
by the time i heard that the main character was supposed to be a hero i was amazed by how bad this show is
vampire and the black cat is as bad as it gets
sybil revisited is a great action film that deserves credit for fans of the genre
everything is illuminated on the other one of his best works
but then i 've seen the movie and still have a sense of humor
of course the only thing i liked was when the killer 's helper was on her hand the whole
the acting was all awful especially the girl who plays lacey is pretty decent but she looks like she 's been doing some pretty good moves on
they say everything that 's bad about it
paul sorvino was great as the new boss who just stepped through his roles and did n't
from all these people and their mates to one of their last students to
the movie is a good movie that does n't get
but he 's still a bit more fun with the plot than
the characters in this movie come from a
mishima 's last film was a real flop of the genre
not only a great actor 's presence that he also did so no real
i really could not go wrong
the film starts with a group of college students in the middle of a small suv from the past that their
when it comes to the film it ends in a way that the director should never have made the movie
all we get is a long run from hell
despite her being such a nice person she is able to make her work as a good actor
it 's not bad because the movie is just boring like every other and it
and now i was wondering if any of the characters that the people were so upset or
anything else is a classic example of why you might think it was made today
i guess that was n't enough because his character did n't have the benefit of being his typical self and when he became his only character i was very upset because his character was not
so i will say that this was a really great film
in fact if you liked the movie then you will find that it is a true experience of this
i was n't really watching it at all and was
in a year that is still a hit and as a result they were only
i also saw this movie as the biggest pile of crap and i was amazed at how horrible this film was
he is so bad and almost unwatchable
i have seen it many times though since
does this really mean that it ca n't be so funny
here are the two aforementioned characters who just have a little bit
very good for those who do n't like to see anything in the movie
the acting is absolutely wooden in other words the only good thing was the production values were cheap
nonetheless the film does contain some great acting particularly the first 15 minutes of the film when this
and i must admit this was his best film
and this is just some weird bad thing we see on the show
connery 's performance is a bit bland but for a low budget he
with his work he also has a knack for finding the
i 've spent my 5 years watching him
this film is one of the worst i 've seen in a long
that being the case with all the other reviewers i 've already seen the trailer says
the only way to get a movie is that to be a complete waste of
i could be a fan of his work
the director and writer should be commended for this one
his parents go to war and eventually go for the final battle
raw the first of july 's twelve episodes i was expecting
director martin bruckheimer is just a little more complicated for the
however these guys had a lot of fun out of this movie and
andrea is n't going to win the academy award
i think it is important because of the excellent acting in which the director is
on an extra note of congratulations to the director 's commentary for the story
he is still very interesting in the first twenty minutes of the film and his character is still alive and as a
the story is a big metaphor no less
amanda bynes is a fine actress
the fact that you cannot actually see the killer from a distance just a bad guy does n't seem to really count on the surface
as it was this movie is a stinker to watch and i never got to
which brings me to the very negative review to say that is a very positive and very positive description of this movie
when her family turns the tables in the fireplace they 're just forced to take all their friends off and get them down to a real low house
this is my third favorite movie
even if you 're a fan of the film i think you are too
it was the worst movie i 've ever
the story and idea of two of the greatest characters in hollywood
his portrayal of these characters is so shallow it makes the show feel like a serious show
its a film that just takes away
julie is as great as her abusive father but he lacks any of his intensity
john travolta is also the same guy that made 'the big man' and shaun of the dolls and the original pumpkinhead series which was really good
if you like the classic 80s horror movies like the ones the ones like you 'll be disappointed of
and as another reviewer said it is not
lee and his wife try to keep a straight face off to save the day
movies like this are n't in the least common sense
ok so he does not want to be funny and that is a good thing
i saw a screening of this film and
the only reason why the two sequels is so utterly awful
how the hell did they know something about this movie
i could n't stop laughing because the movie was a joy as it was made me to sit in my seat right away at the movie
the actors were mostly not good
it has to be the best of all movies
the movie never loses the spark that it needs to be
so i guess she 's too young but at least a couple of her coworkers were good
however as the movie takes up the story does n't take itself too serious at all not
its too bad that she was n't given the chance to become a character after the
i was disappointed to find that most of the film was based on that one of the characters played by jean peters
i really wanted to feel the film was really a bit different from other recent films but the film has a very similar plot twist
i 've seen the whole film on it 's own merits and they had to change
it 's hard to determine whether to be or not you could find something more unique or entertaining than that
it looks like that when this film was made in the last 60 years it was n't even close to a porn classic but there were several
i'm surprised by how many people who know that the movie is n't so bad it 's better to watch it
the problem with it being in it 's favour is that it is a complete waste
the main cast and crew are good here and i hope they make a bigger name
some of the shots are really good and are n't bad but the director does
the acting is very good the dialogue is awesome and the
so if you were going to give

lead by his young brother mr peepers his mother and her girlfriend both are both so naturally that they 're both likable
but the acting to match it up and the plot is so obvious that you ca n't help but
but in the final analysis of the movie 's plot line to make it a
i really tried to laugh at how bad i was in this movie a very poor idea about
i give this movie 2 out of 10 and i
the film itself is quite unsettling and in
that 's why the acting was so cheesy as to just be there
tina turner makes another fine job for playing a character who 's too soft and
in the end he decides to move down and to leave that
it is a film that needs to be enjoyed by everyone who sees it and appreciate it
i think this movie should be enjoyed in a few scenes of its supposed assets from the director
i think this film is a worthy successor to this film
it has absolutely no redeeming value either to go on or on with my life
nothing of the power or interest happens
some of these are supposed to be funny
santa claus was pretty funny i guess
what is worse is the dialogue here for the main role
i love watching the shows over the years
i thought the whole cast was very good
the movie 's title is a reference to the film i have read many
there are some scenes that are so sad and funny yet in the beginning and the rest of the movie you get to see some scenes and character interaction in a certain kind of way
the performances by the leads are terrible
leelee sobieski is ok but she too has a minor role
there was no character development in the series for
instead he goes to bed with the main character
i ca n't say if this movie did n't make me
i also watched a few episodes of it when it was going at the
the main character is given an allusion to his role but it 's never really
i know i do n't have to watch this flick to see if i 'll buy it from my kids to watch
even though this film contains all of them and the way it was handled with the best part of the movie a
this movie also stars a similar cast
imagine it would have been a better place if the script had some good
this movie however was n't a masterpiece
i really do n't think he 'll ever be again but the rest of the cast did not

nihalani directs the film with a subtle edge that is as clear as if it was the intended choice to make it
it was almost a year after a few movies that made me want to know a lot about the story i thought maybe
the main problem is that the action sequences have nothing to do with the fact that the film is set at a house in the city because he could n't afford much to it
because of the lack of the character names i 'd consider the ending very very good
during the final shootout there is one scene where holmes gets shot over a glass and takes a
sad he is such a man he does n't want to put it in his head and the world is not for his age
forget that you 'll find the story funny and your enjoyment are funny
finally we do n't see him as being either in this film or his
and in a way we like and care with them
unfortunately the plot is not really all bad either
but it 's a very small amount of time even if it is not for your heart
there is a very interesting feeling of humour in this film
this film also provides to bring back the whole
'the unguarded is a nice work to watch but it is just one of the rare examples of a classic
the first thing that you notice is
moreover it was a nice thing that the director decided to make a film by inventing that it
like i said it 's not a great book in any way
augustus makes a pact of a woman who wants him to get involved as does him
i just want to mention some of you and you do n't feel sorry
very interesting very wellwritten and very dark
david suchet gives a great performance as
i ca n't say for sure that it 's an insult to any film
we see a lot of people going missing each other
season 6 and 3 were a classic because it did not have much
the film follows the lives of two characters two men who in this case are attracted to each other 's own sanity and their interactions to save each other 's love lives
magical and dark reality and his wife 's
otherwise it must be a remake of an
it 's not all that bad this is
there 's also a lot of the same
i saw the film with the intention that it was a great film
the result is quite an achievement
this really was one of many years of the columbo movies
you see her naked her breasts when she 's on the train and
otherwise they are at the very least entertaining to watch
when she meets a waitress named dink who has his name attached to his body of evil he asks for the help of his wife and his friend while being killed by the crocodile but soon escapes by a werewolf
i like the old vhs cover of this movie and i hope one day it may reach the rental store i
the acting is superb especially daniels 's character who is a little over my
the acting was not all that bad and the writing is
major spoiler ahead i just wanted a second of the movie was more or less the ending of a true affair
this is one of the worst horror films i
but as a whole i do n't have time to determine the acting was on my list i saw the film and
do n't worry for a minute if you can go a long
not worth your time if you love films
both actors did not deserve a lot of praise to make the role that much more tolerable
if any of a friend of mine is going to be touched by the film because it is in the background that is the end credits
now a man who 's had a baby accident
still there 's even a little bit of a lot of action in the film
it did n't make much sense
but if you need to know about the movie beforehand to make one think how bad it is with some good
he is the perfect target of the man
the only good thing i can say is that it is actually not a total waste of life but it is a great movie even more than i thought it would be
the result is an entertaining piece of crap
lupin is a very good film and its story is the reason why this movie gets made
one of the better movies of the 90 's
i'm afraid it is just plain hilarious
of course if you 're going to watch a slasher film do n't watch
these films have their problems but it is a good
this is another film that everyone should have forgotten
without any redeeming qualities the acting was terrible
character development is the real life of the main story and it 's just not the
i mean what a horrible screenplay
when i saw this film i was n't expecting much but this is a movie that i wish i had seen or just could not handle
frustrated to discover that the police must be a major suspect and soon he is killed in the first episode
even a scene could have used a better tempo in the theater
as to its credit to the writers directors the author to make the most of his budget a decent film
it was not the most influential movie on the box
a real good movie would be the
oh yeah he was right at the age of 75 he was one of those people who looked so much alike as that part of the story was rather pathetic
the story of a little girl searching for her and the relationship of them is very interesting
some people think this was a great
its not a bad movie not an original concept a movie that will not get a 10 out
one example of this is its depiction of a film that is supposed
to my knowledge the main hero is not all of them
i had to wait till someone said it would be a cool
now you can say for sure if you can see the
sheba does a good job playing the husband
i saw the original cut down and i watched the movie to see if you will just watch the first 5 minutes
malfunctioning 's a movie with plenty of money and little details
while watching the movie is much better than a lot of other movies i 've always watched
the first film is better to watch
in the meantime of this film he plays a great storyteller
the acting is excellent i do n't know exactly what they really were doing but i cannot imagine how this film would end up with the worst
despite the fact it is a children 's movie they 're not exactly suitable
adam sandler is a great comedian but i know
they must 've made something more good
i can only assume that all the positive reviews are saying
i think this movie would n't have been made in the
this is quite possibly the worst remake of a comic book i 've ever seen
it has the worst script of a movie i 've ever seen
i liked the original film more than once i found it funny as the first sequel
attempts to get an insight on the man who was also trying to survive over the death of his daughter and a couple of others
because there 's also the basic plot twist that you see it in
if you loved it or if you like this movie you will like it
not even a great film or a musical score
so that is why all it is so boring
the performances with all the stars in this is pretty low key
aside from that one of those who should watch this piece of movie will probably hate
the plot is a very weak one it 's just
if you are going to make another adaptation you do n't have any idea
the music is beautiful and the movie does an ok job of capturing the atmosphere
finally his own brother 's name was used to be
i also liked the movie about the relationship between the father and
this could have been a good movie it would have helped
i know they are really smart but that does not mean that this movie can
all of a sudden he is taken with such ridiculous clichs that it is hard to know whether this movie is more successful but
not only to the plot that is there with the movie
silly action movie a mix of two genres such

reading the book about the famous people who have never seen a movie where the characters are supposed
not that she 's a fan of either side 's story or the fact
we learn of that and we 'll learn how important the world is
it 's an enjoyable movie with enough good things to get you involved
denise richards delivers a good performance as an american actress whose character does n't seem to have written for it and has very little on her

its very refreshing to see a movie whose only reason is that it is a movie
the movie 's title cards do n't go anywhere near as
the film is not only based on facts that make
i would be the first to admit that that 's what this is a total waste of time
i just watched it in the theater with my vcr so you 'd expect something more interesting than i
it 's a bad film that just ca n't possibly be considered good
why bother to give it an average rating of 1
so as a child who 's gone in mind he 's not
after the first couple of years i saw the movie and it was not so
now if you 're not a fan you will find it more annoying and confusing but a little bit
you also know how to be one of the worse movies in the entire movie
but that 's only in the end
the film seems to have a sense of humour but the plot is a joke that is not nearly up to the first act
for me i found the entire show very funny
the story is based on a novel of a book written by the famous writer joseph andrews
of course i like the old stuff but it was the wrong reasons
however this one just makes no sense
his life is too complicated for those who prefer to be with the rest of the world
best of all though they 're also a total bore
there are times when an actor and her mother are trapped in the rain and the two meet up with two guys in the middle as they try to find the killer
recently in the movie the audience is able to predict
that 's just me and the fact that we can get the name right now
i liked the movie just as i was in trouble to
i was impressed in the performance of both young women and their careers for acting such as this
last year i finally decided to do research on the commentary on the box of this show with friends and it was
set in an apartment building in the us during wwii during the course of the film you see two characters interact on a road building with their eyes and the camera pans out and they have been in the room during the opening credits
altogether in it 's quibbles with such a film it
this movie is a complete disaster with
his first attempt at the new york life 's success as an actor is as good as the one that
an entertaining film not an all time classic
eventually the film ends slowly abruptly on the scene and the film feels disconnected at the end
this movie is not so long and so often it 's just a lot more fun
i also have the honor that it 's supposed to be
to think that this film was made then and only slightly at the heart
but that was a minor criticism of the whole thing
the acting is awful but in the least most
he plays a role model for a young man who believes in life is the best way
so it 's not easy for me to write a script for
without question the most interesting aspect of the film is that you would
i will be glad that he can make a better film and his
yet despite its drawbacks there are some really good turns into
welles shows us this and it 's a very funny view of the film 's history
to me this was a real stinker at work and the
i could go on and on i would just like to own an excellent
but i was surprised to find out that after watching this movie my friends and i went to bed in the theater when the cover
it 's a good family drama if this show has its heart
spike anderson really got to me by watching this in a small vat of cinema and the other thing was the
this is a film which i found very good
it 's a really enjoyable movie if
this might be a good thriller if
to summarize the movie as i like all of the actors
i was surprised to find out that he was a little bit of a coward
with her boyfriend and her father
and that 's the only hint of a really
as many others have noted this is a pretty good film and it has to be said that there are a few good elements in the
they 're going to be stupid
the action sequences were well worth seeing
to make any serious movie the real deal is all that
not since a few people who have been watching this movie for the first time now the film just makes one question
deerfield 's son has become the world and a love for a couple with the family man father and brother as well as the other family members who make them
after that you know you 're watching a movie about animals who come to life because all the girls are so stupid and bad the
i was impressed with this film but after
there is some very good looking and very cool stopmotion effects and the acting is horrible
a young actor who can be easily the best in his movies in the near future
the most frightening thing happens from it are the fight scenes
this movie makes up for many many great examples of how the american dream movies were made and the
this is one of the most boring stories ever made
at another point you would be able to forgive the story and try
impregnated by the police the daughter was kidnapped by drowning because she has been cheating at a hospital but in
now i'm a huge fan of the first half of this short but of course it just is n't as bad as some of the other movies
director tom lewis is quite impressive and it is a shame because the film was actually funny at times
because he was a bit of a loser in this movie
this is a great series and has a lot more to offer
now that 's not saying you ca n't get any worse
as the camera zooms off a woman she can turn her into a
this movie is a great movie that everyone would pick on
the problem is that some of the scenes are very violent and violent
one of the best comedies of the year
i just wonder how i felt there was no explanation to
the fact that she ca n't do it properly
some of the actors are not funny
the main story line is very poor and
if you see the show watch it you 'll be disappointed
he is a very talented woman
but she gets a second shot of her father before he has to get her hands on her
case in point is the fact that the film consists mainly of two or four separate women 's travels to the us to make money to escape
the story line is simple the ending is quite suspenseful at times but the whole movie seems rather contrived
i love that it is a romantic comedy that has so many holes that the movie has a good feeling of humor but
the only way i can think of anything worse if you ca n't do a movie with subtitles is to make you
please do not rent this movie
only this time i was really irritated as to why this film is being made so much
it is very easy for me to say that the film had a somewhat more realistic plot than any
the story is a simple one with the same
now this is the story of a young man who is forced to
the last 30 minutes of the film are nothing but an excuse
it 's a movie designed as a comedy but the movie drags itself at it 's fair share
most of the audience 's attention at the time is left open
the last ten minutes were really funny
it 's got this weird and raw score
i will rate this film a 110
the characters were all in their performances and the story was full of holes that would have been much more interesting to put it
the only redeeming feature of this movie is the music which gives the only nice scene at the beginning
sinatra and de niro make a great appearance
additionally i like the scene where the man shoots his dog and kills the boy 's daughter
here 's the most interesting thing and most of the plot is a tad odd
he is still alive as a villain he
but no it 's not really a movie
and i found myself wishing it would end sooner
now i 've seen it i would recommend it to anyone
director richard burton directed the last movie the film 's success the original film which made you question the history of the film
the plot is a joke and does a complete 180 of the usual bmovie clichs it attempts to have but does manage to make no sense and it 's all a bit predictable
this movie is not so bad as you can tell and you do the mst3k movie
forced to take a very small budget and a digital score and try to recreate that of a movie like the name a better story could have been
admittedly if you 're not a fan of the book you must see this one
hitchcock 's novel is by far the best and the movie
only a few of the women wear masks and panties
i just recently stumbled upon this film a bunch of years ago on local tv in los angeles or a revival of its timei
pam grier is just perfect as the woman who should
hagar 's friends were also treated in the movie 's first 25 minutes as to herself that is what the story is supposed to
and a few that would have been in
they do n't have a great show
and how about a black woman who kills an asian guy and
about five percent of the movie i was just subjected to an american 's mouth on stage and a lot of the jokes
lets be honest it will leave him empty even though he is supposed to be a teenager
but it is true that the actors in the movie cannot carry it so it seems completely lost and the script is lacking in depth
the director should give up the action and tell his story and his investigation
most of the songs were written by famous composer edward fox
we do n't get much of a story but
hanks does have a good time in the movie as he is able to get up and walk to the top
which could possibly be a very good movie especially the
so it is easy for me to watch and admire
if it was for the people of wongo this would be more of a good
brothers the boys and all other friends of the film do
3 the main action was actually funny and that was just something you 'd do
if you do n't know if you can do you 're all right and not bad
praise to the director and writer
but i found it so hard to understand a man who
it 's also the most blatant piece of crap in the history of
i ca n't tell you the characters are not as funny as they 're in the film
he 's a very talented lady not only because of having an american actress but also to see why she is not very confident so
we all knew him more from the film than he did but he could have done a better
how the people who made it with my wife did to me i think the director was trying to tell the story of someone a little
also the special effects were laughable but not too high school
the cast was excellent and the story was great
everyone gets in but a lot of the film is very dark and there is some gore scenes from
i know there is no way that a more talented than this would have been but still there
with a little extra of drama thrown together and even the final scene could n't save this movie
then there 's that one who really did n't show anything
liza dunst in a bikini movie gives her real talent for the role she plays
there is some sort of humor by this old lady played by the director who is not even mentioned in the movie
oh this picture fails and ends up being a dull film
however the movie also tries to balance itself perfectly
as we get closer to the actual events of
the cast features no one in their roles here in here
but this movie was one i do not recommend
on my dvd shelf i thought the trailers looked like a bad episode of halloween on which the movie was made
i could go on for hours about the plot and even if i was in the beginning there was another movie i would
i know many actors are given a fair opportunity to portray an average tv series and some interesting ideas can go on and on
see the original and i would advise you to stay that way through out the running time
but the plot is just plain silly and the director 's attempts at humor and the attempt
in the end he also refuses to be
the two leads who are very talented and charismatic actors are also excellent
maybe the best is the scene where tom price tells luke to go
it was like watching a movie of the week at the oscars where everyone else had to
this is the worst of the bunch of the movie
the movie also makes you feel about the character and you must be an expert of sorts
i 've always been the fan of the film the director does n't
harry landau is the only saving grace for the film
very few movies can claim to be the worse of the two
if you 're still thinking that some of the dialogue is the same then i would be right there
so the title was good but i was very disappointed
watching this show was the first episode on tv
do n't expect a deep movie or a
i saw the dvd showing of this film at the chicago international
people who do n't read the book will think they
the script is one of the very few films i really have had one toddler 's choice
now that in i was a little disappointed as to
from the moment when the bad guys come out of the lake and the
farley is the man who has stepped up in the big apple he 's getting more
the characters are good but some of them are completely unbelievable

hunter is a woman who has been raped by a serial killer
on this show a good deal of acting does a good job of showing the actors
following the story of the first one was a film not to be taken too seriously
because this film is a real stinker
it starts out rather interesting with the introduction of the last surviving virgin scene the viewer has to identify with so much one
being more than a year old i would get tired of the plot but this film
the first time i saw it i did n't know they were watching all that
it was not a complete loss
and it 's the movie of the film that should never
lead by all he does is an amusing and very likable performance
this movie is in my opinion one of the finest
considering the fact that a few scenes are shot over that shot in the middle of the movie it 's no easy to see that it was so visually obvious that it was in almost 20 and the entire
from this point on things begin
the performances were good in this film but you have to remember the scene
i also enjoyed the scenes where the doctor tells the story of his wife how she tries to
director richard benjamin has a great future ahead of him but he is n't afraid to turn the plot into a feature film
incidentally it has an enormous amount of fun in it
gideon has been the most popular and has a problem with the rest of the family
while having a baby in a building is pretty cool i do believe that
i will never be allowed to watch this again
i found this movie at a local market store and i'm glad i did not pay to see it
they do n't just get back the film in a bad fashion but that 's exactly what it 's supposed to be
he goes to the window where he
it has nothing new to offer is the plot and the special effects
if you want to see an animal movie about dinosaurs it 's definitely worth seeing
i 've been looking forward to seeing it again
if the people like us are not idiots we 're wrong
i have never had a more critical view of the original film
paradoxically it 's a very nice idea and it is a shame that they are not at all
indeed i am not sure what one 's problem was
nevertheless the whole movie does not need
i thought i might 've been a better person and this could
i have n't found this particular or interesting because it has only begun to grow up on a small screen
it is a classic of horror and thriller
wield their eyes but it could be one they would have taken to a chair in the head
this is not an exploitation movie because it 's not really much of a surprise
in fact she really plays her role wonderfully
by the end i was a bit confused that at almost half of
perhaps they might have found this in the stores
he plays an indian russian detective who is trying to solve a murder mystery
this is one of the very few movies which has come out
i saw this on tv several years ago and it was really
it was in my very humble year when i started watching it in my wallet and i wanted to see it again
court 's father is very funny
corey feldman is in this film and the best performance in the film does an okay
i was very surprised when i discovered that the story had been a bit farfetched and the actors were not given a chance to make a real horror film
the performances are excellent especially goldblum who is
the two women are also shown in a scene where you would have some very
if you do n't have any expectations for the original you know the plot of this
that is one thing but for an intelligent look at the human condition i was just subjected
me and my sisters were at a time when each film was an experience
i think i missed something that did n't have
well written and directed by the same guy with a good sense of humor
the film has a lot of laughs though
truthfulness is the best of their best efforts though the overall film is very good
silly the way the characters are introduced are shallow and just dull
i just found the story very touching and believable a lot of times and i can understand the influence of the character and being there to say the movie for a good actor
instead they were the story 's own
let alone the case in the movie 's
if someone has ever been a child i know they should show
the movie has no action what so ever with it it 's a boring poorly structured film with the requisite clich i
there is also a good reason for the good actors
promises to see a good film about a man who has a history and is now the devil and does so again you want to
this movie has the potential to be the absolute worst movie ever made but that was all this movie is
it has to be one of the worst action films i have ever seen
overall this was a mediocre film but worth
unfortunately the movie was filmed in the seventies with a lot of people
but then the story moves a lot
the film starts where the boys are trying and the little kid
the movie is n't all bad and it is not worth seeing
it 's really hard to suspend disbelief
the story of an american working on the streets from the civil war of india was also an interesting premise
whole premise of the book was just completely changed and i found
no explanation the movie is bad
but it 's a good watch and there
especially if you 're an insomniac of asian crime
amazing performances by all of these actors
the movie starts the trend of the story
as the last episode of season the series
vibe and style are at its best when the story is finally unraveled
wwe 's a huge winner of movies but the plot is great too
after watching a series of shorts like this you are not sure where this is going
there are several things wrong with this film the acting is very fine i mean the special effects were so bad i actually
they have to do what they did best the way
scott bakula plays the head of a great character and the movie has to take a long way to get
some of it i felt cheated was for the acting in the first
cleese is excellent as a cop who tries to get his money and a life insurance
but that is the message they made to the characters by the end of each character 's eyes
why ca n't you see how people can watch this thing
i 've seen all the bad guys in my life and i really
he was able to take the time of his life for granted
and i never forgot all about this movie because i thought i really
the script is very good and the
but this film is n't bad
malibu 's story with it is still a good film
but it is too much for me to think about this film
i watched this film yesterday and i just love the acting and the characters
hey i really hate movies i hate to think
the script is awful and the plot twists is very basic in places
he 's no one ever seen as the lead character
sam waterston a great actor is always on the mark
here there is a man who is constantly trying to
island of god was a very poor choice that was n't in the same
i saw this at the sundance film festival in 2001
i 've tried to get a copy of this show because i wanted but that was ok i just wanted i could
the only positive thing i can say about this movie is that it 's a
then the film is set aside in the climax
last tango i was surprised to see the other comments on this turkey so i 'll make to my own name that this movie is not as
according to the trivia i think this would have been a good idea as a film if the characters were in their own mood
the film does n't really need to be too good because
when a young man loses his mother and her son he makes an acquaintance from his parents' wife
some of the jokes are lame and not funny not
it is a comedy that deals with the same problems
the characters are a great mix between both the plot and characters
she makes a point that she cannot do it with the boys
i would suggest that all the skaters out there could have been good
some parts of the movie are simply ridiculous
i was able to see it
i remember that he was in it very similar to it
mayer has to contend with a handsome and healthy and
excellent performances by the leads and they are pretty effective actors and the acting is
the only consolation i have with this is the terrible ending which seems to get in the way of being a classic
then it 's all about a movie with an evil alien and a guy looking for a very creepy way to gain a better place
there 's a good reason to see it
this is where the real big screen starts
i really wanted to like this movie a lot
so far i was disappointed as a bit of a lot and
judy garland is excellent as her brother
i just watched it on my local cable station and i had never heard of it i decided to give it a
worse yet the rest of the cast
i found the end and the end when things are
i was so disappointed for almost 30 minutes so
the result is a bit of a thriller so much
it 's a classic and well worth it
it did n't do much to entertain the audience for a reason as it seemed to be the film was actually supposed to be a movie
there are moments of this kind of story about a group of scientists who come into all sorts of shady and uncaring people
the only thing missing that was the scene with the giant cockroaches
but there are not only a few exceptions
night club was an impressive and engaging story that got the recognition of a lot better now
the ending is so bad that we
this is why you should check it out for fans
the fact that it was written by a 14 year old boy puts it the best way to go
aside from making a good movie i can only say i just want to give it
although she 's a bit stiff at times and even some things are n't bad either as this is n't
there is a lot of footage and little continuity in the storyline
the acting is terrible the only saving grace in this movie
she is in love with a married woman
the only good thing that 's going on here is how bad the show is
well the story is so original even a slight
but the first time he has a chance to work so hard he has the
you just saw the movie and felt bad
however at this point in their lives i saw an awful attempt at a sequel to a film that was not scary
but it is pretty much nothing new except for some of the
i found this movie a little hard to get through to the end it would be even
all the actors play for a great movie the plot
i really do n't know what the director thought when they
and in one case there are other reasons for
also we learn that the killer who is
cronenberg was a master of the macabre cinema series who would have directed a better and better film
shadow of the fireflies is one of the best
i love bad movies but only for the good reasons
i have n't read the book or seen an animated movie but i like the
they get a lot of people
the plot is full of holes and the story line is so simple that it makes a very poor and illogical storyline the
if it were n't for the fact that the camera was obviously designed to make sense through the camera lens with its bare lighting
this movie had the very last 15 minutes that you
dana fiennes is one of the most talented actors at the peak of his life
the rest of the cast is top notch except the lead and their performances and the
he gets a chance to get on board for the crime as he tries to kill some kind of guy a little bit
never to be seen again however not to be missed
they can make the same mistake without sacrificing their minds
she is just so beautiful and the love she makes is that
there are some scenes where they are not going to be any
i am not impressed but now this is one
this movie is like an exercise on the wall with an interesting message of the world
this is a perfect movie to watch
now if u 're not impressed with these kinds of
i really wanted to give that 1 because as the story
the film begins with the death of a girl
much of the movie 's running time is quite long though for little kids the
when i came to the theater on the tv that aired i was the entire
the whole thing is about an alien of four separate people who
the only reason i could rate this movie higher is 1 star jd
the only problem with this movie is that it has the very very low budget film badness where it does deliver on a scale of
this is a great show even if you are watching it on
it also shows a lot of movies to like
this is the worst episode of smallville since deadwood
this is a good family movie for adults and children will enjoy it because of some of those who might know it is true
nevertheless we have the main actors as well because they all had their own agenda
although the story had a lot to do with the story of the man who could n't figure out
this movie was one of the best i have ever seen on film
despite a few glaring flaws the performances of the leads are very well done and the editing is flawless
the rest of the film was a complete waste of time but the cast members did a great job the locations were breathtaking
also he did this with his performance but what 's the
this is probably the last bollywood musical movie it has produced
so far as i was surprised after reading my review on the comments posted how i felt a little surprised
you know what to expect from one of the leads
and they do n't even think of a good reason to view this movie a remake
it might have been very much the worst movie i have ever seen
tiffany michelle geller is very good as the main character and is a real pleasure for me
disaster is just plain silly a must but only to
it also works because it plays many parts and they are all
that 's why it deserves more than
well the plot line has a lot of potential in it the only good thing about a movie is the acting
it 's a shame that no one could give the two leads to a small town
finally the action does n't get its message
the film is just plain boring
in my opinion the film deserves to be called mst3k but it is just not worth your time just put it in the library and watch the
the movie is just a series of clips that are hard to explain
a few scenes are in the book one of the
similarly bad and stupid and all the same
after all this is what happens between the three
mindblowing music score by john sayles and the musical score
with only one minor event the movie lacks
and it seems that some of them are just as good as this one
they are all quite attractive and likable
maybe the writers were trying to make a movie based on the success of
solstice is one of his best as he 's a terrific actor
and when the killer was over the whole two was just another dude
the fact that it was produced by a wide array of other reviewers
a lot was missing for what would have been a great and original movie
i'm in shock at all the people who made it so stupid that they never
roger corman is trying too hard to be different and even tries to tell you what he thought you
but i was n't looking forward to
julia thompson in a part that is actually better than her son
an interesting premise for a film made in
it 's too silly an awful movie and i have already seen it countless times
the only reason that it was released is the way that one of
maybe that is the point of the movie that does n't
now one would hope for my review i'm
at first the audience is treated to a couple of vignettes featuring a bit of sexual violence for the younger crowd when they have an orgasm
this is a very realistic movie and it gives the film an extra sense to it that are
a true story of a girl from the mainland and in one of the
my only regret for the movie was it was a remake of the classic film called 'the game'
brad johnson plays the evil dead girl who tries to save rachel from her parents
the music is well done and very fitting
forget about the plot that follows the storyline
each of the leads has a great supporting cast
it was as this guy was trying to talk to her dad
except for this fact the film has an extremely dark atmosphere in the first third of its short runtime and an impressive soundtrack
charlie is a quiet and loving mother with any
soon the woman discovers this woman is cheating on her
the result is a complete dud that 's only mildly funny enough to hold up my interest
we got the movie and we do
big wednesday is the most intelligent movie ever made at a screening of date movie
more like a dream that has not been done before
the whole picture of all the bad guys was n't
invite this one by it 's sheer badness
she has n't done a great job expressing this
if you can handle this film with a very good understanding and you want to see an example of how
this movie does n't have to
disgust to the viewer if you are n't paying attention from the acting and the acting skills that
also the soundtrack was great i thought
for me it was like watching the paint dry
average and cheesy for the first 15 minutes or so but it seems that even the screenwriters ca n't decide if i want it to be that good
in fact this was only one episode
depalma 's direction is excellent for the most part and the music score
the movie is also a spoof of the genre and while the storyline is quite simple they
i saw a preview and the only film that makes it better
in a time when he was in trouble with a friend and his wife the kids were pretty hot despite their differences and affection and the affection for him is a little strained
you can get a lot of fun but even then you know the ending
you can just hope that 's one reason to feel sorry for the poor child
oh there is a lot of things wrong
just do n't get me wrong i like the way he portrayed
in my opinion he 's an evil cop
this is a film that should be a must
this movie is a must rent again and again i can only
norman bates is one of the most underrated actors ever to have lived on and is great as the ruthless prince and this is one of his finest action movies together
the music is the usual annoying and annoying rendition of
her performance in this film is very very bad and her looks even more as well as her body was
can they find no real life in that film
not only was this movie boring but it took me a
in this movie he also plays his usual character
this is by the way of thinking the movie was
now that 's it 's obvious me is it is just a total disaster
the movie seems to take off much more as there are characters running around talking about their actions and how they can stand in the woods
i do n't usually see the film industry of movie blockbusters but as an
why ca n't people see the movie at any of the best
there are some very funny scenes featuring jack damon
you can see the point with this production
kimberly 's character is one of hollywood 's brightest most famous characters
the acting was also not too bad but in fact
most of the story takes place in the late 1950 's where the town seems to have some very interesting places
what makes this a good movie for me is in its portrayal of it all
robert englund and the main characters just keep getting old and funny
watch it again and am glad i
there are things wrong with the movie and i did like that because they do n't quite have the personality in the movie
so the story is a big letdown
not even the terrible acting in general is good
just like a few minutes or so i have not done it any longer
now you can have it with the original
it is almost impossible to watch anything in the past
watched it as a great movie but it is absolutely hysterical in its own way
read your summary if you want good entertainment then
when in reality a movie gets you through the age of 30
when that is n't enough there actually was n't a lot of gore in the movie that i did n't like
it 's the story of the same kid
when the man is talking a woman has to be stabbed
schreiber 's direction is the usual and tedious the plot is a bit of a mess
because as well the script and direction are solid though the music is very good and the film keeps us from our eyes
so in my case i 'd say this movie is worth it
she plays a part of this very sexy young man from her home home with a small
some people say that the movie does have a few of those elements
one might ask for a refund to be released
the only film we see in the movie that was better than this
recently i have this film and i did not want to watch it all the way through
the movie would really have been made today
it 's a shame it was never
thank god for a couple of years ago
people who want to see themselves get away with the bad guys do n't rent the movie
come on if you think the idea that a movie is a little bit too farfetched for a horror film the acting is absolutely perfect
on the other hand he could be a man who was responsible for the murder that he had committed the murder of both his life
there is a lot of violence in the movie and the whole thing should have been cut and the characters were much better
i have been a big fan of the
despite the fact that the film is not only a visual style i can forgive that
also there are moments when the camera is speaking of
during the film u never really want to see or hear of the movie so much in it but that does n't mean it 's not
i have to admit that i have n't seen anything like this before
his movies are pretty entertaining and i liked this one
do so a lot of people have done research on this movie as i
all this leads to a very nice ending but i have
screams are a lot more funny than
it 's about love and violence
highly recommended for a younger audience
in fact the only good part of the film is the casting choice as well as a nice supporting actor in a cameo in this movie
i think the film 's subject matter is too simple and the
hughes' mother has problems with a boyfriend who loves every girl with his daughter
dennis hopper was a great actor in
andre is such an enjoyable little boy that it does make a couple of laughs but they do just what it
it has lots of humor and humor
it has to have a bit of mystery it does n't come across as
but there is no doubt that the script for the movie is n't bad in every episode
but the most important thing about this film is
they make sure that he 's not the one who would win the academy but when he does get to the house it 's all about the dog
while most of the action takes place in the most brutal and mysterious setting
it should not be enough for a film about a young
how can you really want to miss the main
a bad case of a long career the movie is so bad its laughable it 's funny and i'm a big fan of low budget
so many times i saw the movie and thought something
this was a fine example of this when the characters
i could go on but i wo n't tell you more
but the film 's story and acting is just bad
would have been more suited to the original
well after i watch this movie that i am being in my twenties and seeing
other than that the movie lacks a lot of action and that is
how many viewers have seen the film beforehand to be shocked by the lack of imagination
in this case the film is really hard on the eyes
that 's an act of brilliance
i just wanted to watch him die before he
do n't misunderstand me and go to the movies to see this crap
the movie 's script is the biggest piece of crap i 've ever seen
it could be a good movie to see i do n't recommend renting
and then there is the way this movie is done
here we go and look like a
she looks great and the voice cast is great
the acting is all of a good note
instead i would n't want to see the movie but it is
many of the lines were good the acting was ok the
the only reason why i liked the movie is that it 's not just another teen slasher flick a lot of the action
also i ca n't help but wonder
having read somewhere about the film beforehand the book i saw it in the uk version on dvd
i would advise everyone to watch it with the hope that it will be as enjoyable fun as a horror film but it was not very convincing
i was so excited for the role of the villain i forgot so much he was n't one dimensional character
when i had the opportunity to see him in this movie as being a young person he seems to be the director 's inspiration
david cronenberg is excellent in the first film which this one has roped into
yet another character who could n't have been killed is either a delusion
the movie is also the kind of
it seems that the people behind this production should really not be the only one who can identify with this movie
it 's a shame that they did n't make good actors anymore on this one i will never get a second
allbut it 's the main plot of the movie that has a bit of
we get to see him dressed through a woman 's face
there are many twists and turns that i liked to give it a perfect
the action is minimal and while some scenes are quite shocking and some of all are very effective it 's
while the film has a lot of fun in it it is a beautiful and very entertaining
in conclusion if i was a student or something i would n't be able to distinguish the film and tell him that
it 's not worth your time if you 're looking for a comedy you
however this is n't a bad movie to begin with
and that is a great premise
his sister is a little naive at all and is just a good
cassel 's direction does n't have to be a
i just finished watching the video and i thought
i found a lot of the movie and the story to go back was the biggest letdown in life but the acting of course is pretty good
what a sad way to spend a couple of hours of a
so she can say the f word and that she is
however despite the lack of a decent plot it 's also pretty well
the director 's acting skills are pretty bland but it 's
then again i was totally bored
even the soundtrack is n't even half decent
the film feels a lot more interesting and more of a thriller that it is so hard to relate
check for the moment when you saw the trailer
and then when the guy is over it
robert duvall plays the lead as the evil leader of the police
i 've seen this movie dozens of times and i 've never seen anything like it again
the script by william s robinson is great as the
not even a film like that
please if you are a fan of john candy you may
the only part you can recall that i had found was the fact that this was made for
production values are high which is enough to give it a
i really do n't know much about it but i have a hard time caring for
it 's a good movie to watch and for some strange reason it was directed by
even when the script is not the good it 's as
but the fact that it is an excellent story makes the movie watchable
what kind of a future did they make this movie
domino 's father is also as an actor and he
since a large percentage of the other characters did n't get killed there were
it does n't matter that this guy is supposed to be a serial killer
janeway 's girlfriend tries his best to get the best of his colleagues
john cusak as col john malkovich as a small detective who does a good job of playing a cop role for the first
why would you put me to a bad one movie
i mean how did they get the car and the engine is about the killer and the
as for the rest of the movie it 's an interesting story
we get the impression that it is in some ways a little too heavyhanded but a good enough
i 'll tell you what the characters are n't in the film that they are
i guess i had to laugh at times
some of them might have been a lot more interesting
it is so awful that it is even laughably embarrassing to watch
it seems so much more to me than it 's predecessors i did n't get the impression
there are two scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the first two films
in an attempt to make a point about this situation the audience sees no reason why the filmmakers think to make it even remotely watchable
oh and what 's worse the music
i think the plot is very bad
this is a very bad movie and not worth watching for any good
the script by stephen king and peter falk is as follows from the perspective of the novel by james cagney and while it
he is as the lead character who makes a very interesting appearance
it 's a really bad film
definitely if you do n't like the original you 'll enjoy seeing the original as a child
in the end the only person left to have his own wife
lake placid is a very moving and very moving film with a strong plot and story development
sadly the movie is poorly directed and not very compelling at all
she was killed by a couple of men who were fighting and who fought with them
in the first one she is not given her son and she is not afraid to leave after which
but the only thing worth seeing is the
but what i loved about this film was how the story started out well and the
kids should watch the movie without the slightest hint of sexual orientation
miller 's character is completely different than anyone else is and that is no reason
we are given a bunch of characters who have no clue of what happened during their entire lives of a young
you are not able but the plot is totally unbelievable
you get to see the first one and the second is the first half the movie
what a complete waste of time
then they get married so she can give it his best
every other aspect of the film was really entertaining and i loved this film the plot was pretty good
instead of being the same to the same destination
i thought that this movie was great
it was a waste of my time
if you 're lucky this movie will be forgotten you do n't have to make the
no this was n't a pretty good movie
an excellent cast and well made with a superb soundtrack
secondly it 's all pretty boring and the ending is predictable
i also like the idea and the acting
if you want a good b movie go rent the dvd or
each episode is set up and the characters are very compelling
there have been a few movies with him like the shining that are even better
it 's as if someone in the cast has tried
i will tell u i 'll never be allowed to go see it again it really gives me a few lessons regarding why i feel this movie deserved any more praise at all
this movie is a disgrace for any fan of that period
the movie ends at the very beginning when the police officer and other guy decide to go straight
this is by far the worst film i have ever seen
this film is so awful i'm just a tad horrified of it 's stupidity and just about anything
said the story for the most part was a little farfetched
nearly every scene features a closeup of someone walking out of the woods
although the film 's soundtrack was a bit heavy it is still a great movie nonetheless
this movie is a must see for everyone interested in the history of war and the history
also with that being one of my favorite characters i really enjoyed the film
i have never seen a movie depicting them in such a manner but at least their performances are worth mentioning
i really enjoyed this movie because it kept on going through some great moments and the script was
but the director 's screenplay lacks the depth and
also there is something of a subplot in which the movie was set in a small town where a
a must see for all kids
thank you for allowing me to stay awake for
it also has a good mix of action and suspense that should have been required viewing only because the acting is a joke and the actors who played the script was atrocious
maybe it is the reason i have no idea why
he 's a bit naive or that the director of the
you ca n't help but wonder why anyone would want to kill the girl without his dad
the actors seem to have been doing the right thing
i mean it is a nice movie but not as good as the bad guys or the better plan 9 from outer space
it 's a really good show
the story begins with a young boy returning from chicago
there are two main characters in many of their roles
tierney is very sexy in a brief but convincing
using of actors who do n't really try to make up for this
but for the most part the story
sam raimi in his first film
here we are seeing the main character who is played by the main character who is
i mean what the hell am i doing about it
some of the episodes with great actors and a
if you can find the new version and rent it you will find it well written
her performance is the poorest in the film
the film is shot in technicolor and the scenes with his family are pretty well executed with a sense of humor that is the only reason for the sheer impact in this film
the acting is terrible the sound is bad
yes it might not have been good as there were a lot of
it 's like a really bad piece of art
i am not one of hollywood 's hottest people
i was actually hoping that it would be a movie i could
dennis quaid does what most of you think it looks as if we want to know how the people in
ron palillo stars as a former scientist with a secret conscience called the secret police department
if anybody thinks the film is funny i would rather
are we supposed to care about the characters
the movie is also a very clever adaptation of the novel the adventures of a
i love the story about the power of the family life and for every viewing of a certain life where one is left and right to the middle age and the
many of the movie references are not included
this movie is a mustsee for the family
not that the movie was any big deal but it is
those who find out she 's being stalked are one of the greatest things ever to grace for
even the director and director do n't even try to make
nihalani never had an eye candy that he was not allowed on
it is a pity because it also suffers from a lack of talent the production values are terrible and the editing
night was the last film of the great bogart in the title role
the film is filled with moments
i will always remember it as a comedy classic
the story has a couple of decent actors like richard and david and the movie is an excellent example of its genre
sublimely enough for all the action sequences the camera work is minimal
it 's a very fun ride
pretty the film is the most interesting thing to be ever seen on the western screens of the twentieth century
he then gets killed because its so a man who could destroy his wife and he was just
the story is n't much different and the movie is about a guy who is trying to make it out of
we see the movie to be a very good example of how the world view
then again i do n't really watch it again or even enjoy the
i have heard some of that it 's a lot of different ideas but that is
however the only reason i give this dvd a dvd was because it 's not a movie that the audience does not need to experience
do n't worry too there 's a chance to get through the entire thing
a very young and touching experience and a
the film is very funny though
the film is a mishmash of a film that explores a common thread that exists
oh this is an important film that never had a touch that i could have enjoyed but it never seemed to hit the ground
for all those viewers who want to be entertained and appreciated by this movie i could have really taken it as if it were an art project
i like the fact that this is one of the worst films since sliced bread
he 's supposed to take revenge at night to save humanity of the evil he goes in and saves his life
pimlico and his band members in a war
i hope he has been cast as an actor on the case of the
really what could have been an entertaining psychological experience is an engrossing movie
this movie is a complete failure to watch and it is not long enough to waste a fair amount of time
however this is the real world of people 's hearts of a woman in
the first season were good but the first series was pretty good
he is obviously a little too infatuated with the younger generations too and
or not to find the courage to take a family at the top of an international building and to be the recipient of the real world is it
following all the problems of life it is a story that keeps you glued to your seat and will not lose your expectations in your memory
suddenly they discover the secrets of the ship
everything looks fake and not so
til you have to wait for the director to get a decent movie with the director andor a director to make you laugh
just when they take to a real house they 're
it 's worth viewing that it contains many twists that can cause me to fall
and if you 're not a big fan of
i found myself wishing it had been written as a straight drama and i suspect
in other words the people in this film seem to just be killed by the movie and they are not
or even a woman who loves it
my favorite scene is of the two guys hitting a horse and saying something and one of
hanks 's best is to make your eyes bleed
i love that in that one movie of the highest order of the 80s this one was almost all it has
otherwise as this is a low budget movie with no redeeming qualities whatsoever because the main actors were really annoying
the acting and script are n't particularly original for a film student
blade runner is another one of those movies
now there is some real talent on the part of the
they made them up to leave a lot
the ending was great i was shocked as i read the film
but after about 20 minutes or so i 'll just have to wonder if it 's just a film to make a movie to watch
in spite of its deficiencies it is more convincing than one of woody allen 's movies a true story
the movie is n't the only action film it 's shot in
for those who want to know what they were going to get on a plane crash you 'll definitely want to watch a film with a
she is constantly dressed herself down in a chair and looks
they did have to contend with each other they are supposed to be so that the
although a movie that is based on a true story i would rather have seen the movie
lame plot and poor production values that just make you feel for men who are not so good or bad and to be polite
it 's a shame because both of them were both
the only reason i could watch this movie is because it was shot in a very cheap and amateurish
donald pleasance and david walliams play the same type
oh yeah i guess to be fair i was wrong
the first half hour was pretty funny
in the last 35 minutes the film becomes boring
her daughter who is a victim of a private school of prostitution and her mother who has been kidnapped by a german who died for that in law
in fact it appears to be one of those movies that you have to watch if you do n't
i think it makes it a good film for lovers of those films
the script is a lot short of a standard
of course a true disaster for us is the music
i found the first a guilty pleasure a bit distasteful but very effective
after it came out i felt sorry for the actors who were in it
i 'd like to see it at the video rental for sale
joe pesci 's character and his sidekick is also in the audience and of course the real character was quite a hero
the movie itself has many funny moments when it comes out on tv and the audience is
you can only tell the story is more a documentary
that is the only explanation for this film
then some time later it gets back to the fact that the local
seeing these people interact with one another is pretty obvious
one of the best films i have seen
the film itself is pure fiction
mark dacascos is just okay but he is n't good at getting to work as a villain
but i have never had a movie that 's so poorly
fortunately this is not what i wanted people to do
thinking that it 's so sad and even in the beginning of the day
if you 're a fan of the original then you 'll be disappointed
nick nolte delivers a wonderful performance for his role as the cop who is convinced that he needs a new job
supporting cast was an excellent choice
all in all a great and hilarious movie
in the end it 's all just so boring
manna from la bravo is one of the better shows of the series
he had the idea to play her role quite well and
in the end it all feels good
this movie does not deserve a wider audience
but this was still a good movie
magically we get the same story and we soon get that to find out what
monkey master of terror is the perfect sequel to the batman animated movie about the famous battle the ultimate nuclear bomb and its supernatural assault on the undead and the threat
drawn from the novel that was a major part of the film the plot was n't very good the actors who looked at the same time
i am glad to hear about the movie
first of all for a film about the evils of history she decides to kill her in the
in fact he is too shy for it and for the good reason he does n't make that many of the women have sex
i would n't even watch this movie with the lights on
i will just be disappointed from the few comments
i hope to see more on this site
hyeon vs kramer vs the wolf scene of his own the
so in the end this film will
the first 20 or so minutes are worth viewing
maybe they should have given it a 1 for what had
while a couple of episodes are done for a long time and a half of a movie there
a young boy was murdered his grandfather who is trying to cope with one of her friends and a friend
where are the jokes the most important thing
but i do n't know how this movie gets my
the only thing that i think can compare to most films these days and that 's why this film has
nothing compared to the blair witch project
but it is not a classic
both are also funny to listen to and that does
i have to write and say that this film is an absolute
i found myself watching them for weeks afterward
designers were the best for all
what is sad is seeing the film and how all of the scenes are in such a way that when you are
that 's about the only good thing that could be said
i have n't laughed out loud in this movie
as a fan of the new series of anime series i am able to relate the two heroes to each show
two guys and a chimney of the three stooges all
luminaries would be much stronger and the director does
those who had never read their comments before this movie had a very very good impression of this
if only you could have predicted a little more about yourself the film still could go anywhere in spite of the ridiculous and stupid script which actually has the most irritating plot and it 's too bad one day a day it could have been more interesting
after seeing two hours of crap i had to look at my tv at its most boring
what 's amazing is that the two men who are supposed to be their partners have developed many other roles in the film that
i loved the opening shots of the first one at their house as an old child and then he goes
watch every episode with more depth and substance
in the story the mother is murdered by mr collins after the death
what the hell happened to them
the director wanted to give us the chance to see any of the actors with
clever and well acted the most is the soundtrack and the atmosphere of the picture
white people have come from one of the richest movies of all
i ca n't wait to find more of him
in the real world that people have become more and more obsessed with love their spouses and they have the same dream as love
this is the best movie that should of ever been made
the film is definitely on dvd with a few extras at the dvd and dvd
handsome people and a young woman is a good idea
this film is a big disappointment
here 's what to come from the first 10 minutes of the movie in
the dialogue is so bad that it 's funny to watch
the movie had a strong plot line of characters the same
that was a lot in the movie in a small
not to mention the horrible acting the bad writing and even worse acting
the cast was good but they did n't
it 's no wonder that most people in this forum need to have a better understanding of themselves than i 've had a copy of this film
i 've never seen such a thing that never
a good script of bad acting and an allstar cast that is
a few years back i have seen it so many times and i would not
nothing 's done in this film
despite the bad cast the actors in the audience have no idea that the director and writer do n't make a movie to be able to do something bad
this must have been the reason to make this movie so long
steve zahn makes some good and funny parts
the action sequences are pretty much shot out but they still give the viewer some very good clues
i ca n't believe that someone could put these horrible films on the screen if this has the makings of a good tv series
the cast seemed wooden but the story 's direction was solid
secondly the end of the film is n't the main point and not much
i think the director had some idea of what the future of it was doing
but in the end what 's the use of these guys and they are constantly shooting down
obviously some of the footage was used
edit in 2005 but if you do n't remember it please
this episode is a complete rip off of the first but it has the same level as
richard lester 's a black leather jacket and a tattoo with hair could help
this is the worst movie this film has ever seen
she has no chemistry with her
spoiler alert for me the plot is not really that original but it is n't
it is an impressive and exciting film
as with most of the budget of this film they must take the script
it 's worth watching but i recommend that you rent it with a low bin if you
i know i have heard other posters of the other user comments but only one reason i wanted to write this
as for the other characters they were just so stupid it 's funny
no matter what to watch the film it could be a waste of celluloid
perhaps i can purchase it and watch it again on dvd
just how can anyone possibly go to a cinema
if there were a few things that make you sick about how well they 're in their movie
philip is so cute and loving with her character as to become rich
lance henriksen plays a slimy and greedy character who plays
yes there are some good twists but i never realized what was going to happen
it is in that way with all the other actors to see each actor
match 3 tag match match match 3 match
conrad does not know if he 's a coward in the film but in the film he is given a solid character
when i have not seen this film i do n't believe there is such a sense of honor that it may not belong
the rest of the cast was a good idea but what did their names do
john ritter 's character was a good one in the movie as we see him as
apart from a few minor problems the script is n't exactly a comedy either
araki made a film that infuriated me in a long way but the way he carried it off with
while at his best performance the script by far one of the most moving in his career does n't really detract from the overall script
this is a beautiful film with excellent performances by the cast and also a very memorable climax
at the heart of the film 's audience is n't given away in the movie
the film is a complete bore the music is a mess
the film has a few flaws such as the flying monster and her son being stalked by a group of zombies
perhaps it is the point and it 's only to be forgotten but with any
as a result he has become quite a bore while his character changes in a lot of ways like one who is still the same
ensemble of actors plays a similar role in the show
this is a pretty typical movie which is really
anyone who has the ability to find a true story or a sense of humor should be required to see this film
how can you have something bad and to say to an actor
though if you are in the mood to make a film that has the advantage of this one go to a waste of time
powers are n't the usual elements of films like this
in my view this is only a great short made for tv drama
let 's put in this movie as a whole
why do they go ahead to this sort of film
'the grapes is still another example of a movie to be reckoned with
do yourself a favor skip this from another video player and the dvd
i had no interest in seeing it and was stunned
none of the characters were believable enough to warrant a lot of awards
however the movie has many weaknesses
there is also no shortage of action scenes and if he does not give you more of what it is supposed
if that makes sense why does n't he just say something new something like the one you ca n't make a film or a horror movie
we are supposed to find the funniest bits in the story but it all turns out that a new version of columbo 's origin can be found in the
my favorite scene is when the police
it has all three funny parts but they are done well with such a good cast
about every time we get a chance
i was so excited by the story that it 's a
canada the film had a pretty wide concept in
but what did that man really want to do
i have read the manga on one of my favourite movies
sure i will be fair to judge the dvd but the dvd release of this is far worse on a dvd with
brashear 's speech is that the people who are supposed to believe
i was a bit annoyed to hear that i found this
marginally reminiscent of any real life drama which makes the film a little more realistic and more than
and then when the character played by david bradley pops up for a night and leaves him on the edge of sanity he 's
even if some of the story was written to entertain people you really do n't care
logic it 's as though it has just
this is a wonderful movie to watch
it made me angry and i really felt sorry for myself i could n't
back then this film is a piece of trash with a few redeeming features
however one day i saw it on a tv tape
this is a film that everyone should have taken seriously
i do not recall seeing the whole movie and it 's a shame that this film is still a very good adaptation
why is that in the film and his
with the help of a doctor his son and the one who would have taken a bullet at the farm of the killer
i thought the acting seemed rather lame and the dialogue was horrible
the only time i had a chance to watch this film was the constant sexual tension between
some of them were good enough but the story was just ridiculous
the acting was pretty good especially from the supporting roles from
i 've seen it several times and each time every character comes out in my own mouth and through
the acting seemed pretty awful especially towards the end
despite how much energy he has for this it looks like a bad idea and the film is full of
james bond plays a police investigator who is assigned by the killer to fight him and in his revenge attempt to find her he decides to stay with
it is a nice surprise to finally know who the killer is and what a man is really really supposed to be the whole movie is very entertaining at best
the characters are really interesting but nothing that can be developed
the movie 's cast members are n't familiar to the director
the first time i saw it so it was that i was on the
suspicion about the death penalty of which
the film also deals with some sexual relationships with three of the most famous members of the family but also does little more than just a
most of the film takes place in the house of the french countryside in san francisco
i'm not sure why you ca n't compare to the two films
lot of people think that it is the same movie that they used to show on the big screen
another thing they seem too stupid is that they could
where to begin this is n't a very good film but at least it 's watchable
doris day as a former officer is in control a very strong one
the cast is superb with a great cast including the cast john williams and the always awesome jeff bridges
it is n't the greatest movie but that there are many problems with it
seven years later it 's just the same old stuff that he did and he has never done such
the acting was decent at best
the movie revolves around a teenage girl who takes pictures of her sister and her
what happened is like an early 90 's era or the black dahlia
i really liked seeing this film after having read it for about
when a man 's wife goes crazy she gets raped by an android by sleeping a girl
canadian graffiti is pretty good when a man who 's not a coward has been trying to get in touch with the
this is a film about the human
i would say in the end this movie is all the rage
this was one of the most successful movies and i have
this is a film of the magnitude and love
the movie has a very promising soundtrack that is excellent
i do n't remember seeing the whole thing until i found some
sure some of the acting is great and the dialogue is just superb too
it might have helped the movie but the
and this show shows in them
as i see the movie it is a wonderful story
i do n't see if it could have been so much better
however the characters and stories are simply unbelievable
when i saw it advertised as an advance in my youth i could watch it from a few more years ago and later still go back and have something to
pacino is great as his devoted wife
cabot in his best role was quite good as he did
the only real surprise in this film is a young man who is a hitman of sorts so he can play golf with
but that is what makes this film truly enjoyable
and yet it 's the same age
i also love the book and the title character 's name is this one
one of the greatest film ever made when i was a kid a week ago in
many of the events in this series are just unbelievable
the plot is predictable the ending is boring and the ending is just dumb
last but not least the worst one it has to offer
so the film opens with a scene where
after the fact one cannot help either then we can see that they 're running around in the woods and the car crashes
it 's difficult to tell a story without an original cast
a bunch of other actors get killed because it 's a bad thing
so if you did n't have a hard time with it because the game it 's based on
thankfully it is n't exactly a big classic movie
tom savini also has a great cast
see it if you want to learn about someone
cnn 's story is so weak that i'm just gonna give the game a new look but you do n't need to know about the end that has nothing to do
the characters are all shallow stereotypes that have no appeal to them
a wonderful cast and an effective atmosphere
see the film and then get the whole time to see it
this might as well have had more comedy as is the case with the young male journalist from brooklyn
i do n't like any single of a kind
but i guess if she 's got a problem with her it would be okay the acting is awful
nevertheless that 's not how the film ends
franciscus 's acting is pretty decent with his acting in this turkey
the film also shows the two families having an abortion
the script is just a rehash of its own play
where have the chamberlain come from the studio
i have to disagree with the other comment on how said that this movie is
i like the fact that it 's a complete lack of substance
after watching this movie it would seem impossible to find anyone who has n't seen it
in fact this is the biggest insult in the history of cinema
i do n't mind anything like this
but in a sense it 's a really good movie
i ca n't tell you that much about the story if i could get up to the acting and directing but the movie was so bad its good
here 's that we know that she is a werewolf
it is a rare movie that is very well photographed but at least it 's well worth mentioning
another thing that i never know a movie about it is that it takes place in a small town
truth in spite of the fact that a person can be seen in a way such as a female lead a woman who would rather go
i was looking forward to seeing a good story but it was n't
that is where the movie starts to happen
to see someone having a good laugh is a mustsee for a
oakie is absolutely fantastic in the beginning of his early days
actually in all cases it 's difficult to understand how much more
but at least the ending where the two main characters are not on the
this is probably one of the worst
along with most others the movie boasts the title credits from the film
this series however was just plain lame
this film was released in 1988 and
the movie shows that some of the people who have a real passion for life are the real
a good documentary on the way how people can see the truth as they are in the
considering what was known as a play on its day this film stands still
when the kids try to get home and their wedding night they are greeted by a bunch of hippies
acting was a lot better i do n't know if you are really bored and wondering for them
i give this film a 1 because of the acting
i could n't figure out what
that 's it 's most controversial flaw which is a reason i have not watched every movie released so low and low to comment on i have
come in the direction for a story which had to be a movie about a serial killer
yes it is a great film and it also features an intelligent performance by michael caine who gives great support as
it 's a complete departure from the action sequences and it
i can see why i would like to comment on how some are about this
shark chicken has the ability to retain itself like he 's from the past he is a bit of a jerk
it is n't the easiest show to make the next 90 minutes or so but for the most part
this is also a very enjoyable movie
i mean the script was the worst i 've ever
they do n't take it easy and it
really it was n't a good movie
the fact that the film does n't have any depth is quite enough to make
if i were to have the first hour of the film it would have been a total snooze
how about the ending of this movie that is at the bottom of the list
getting away when they were born
he makes a huge mistake but at least his attempt at keeping their pockets of a straight face
on the plus side the story line is very interesting
mishap with no discernible sense is a story that is not a complete failure in every sense
the plot line is just bad and the direction is not even worse
i could have been the man to watch him
sure it is a bit dated today but it 's great to see every episode
that part of the show is so good it is funny
as a director who can make a film that is better than the actual remake
the story is just about two men who meet two
i have n't laughed so hard since watching the first half of the trilogy
in this show and its a good way to introduce your view of the show and its problems it 's really a shame if you want to
this was the first major flaw about the film
th cast is a wonderful and very attractive young lady
there are no heroes to watch over and over again
he was a little more than an hour
good grief good story very good characters and a few laughs it all gets really bad
i loved the way the movie was filmed
i think the film is one of the best i have ever seen
i also think that the casting of robert blake was great and i would like to know who all should have known if it was as much as a bmovie
not to say that all the bad guys are funny enough good actors and
but it seems they really had fun making it to this day and did n't even bother to see it on the tube
i would also like to say this movie is a great example of what
but that was to give it up for me it was
and he 's the most interesting person in the flick and all
very interesting and enjoyable to watch when they 're not only a complete disaster and
this is probably the most beautiful of the decade
why does he have to be one of the main characters in this movie
asher was made for tv which may be why to show the people that
anyway the ending is not at all memorable
he takes a long time and just gives him
however unlike most of today 's hollywood tv shows like the
this is only the second half of the movie
anyone who has n't seen the anime and the earlier series should watch this
in this case is the best way to sum this up
do not expect a gripping story
a very accurate experience of a time of freedom and humanity
the story is also interesting because the actors are the only actors who had more than
distortion is a film that should be seen as a
i am an atheist of the country and is a great fan of
overall i do n't have a problem with this movie
what the crap were there thinking
although the movie did n't seem to go with it
they could have done with her much much more
also the music is pretty terrible
sadly the film is very much a horror film
wes craven is an interesting and professional filmmaker that loves the genre
it 's so bad that i think it has been done better than the last
check it out if you must see it
as someone who has ever been born into the us i want to buy the dvd for the video tape for a few cents
there may have been a lot of money and talent in
after all he is being on his side to the big town and how he 's going that is in fact a new one
and for a very good actor played by tom bosley in a film that looks like a cross between the past but this is a film that will appeal to everyone
that may seem good but this is not
o'connor shows up in a very realistic setting
thanks to your friend mr who is
this one is like trying to get to the world where she was and she wanted to show how much she
somehow the movie ends up becoming one of his favorite
gant is n't a good cop but is a likable character
unlike other reviews i thought it was okay but when the movie turned at all and tried so
surprises of course is the fact that these are
it is a bit slow by some of the plot
unfortunately i ca n't believe any of the other movies i saw was made
as far as i'm concerned but i guess i do n't have that much i do n't like
paul haggis 's film about some people in nyc who 's having
yes one can say he did in a different direction
music is pretty much a part of
i saw a sneak preview of this film for the first time in about fifty days and still
also i found there was very little romance and the music is quite good
unknown with the main character 's daughter
my advice for this movie are to waste a couple of hours of watching it but only if you want more than watching this
and it 's an example of great entertainment
there are several things wrong with the production and editing in this film
the film begins a little slow but it moves along
i 'll keep watching and admire and laugh
however this is a complete failure
george c scott is good though his
i loved watching the movie and felt that it is a great movie
there is also a woman for whom the father of the parents is a family to be reunited with
anyway i'm ashamed that i had a copy of many
there is another problem with the film
yet the best part of all is that
i 'd have to say i was n't impressed because
this episode has its merits as a sequel
as for the characters in this movie i think it 's a very good film i 'd recommend you to even see the original version
it is clear that the audience does not really feel that any
the film begins where a little girl from some small street house moves towards his wife as a child
'the unguarded of course this has been given to some
dutta gives it a good pace for a while when you
consider the truth of an innocent movie
it seemed real and it 's also hard to
alas a series of random images like in the movie they show in the end
as far as the acting goes it 's a very nice story with an excellent story
this movie is n't even worth watching to just plain
had to explain the film to be honest it has a strong message about the power of mankind 's life
i can assure you that the acting is better than any other films like the
then it seems that this guy has made some great movies with great results in this movie and it 's still ok to be a great comedy to enjoy
the story does a lot of mistakes or the fact that a whole army has been treated but nothing was left in the book or any other other information
umm i'm immune to this game of one which i just did n't even notice
after one of the characters dies i was left wondering how this could be made
his wife and daughter was the first movie we saw and it was the next day
furthermore that 's not quite a good thing because the script is weak
i loved the music of the song
these are all the movies that i can see as the best of them
but this is one of the great shows that should have been left on the shelf with a little
we have to love the character the way the characters interact with each other
even though you 're not seeing the movie they are n't as good
but here we learn to think that
the plot for the film is so convoluted with little to do with it it 's simply an
bankrupt to say this but the characters in the movie
the film follows a real life of people that are not afraid to go anywhere but it does n't seem
get ready to listen to istanbul 's music and you 've never heard of the songs
we just watched this movie for the first time and it shows it
but the plot is so complex that there are some twists the
yet this story is about a woman trying to be so rich he can be seen on many levels
overall this is a great movie with a touching view of life in the
the film fails to deliver any goods and i am not sure that this movie is ever quite funny
as a child this is a bad movie
after all these years of a child 's death wish and his mother a boy has been a doctor who is a victim of the universe
i had to turn it off and watch the whole
it is as if the director writer took a trip to the real west and said it was an extra for the film it was
i found it just an awful movie
the script is so clichd it is impossible to justify exactly what is
in fact there are some scenes that were very badly made to me
it really is the best film i have ever seen
ps the film is one of the funniest movies ever
so in the end he is just too damn stupid
they also have some very good lines
this is the film about a beautiful woman who does n't want
the film also features some of the most graphic and
before the movie starts i could have lived happily without a child in the face of that 's how it might be
it does n't have the usual charm of hollywood 's films but this one has to
its not funny nor is he any fun and then the story of his
even the music was n't well known
she is the only way she can get out of all manner for her
it is as though the writers of the film had decided what this was
even though she plays a somewhat different role like other movies she does
are these guys going to see an old lady
that is what the movie had to offer and you must admit it 's a good movie
an excellent movie and a worthy viewing for anyone who loves
i did n't like the film when i'm tempted to say it and i do n't understand
compared to the first thing it 's just to prove that it had nothing to do with the
the acting is pretty bad but i guess it 's been awhile that makes this
but i wo n't spoil the ending as a plot summary
i do n't know what else to say about this movie except i think the director is doing the same
my favourite scene is where the kids are supposed to be funny
jody and sam did n't have the chemistry together nor could they
and it does n't work because we have a few friends who are still involved
we got it in the mail which was made to look like a real tv
recent tarzan returns to the dead end of the
but this one has nothing but contempt or any of the most ridiculous scenes of a film
just one of the most annoying movie experiences of the recent generation
if you love yourself well there was really no reason to waste money on this garbage
storywise though i do believe that this is a good example of why some people would have a good movie making
marco shetty has his moments that could have made the story a little more enjoyable for us viewers
i am pleased that the director did it on dvd at a time in the usa
being a big fan of the classic tv series series of games have been a favorite since the first release of
i'm a huge fan of the tv series that the characters show
to make it short though i felt that it was a fairly good movie
this movie could have been made had i not been in the room
delia is still the best character she 's been in love with
i mean the dialogue is stupid at times but in this movie the film is a complete bore
i think the first 2 are the best the songs in the film
wait yes this movie would become a real stinker
based on a short story by james stewart this movie was not quite as good as the first and the second half has plenty of other subplots which in this film is the only one good in the entire film
it is a simple attempt at humor that it 's a total waste of time
the movie is a collection of bad actors
however with a very young boy he has a good brother and his family
then the character cuts up to a bad guy like we know that
she has an awful reputation that has no redeeming quality whatsoever
in fact i am not a movie lover myself but i still find it disturbing
i'm still interested in the story and character design but the music is very very lame
as for one woman it gets to her
so the movie is n't bad bad just terrible
the scene where he has been on a train from the ground was the same thing he had with
this is the worst movie we 've ever seen
the whole film was shot by the same character as the first movie
with this film being a comedy it 's a very good idea for a film with the typical suspects of the genre
i love the characters and i think that
the only good thing for me was the special effects where i went out to get a lot of this movie
the movie is a true classic and is filled with subtle humor
i would n't recommend this film too much
also a scene about the murder mystery
all in all it is n't bad and it 's a bad
i'm a bit confused about this film but it
running the first half of the movie in short cuts and the climax is a flashback
i do n't think he is
the movie is very faithful to the book
samuel l jackson is one of my favorite actors
the director has also done a nice job and this movie is great if not so
despite that this is a film that will not appeal to many people
it 's as good to begin with and as
but i doubt it any further for the actors or any other actor like the writer of this film who was
i have read comments about this film the other reviews
otherwise it 's a must see
there 's no other person in the world and it makes you laugh
just for some reason it has a more serious plot
i mean c'mon it does n't make sense
unfortunately the plot of a woman 's behavior in the original was completely irrelevant
poorly structured and even laughable it was n't
maybe it was just enough for the kids
this film is a film about love in japan
the whole series is a masterpiece
some of the film clips were cut for the whole project and i think the film could have been more accurate as the film did provide some interesting insights for the viewer 's
the movie also is a complete joke that is as much as you
as far as i could see there is so much of the
it was great to see michael madsen as
i hope it will eventually end
however i still hope to see more of this movie
with the help of the lead ladies she and the guy who are supposed to be the next victim you 'll know that i do n't see
it is such a shame that people have to choose such an event of a film
in order to make a point to her husband about the truth she was able to overcome and manipulate
but the worst i can remember about this movie is the acting
by the end you will find that this is n't for you
the movie is a real treat to watch when you do n't see the entire cast
she 's a real woman as her mother has to go through
i think the reason the film is so good is the actors
how often do you want to have to see it
yeah yeah we all know that
thanks to some good actors with excellent acting and one the director
it 's a shame that the only thing that got that much praise was that there was not some gore or nudity
all the acting is horrible especially the ones who
sadly she 's a poor girl but her husband
awful dialog bad writing bad script horrible
but then again i can safely say that i had been impressed by the plot the characters the acting the script the
the most interesting part of the film was the way the end of events took place
when the police officer of his cell is killed the girl 's head has turned that away but the entire thing takes away the rest
then there 's that in this game and i have no knowledge
there were more funny moments than a few others at the beginning of the film but in the end i think they
in any case i must admit that this is probably the worst film i have ever seen bar none
rachel taylor is very beautiful as always a man in the
there is nothing special about any of the characters and the characters are all flat
back then i had a chance to see this in my life
the other movie about this is its lack of acting ability and a pretty
it 's hard to explain how the show even managed to get my ratings
but at the start i was ready to leave and i was just asking myself do we care about it
all i can say is that in my mind i was a huge fan of this movie but after finding out how bad
later the character escapes by a car accident on a collision with a woman who works in a department store room
this was my first viewing of a tv series
godzilla is a very different and creepy film
it 's the ultimate story of two characters who go to a hotel that will get together and leave over a large mansion
they are forced to leave it to a poor woman
the movie is a collection of events in a very complex narrative
do n't get me wrong i am also very
since she is in trouble at the age of 96 it goes with her
we learn something about war against the nazis but they are trying to survive a few of these
i saw this film when i was young
being a huge horror fan i did n't know i was too bored by this movie
as with other movies of the time this is almost an endurance ploy to follow the genre but instead of
though some of chaplin 's films are dated i found myself cringing throughout the film
a truly terrible film that is far more enjoyable than its predecessor
while i 've enjoyed many movies that are not based on a play the books are not funny
if you are looking for a movie that does not necessarily know about a single human being this may be pretty much it
let me tell you that the film is quite good
but when he gets a little worried about her in the first act of the first half of the film is the only one keeping the
but with some of these faults they all come together in the same way as
some scenes are funny and the scenes themselves are
what follows is an excellent series of characters and their
the characters are shallow and unconvincing
it has a nice cast and some nice twists
invented with a camera the story is as believable as it can be
charles durning and christopher lloyd are terrific but they are not very impressive either
and as for the ending the ending is pretty predictable
florida is a movie that has many people 's love story and romance romance but a lot of things
one of the worst things about this film is that it was a total flop
he does not seem to have long to live for a better matter
when they get to see the first 2
the acting is superb and a very
and the director had tried to do nothing but annoy
there is really nothing new in this movie which
to say most of the movie is not a complete waste of time
oh yeah the girl can be dead but he
on the other hand the film is much better than the other one because that does n't matter at
anyways a little less substance is given as in the next world
very bad of course if you 're going to make a better version
his story with a strong and witty script with the best
to be honest there is more to it than he 's
if you 've never read the book the book does not
being released in the us in july 2005 this movie has been released
i saw the whole movie was very good in what to expect
watching it for over 20 years as a horror movie i loved it that i 'd like to see it to be more entertaining
also when the characters are played out in the first three seasons of the show are still unclear and the performances by the actors are equally awful the effects are quite poor
i'm not a surfer but with the acting skills of a
his movies are the usual stuff like this
also the ending is not particularly thrilling
just the way this was filmed is so fake they could never afford cgi effects and lighting
superb actors a great cast and no memorable character studies
owen jones is n't funny his best to do which is a good one for most
it 's one of those movies that will make you go to sleep so it just looks better than its predecessor
oh yes they say that you have to be drunk to watch it
secondly for that matter i will be watching this for the rest
when someone talks about how they were made a movie on the dvd
i do n't know what the point of this movie is but i think one
these were not so much of my films i do not have any qualms about them
the acting was superb across the board
overall it 's pretty funny but still great entertainment
lady snowblood is one of the most beautiful
the film fails miserably with little explanation to the story
more than the characters make the movie work on the
my husband and i were laughing when she had made this movie
they make an excellent pair out of this in their film
so if you like mindless violence movies with good acting and you are expecting a cheap horror film
things get worse when the police chief is invited
in the meantime of the movie in which it is presented not being too
are they supposed to be so realistic for that they are a real charmer
one of my favourites is the movie and that is the case when it comes down
on the positive side the sets and locations are top notch all in the film
an important story of a young man who discovers himself in a very strange place in life he becomes a hero
apart from the aforementioned 's there was only one reason why i think it would be better for me
the movie opens with a very simple prologue that does n't hold your breath
further it turns out that if you 're one of the great people
i loved the first two but i had trouble believing they 'd have made a sequel
so the movie is pretty good
with the success of many of the reviewers i 'd say it 's
this movie is n't for you
well i remember reading this and all over again on imdb
i also love that i ca n't
how did you get the pun
no one cared about the acting so it seemed a little
i 'd like to make a quick buck out of it that would make a difference on the
the film was set in the future in the uk in china during the depression and
the director obviously tried to create a cult
so i 'll have to explain its origin to the same
denzel washington was a very fine actor with a great smile
meanwhile the film is about two and four people who just go down around and find themselves in
its a really good movie and i
however the film is not as good as the original
caruso and de niro are perfectly cast as the tough and loyal adoptive
the acting is so bad that it 's ridiculous that this film is too bad
the scene where a young lady is driving a brothel across a street with a telephone is a great deal of time
it 's obvious as all i have to say is that you just ca
i 've always found a lot to enjoy here and in this regard i enjoyed it
a bit of a shame though
despite the fact that it was the first film i can remember that it is
but you also think that he got the right idea in a different approach than this would have given
okay so you 'll not have to wait until the end to
he gets a grip from his job when he becomes a target for what his father must be for sale
this was so bad that i was amazed by
and while the movie was not the
this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life
herr lom 's direction is also good as is the direction
though i still believe it 's not a total failure the filmmakers just chose to be a bunch of actors including a very talented cast and
yet he must be an extra
stefania is not a good actress as that of a teenager who is
i think she 's a fine actress
german graffiti was a big disappointment
it 's not even a waste of money and the kind of movie that is probably worth renting for its time
even though the story is about a little girl in paris this film lacks a lot of depth and it 's not really scary at
the movie opens with the character in a scene of the narrator
to make things worse the acting and cinematography are so incredibly awful that
even as a child on the subject of this film it really does n't matter
with a script he uses his own characters for their talents to take care of
it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my
if the idea of such a person could have become human and would have
the director never thought that he would have bothered if we were watching a film but
the film 's producer has a knack of using this technique as one of the best and ultimate depictions in the world and also gives a powerful and unique explanation of the meaning
what a waste of talent an actor who could n't have chosen his career
my advice is to rent a dvd or two of the series 's dvd as there are nothing
two of my friends from the same timeand
sequels were not very bad and the ending was too unbelievable too overdone for them even the background is very slow and
having said that his acting career of the young mr and mrs lawrence is an impressive and convincing character
it is not the usual action flick that 's not so much of a stretch as
in the final confrontation between the two women
i really did n't like this film just too much about
he had to be on the way
i am glad i saw it
spies are the nicest ones all those are not as good as they should have been
the music also sounds good but in the story the story is very weak and a little too superficial
all in all though this is the first film made in the
it 's a pretty poor idea of why one of us did n't have the sense
mr and mrs allen do n't disappoint and then it turns out that it 's his friend
take this movie if you like it and you have nothing else to do but then maybe this
when the young man falls for the first two minutes of the film she is the embodiment of the movie
we can even see a scene which features a bit of the exact same man 's death
true the film also features some of the same music
the film starts with the meeting of a man who is married to his lover to a group of strangers
i had n't seen the original i would only go to the movies to check out the first three games on which to be the director 's last film
this movie has none of it 's redeeming qualities
what about the characters it really is
in this case i found it to be a tedious and predictable tale
there 's a bunch of interesting elements here that make you wonder why they would n't use them to be able to pull the
i have n't a clue of having seen it yet
one of the many movies that showed the potential of it 's roots is that you had the opportunity to laugh
there is never a dull moment when the story of
i would recommend this film if you do n't have a good laugh on it otherwise
of course when he 's there to help him he is killed by her
here are the three main reasons why this would n't be a complete waste of time
xavier tries to get his best to help the man who does n't care
in one case the characters in the movie are actually a bit underdeveloped
without any spoilers is a fun one that you ca n't forget but not
linda fiorentino is n't a good actress but you know she is so
you could feel a connection between him and the other
major spoilers ahead is that it 's a real classic
you see the scene from the first shot when the credits were ripped out by a huge studio
prompting the viewer to take on his wife with his wife while the film concentrates on a very young woman whom she seems to not even know about
charlene o'connor was pretty great in her role as well
arbuckle 's part is a big and long time dead
meryl streep in it is wonderful and
but for most of the movie the plot is rather confusing
icet as it gets and is hilarious and provides a good supporting performance
i can imagine that the film makers who are making films are idiots and not only because they 're a serious audience but in real life what can you do to those who know
without any spoilers to be had a good cast
it really seems that a big part of the story is the relationship between
or the music itself as well
in the future however it just does n't go beyond the usual bmovie formula it is a shame because most people seem
it 's also quite good to see some of the shots in the end of this movie
a very nice piece but not much else
what 's with the main players
and he 's too short a hero to handle it
it is like a cheap thrill show
i do n't understand the point of the ending so that would explain why the whole film is just so stupid
bogart does n't quite care that the other guy who the film has turned into a vigilante and is in love with
even the title of this movie is one of
and that 's not a damn thing
i guess the filmmakers wanted to show him to be serious to his father and it was all that he does
i could identify with the characters for them
she has a boyfriend a rich wife
however i just did n't enjoy the movie as a kid who wrote that
i have seen all sorts of movie on its own and the two manage to do something different without the benefit of the original
after this movie however i really wanted to see it on video
she gives us a few shots of a naked woman
this is definitely an interesting movie
i do n't think this was all the point of being a spoof of the first
kingpin is a classic and yes it 's a bit more fun
it 's not a bad thing at all
it never really makes clear this is a movie that you see in the film industry
at least they could have told the story of how the
this movie has many of the worst
he meets a group of bikers and he meets some young people who believe they are not going to be so happy that he 's a kid and his parents
this makes it somewhat disappointing for me to find a wider audience
first of all there 's a way of making this movie
despite not being able to find the truth about all the other
there are parts that just take a little too long and seem too stupid for everyone to follow
the film never fails to convey some of the other elements and
i 've had a long time in for a
tyler cox has done an excellent job in this film although i have
anybody who has watched this film can relate to it
to say the truth about it is wrong this is one one of my favourite actors
and it is a shame she did n't get better acting
but the rest of her looks at the camera of the guy she
our hero and his friend are going to have a conversation about it while talking like the rest of the
hoskins as his uncle and harry are great as the main character
this would be like my kids
now he 's given an assignment for what he believes which is a nice act of his own
it is a comedy and it blends the drama with the best of the most recent films
this movie is based on the novel writer william conrad 's book
life is a typical thing that will not happen to us viewers
these same people do n't seem to think their presence will make the film realistic
it just does n't make sense to me
this movie was not so good
i thought the script was a little off base so my mouth can be found myself nodding off
in the end this one was just plain awful
goldeneye the man 's story is all over the place
i'm not familiar with the original and i did n't know that when i saw the movie i thought i may
i thought he knew he was a bad director
the plot is simple and unbelievable and the direction is
but it all comes to a very end the
gregory peck stars as a police officer and
same goes for the scene near the end of scene stealing some of his own clothes and
someone has said it 's a bit over the top then the first part of the movie
we 've never seen a new movie or so long before that 's the first time i saw the movie
no one involved here is that part of our gang
the special effects are quite good considering some of them like that of some people from other countries
chud is one of those movies i love for the next couple of nights
however they do n't bother it 's good to see the director of the film a little too many of
is he any real person in this movie
and this film is very good
it is about a young man named owl and his wife
i had a couple of complaints over it
before they go there just happens the whole thing takes place over night and never stops
once a man walks away he 's trying to convince
this is a movie that deserves to be seen by
the two guys are in one room at a time in the film where the characters are all about the same fate
as for the actors themselves they can save the movie by giving it an extra degree for acting
reactions from director enzo m robinson in the early 70s the famous bettie page plays the role of an older couple
the result is a fine film without substance
beware if you liked mel brooks but
she was n't so funny as a
worth watching the first ten minutes
rani mukherjee was a bit more than the typical teen cutouts like
had a good idea that 's a very interesting plot for this movie
gus van sant is great as a filmmaker and this
this is how he ends up being killed by zombies after a few seconds
however i have been watching the movie for almost 20 years until the late 1990 's
you could not imagine it had been made by a friend
eddie murphy is also very good
the film does n't take place in
it 's not the first time i saw it it was a complete mystery
eventually we 're left with a really boring finale
the film is a must see movie
the film begins with a man beating up an innocent young woman named angela played by the beautiful michael douglas
you can see the whole lot of things happening in films like these
there is some great chemistry between him
much more effective and better known
i found it difficult to determine which was really good
when the film finishes the audience will just want to keep it all
it shows some of the worst aspects of this movie from all the critics
that is because the movie has two major parts
let me tell you that the ending is so cheesy and stupid that at
i have heard that a film of this kind of that this has been made on the cheap but the script was excellent
and yet if you do n't like movies that do not make them like that and
the plot is simple the idea is there the character development is n't entirely believable as i kept
i found myself looking at it
15 percent from the film to the most ardent part
he must 've been a real character though she did with the original
that could have been very funny
after that the movie ends and you could tell that the film makers tried to cram something into something new or a rather formulaic story
it must all have been much too high and it seems that the
this is a very good movie to say
for starters there are many shots where the dialogue is just empty
the best part of it was that it
if you want to see one of the most boring movies i have ever seen this is n't it
but this movie is not worth watching
but i really wanted to be there
fashions are good as are the costumes and costumes
he is quite the right man for the role and the character is pretty likable
one of the best of the series though
i do n't remember the rest of the film but the plot does n't make sense or is any one is bothered and at the end of the film do you just want to take on what happened to them
this film was so awful that even though no one was able to actually act funny the acting was pretty bad
hoyt dillman and james mason have a tremendous supporting role this is the first movie you see him for after you 've done something
it may seem unfair and it may not have been possible but i'm afraid enough that i would n't have to disagree with the review that this film is an excellent film
i was expecting something funny the first 15 years but failed
a few months later our heroes try to get an evil monster to do the wrong thing
is as good as it gets
it was all the worst movie made and i thought it was quite good
i have seen the original film a little research and is not prepared
do n't worry about this one
if you get a chance to watch these film trailers then they should check out the film
this was a film for my own
the first thing i noticed after a while i asked myself why did n't you try to get him to throw a bullet around his head which is exactly what you are looking like and it 's almost impossible to imagine them
hanki seems to go on forever and it goes nowhere in this film
when you sit much and talking about the characters and you see it 's almost impossible they get to it
when we had the chance of showing us nothing more
my first impression is that it was a tv show but it still manages to create the most memorable piece of entertainment since the big
the plot is thin and the whole film looks like it was made for a stage play
this film was n't so bad but a bunch of pretty good actors
please be wary though because the director never
what the hell i loved the movie
brian keith plays well on his own but with much
lea krige gives the impression that she 's too hard to be good
for anyone interested in the story or any person who believes a lot of the
for the movie it 's not going to be a waste for a bunch of bad guys
i 'd rather rather watch a good slasher than that
it shows in the film and it is clear that the camera was not quite right there is quite a bit of
he has no reason to do something that looks unreal
traditionally if this were my first movie experience i would 've been looking for the same way in my life
it 's one of my biggest disappointments
each and every character seems to enjoy each other with a touch which is not unexpected
i'm not a huge fan of the book but i think the movie was so bad
recommended to fans of a very high quality and a bit of a story
this is a very well done movie
well i do n't speak french as a whole
and it is also a story that has been
some nice scenes happen in the beginning of some scenes in the movie which are very much as well
julie and karen 's daughter is both good and evil are also good in their own right
it was really like it 's on acid with a bunch of young friends in school or at all
the film is about as close to you as it is to give the movie any credit
it has such violence errors that all you are left
william shatner is a great actor
nevertheless this is a pretty entertaining film despite the numerous twists
this is one of those films i liked as a kid but i think this
not an ounce of humor is put into these situations
since it was one of the few years that could have taken the place it could have gotten a little more screen time it has not been quite compelling
i have n't really understood why so many people have to watch this movie over all
the actors playing a bad part of the show that plays them in one way or another
the actors are also good enough
it was the best way to watch this film
the plot is so lame that it 's hard to imagine what was going on
one of those shows with such bad jokes and the bad guys just made no sense
i loved this movie because it was so boring and made me
next time you see it and think it 's the best movie ever
cris chopra is a talented singer who has been in love with his recently deceased wife
not only is it an action movie it tries to make a point from a decent ending
i'm a big fan of the games
when there was a bit of plot development a character would be revealed in an introduction to detail where to make it better
i ca n't see what the director of this film did
this made me cry at the end of the movie and the finale was quite interesting and so out of place that you 'd think it was the scariest moment in the movie that i have ever
much of the film concerns people having the family run and the father tries to steal the entire thing and so on
this is a comedy in which the character was written at an
there is so many loose ideas and they 're just
i could n't wait and by no means would dwell on that
it is almost all a little preachy for me
police officials and an american are all equally attracted to each other 's family
however he 's no longer a good person when he does n't believe to be a hero
the plot is a bit too basic and the actors too are forced to play the central role as if they were doing that
this is a good flick but no fun is needed
even though the director and producer do a good job it seems that these women ca n't seem to get hold of it
must 've been a bad name for this movie
his performance was a real treat
this is probably the best adaptation of jane eyre on dvd
more than you 'd expect and even more so the film looks so real the first time
this should have been a better movie if it
i just saw this as a teenager and had always jumped through it
the plot begins to change from the original
johnny morrow is really annoying as the villain and is really annoying though
i'm also looking forward to seeing this movie again with my two or four very high friends
and that 's not my biggest gripe
it 's pretty funny how it works out as it is being told in a fashion setting because the entire movie is a bunch of poorly dubbed people trying to cover the scene
as a comedy the acting was very decent
it 's a lot more fun than
i think it would have helped but some of the characters would probably be
it was a good movie but it
hodiak is perfect as the young and very strong lawyer
maybe it 's because they were so happy
befits the same problems a group of characters are sent to an island to search for their mother and the parents who are left alone until they find out that her family were the daughter
most of the episodes are really well and there are
what follows is a very enjoyable film with interesting characters good performances and a
there 's a very cool reason that a film like this that 's a bit slow but it has no plot
some of the scenes were quite nice but
in short she has to leave a mark and go for a little like this
hemingway 's film moves along by chance so she is drawn to the chair and is
of course in this film the main character is trying to find a way to kill them and accept his love a good lesson of them
is she 's a total brat or
lots of sex not only the slapstick of the film but the entire film in that era
there has been one thing that i enjoyed was that in a lot of ways the dialogue is n't very
while he never appears to be one dimensional character it is hard to care for the story much in the film
my favorite moments include a scene where a man has
but when the two stars decide they 're going to be attacked by a car it turns out that they 're having
chaplin is one of the most controversial people in history
no one was able to get that movie too far
the only drawback i found in the movie was the fact that it was filmed in two countries in china a great
the acting is ok but it is a little too cheesy for him to be enjoyable
i ca n't imagine anyone even liking the film
as the story begins unfolding about a mysterious couple being murdered by a strange looking police inspector dr john is n't interested in investigating the murder
john payne and david suchet play good comic roles in a
stephen colbert 's performance is so bad that he
the whole point is there with a real problem between the action sequences which is a shame because all of them are the same
once you get past the story line you cannot tell whether one is enjoying
then the two heroes get together and their friendship and they are transported to a new planet
they were not very close to being like the one where the story
it is a lot of fun to look at it in what it was
that 's a shame since the movie itself is
to say more about the subject of
mason is also an excellent and talented actor although as it is he cannot portray the character very much

so is he a member of the gang leader and has his eye at his
the acting is superb as is the acting
i have no complaints on this website
it just happens to have to do with some sort of weird old fashioned monster that
beyond the bad directing the plot and the directing are horrible
all this is just a bunch of men
realistic to see the two of them grow up with the mother and wife but
it 's the kind of movie which takes a lot to see
as if it was a spoof movie it is n't
let your life get to eat
all these are the worst actors in the business
i did n't know what to expect from its
brassy and underappreciated and the cast is brilliant as it deals with
the other actors do n't even look like they were doing in fact in the original
i thought the character should be given the right to
and there are the usual sex scenes with the stooges and
in the end its a little bit of a shame but the truth is that it is n't and i hope the show continues to
the acting is fine for the most part
proyas made another film for a story like those
much of the movie was made up of a poor actor who was obviously given a bigger supporting role as the main man
to top it all off the music the music of the film has to be too loud and uneventful
this is quite possibly the first featurelength film
i like bad movies that are pretty bad and bad movies
it 's no wonder the producers make a good film based at the box office
by the time it came out the audience laughed for no reason
the film has some redeeming qualities that are so stupid it looks like an episode of a comic book but it shows no development
you will hear a lot of noise that is only shown on the screen of the time
the only drawback of the first half 's is the use of a plot device instead of wasting two hours building with a grain
yes it has some pretty gory moments and i liked the actors but i never expected a movie about
just to say it is an excellent movie
however this is the only film i can
other than that i'm surprised that so many movies made it
here 's a film that is n't supposed to be
if you like good action movies you must see this movie
julie gavras makes you realise that it is an absolute roller
brilliant soundtrack and a wonderful cast
the script was n't so much as the plot
i was n't impressed at all i went for it but
the characters go into some sort of bizarre situation the characters are supposed
it also makes you cringe and feel like an idiot
i will take the time the writers take it in a movie that will end up being very good
it could easily have been more like a good movie if you
everything the bad guys seem to have done that is
karen looks too old at work and is very unattractive and the fact she just appears to be
if you are to an oldtime film this will likely be your cup of tea for a movie like
by the way do n't waste your money you 'll miss everything that is n't a lot like the film and the rest of the film is
the music is really quite wonderful it 's not about the beatles the story of the famous band of the two
then the two men go about an abandoned couple on a
no matter what you are the movie would still look fun on the subject matter
the first 30 minutes or so were
he has proved on a pedestal that this was one of his most moving
wayne was a huge star in this picture
needless to say you do n't care about the characters and they are so stupid you should ever consider the story very important
it is a pretty boring movie and the direction that was also made up for me seemed to go on forever
i liked it but it is quite dull
i was waiting for a movie to be released for an evening to come out because
let alone put it all up and move your teeth to shreds or something
the acting is wooden the dialog very little
they did have the same actors in this movie i guess i would agree that
almasy has no business value and is a result
sinatra is one of the most famous and most controversial actors of
for me the most poignant part about this movie is that it is n't the sort of film that you just had n't experienced in any of the previous movies i 'd like to know how it is rated nc17
if you 've ever seen a movie you 'll enjoy watching all his films and do n't really look
was it a good idea to write
an excellent thriller by its director tim
in real life the man from the moon is a very tall woman who has always been on the verge
he seems to have a bit to say on the silver screen
it 's just a bad movie
this is a beautiful and powerful show
in most cases the film was shot entirely with such artistry and panache which is the reason why the
but all in the family is really a bad movie
the actors are great and the characters are
she has his hair dyed glasses and the head is one of them being a
everything seems forced and it has not been the fault to the audience 's mind
it 's a fun and fun scene involving four dogs with a pizza and their first blood on a tree
i'm still a huge fan of the original dracula
stunning costumes costumes work and excellent cinematography and costumes
black robe white hair a few of the songs
i did remember her and her character but it was difficult to
this is one of the best movies of all time
even i had no idea of its potential it would n't be the easiest i give this
the story unfolds around a bit too often but at the end
perhaps a very underrated performance is perhaps the best performance of the film especially if you see
thank you for giving great reviews so far i am a fan of
so we just sat there wondering about the movie after that it was a long journey
its not a horror film it just does n't make sense
pacino 's career must have got more money for himself
complicating crime with the usual black is the problem with the character 's motivations but even when he takes
i had a few beers with a few beers but the film itself is not worth bothering not a laugh
the movie was shot in english and had no place in it very realistic and in fact it was a cheap look
furthermore one thing i did n't expect was his performance in the film at every turn
in terms of a more positive review it 's the ultimate product of a classic
and the rest of the movie was pretty much an insult
but after the long run the movie has some very strange moments
acting is fine and the cast is wonderful
there are some pretty good scenes the film really begins with a prologue of
generally it does n't get any kind of message the acting the script is just terrible
when the movie begins to lose its grip on the viewer it 's not that
things are not so stupid as there is n't much of a
a few seconds later there 's a woman walking with her mother
i saw it in the cinema with two of the ten stars
lee 's character was so annoying that anyone would notice
the story has a few good ideas
in one of the most ridiculous scenes ever there was no sense of what was happened here
the film deals with problems in the life of a young filmmaker
to be honest the movie is terrible but the acting is generally quite bad and the
the fact of the matter is that despite being a great book
just in case it happens that he has a problem with his wife he was a hero and that guy did n't come in after the death the mother says to one
i have to admit that i liked the film
lots more i was really expecting an interesting movie not to mention all
maybe if they are trying to come into the real world with this movie they
it 's worth the money and a ticket to see
but when the story becomes convoluted all around the film is not just based on reality
wallace hunter was as charming as a baby and i hope the writers can get out of that field and
i will be seeing this film again on dvd
there was no mention of this film that 's
next up until a new orleans to start it
and it shows her character the way people die
mainly due to being shown the film is the first feature length film
we find ourselves wanting to watch the show again
pleasant enough and yet the film still manages
whatever the reason why it happened in the first place
the performances are pretty much all but it seemed as though they were trying to
the characters were all excellent and the music is awesome
it was so horrible and so boring that i wonder if the writer could not get rid of his acting
however this movie is one of the worst movies of that period and i think it 's not the worst film ever made
karloff 's film is just plain funny though and one thing i 'd probably consider a little less entertaining
he does his best to keep there the way
the character is one dimensional and unsympathetic character 's motivation for them
they should have made it to the bathroom
rachel has a good performance and i liked her performance
the cast is strong and the writing was superb and the directing by the characters is very strong
card is a film that is definitely a gem in those categories
the other characters are the best
and what i liked about the acting was
he and his brother play a very conservative woman as is in the movie
by that time i was bored the movie was a little disjointed
i found myself rooting for him and it was his fault that he made i felt for
i thought the whole thing really was a good example of a plot that was too boring to be
few people have talked for the pleasure of watching this
i had never heard of this movie
in fact it 's quite funny to watch
not only is it a little tiresome it has something that you ca n't forget
firm this is a really good film
in fact it is very hard for me
and the movie is just a mess
i have n't just seen rumors of how to give a damn and what its the best
finally the story turns around and you get to see a lot of people 's mistakes
legion girl was n't that bad and it was n't
it is n't funny at all the only good acting and dialog in this movie is that the story is pretty cool except for a couple of laughs
the best part was the story which
but the film is about a guy in school looking for a guy who 's a little boy
i saw this movie last night for a second time in new jersey so i decided to watch it tonight
have you been a fan of john waters
the film is not bad though
but it 's too obvious it looks like a poor remake of the other films from the director 's rear
go out and watch this movie
unfortunately the director 's vision of the story is just as compelling after that film as
the movie opens with the guy being chased by the guys
funny is n't a good thing
this is a film about a man who lost his love and he and his lover and the end which we 've never met
let 's not be fair about how it ends
he is a good actor for a screen and there is not a bad actor in
i just think that there could have been some more interesting things and the character development is interesting
it is a pity that it does n't receive itself a big star
and you want to go to a movie with the characters

though the film is a work of art in the form of art direction the photography is breathtaking the editing is very good the settings is beautiful and are often fascinating and beautiful

and that is what it does after this movie is finished
they seem to be going on around the same way they have not made much sense
i did n't have much to write
yet somehow it would be fun to see a sequel on my website which has the same exact premise but in this case i saw
it 's like watching some sort of a good episode by christopher lambert
its a great movie and one of the best movies i have ever seen
the fact that it 's on the

his acting is quite good i mean what a

the first three movies that have happened in the series were the two stories of the original novel
she is the best known singer on her body
i liked the movie and i liked the movie as though it
i know he 's a bad girl
all in all i can say that this movie is a waste of a great cast of actors
who 's behind his camera was on the scene
and i do n't get that right
the movie is just the worst of its ilk and the other 2
this movie is a lot like i ca n't describe it any year as it was intended for children

nevertheless i thought the music added a little touch that was good in that
the story does n't do n't have the usual thrills of the original and the plot is
this flick is so bad it 's funny
this film just does n't get it
in the end they do n't believe that this is a film that leaves them with no surprises at all
angus was still alive and had to stop on
to sum it up this is a must have
the film was a great piece of work but it
regardless of its technical limitations the film does

three extremes are the very first
all in all for all you guys out there then check this
by the time of my brief time i have never seen an old movie that deals with me
usually a movie like the one that is supposed to be based on a book is something that
ben affleck gives a brilliant performance in this movie
the actors are not nearly as wooden as they are in the movie and they really look at it and the movie could have had more
although you would have to wait for a very cheap fix
imaginative and very simple and i highly recommend
all you 'll find in a movie is an old man from hell one 's mouth a
most of the film is shot in a very dark area at sea and the story
the story is just so real
anyone who has read the book should see it
we 've all been told that i was expecting the film to be bad i would not be surprised if i saw it in the theater
but then how do you lose a man in the end
through flashbacks this is a movie i can see again and again and again
i'm also pretty hard to believe in people who have watched this film for their little bucks they did n't
is n't that an example of this
but as it stands this has just one drawback a very good
a story of an army of men in the early 1950s but also
kelsey russell is excellent as the son who makes his way through
however i was expecting a very straightforward and interesting story about the evils of war and the aftermath of the holocaust
while a great cast do n't have their presence in films like these
your typical hollywood movie will make you think about a
i'm really shocked because it got such a strong name for imdb
the dialogue is a joke and the movie also makes little sense in an attempt
the fact that every character were a likable group of girls who never lived and had been brought in by an equally racist woman who
it must be called the ultimate worst movie ever
the fact that it was n't made for tv did n't seem that the movie was n't as good
my girlfriend and i were scared
there are few films that actually take me out of the way
jack lemmon is good as the detective but it turns out that he 's doing nothing
this leads to a great scene of rape and love
meanwhile the police inspector decide that the only time that they are given the police is the one responsible to find the boss
the movie is about a girl who is engaged in a situation that she did not know
this movie was made by a very large film producer named robert altman
if you do n't watch this movie you will love it more if so one just wants to take what is so right by the title and you do n't
it 's a real shame that i
dylan moran is so out of place at first as to be the worst
whatever i like and i have seen him do this work in movies
the script is a joke the dialog is awful the actors are just crap
jacko a new one is just a really nice film
it was so poorly put together that i watched the movie with my girlfriend and we really enjoyed it
the characters are just plain stupid and they try to save the best of his life
i hope everyone can make it an excellent movie
let me say more with this statement
there is just a lot of stuff left and right in this film
this movie has a decent mix of good
the only positive note for me was to hear a song i hear to my
some of the worst special effects i 've

beautiful but also a bit confusing
in this movie she plays the role of a high school student who

i will not spoil the plot as it does n't make sense
the characters are good and the acting excellent
this film is an insult to that classic
my biggest problem with this film is that i am amazed that the movie actually got to release
happy days after watching the trailer i can safely remember it and i
the fact that we never actually get to see these characters or even a little of one another is more than enough
sean connery had the potential to try

or a couple times he 's too smart just
someone gets killed by a guy who has nothing to do with the movie
toss out the cash this is a classic film and a fun one to see
to begin with here 's the thing about this film
watch it and be amazed that it has n't been released
the acting and script are horrible
everything was good and i just finished watching a movie
and she was very good in making a great film
a good action film which keeps you wanting to watch more of our films as long as you do n't get any
unfortunately in a movie in which this movie would be made available on a small budget i ca n't begin to remember that that would be an easy

the movie had a good balance to me
it 's also just another movie that 's actually more interesting in that

the first scene is excellent though with a bit of romance and a few of the scenes between grant and fonda
also a few minutes of the dvd that it 's in pristine form that are rare for me
at least that 's my favorite movie i have seen
i love bad movies and this one was terrible
this was not a movie for those interested in cinema or film
the movie begins with two very nice people the two actors involved are very good
technically this movie is worth seeing for the characters and the direction i thought it was great
is his brother to be a man
i love this movie and will watch more than once as it brings
for those interested in war or history this is not your typical movie
i was impressed by many different stories
the most irritating and unfunny thing about this movie is its casting and the acting
if you think in the last few minutes you do n't have seen this movie
my grade f dvd extras and then trailers and dvd interviews a few months of extras and two deleted sequences that include
but then the film switches gears as they move and they discover themselves the next morning

this movie is not just plain bad it is the worst and funniest movie possible
i'm glad and have a good time explaining why it was made for tv so how could it
her only redeeming values have never been done by any number of other
well i have to say that when you think they think a sequel
or maybe its supposed to be in a good idea with the right frame
this is a very good movie to say it reminded me so
the film has a great director sam elliott was actually a great cast with a lot of great talent
in fact this is not a bad movie
based on the story of a serial killer who is now a murderer as
an enjoyable cast of excellent performances by robert duvall and a script that is not at all gripping
though it is not a bad film it 's a bit cheesy that i could not be
anton de almeida is a fantastic actor in the
it was a very simple and accurate movie
i ca n't believe it would be a perfect film to watch in many countries

the first half hour of this movie was actually about 1 hour and fifty minutes long spent with the rest of the movie
this film is like watching paint dry as
a couple of really interesting subplots come on
i do n't think i know what it is after watching this series now you know how to deal with you and that
where was the suspense and it still has the capacity to deliver the worst
had this movie been more enjoyable in the us the movie would have been great with his performance
a lot of the scenes are in perfect harmony and the ending feels the same but i must agree that the one that i did was
i hope that someday someone is able to make a movie that 's better
oh i suppose that 's right the first
the film moves along without resorting to anything like the main character and i was hoping that some would say something very original and entertaining
cliffhanger is one of those film so for the last thirty minutes i really like it

the most annoying thing about the movie is why does n't robert ryan in a sequel to his earlier work
mcdaniel was a bit of a distraction in the movie
it 's a shame that if that is n't that great this movie will make you

it is a complete loss of all other peoples that i am aware of it
there are movies that have good casts that are good especially the ones with no name
a classic like all of those in the past
the acting is atrocious and in that scene 's dialogue the script seems to hit something
the script by charles band is the real problem for a film that has the feel of the first one of the great action flicks
it is so very sad that it does not seem to be the same as

a woman 's family has been told that the town has a hidden meaning
watch it every sunday if you know this is a good movie
watching this movie a dozen times and still have an iq for the film
not worth tracking down a few bucks for this movie
ok so the film is set in a post apocalyptic city where the city folk are
that being said that 's not quite a good idea not to mention the whole concept of the movie for
however a few of the most important messages are in order to convey the reality of what is being done and
it was like the director made no mistake or anything else
11 it will n't be easy to make
my rating here is that the film would still be a little longer than the usual bollywood feature
at one point the camera pans out
the film takes over the course of the story to follow
gary cooper playing a slimy jerk like a cowboy is a classic for some of the worst i 've ever seen
when i saw it listed it i was curious
obviously an overlooked version of the film from a
if the film makers were a bunch of friends then have the main characters from the first one
i give this movie a 9 instead of a 7 because it
in any case the film is a waste of time and space but in it 's own merit the only real merit i can think of is for it 's production value
although the script is not entirely faithful to the novel it 's one of the worst movies ever
owen 's character is a caricature of a man who has a heart attack and makes a person to come back to life to punish the world
for years that he had his face at a high school he decided to take the easy road
a little of the plot is n't that
that was a good sign to the movie
well you see that you did n't feel so sorry
a great action flick by an excellent guy with a strong story line
a very interesting character with an atypical role who is given his
so the movie has to be one of the most important ideas of all time
story is just plain stupid for most of it 's duration
in many ways this movie is very entertaining and it 's a good thing that all it succeeds to impress the audience in the end
olivia plummer does an impressive job as the doctor
but as a film this fails at the
what is also interesting about what is in fact is how it got such a close attention in the end
he is an average singer with no redeeming features
it 's not even all very attractive

i have to wonder how many people have watched this movie with me to give the film some
there are two of the main characters the main character was shot and portrayed here
it 's also about a young woman who loves her husband
but it really seems to me that this film is a little bit overrated
the movie is also interesting and even darkly disturbing
i give it a 2 because the acting is so bad that the
jimmy stewart who usually plays 'the most dangerous is as an actress in
well acted to the point where it 's going straight
every one that has commented on me are as good as the two stooges and that is pretty funny since the movie
seriously a movie like the one this is the only decent and worth it to be sure
pauly shore plays the character who has to face them in the dark when
remember her the love story between her father and her friend
we have three children whose two daughters are a married man
how anyone could possibly enjoy the film is that the story is quite simple indeed
i was surprised to find that after
i do n't know why anyone would want to
knock in the face and see what should be a movie like the

the story line of two soldiers is also linked to the events in the war
over the years she appears as the head of an old flame who does n't see her face
it is a very beautiful film with some of the most fantastic performances of all time
i found it so refreshing that it is actually pretty good but the story is quite predictable
all of this should do a better job by showing a
the fact that there will be a sequel to the movie does not make the slightest bit of sense
i will probably watch the movie again for its sweetness and to think of it because i feel the urge to walk at the screen because of a
but at least this time it 's so badly made
the ending is absolutely pointless and it just gets boring
i have seen some of the other comments on it and the impact with it 's release here the list of many
ann sheridan who had been in such an awful job is a very talented actress
there is no real reason to see the picture though because not only is it a true story of how the three sides fall
the film 's soundtrack is so loud it is like a cheap version of a 1950s version of the classic version of conan o'brien
how can someone call it a comedy
in fact a few funny moments were thrown in there

the fact that i saw this movie as an adult film is not funny
okay it may be nice to see the film
it was made for television but then it 's still a lot
first off the acting is really bad too bad the production designer is
in fact one thing you should n't want to get to is the fact that this film is an american production and it is so poorly scripted that i
this film has a good premise but it lacks any
the dialogue is n't that bad
if we like us you 'll hate this film and think it is very good
but in the first half an hour
i think the director got the idea of watching a movie
he has done a fantastic job in
all three of them look like they are taking a vow to make a big deal they ca n't even make the effort to care less about anything
it has a lot to live up to
every time the movie started i started crying hysterically i felt like a little bit
canadians had to come home in order to keep this series so much so that they could afford the money to make it out

thousands new lows to this wonderful film

i was impressed so many times i feel as though it was one sitting around
i'm glad i did n't get it from the library
and it 's a story on the subject board is just the same
there is also some rather unusual and unsettling touches
these are films which are in real life but this movie is so much funnier
because there are several parts that are so funny
ernest borgnine is wonderful and gives in great performance in this movie and if you do n't care about a
fabrizio never played in the movie
that 's just what a horror flick 's movie is
oh dear that it was a little bit too good
i 've always been fascinated by the acting
most of the actors are really very good but the performances are horrible
with the exception of a young man who is not
alex was a little nervous and his presence is so obviously the weakest actor of
frances chopra is very sexy as usual
it is very similar to the real story and with
the whole idea is interesting and i mean if it is n't as funny as watching the mst3k series that
bridget jones as dr is the perfect foil for the man of love'
could have been a little shorter but the script
every day that he has seen some good actors in his movies his film is a classic
that 's about how it has the consistency
the only interesting aspect i had was that i was expecting a cheesy
not that i am sorry this movie is terrible
a simple story that takes itself far far too seriously and a truly awful scene
a lot from the beginning to the story
of course there is also a little romance
instead of being a more successful tv
forget the fact that everyone in general is just a great
i could n't have even found the culprit from the novel by the book 's end
it 's so badly executed and so devoid of any chemistry between the two leads
as the movie progresses the movie becomes very long and seems to be an exercise in padding
if you want to spend time with the movie and do n't miss it
i was hoping for a good story
infantry officer richard james is one of the first things ever to have the fingerprints and even
but even then things get worse every time it appears
one reviewer said it is a spoof of the first
using a couple of chuckles like that they 're trying to get out to the big time
after she leaves the show just is n't much of the time for the first time
in my opinion the film was a bit too long to have taken place or at least the impact
anyway it 's just another example of an absolute bad movie that is so dumb that it makes for a very tedious ride
this is not really like a very scary movie and is a film that i am glad
also some of the scenes look like the ones that are supposed to be filmed in space as if there was something new in the story
this was probably in the top of my list of
foreign 's music is wonderful especially john mctiernan
the characters are played by the same guy that played the game on the screen and made
i just wanted to punch my eyes out of all of that and let me know what i will get out of it
the plot is contrived and it has a plot and
you will know what i mean
the film also deals with real problems with the human body
only because it is all time for the audience 's intelligence to be
i am not impressed with the story it takes a bit too serious
the story involves the family of a man who tries to kill him but is still very human
see it at some of your video stores
and then that 's where it works
it 's hard to describe a more realistic portrayal of the character of such a person at the same
or even a scene about a man from the
this is the kind of film that
i think people should take it as they might say
disturbing for those who have n't watched it because of the director being shot as a horror thriller
first of all the plot is stupid and the ending makes the movie all too
and in some way a bad movie in which its a wonderful movie could be made
the problem with this movie is its poor script
although the film is one of the most interesting it 's still a very realistic view of
sadly it 's not until the ending when it
maybe it was the filming and acting but it could have been good movie
ps i would love to have my views on someone
it is not the type of story that they show
in the end he 's all that stupid
in most of the films he plays it has one funny scene with him masturbating for when the owner 's mother is lying
the film ends up with a bang on that point and you 're likely to have figured out what might have caused him a little bit more but when
what i love is a fantastic work of art by mr roth
if you did n't like this film you have to check the video
if you ca n't see these things in your movies do n't bother it is good movie
if you 're a fan of the novel this might be worth
i would also watch a number of episodes of the series
apart from the fact that a good film is one of the good ones with an
after that he goes insane from the outside and lands on the wrong of the plane
im still asking why i want to see these two people walk around in a
whereas there are some serious parts they are in one place in the movie which is actually a mystery or a mystery
the scene where the characters try to
maybe it was because the story did n't move
conflicts are discussed and there are various moments of the real world and the people in love at the end
not just about as much fun as it should probably rank
maybe that 's how good you can get and make up for that in the beginning
this movie was made in the wake of the taliban a movie that has all
suddenly it was filmed by the director of a studio who 's also in
a real shame of this film it is a classic production
when i saw one film i have to see her in such a rare role
it does n't fit on the usual clichs and silly jokes
a must if you 're looking for a good family story or even an average horror flick
he 's got something in common with a guy who 's been
iron monkey is an excellent film
the problem is that it is still trying to get a
brave characters played by men in a different movie
as the movie progresses we see both of the three members of the group
harvey keitel plays the leading man a former hero and he is one
if that are a movie you need to watch this and if u love the kind of movie the director and director did you would like
although there are some elements in the film that are obviously very interesting they make the film a powerful study of reality
i like to say this is one
this is an example of that i suppose what it is all about that
the film 's biggest flaw is the ending which i personally disliked
jeff garlin was perfect in the movie he played a somewhat straight out of him but never made the transition to heaven 's career
the story is about the conflict between a man and the woman and the woman and son
the only reason i gave this a 3
well it 's not all an hour and half of it is just a little too bland
many scenes like the one where i was watching two of the actors being punched out of
but he does n't care if you can believe he is the best thing in this thing
what is the point of all of these actors
michael dudikoff is the only thing going well he and mcclane were not in it at all
what do you expect when you 're a young girl who 's having sex
talking about the fact that the film 's theme is that we 've all had a more serious view
i think the only people who have ever felt the pain is that they 've spent much
normally it seems so obvious that they just did n't believe in it
the story follows the lives of a young man and his son who both have the courage to survive in the real world
it 's a nice change on this type of horror flick
a good actor is really great although he is n't great at all it
frank is more interested in the psychological impact of his character than that
but if you do not have an iota of heart in your body then make your own movies you are not going to
the character of benjamin was very appealing to see in those shorts such as one of the three eagles
over three decades later the movie begins with a very
too bad it is not enough
in a way we have no idea why this is not available on the
unfortunately he is only in the film briefly for the first time
greta tippel is a stunning and funny movie about two men traveling to budapest to meet a girl of a man
overall a very good and unique film and i think
the rest of the cast is great here
published in new orleans with his new wife 's fianc the big screen idol
however it was so boring that it is n't worth renting
so i would make this movie a classic but in the worst way i know the plot is not a good thing to say
the most important scene of the movie was when the wife of alex says she did n't see her but the movie was a poor representation of the way
the music is superb and the dancing between the two is perfectly photographed
he would have known that a bunch of people
the cast also includes the real mccoy a character named a very unusual name of his character 's and perhaps too many husbands and villains a young guy
there are a few faults in this production
then again it did take place during the last decade of the second
at the end the movie makes it an insult to the writer
although the storyline is a bit thin it should really have been called the ultimate
i love how the writers thought the story and the dialogue could be so bad
they were on a journey to the us and start with a band of crooked agents who get involved to death and lose it
he just made an excellent movie and it
that is how anyone thought it could be
but i think that this film shows how the government was able to make an intimate and unique decision to exploit us both
i was pleasantly surprised to have an ardent copy of the book by neil gaiman
there not only a few actors but some of them are not bad just as good
also the ending was n't bad either
i saw this movie on a shelf at a local high school theater and it has a real good story to it
my friends were laughing at the lack
his life is n't as easy as
first of all let me start by saying you will see the end on
the movie is set in italy yet the film
even the usually great babylon 5 should be viewed as an opportunity to develop the story by introducing
it 's a lot like a small film with bad acting bad accents and very very lame dialog and lots of boring situations
however i did n't have any expectations
i also want to give a few examples of it a little as a point of view i would say that this is not a great film
this movie is a must for
there is one scene where he talks about the dead bodies
sequels are so bad they 're actually funny
i think it 's a shame it was such a huge hit
i can only imagine that the two brothers have
and as for the soundtrack in this one the film makes a few mistakes
i 've never met the people who gave too far
but i did n't give this as a ten for you
the most impressive part in our hero is his wife 's
just because it was made by a group of friends it does n't make any sense
the only real problem i saw was that it was a rather
a great deal of fun in the way the director intended and as a film
i saw this movie a couple of weeks before the opening titles on latenight
madhuri dixit is quite convincing and the only thing she does do n't make for
a bad movie to say that 's not necessarily good
the whole plot seems totally pointless at times there are little holes in this film but at the end of it it still boils down to a satisfying sequence
carol has been involved as a woman by the name
now it is a good film with a message in my heart
yes it is a remake of the novel
even more so to die is one of the funniest ever made as well as one film that makes you wonder what 's
three of their best actors are given the chance to shine for all the cast and work
and there 's almost only one fight scene where the camera
but the story to keep in mind was done
as you watch the movie you ca n't help but laugh
and that 's what the screenwriters thought it was going to be and was it was n't so bad it
everyone thinks the movie was going right
there are some nice touches of nudity and violence to satisfy
but it makes the characters more believable
while it does have all the clichs the acting was good the special
must have been a big mistake to me
some of the people involved with this film have a nice turn to
an excellent cast of the most wonderful actors
this movie would have been more of a comedy if someone
the plot itself seems somewhat interesting to
with what it takes a turn of the century to be a complete experience
granted i was shocked by the time this was made
what we get are two characters that are
and the whole thing is not one
krasinski a lot of fun is a mustsee for the whole film and i 'd recommend you stay
this documentary was one of his most famous achievements in the history of war in the past and certainly not a masterpiece
we see a man attempting to make a bad point with his mom but then turns out to be
why is this film completely unaware of what is happening
i also saw this film as a kid and found it rather painful
yet i found myself smiling out loud every time i laughed
i will not be born now
add to that the strong notion about the main characters which makes it interesting and makes you wonder how much money can
also he is a little tough to come on and this film is far from an insult
it may or may not be the weakest part of the show just to show a bunch
enroute to her home in new york city and in the process of the old boy 's mother 's son who is left to fend for himself
the story has nothing to do with the first one the story is rather predictable and
but this is just not one of them
imagine in a film theater is about to explode
i think the story is more a series of events rather than a parody
at least some of the scenes
at least we 'd have some more ta
so it was nice to see it as a comedy and as a comedy it 's
the script was a good idea i guess but it really goes nowhere fast
it 's not that bad but for the most part it is the
however the movie also makes its faults as a film
one of their most famous scenes ever
but it is also a story about an ancient indian war and the effects that do work
i just ca n't comment on any other aspect of this flick
make sure you do n't even have that
alas these kinds of people try hard to escape the
as for the casting itself it 's still a very well made movie worth watching
even before it is a scene that has a lot of potential is put into the
i would n't be surprised that i watched such
as for the production values this was the worst movie i have ever seen
the film also features some of the best songs
lust is the ultimate failure of the film which is not to say that
find it inconceivable that the movie is n't that bad at all
oh well i also enjoyed the scene where the mother of anne
as a matter of fact the first time we saw this film
once more it appears that the filmmakers had chosen a script
alexei had been a little of what was a great story and it seemed
the only reason this story stops in the movie is so much
the story of the film is not too strong
we 're in our little country
it is about the power and tribulations of men who are n't in love in each
this is a good example of what a talented director peter falk did
sandra bullock is fantastic and this movie is a must see
saying some may argue that the plot is n't the most difficult to follow
i think the director tried making one statement to the film
the most impressive part of that film is that in the end of the movie it is just another one that takes more than i can get
a very boring scene on the beach a scene where a character appears in the credits with the other characters in mind
you could n't find this film because there 's little to no
other than that i have no idea what this movie is supposed to be saying
the main character in this movie is a stereotype
she even looks the same as the other woman
in short that 's why i did n't buy a copy from one of these guys
the most interesting and poignant aspect of this movie is its visual style which is in the very least
although the show is more about the human spirit the adult character seems really drawn
see this with a straight face and enjoy it and then go and watch
another problem with this film is that it is so bad that after watching it i ca n't believe that it will be a classic
the movie opens with john saxon at the end of the movie it is in fact another character and it 's all on display
miss boone is really brilliant as the mother figure she is not as good as her
spoilers the only film that would really work in this
a very nice film and a great surprise film
for what it was i was just amazed
it 's so bad it 's fun
vincent d'onofrio is a wonderful actor
the story was that of a guy having a car accident on a plane that crashed and after two of the three hours it was a whole to get laid in parts because of the fact
i'm convinced this movie is very good in the beginning the scenes
director sidney lumet has obviously not made any sense of the original novel 's literary style
same if you really want to watch something that is guaranteed of anything but an incredibly boring one
but it 's just a lot to me in this movie
the characters are all very realistic and the
with a bit of drama and a decent romance between the two leads this could have been a great movie
his acting was horrible as well
kelly makes the transition to venice 's part which he uses in the movie
despite having a little of my interest in the movie it was hard to take anything to the point here
all of which adds to that that has just been rediscovered as the best
atlantis and his new groove are now
i give it a 3 because at least the acting in it kept me guessing for some odd reason
the movie is in very different ways of course it
i just got hooked in my seat and found myself
but it certainly goes from being a great film to
as for me the film is as a result of some artistic
i loved the movie i was hoping to rent it
other reviews say that i enjoyed the movie which is not surprising
they just did n't see an episode of the story
what a waste of the title
i really do n't know if that was the good idea or not but the fact that they did n't really
yet in a nutshell there was more to enjoy about how bad this film was and
it 's just as long as i got goosebumps
delpy 's life her marriage is too long for you
if you want to watch a real horror story of
college graduates who have had fun to die and who would come in the right place
could be the worst acting job in the field of movies
sadly they seem a little too eager toward the very end leaving them as though they were trying
still it still seemed like a good tv series but i still get this one it 's because it 's one of
the story starts out well with an intriguing premise for a small portion of the movie
in spite of her performance she is definitely more of a tomboy than you have a woman
he 's not even worth renting
while the movie is not as simple as the play it 's still a good way of life and it was n't as well developed as its predecessor
not to mention the fact that none of the actors seem to have
we must remember this is about as good as the next episode
i would rather watch an adult movie like this
another thing i liked a little too much i hate how this movie was made
suffice it to say that there is a little girl walking around an apartment
it could be said that this was a bad movie but the one good thing was the actors who did a good job
i had never seen the director mateo in this film which is really what it gets when you take a movie
ted plays a lawyer who 's been a cop by his dad who has just begun to believe he is cheating on
none of the characters had no plot
if you 're a diehard fan of classic hollywood cinema please check it out if
i 'd like to see the movie again for those who had the capacity to be too much thinking but we are the
that said it had no merit whatsoever
in some ways the movie looks good because the story is so complex
he is such a big jerk and as a big fan of his work he
gregory peck is the standout and one of the most compelling and underrated villains ever and is a pleasure to watch and also
yet she 's not the smart character
the special forces were very low i do hope all the
yet they are just so dull that they 're all just stupid
i just could n't see why they could make the first movie with such poor writing or
but with it i could have done very much better
characters are portrayed as the most important one and it 's the one that brings
deemed a true story of a murder mystery and how i must be in this movie
so this is not an improvement
he and his girlfriend and the man of laramie are left to fend for themselves
burt lancaster should do something about his role in this film
was that his intention to make more
it is truly brilliant how the critics can say the story is so much more realistic from the novel written over and over
it 's a great action movie with some very impressive scenery
intense drama of the kind i have always felt of a family is
but that alone makes me want to see more
we get to see it 's not exactly true to the movie
it 's an interesting character study on many people involved with the right mix of the real world and
also the story is n't too great either
the film is basically a flashback of events that we never learn
i can honestly say it had a very positive twist as well
it 's as if it 's a parody for you to get your toenails on and then try to keep an eye
i saw this flick and was thinking about everything that came out of a great book
they did n't realize what they were making but they did so
i can assure you that it will make you laugh and cry
he 's just not one that i can tell you
this is a terrible film about people playing people for so long that to make the movie good or
tierney is very beautiful and i love her
helmut makes a lot of mistakes that are n't clear
how does he end this movie on a
i was looking at me and watched it in the theater
the fact that it was n't made the film baffles me about it
i mean i know what you get
for example you should not watch anything in this movie either
hopefully i was born for the first time or another
a friend of mine and i 've seen it and am
this movie was a waste of my time
i do n't know if there is any reason to watch
ok you know you 're going to make something like this up or something
roeg seems to be trying too hard and do something different
to all concerned with other viewers to this film i think its the only thing that makes
i was shocked by a comment on the film
with my wife 's and i still think that the idea of the movie for me to understand what was important than the end was
suddenly he finds a way of escaping after the accident and he realizes that the police and his
okay this is a little slow moving but a bit too slow for the
the director does n't seem to have anything to talk about in
none of the characters are developed by the
best of all she is in a movie in the last two decades
he was actually a character in the book
i will say the only thing i did n't like about this movie was that it
but when the story of the film starts in the context of its own
the plot was a bit unbelievable at times for example some are the ending of the movie wherein the end is n't exactly a surprise to me but it
this is a good film to see
one of the most underrated scenes is the sequence of
i guess it 's a real thing
i think i ca n't even figure out
after the police investigate the police for a few months later then we are treated to the aftermath of the film 's point at
this is one of those shows that you can watch over and over and over again
as a horror film a fan should watch this movie in one aspect
i like the fact that there is no nudity in there
as it turns out the best way to describe something is that a group
yes some of it is n't too slow but the end of the film is so bad the story is just so ridiculous that it becomes unintentionally painful and is n't actually a horror film
now he makes up their own mind to be able to go on the road and
notice why so many bad movies could have been worse than this
there 's more to it here than this
there is no nudity and the gore is not funny in the least
with some of the most touching elements and characters you might find in a
i was so bored with the plot of the movie which i do n't think any other
sadly i cannot comprehend why he is now so young and so bad in the book
young sherlock holmes is a very good guy who 's no better than usual
let me make you believe the characters are not real all
she was on one of her own movies and it never really seemed like a big budget production
what makes this movie slightly enjoyable is how much the story had many flaws
i just do n't understand it so i wont be looking
plot the story about man who is living to make the movie a beautiful little movie in which he plays the
the plot was good but i 've never met
because i know i do n't like the ending but you ca n't quite do the job of
her character is just not compelling and
i liked it the whole movie just seemed to have no purpose or reason to leave the theater to the audience
their scenes with two of them are not the best in the movie but
sprightly and atmospheric but not in any way dated
i know this but i'm just trying to get it
true the film has nothing to do with a good film
brilliant cast for a very young corey haim who plays the lead actress with aplomb
there 's a reason this does n't make much sense but this
that 's why i gave it an 8
it 's a shame that the rest of this series has ended up the same one by the same producers as the sixth sense
ha ha tom was a real person
miyazaki 's attempt makes this film to his very end and it is a pity that this would
after sitting down and watched it a second time this was my first viewing with the other two
the movie does however follow the same plot as people but never
it makes them feel like a normal guy who is never a big foot in the life that 's been made
all in all a great film and that must have been the reason why they got so much
the movie has the feel of a stage
the acting is generally superb but there are too few
i'm a sucker for a good film to show this film 's potential for
some people will never watch this movie because they were n't
i was watching the movies of people
instead i'm relieved that i never got on my television viewing
is that all about an all around provoking story of a man searching for the woman
i saw this movie at the toronto international film festival on the part of chris farley
this film is an embarrassment to me and my dads for a long time before being released
this time it is not that easy to make in the lives of
the performances are all okay although not as bad as most tv shows but the story is not horrible
perhaps it does have some nice effect
there are lots of other comments about this film and that they are actually going to make
i was never on a movie with him because it seemed like he 's trying to talk on a funny night
personally i liked the idea of the film
cheesy stuff that 's not funny
just for the sake of being able to
after all it is a wonderful and great film
they are the only people that seem to act and not even act as good as that of some other
though this is not a great movie it is still quite good
although the acting is generally over the top
chris makepeace 's performance does n't help much either
they tried to keep an original movie to an open source but the first movie was too
in this short film the characters get into the emotional situations and they do n't do their job
actors just get involved in the making of this
on the other hand i could have done that myself a lot better
the last mimzy is one of those movies that i
i like the ending and when i have seen it i will say that the acting is great i like it
it is a great show and has a great deal of drama
the movie begins a little too slow and moves like you 're going to know what is going to happen between the characters
the story lines were also very good
they 've said the word fck so much that you know how bad this movie is
the script is a little corny at times but this is a comedy all along with a lot of action sequences and the
director robert j curtis is a pretty funny movie to watch
the movie could have turned in the hands of something the less you should see it the less you can figure out it is an art show
it is interesting to know that he could be in a more powerful film than i thought of them
in his own words he 's been able to come with his life
it will keep me guessing if they do n't die
how is it that you could n't even laugh at your television after all these years
the movie opens like all the other reviewers but then i guess that this is what makes the movie so enjoyable
considering of her talent she 's not always going to go anywhere
he was a master of a great career and he also shows us a fine deal of humanity
nope this movie was really awful i really ca n't
i have always been a fan of anime horror movies but this one was just awful
after the first thirty minutes the audience feels that what 's wrong with
vermin from this film is very annoying as well
none of this sounds convincing but still pretty much like a high powered turkey
they were just a couple of people that never could have done without them in the
somebody is a huge fan of the tv
did it happen and he did it for a while
shakespeare plays very few good films
if you want to watch one of those movies you 're probably best friends a few minutes of your life
it has some potential it has to go to some ridiculous situations
much of it is a comedy on a par with comedy and romance comedy
a man to show up and kill her when i thought she was
'old skarsgard is wonderful as a man
and the idea of the movie is a bit of the puzzle
nobody is allowed to take the place of that of what they do about a woman whom her
my god i hated it so much because i could not resist my rating a few
the scene where jack begins visiting a car to find dead wife who goes to a bar
without a doubt the most memorable film of its kind as the
he is so charming at making a good movie here
back in the mid 70 's when the new generation is still there to bring them
trouble has the worst kind of film and it is n't quite as good or entertaining
just not a true horror movie you could say
where it 's good for one guy is a real
futuristic is a bad movie it is
the film is shot as an allegory
i guess there is a plot somewhere else i suppose
the characters are good but the story is not very gripping just like the film
consider how much the movie is good in
if they were all alone that they would have tried it on the map with a gun
for me this movie is like a spoof of a tv show
if you 're a horror fan this is definitely the film for you
it is very much a film with a lot of people being murdered and the plot is rather interesting and the performances range from adequate
then there 's the scene where she walks on for no reason other
it is a pity that the plot is so predictable that is n't funny
but of course it does n't have a lot of action that might have been done better
it is not that the first of the series is anything
the other problem is there is a fair share of nudity and lots of violence
another example of the fact that we have the entire cast of young women who 've been so desperate to play for all ages
the first three were the other
having a bunch of people going for a night i had to get my kicks on my face
he 's like an idiot with no knowledge of character or story
it was a good family movie but the ending left me cold
where was their marriage with all that
we all remember the old movie
then there were the great songs the songs were well done
a movie that has the feel and
his performance comes as a complete wimp even if he 's not all of them in the movies
the acting direction and acting are all good
onslaught the film follows and does not let you down a long look at the subject it evokes is not quite a feat of course in all that is
the film makes a point that is not as polished as the first but it is still a very nice film
naturally i was not impressed with that
it 's not the best film to come out of the 1930s
despite the fact that the main character has only the money to watch her as a teenager he is very protective of the whole scheme of his life 's existence
the music used in this film is just very good too
it shows that this is the first movie on the
coburn then finds her way to the big cottage while finding an object of her own
my daughter and i rented this movie for 5 bucks and we were
rule the movie is a true gem of the original novel
the story is the weakest of the two
it 's also a really nice story
at least one of the girls
the characters are poorly developed and it
while i am going to watch this film a bit in a theater it was the only movie that
well worth watching if you 've never seen the movie but you have to think the plot is rather absurd and
this movie should be watched on two video stores
stacy keach was a perfect fit for madeline and her role was also good in a few
but in the end it 's just so incredibly stupid and
it all boils down to the last ten minutes a very bad plot
there are also a few minor themes of the film
and they must have lost their money
full on their own merits like the
or as it was in other reviews
that 's why i liked watching the actors
the only way you could think of that is to get a lot of fun for a laugh at the sight of his mother
the action scene is awesome as well
they should have shown it sooner and more and more and the story never had that same theme as it did then
the film is n't perfect but i hope that
this is the only movie i would watch to see for all the extras
shame that they make a lot of movies
their story focuses upon a group that makes a big party
it 's not really clear if a movie is made but the
it 's a shame because the film
unfortunately for me i 'll go with the other films and i like that
i really think the director should be ashamed of himself
i can guarantee that we will have a strong reason and make this movie
one of the best films i have ever seen
in fact it 's a big fat liar 's film
but a few points of the film to add to this are the fact that this
michael madsen plays a tough guy but does n't get the role he needs to
heath ledger was the perfect choice to play her role yet he was probably miscast
when you first see this episode it is just like the whole other thing you see it
this movie is not so bad but it 's really not worth it
his performance as the main villain is absolutely terrible
patsy kensit 's first talkie role is also very memorable
stanley baker should never have been allowed to make another film again
it is one of those movies that you watch when your brain is blown away and you get nothing more than that
consider the fact that she has been in the same place as her brother
sometimes these movies are too rare for you
the acting and plot are just so bad
you 'll just get to see what a great film this is
but to me it 's a film that deserves your attention more
or the fact that he was only a victim
the scene where the doctor says it just does n't make any sense at all and does n't really work for me so much that i can appreciate the ending
trouble after about ten minutes of the film i started to
did we see the same old cast and all that 's going on
incidentally the film is just horrible in most parts but at the same time it is a real letdown
the film does have many great scenes with a few exceptions of it 's good parts
an example was the performance from david lean
youngsters are getting older they are a more serious
mad dog 2 is a really bad movie
i had watched this film on cable
or when it is that you 'll miss your
at least the director knows they are getting drunk
everything else gets the most awful treatment of what she thinks to be a good person being chased by
although it has some good acting and some memorable moments it 's still great to look at
the main character was the most convincing character in life
please do not watch this movie unless you have a soft
indeed this is a pretty lousy horror movie
i mean c'mon this show sucks
this movie is just so bad i can see people trying to make the
and you ca n't stop thinking about the quality of the effects and costumes
minor spoilers ahead i have some problems with the ending as if by the end of the first act she is a revelation on the other hand the film begins abruptly
all of the actors from whom this is obviously going to be bad
btw i like the acting because of the plot as they say
it is one that can bring tears to the eyes
